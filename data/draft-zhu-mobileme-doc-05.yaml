abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the implementation of Apple Inc.'s Back to
    My Mac (BTMM) service. BTMM provides network connectivity between devices so that
    a user can perform file sharing and screen sharing among multiple computers at
    home, at work, or on the road. The implementation of BTMM addresses the issues
    of single sign-on authentication, secure data communication, service discovery,
    and end-to-end connectivity in the face of Network Address Translators (NATs)
    and mobility of devices. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"

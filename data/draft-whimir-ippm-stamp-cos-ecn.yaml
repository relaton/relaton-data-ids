  content: "   The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) enables one-\n
    \  way and round-trip measurement of network metrics between IP hosts,\n   and
    has a facility for defining optional extensions.  This document\n   updates the
    definition of the Class of Service TLV (originally\n   defined in RFC 8972) to
    enable the measurement of manipulation of the\n   value of the Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN) field of the IP\n   header by middleboxes between two STAMP
    hosts, and to enable\n   discovery and measurement of paths that provide differential\n
    \  treatment of packets depending on the value of their ECN field.\n\n\t "

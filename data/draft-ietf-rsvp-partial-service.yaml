  content: "Specifications for providing enhanced qualities of service in the Internet
    have been defined in [2,4].  Technical and administrative concerns may prevent
    a network element from offering one or more of these services.  In this document,
    we present a mechanism for dealing with heterogeneity in the set of services offered
    by different network elements.  This approach enables end-to-end service to be
    composed of different per-hop services while not requiring end systems to be aware
    of the details of the service provided at each hop.\n\t "

  content: "    This document describes how implementors of Mobile IPv6 can use\n
    \   IPv6-based network facilities to perform remote testing of their\n    implementation
    with other groups participating in this testing\n    program.  The document aims
    to describe how one may become part of a\n    testing group, what can be tested
    through this method, and the steps\n    necessary to connect to remote Mobile
    IPv6 entities.  This draft is\n    not meant for deployment, and no change in
    Mobile IPv6 implementation\n    is needed in order to participate in testing.\n\t "

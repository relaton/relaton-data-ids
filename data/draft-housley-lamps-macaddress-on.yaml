abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new otherName for inclusion in the X.509 Subject
    Alternative Name (SAN) extension to carry an IEEE Media Access Control (MAC) address.
    The new name form makes it possible to bind a layer-2 interface identifier to
    a public key certificate. This is needed for secure onboarding and key establishment
    protocols that operate below the network layer, such as IEEE 802.1AE (MACsec).</p>"

  content: "This draft proposes a simple extension to HTTP, using a new\nset of headers,
    which can significantly reduce the network traffic\nused for sending pages containing
    advertising banners and other\nrelated content. We begin by describing the problems
    generated by the\nuse of 'cache-busting' techniques today and why the Hit-metering\nscheme
    [RFC2227], by itself, may not be adequate. We will then\ndescribe a new scheme
    which relies on collaboration between the\ncontent providers and the Internet
    Service Providers (ISPs).\n\n\t "

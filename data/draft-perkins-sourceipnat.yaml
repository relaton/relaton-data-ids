- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "A method is proposed to enable communications between an IPv4-only\nnode
    in today's Internet and an IPv6-only node, initiated by the\nIPv4-only node.  The
    communication depends on allocation of a flow\nrecord and address triggered by
    a DNS query received for the target\nv6-only node.  DNS query conventions can
    be agreed upon to provide a\nnatural model for resolving IPv4 queries for IPv6-only
    nodes.  The\nNAT mechanism proposed demultiplexes multiple sessions through the\nsame
    dynamically allocated IP address, using flow records matching\nthe source address
    of incoming packets.  This is in contrast to the\nuse of ports in NAT-PT boxes,
    which inhibits the support of incoming\ntraffic towards a node behind the NAT-PT.\n\t "

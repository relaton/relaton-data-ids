- language: en

  content: "   This proposal defines key management approaches for the Quantum Safe\n
    \  Cryptographic (QSC) algorithm FALCON which has been selected for\n   standardization
    by the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process.\n   This includes key identification
    and key serialization.  The purpose\n   is to provide guidance such that the adoption
    of quantum safe\n   algorithms is not hampered with the fragmented evolution of
    necessary\n   key management standards.  Early definition of key material standards\n
    \  will help expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms and at\n   the
    same time as improving interoperability between implementations\n   and minimizing
    divergence across standards.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document considers a VPN End User establishing an IPsec SA with\n
    \  a Security Gateway using the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2\n   (IKEv2),
    where at least one of the peers has multiple interfaces or\n   where Security
    Gateway is a cluster with each node having its own IP\n   address.\n\n   With
    the current IKEv2 protocol, the outer IP addresses of the IPsec\n   SA are determined
    by those used by IKE SA.  As a result using\n   multiple interfaces requires to
    set up an IKE SA on each interface,\n   or on each path if both the VPN Client
    and the Security Gateway have\n   multiple interfaces.  Setting each IKE SA involves
    authentications\n   which might require multiple round trips as well as activity
    from the\n   VPN End User and thus would delay the VPN establishment.  In addition\n
    \  multiple authentications unnecessarily increase the load on the VPN\n   client
    and the authentication infrastructure.\n\n   This document presents the solution
    that allows to clone IKEv2 SA,\n   where an additional SA is derived from an existing
    one.  The newly\n   created IKE SA is set without the IKEv2 authentication exchange.\n
    \  This IKE SA can later be assigned to another interface or moved to\n   another
    cluster mode using MOBIKE protocol.\n\n\t "

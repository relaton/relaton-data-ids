  content: "   DMARC introduces a mechanism for expressing domain-level policies and\n
    \  preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting.  The\n   DMARC
    mechanism can encounter interoperability issues when messages\n   originate from
    third party sources, are modified in transit, or are\n   forwarded enroute to
    their final destination.  Collectively these\n   email flows are referred to as
    indirect email flows.  This document\n   describes interoperability issues between
    DMARC and indirect email\n   flows.  Possible methods for addressing interoperability
    issues are\n   presented.\n\n\t "

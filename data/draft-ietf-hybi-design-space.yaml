  content: "As technologies for bidirectional communication over HTTP have become\npervasive,
    interest has grown in (1) defining improved mechanisms for\nsupport of existing
    technologies (short-term solutions such as new\nHTTP headers) and (2) the development
    of new bidirectional protocols\n(long-term solutions such as WebSocket, Bidirectional
    Web Transfer\nProtocol, and Reverse HTTP).  In order to provide context for such\nwork,
    this document provides a tentative map of the design space for\nbidirectional
    HTTP, with special attention to deployed infrastructure\n(e.g. web clients, intermediaries,
    firewalls, NATs, web servers) and\nprogramming environments.\n\t "

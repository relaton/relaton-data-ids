  content: "One of the major applications of the Session Initiation Protocol\n(SIP)
    is in Internet telephony. In this context  it is often useful\nor convenient for
    a SIP entity to request another SIP User Agent\ngenerate some type of tone, without
    generating this tone as part of a\nsession. This document describes how SIP can
    be used without\nmodification to carry such tones and explores issues relating
    to\ntheir use. Finally this document defines a new MIME type which is\nuseful
    for conveying computer generated tones.\n\t "

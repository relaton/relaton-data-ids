  content: "   This document describes several potential price and charge issues in\n
    \  CDN interconnection.  It discusses some optional charge models when\n   CDNs
    are interconnected and presents a need from Content Service\n   Providers (CSP)
    or CDNs to optimize their cost locally and guarantee\n   their performance.  It
    finally shows how can CDNI frameworks and\n   protocols support price, charge
    and policy information exchanging.\n\n\t "

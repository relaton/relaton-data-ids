  script: Latn
  content: "The protocol referred to as 'HTTP/1.0' includes the specification for\n
    \  a Basic Access Authentication scheme.  This scheme is not considered\n   to
    be a secure method of user authentication, as the user name and\n   password are
    passed over the network as clear text.  A specification\n   for a different authentication
    scheme is needed to address this\n   severe limitation.  This document provides
    specification for such a\n   scheme, referred to as 'Digest Access Authentication'.
    \ Like Basic,\n   Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a\n
    \  communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this\n   verification
    can be done without sending the password in the clear,\n   which is Basic's biggest
    weakness. As with most other authentication\n   protocols, the greatest sources
    of risks are usually found not in the\n   core protocol itself but in policies
    and procedures surrounding its\n   use. \n\n   This is the final draft of any
    document under this name.  Digest and\n   Basic Authentication from the HTTP/1.1
    specification will be combined\n   and issued as a document titled 'Authentication
    in HTTP'.Our intent\n   is that RFC 2068 and RFC 2069 will go to draft standard
    as a pair of\n   documents, but with all authentication schemes (Digest and Basic)\n
    \  documented together in a single place.  This transition has not yet\n   taken
    place.\n\t "

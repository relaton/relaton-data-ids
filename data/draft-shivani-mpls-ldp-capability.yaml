  content: "   This document defines a new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities\n
    \  TLV, that is expected to facilitate the introduction of new\n   capabilities
    in the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) by providing\n   graceful capability
    advertisement without requiring that LDP peering\n   be terminated.\n\n   The
    \"LDP peering\" in this document refers to the TCP connection\n   between the
    2 routers and not the actual session. The \"LDP session\"\n   refers to the connection
    after the initialization message has been\n   successfully processed and the session
    is marked operational.\n\n\t "

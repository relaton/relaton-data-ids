  content: "   3GPP is introducing the concept of slicing as a primary way of\n   service
    delivery.  Slicing at 3GPP implies the differentiation of\n   services in terms
    of performance expectations as well as the\n   connection of different network
    entities also potentially\n   differentiated per slice.  With that aim, 3GPP is
    defining a number\n   of logical constructs with the intent of being served with
    specific\n   characteristics, determined by different QoS profiles.  This document\n
    \  describes the connectivity of 3GPP slices through IETF Network Slice\n   services
    taking into account that specific service level objectives,\n   and identifies
    gaps existing nowadays on both 3GPP and IETF\n   specifications for an straightforward
    mapping of parameters between\n   both environments.\n\n\t "

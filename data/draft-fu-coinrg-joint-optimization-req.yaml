  content: "   With the development of edge computing, there is a trend that\n   computing
    is widely deployed in network rather than at other end of\n   network, and provides
    services at nearer location.  With the deep\n   integration of network, traditional
    optimization and scheduling\n   within network domain is not enough, the endpoint
    of the path matters\n   a lot.  So the relationship between computing and network
    are new and\n   important topics to be studied.  This document focus on the\n
    \  requirements of computing and network joint optimization and\n   scheduling
    based on the newly arising service requirements.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of \n   protocols
    has been defined to control different switching \n   technologies as well as different
    applications.  These include \n   support for requesting Time Division Multiplexing
    (TDM) connections \n   including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous
    Digital \n   Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).  This document
    concentrates on the routing requirements placed on the \n   GMPLS suite of protocols
    in order to support the capabilities and \n   functionalities of an Automatically
    Switched Optical Network (ASON) \n   as defined by the ITU-T. \n\n\t "

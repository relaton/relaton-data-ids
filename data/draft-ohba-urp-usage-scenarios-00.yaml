  content: "Many different kinds of commercial networks require users to\nperform
    registration before being allowed usage to\nresources. Resources could include
    basic access to the network to\nresources that are more specific such as services
    in the network\nor a certain grade of service, etc. The registration process is\nnormally
    specific to the type of network that a user is attaching\nto and the registration
    process itself occurs in the protocol\nlayers that are specific to an access technology.
    With a network\nlayer (IP) or above solution, a common protocol for performing\nregistration
    could be defined.\n\t "

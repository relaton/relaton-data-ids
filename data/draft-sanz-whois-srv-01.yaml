  content: "Whois servers are used to locate administrative, technical and \nsecurity
    contacts for given IP addresses, domain names or other \nnetwork objects associated
    with an organisation, e.g. AS numbers. \nWhile usually Top Level Domain (TLD)
    registries run a whois server, \nthere is no generic name for it and it may not
    even be obvious that \nthe TLD registry's whois server is the right one to ask,
    since there \nare TLDs where registration takes place under specialised second
    \nlevel domains (e.g. UK, AT). The Regional Internet Registries (RIR) \nalso provide
    whois service as part of their coordination task. \nAll this can be solved by
    central 'master' or 'meta' whois servers, \nwhich keep track of all new and changing
    servers and refer to the DNS \nregistries' or RIRs' whois servers. \nThis document
    proposes a DNS-based approach which eliminates the need \nfor a central master
    repository and works down to lower levels in the \nhierarchy. It is the intent
    to locate a whois server as close to the \ntarget (in terms of hierarchy) as possible,
    while preserving the \nopportunity to locate higher level servers for escalation
    purposes.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Internet mail defines the RFC5322.From field to indicate the author\n
    \  of the message's content and the RFC5322.Sender field to indicate who\n   initially
    handled the message.  The RFC5322.Sender field is optional,\n   if it has the
    same information as the RFC5322.From field.  That is,\n   when the RFC5322.Sender
    field is absent, the RFC5322.From field has\n   conflated semantics, with both
    a handling identifier and a content\n   creator identifier.  This was not a problem,
    until development of\n   stringent protections on use of the RFC5322.From field.
    \ It has\n   prompted Mediators, such as mailing lists, to modify the RFC5322.From\n
    \  field, to circumvent mail rejection caused by those protections.\n\n   This
    affects end-to-end behavior of email, between the author and the\n   final recipients,
    because mail from the same author is not treated\n   the same, depending on what
    path it followed.  In effect, the\n   RFC5322.From field has become dominated
    by its role as a handling\n   identifier.\n\n   The current specification augments
    use of the RFC5322.From field, by\n   enhancing DMARC to also use the RFC5322.Sender
    field.  This preserves\n   the utility of RFC5322.From field while also preserving
    the utility\n   of DMARC.\n\n\t "

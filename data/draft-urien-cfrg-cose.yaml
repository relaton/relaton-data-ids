  content: "   This document describes an architecture named \"Cloud of Secure\n   Elements
    (CoSE)\" whose goal is to strengthen the Internet trust. A\n   Secure element
    (SE) provides secure services thanks to various means\n   such as tamper resistant
    technologies or software virtualization\n   techniques. Secure elements are hosted
    in dedicated servers (i.e.\n   Trusted Secure Elements Servers, TSES); they provide
    secure storage\n   facilities or compute cryptographic procedures. Secure elements\n
    \  resources are identified by dedicated URIs and should also support\n   HTTP
    interface. Users are equipped with \"Access Credential\" and\n   thanks to the
    Secure Transport Protocol (STP-TSES) remotely access\n   to Secure Element embedded
    resources. The RACS (Remote APDU Call\n   Secure) and its associated framework
    protocol is an early proof of\n   concept of the CoSE concept.\n\n\n\t "

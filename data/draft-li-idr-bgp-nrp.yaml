abstract:
- content: "<p>Existing approaches bind a Segment Routing (SR) Policy to a Network
    Resource Partition (NRP) on a one-to-one basis, which lacks flexibility and introduces
    significant operational overhead as the number of NRPs scales, especially when
    the NRPs share the same SR Policy path. This document defines BGP extensions to
    advertise NRP identifier (NRP ID) information between network nodes, which decouples
    SR Policy from NRP, allowing multiple NRPs to share a common SR Policy path and
    thus avoiding linear growth of SR Policies. This design reduces operational complexity
    and is also applicable to SR Best Effort (SR BE) scenario.</p>"

  content: "   In the SDN, the controller is in charge of the maintenance and\n   administration
    of variable aspects like the network topology and the\n   network resources etc.
    of the whole network.  Administrative\n   strategies are made upon these work
    and sent to the switches from the\n   controller so as to instruct the network
    devices to apply appropriate\n   policies to the data flows.  As for the data
    packet which reaches the\n   ingress OpenFlow switch for the first time, the packet
    itself or a\n   fraction of the packet will be encapsulated into a packet-in message\n
    \  and will be sent to the controller to request for a new flow rule.\n   After
    the flow-mod message and the packet-out message are sent back\n   to the switch
    from the controller, the determined forwarding action\n   will be applied to the
    certain data flow.\n\n   So far, the inbound latency caused by the creation of
    the packet-in\n   message and the outbound latency caused by the receive and the\n
    \  execution of the flow-mod message are highlighted when it comes to\n   the
    concerns about the latency and the effectiveness of the data\n   transportation
    in the SDN[Mazu].  Attention to the studies on the\n   processing order of the
    flow rule request message like the packet-in\n   message and the packet-out message
    is comparatively low.  As the SDN\n   continually grows in scale and complexity
    and the packets' forwarding\n   policies become more recursive and dynamic, the
    number of the\n   switches under the administration of the same controller is
    elevated\n   and unavoidably causes the network congestion problem widespread.\n
    \  The scale of modern networks and data-centers and the associated\n   operational
    expense deteriorates the delay problem in the network\n   with congestion.  The
    ability to help the services with high priority\n   be processed without delay
    becomes critical.\n\n   This document proposes the combination of appending a
    priority tag to\n   the packet-in message and the Priority based Flow Rule Request\n
    \  Message Processing Mechanism(PFRRMPM) as a solution to help the data\n   flow
    with high priority or lantency-sensitive to acquire the\n   forwarding rule without
    or with shorter waiting latency when there\n   are excess flow rule request messages
    in the SDN.\n\n\t "

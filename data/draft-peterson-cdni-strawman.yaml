  content: "   This document presents a simple strawman for CDN interconnection, and\n
    \  uses the strawman as a basis for articulating a set of design\n   principles
    and exploring (parts of) the CDNI design space.  Our\n   intent is to spur discussion
    about what information needs to be\n   exchanged between CDN peers, which is a
    prerequisite for crafting\n   interfaces and protocols to communicate that information.\n\n\n\t "

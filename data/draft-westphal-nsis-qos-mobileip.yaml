- language: en

  content: "This draft provides a framework for QoS signaling that is optimized\nfor
    Mobile IP handoffs. It covers the horizontal signaling between\naccess routers
    (ARs) as well as the vertical signaling along the\npacket data path, both of which
    are triggered by handoff of mobile\nnode (MN). The key design goals are wireless
    bandwidth economy,\nfast QoS establishment along the new data path after handoff
    and\nsecure protocol operation.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that\n
    \  arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where\n   the
    sending rate is limited by the application rather than the\n   congestion window.
    \ It provides an experimental update to TCP that\n   allows a TCP sender to restart
    quickly following either a rate-\n   limited interval.  This method is expected
    to benefit applications\n   that send rate-limited traffic using TCP, while also
    providing an\n   appropriate response if congestion is experienced.\n\n   It also
    evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion\n   Window Validation,
    CWV, defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC\n   2861 sought to address important
    issues, but failed to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This document therefore
    recommends that the\n   status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental to Historic,
    and that\n   it is replaced by the current specification.\n\n\t "

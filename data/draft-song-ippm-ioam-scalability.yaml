  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes several potential scalability issues when\n
    \  implementing in-situ OAM based on the current in-situ OAM documents\n   and
    proposes the corresponding solutions and modifications to the\n   current in-situ
    OAM specification.  Specifically, we extend in-situ\n   OAM to support more standard
    tracing data than is currently defined\n   and add new features to avoid limitations
    on MTU, bandwidth,\n   forwarding path length, and node processing capability.
    \ We provide\n   use cases to motivate our proposal and base the changes on the\n
    \  current in-situ OAM header format specification.\n\n\t "

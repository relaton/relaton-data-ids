  content: "This document defines a C language application program interface (API)\nto
    the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This document\nreplaces the
    previous definition of this API, defined in RFC 1823,\nupdating it to include
    support for features found in version 3 of the\nLDAP protocol.  New extended operation
    functions were added to support\nLDAPv3 features such as controls.  In addition,
    other LDAP API changes\nwere made to support information hiding and thread safety.\n
    \nThe C LDAP API is designed to be powerful, yet simple to use. It defines\ncompatible
    synchronous and asynchronous interfaces to LDAP to suit a\nwide variety of applications.
    This document gives a brief overview of\nthe LDAP model, then an overview of how
    the API is used by an applica-\ntion program to obtain LDAP information.  The
    API calls are described in\ndetail, followed by appendices that provide example
    code demonstrating\nuse of the API, the namespace consumed by the API, a summary
    of require-\nments for API extensions, known incompatibilities with RFC 1823,
    and a\nlist of changes made since the last revision of this document.\n\t "

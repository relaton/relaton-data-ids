  content: "This document defines the encapsulation and mechanisms that allows PPP
    \npackets to be transported over low-bitrate links such as modem lines, \nISDN
    B-channels, and sub-T1 links with guarantee of quality of service \nfor time sensitive
    services. A mechanism of channel preemption is \ndefined, allowing the immediate
    occupation of the channel with the most \npriority packet, resuming the transmission
    of the lower priority frame \nwithout need to retransmit the octets already sent.
    This mechanism \nallows a dynamic packet fragmentation, guaranteeing simultaneously
    a \nlow transmission delay for the services more sensitive to transmission \ndelays
    and an efficient channel occupation. It is a recursive \nmechanism, which means
    that the packet that made the channel preemption \ncan itself be preempted by
    another higher priority packet, and this \nprocess can be repeated whenever a
    higher priority packet requests \ntransmission. The proposed mechanism is compatible
    with existing \nhardware and drivers for asynchronous and synchronous HDLC controllers.

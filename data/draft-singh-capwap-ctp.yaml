  content: "   With the overwhelming choice of proprietary implementations of \n   centralized
    control and management of wireless access points and \n   access controllers there
    is a great demand for a standard protocol \n   and architecture that enables the
    deployment of large scale wireless \n   networks. \n    \n   This document describes
    the CAPWAP Tunneling Protocol, a protocol \n   that allows for the centralized
    control and provisioning of a large \n   number of wireless access points from
    access controllers.  It is \n   supported by an architecture where the MAC layer
    of the RF technology \n   is terminated within the AP.  This allows for the protocol
    to be \n   extensible to multiple radio technologies.  It assumes an IP \n   connection
    between the access points and access controllers and has \n   signaling primitives
    to enable wireless station mobility between \n   access points.  Therefore, seamless
    Layer 3 subnet mobility is \n   seamlessly enabled by this protocol. \n\t "

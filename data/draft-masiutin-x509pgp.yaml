    certificate to a PGP Certificate and vice versa because of\nformat of data being
    signed differ in these two standards. This\ndocument defines a new X.509v3 certificate
    extension called pgpKey\nthat holds a verbatim PGP Certificate, making such conversion\npossible.\nThis
    draft is being discussed on the 'x509pgp@egroups.com' mailing\nlist. To join the

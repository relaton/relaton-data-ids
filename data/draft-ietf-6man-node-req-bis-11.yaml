abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements for IPv6 nodes. It is expected that
    IPv6 will be deployed in a wide range of devices and situations. Specifying the
    requirements for IPv6 nodes allows IPv6 to function well and interoperate in a
    large number of situations and deployments. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"

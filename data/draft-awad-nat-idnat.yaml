  content: "  In many flavors of the nowadays address translators, real addresses\n
    \ are assigned to private hosts without preserving uniqueness; the same\n  real
    address can be shared among multiple private hosts and the same\n  private host
    can also obtain different addresses over the time as\n  well. As a result the
    addresses used for private hosts reflect some\n  kind of ambiguity on those hosts.
    This proposal introduces the IDNAT\n  model as a solution for that address ambiguity
    problem. This solution\n  concentrates on defining another virtual identity to
    identify private\n  hosts in replacement of the ambiguous assigned real IP address.\n
    \ Through agile practices this identity can be assigned to each of the\n  private
    hosts, and the hosts themselves will be aware of their\n  assigned Ids which are
    going to be quite unique throughout the private\n  region as well as the entire
    Internet realm. Moreover, the new Id will\n  play a centric role in the packets
    transmission so as to identify the\n  private host outside the private region
    and hence defeating the\n  undesired ambiguity.\n\t "

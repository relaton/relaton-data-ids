  content: "   This specification defines a framework for SNMPv3 authentication and
    \n   key distribution with support for various authentication systems \n   such
    as RADIUS, X.509 certificates, Local Accounts, Kerberos etc. \n   Support for
    these authentication systems for SNMPv3 allows for  \n   a common identity to
    be used with/shared across all management \n   protocols since the other network
    management interfaces such as the\n   NetConf protocol and device Command Line
    Interface (CLI) are already \n   using these authentication systems. \n\t "

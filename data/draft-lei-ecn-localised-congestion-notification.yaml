  content: "This document introduces analyzes of ECN(Explicit Congestion\n   Notification)in
    case of congestion of local links. 3GPP adopts and\n   specifies shared channel
    for multiple user equipments in a cell.\n   Other last mile access systems (e.g.
    xDSL access and Frame Relay\n   access) have to handle congestion since bandwidth
    multiplexing is\n   most likely considered for reducing unnecessary cost.  Therefore,\n
    \  congestion in access network is to inform user equipments in case of\n   traffic
    congestion utilizing congestion notification concepts and\n   similar mechanisms.\n\n
    \  Besides the argument on the congestions of access networks, this\n   document
    is also to introduce the use case of Conex which might be\n   useful for the potential
    Conex proposals to notify and address the\n   congestion of wireless access network
    further.\n\n\t "

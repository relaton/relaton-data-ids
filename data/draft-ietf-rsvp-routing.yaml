  content: "This memo describes version 2 of RSRR, a routing interface for RSVP.\n
    \  By using this interface, RSVP may obtain forwarding information from\n   routers
    and use it to place reservation state within the network.\n   Version 1 of this
    interface was designed primarily for RSVP\n   interaction with IPv4 multicast
    routing protocols.  Version 2 adds\n   support for IPv4 unicast as well as IPv6
    unicast and multicast\n   routing.  A backwards compatibility mechanism is provided.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the use of the LISP architecture and\n   protocols
    to address the requirements of the worldwide Aeronautical\n   Telecommunications
    Network with Internet Protocol Services, as\n   articulated by the International
    Civil Aviation Organization.\n\n   The ground-based LISP overlay provides mobility
    and multi-homing\n   services to the IPv6 networks hosted on commercial aircrafts,
    to\n   support Air Traffic Management communications with Air Traffic\n   Controllers
    and Air Operation Controllers.  The proposed architecture\n   doesn't require
    support for LISP protocol in the airborne routers,\n   and can be easily deployed
    over existing ground infrastructures.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   BGP Flow Specification (Flowspec) provides a mechanism to distribute\n
    \  traffic flow specifications and the forwarding actions to be\n   performed
    to the specific traffic flows.  A set of Flowspec\n   components are defined to
    specify the matching criteria that can be\n   applied to the packet, and a set
    of BGP extended communities are\n   defined to encode the actions a routing system
    can take on a packet\n   which matches the flow specification.\n\n   An IETF Network
    Slice enables connectivity between a set of Service\n   Demarcation Points (SDPs)
    with specific Service Level Objectives\n   (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations
    (SLEs) over a common underlay\n   network.  To meet the connectivity and performance
    requirement of\n   specific network slice services, network slice service traffic
    needs\n   to be mapped to an Network Resource Partition (NRP).  The edge nodes\n
    \  of the NRP needs to identify the traffic flows which belong to a\n   network
    slice and steer the matched traffic to the corresponding NRP\n   or a specific
    path within the corresponding NRP.\n\n   BGP Flowspec can be used to distribute
    the matching criteria and the\n   forwarding actions to be preformed on specific
    network slice\n   services.  The existing Flowspec components can be used for
    the\n   matching of specific network slice services flows at the edge of an\n
    \  NRP.  While new traffic action needs to be defined for the steering\n   of
    network slice service flows into an NRP.  This document defines\n   the extensions
    to BGP Flowspec for IETF network slice traffic\n   steering (NS-TS).\n\n\t "

  content: "The transition from a pure IPv4 network to a network where IPv4 and IPv6
    coexist brings a number of extra security considerations that need to be taken
    into account when deploying IPv6 and operating the dual-protocol network and the
    associated transition mechanisms. This document attempts to give an overview of
    the various issues grouped into three categories:\n\n o issues due to the IPv6
    protocol itself, o issues due to transition mechanisms, and o issues due to IPv6
    deployment.\n\n This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

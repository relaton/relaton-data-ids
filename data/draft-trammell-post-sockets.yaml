  content: "   This document describes Post Sockets, an asynchronous abstract\n   programming
    interface for the atomic transmission of objects in an\n   explicitly multipath
    environment.  Post replaces connections with\n   long-lived associations between
    endpoints, with the possibility to\n   cache cryptographic state in order to reduce
    amortized connection\n   latency.  We present this abstract interface as an illustration
    of\n   what is possible with present developments in transport protocols\n   when
    freed from the strictures of the current sockets API.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The \"Network Management Datastore Architecture\" (NMDA) improves on\n
    \  NETCONF by adding new features to give more accurate handling of\n   configuration
    and operational data.  These include ability to inspect\n   the current operational
    values of configuration data, allowing\n   clients to use identical paths for
    retrieving the configured values\n   and the operational values.  These new features
    require additional\n   operations in network management applications such as NETCONF.
    \ This\n   draft details those new operations.\n\n\t "

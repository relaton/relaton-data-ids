  content: "   Mechanisms for specifying and implementing end-to-end Quality of\n
    \  service (QoS) treatments in Information-Centric Networks (ICN) has\n   not
    been explored so far.  There has been some work towards\n   implementing QoS in
    ICN; however, the discussions are mainly centered\n   around strategies used in
    efficient forwarding of Interest packets.\n   Moreover, as ICN has been tested
    mainly as an IP overlay, its QoS is\n   still governed by the IP QoS framework
    and there is a need for\n   implementing QoS in ICN natively.  This document describes
    mechanisms\n   to classify and provide associated \"name-based\" extensions to\n
    \  identify QoS within the framework of ICN's core design principles.\n   The
    name-based design provides a mechanism to carry QoS information\n   and implement
    the treatments as ICN packets travel across different\n   routers in the ICN network.
    \ Detailed discussion is provided for QoS\n   specific procedures in each of the
    ICN network elements i.e.\n   consumer, producer, and forwarder.\n\n\t "

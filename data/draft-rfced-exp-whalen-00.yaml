  content: "   This memo provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming to the\n
    \  MIME specifications [RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2048, RFC\n   2049]
    can convey information not intended for display by the Mail\n   User Agent (UA),
    but for processing (as opposed to display) by an\n   external program.  It specifies
    a new type of 'Content-Disposition'\n   (defined by [RFC 2183]), which is valid
    for any MIME entity\n   ('message' or 'body part).  When 'body part' is referred
    to in this\n   memo, it is referring to any MIME entity, except in section 2.4.
    This\n   memo is the definition of this type, as specified by Section 9 of\n   [RFC
    2183].\n\n   This document is intended as an extension to MIME.  As such, the\n
    \  reader is assumed to be familiar with the MIME specifications,\n   [RFC 822],
    and [RFC 2183].  The information presented herein\n   supplements but does not
    replace that found in those documents.\n\t "

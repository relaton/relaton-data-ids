  content: "The protocol specified in this document is designed to provide\nmulticast
    and broadcast functionality in mobile ad hoc networks.  It\nutilizes the Route
    Discovery mechanism defined by the Dynamic Source\nRouting protocol (DSR) [4,
    5, 7] to flood the data packets through\nthe network.  Although this protocol
    is derived from DSR, it can be\nimplemented as a stand-alone protocol.  In fact,
    it does not rely\non unicast routing to operate.  If DSR is already implemented
    on\nthe network, very minor modifications are required to enable this\nprotocol.\n\t "

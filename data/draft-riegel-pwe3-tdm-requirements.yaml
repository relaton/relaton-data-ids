  content: "This document specifies the particular requirements for\nedge-to-edge-emulation
    of circuits carrying time division multiplexed\ndigital signals of the PDH as
    well as the SONET/SDH hierarchy over\npacket-switched networks.  It is based on
    the common architecture for\nPseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) as defined
    in [PWE3-ARCH].\nIt makes references to requirements in [PWE3-REQ] where applicable\nand
    complements [PWE3-REQ] by defining requirements originating from\nspecifics of
    TDM circuits.\n\n\t "

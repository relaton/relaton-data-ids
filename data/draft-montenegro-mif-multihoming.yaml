  content: "Increasingly, hosts have more than one network interface active \n   at
    any given point in time. Such multiplicity of interfaces \n   leads to multiple
    and potentially conflicting (or overlapping) \n   sets of configuration information
    and policies. How these are \n   arbitrated and managed influence how the host
    resolves DNS \n   queries, and-with respect to outgoing packets-how it selects
    a \n   source address and an outgoing interface.  \n\n\t "

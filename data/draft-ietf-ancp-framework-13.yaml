  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of this document is to define a framework for an Access Node
    Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g.,
    a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference
    architecture in order to perform operations related to service, quality of service,
    and subscribers. The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission
    of the information does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather
    uses a direct device-device communication. This allows for performing access-link-related
    operations within those network elements, while avoiding impact on the existing
    Operational Support Systems.\n\n This document first identifies a number of use
    cases for which the Access Node Control Mechanism may be appropriate. It then
    presents the requirements for the Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) that must
    be taken into account during protocol design. Finally, it describes requirements
    for the network elements that need to support ANCP and the described use cases.
    These requirements should be seen as guidelines rather than as absolute requirements.
    RFC 2119 therefore does not apply to the nodal requirements. This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

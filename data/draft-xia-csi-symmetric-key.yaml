  content: "In this document, a method for provisioning a shared key from the\nrouter
    to the host is defined to protect Neighbor Discovery(ND)\nsignaling between the
    router and the host.  The host sends a Router\nSolicitation(RS) message with ND
    Shared Key Request Option to the\nrouter.  The router encrypts a ND shared key
    using the host's SEcure\nNeighbor Discovery(SEND) public key and sends it back
    to the host\nthrough a Router Advertisement(RA) message.  The host decrypts the
    ND\nshared key using the matching private key.  The Neighbor Discovery\nshared
    key is then used for protecting the following Neighbor\nDiscovery signaling between
    the router and the host.  The Router\nSolicitation and Router Advertisement message
    exchanges are required\nto have SEND security.\n\t "

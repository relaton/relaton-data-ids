  content: "   This document describes the candidate protocol mechanisms which may\n
    \  be used to meet the requirements of enhanced virtual private networks\n   (VPN+).
    \ The gaps and limitations of existing mechanisms are\n   analyzed, then a proposed
    mechanism is briefly described.  The\n   proposed mechanism can be used to achieve
    network slicing to meet the\n   stringent requirement of emerging 5G services,
    but it can also be\n   useful in other general network scenarios.\n\n\t "

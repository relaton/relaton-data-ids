  content: "   Neighbor discovery options, in addition to being used for Neighbor\n
    \  Discovery, are used to convey some forms of network configuration\n   information
    to the hosts attached to a network.  Some centrally\n   managed networks, that
    do not wish to configure their routers to\n   advertise these pieces of information,
    might use a DHCP server to\n   configure there parameters.  This document defines
    a generic DHCP\n   option for carrying these parameters.\n\n\t "

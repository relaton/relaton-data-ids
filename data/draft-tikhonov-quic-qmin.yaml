abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines QMIN, a compression format and protocol\n
    \  for HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) headers.  QMIN is based on HPACK ([RFC7541]).\n   The
    modifications to HPACK are meant to allow robust compression use\n   in QUIC:
    That is, no head-of-line blocking and low overhead.  QMIN is\n   guided by HPACK
    design principles.  It inherits all of HPACK's data\n   structures and retains
    binary compatibility with it.  While designed\n   with QUIC in mind, QMIN can
    be used in other contexts.\n\n\t "

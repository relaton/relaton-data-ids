  content: "   RFC 3344 [2] contains no provision to allow a home agent to inform
    a\n   mobile node that it needs to stop acting as the home agent for the\n   mobile
    node.  Dynamical Home Agent assignment [3] is designed for\n   assigning a optimal
    home agent for mobile node, not for proactively\n   notifying a mobile node to
    change it's home agent.  This document\n   specifies a new MIP4 control message
    that can be used between a home\n   agent and mobile node to signal a mobile node
    that it should acquire\n   a new home agent.\n\t "

  content: "Some ASes currently use length-based filters to manage the size of\nthe
    routing table they use and propagate.  This draft explores an\nalternative to
    length-based filters which allows for more automatic\nconfiguration and which
    provides for better redundancy.\n\nRather than use a filter, this draft proposes
    a method of modifying\nthe BGP [RFC1771] longest match algorithm by setting a
    bound on the\nprefix lengths eligible for preference.  A bound would operate on\nlong
    prefixes when covering route announcements are available; in\ncertain circumstances
    it would cause a router to prefer an aggregate\nover a more specific route announcement.\n\t "

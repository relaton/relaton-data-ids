abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern data center (DC) fabrics typically employ Clos topologies with
    External BGP (EBGP) for plain IPv4/IPv6 routing. While hop-by-hop EBGP routing
    is simple and scalable, it provides only a single best- effort forwarding service
    for all types of traffic. This single best-effort service might be insufficient
    for increasingly diverse traffic requirements in modern DC environments. For example,
    loss and latency sensitive AI/ML flows may demand stronger Service Level Agreements
    (SLA) than general purpose traffic. Duplication schemes which are standardized
    through protocols such as Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) require disjoint
    forwarding paths to avoid single points of failure. Congestion avoidance may require
    more deterministic forwarding behavior. This document introduces BGP Deterministic
    Path Forwarding (DPF), a mechanism that partitions the physical fabric into multiple
    logical fabrics. Flows can be mapped to different logical fabrics based on their
    specific requirements, enabling deterministic forwarding behavior within the data
    center.</p>"

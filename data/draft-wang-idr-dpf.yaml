  content: "   Modern data center (DC) fabrics typically employ Clos topologies with\n
    \  External BGP (EBGP) for plain IPv4/IPv6 routing.  While hop-by-hop\n   EBGP
    routing is simple and scalable, it provides only a single best-\n   effort forwarding
    service for all types of traffic.  This single\n   best-effort service might be
    insufficient for increasingly diverse\n   traffic requirements in modern DC environments.
    \ For example, loss\n   and latency sensitive AI/ML flows may demand stronger
    Service Level\n   Agreements (SLA) than general purpose traffic.  Duplication
    schemes\n   which are standardized through protocols such as Parallel Redundancy\n
    \  Protocol (PRP) require disjoint forwarding paths to avoid single\n   points
    of failure.  Congestion avoidance may require more\n   deterministic forwarding
    behavior.\n\n   This document introduces BGP Deterministic Path Forwarding (DPF),
    a\n   mechanism that partitions the physical fabric into multiple logical\n   fabrics.
    \ Flows can be mapped to different logical fabrics based on\n   their specific
    requirements, enabling deterministic forwarding\n   behavior within the data center.\n\n\t "

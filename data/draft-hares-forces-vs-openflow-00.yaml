  content: "   While both ForCES and OpenFlow follow the basic idea of\n   separations
    of forwarding plane and control plane in network\n   elements, they are technically
    different. ForCES specification\n   contains both a modeling language [RFC5812]
    which allows flexible\n   definition of the Flow tables and flow logic. ForCES
    flow logic\n   include Logical Functional Blocks (LFBs) connected in flow logic\n
    \  that is described in logic of direct graphs augmented by passage\n   of Metadata
    and grouping concepts.\n\n   OpenFlow's specifications contain a specific instantiation
    of\n   Flow tables and flow logic which has emerged from the research\n   community
    theories.  OpenFlow's logic varies based on the\n   revision of the specification
    (OpenFlow-Paper [McKeown2008],\n   OpenFlow Switch Specification 1.0 [OpenFlow1-0],
    OpenFlow 1.1\n   [OpenFlow-1.1] Open Configuration 1.0 [OpenFlowConfig-1.0]).\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies how Label Edge Routers (LERs) should behave when
    determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IPv4 packet with header options.  Lack
    of a formal standard has resulted in different LER forwarding behaviors for IPv4
    packets with header options despite being associated with a prefix-based Forwarding
    Equivalence Class (FEC).  IPv4 option packets that belong to a prefix-based FEC,
    yet are forwarded into an IPv4/MPLS network without being MPLS- encapsulated,
    present a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.  Further, LERs that are
    unable to MPLS encapsulate IPv4 packets with header options cannot operate in
    certain MPLS environments.  While this newly defined LER behavior is mandatory
    to implement, it is optional to invoke. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

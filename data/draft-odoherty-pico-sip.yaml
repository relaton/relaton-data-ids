  content: "This document defines an extension to the SIP protocol to allow \nit be
    used in adhoc networks or Pico Networks. It leverages the \ndirect, client to
    client session initiation capabilities of SIP, \nalthough there may be applications
    where the redirect and \nproxying abilities will be important also. Note the intention
    is \nnot to imply that SIP is inherently the best protocol for such \nnetworks,
    but to recognize that there will likely be many SIP \nbased applications in existence
    and that it would be good to \nallow these applications work with as little change
    as possible \nin this different type of network.\n\t "

  content: "This memo documents a way to include information on active routers\ncapabilities
    in routing protocols. In this document, a special focus\nwill be put on OSPF protocol
    release 2 [2], meanwhile other routing\nprotocols might be considered.\nThese
    information on active routers transferred through routing\nprotocols will help
    active routers to exploit as better as possible\nthe abilities of other active
    routers.\nThis draft especially focus on OSPF protocol v2 and describes the\ncorresponding
    opaque LSA complements according to the RFC 2370 [3].\n\n\t "

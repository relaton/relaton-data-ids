  content: "OAM functions are essential to ensure that the desired service level\nof
    traffic engineered connections are met.  In certain technologies\nOAM entities
    are inherently established once the connection is set\nup.  However other technologies,
    especially OAM for packet switched\nnetworks, require an extra configuration step
    after connection\nestablishment to setup OAM entities.  This document specifies\nextensions
    to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration\nof OAM entities along
    with LSP signalling.Requirements Language\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",

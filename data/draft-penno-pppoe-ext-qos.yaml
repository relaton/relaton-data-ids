  content: "In the year following the publication of the PPPoE protocol much\noperational
    experience and customer feedback was gathered. One\nproblem that access providers
    usually mention is that in order to\nchange QoS on a connection for a specific
    user, they have to \nprovision some central database (for instance, Radius) and
    also \nhave do it every time the user wants to make a change.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables a\nsubscriber
    to receive asynchronous notification of various events\nfrom other SIP user agents.
    \ It defines mechanisms to create,\nrefresh, terminate subscriptions.  This framework
    also defines\nmechanism to fetch (poll) an event state of a resource without\ncreating
    persistent subscriptions.  There is no mechanism to\ntemporarily pause the notifications,
    while still maintaining a\nsubscription on the server.  This lack of functionality
    sometime\nresults in a lot of superfluous notification traffic, and put\nunnecessary
    load on the server.  This draft defines an extension to\nSIP events that allows
    the subscriber to pause, un-pause\nnotifications, and be able to perform fetch
    (poll) subscriptions\nwithin an established (created) subscription dialog.\n\t "

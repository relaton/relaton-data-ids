  content: "LoST maps service identifiers and location information to service\ncontact
    URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover available services\nfor a particular
    location, it will perform a <listServicesByLocation>\nquery to the LoST server.
    \ However, the response from the LoST server\ndoes not provide information about
    the geographical region for which\nthe returned service list is valid.  Therefore,
    this document\nproposes a ServiceListBoundary to assist the client to not miss
    a\nchange in available services when moving.\n\t "

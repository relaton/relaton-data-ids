  content: "This document presents an overview of SNMPv3 compliance with the AAA \nprotocol
    requirements for network access as stipulated in the \n'Network Access AAA Evaluation
    Criteria' Internet Draft dated April \n26, 2000 [1].  SNMPv3 protocol features
    and capabilities directly \nsupport many of the AAA requirements.  In addition,
    the more \nsophisticated management model (see Section 5, below) now underlying
    \nSNMP -- which has evolved from the original model introduced in the \nlate 1980s
    under the guidance of extensive  use in the field -- \nenables the design, development,
    and deployment of more \nsophisticated management applications geared to the overall
    body of \nAAA protocol requirements (or sub-sets thereof). \n\n\t "

  content: "   This document aims to illustrate possible approaches to make network\n
    \  management and operations more autonomic in several aspects.  The\n   ultimate
    goal is that the network could run all by itself, so that\n   users and administrators
    may feel that there is no network to take\n   care of at all (a.k.a.  \"Networkless\").
    \ The approaches are described\n   in a form of different levels (inspired by
    the Self-Driven Car\n   levels).  The higher the level is, the more autonomic
    management\n   capabilities the network would have.\n\n   Although some specific
    technologies are categorized into different\n   levels, it is not the document's
    intent to rank them; rather, this\n   document is more about discussing the possible
    next stage and the\n   ultimate vision.  Hopefully, this document could collect
    people's\n   consensus in the industry and provide guidance for future technology\n
    \  developments.\n\n\t "

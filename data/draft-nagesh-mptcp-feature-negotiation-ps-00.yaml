  script: Latn
  content: "   Path manager and packet scheduler are two important components of\n
    \  MPTCP protocol and associated implementations.  Normally they are\n   implemented
    and configured statically.  This draft discusses the\n   scenarios where statically
    configured path manager and packet\n   scheduler are not sufficient, and presents
    the cases that deserve the\n   negotiation of these multipath transmission features
    which are\n   currently not addressed by MTPCP.\n\n\t "

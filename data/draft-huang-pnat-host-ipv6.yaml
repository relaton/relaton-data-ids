  content: "IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer issue, it is not easy to\nmandate
    the application in the host to change in the first place, the\nnetwork layer may
    have to have a solution to support conventional\nIPv4 appliations in the IPv6
    only network, especially when there are\nmultiple applications need to be supported.
    \ This document describes\na mechanism for providing a host-based IPv6 translation
    technology\nwhich could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatibility.  A
    new\nwell known IPv6 prefix is used for the destination address\ntranslation and
    network assigned prefix will be used for source\naddress translation.\n\t "

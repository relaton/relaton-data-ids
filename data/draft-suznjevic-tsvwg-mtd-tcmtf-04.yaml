  content: "   This document contains recommendations to be taken into account when\n
    \  using methods which optimize bandwidth utilization through Tunneling\n   Compressing
    and Multiplexing (TCM) traffic flows over a network path.\n   Different multiplexing
    policies and implementation issues which are\n   service and link specific are
    discussed.  Additionally, this document\n   describes policies which can be used
    for detecting, classifying, and\n   choosing the network flows suitable for optimization
    by using TCM.\n   Finally, recommendations of maximum tolerable delays to be added
    by\n   optimization techniques are reported.  Recommendations are presented\n
    \  only for network services for which such bandwidth optimization\n   techniques
    are applicable (i.e., services with low payload to header\n   size ratio, which
    will also be denoted as \"small-packet flows\").\n\n\t "

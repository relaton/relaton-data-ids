  content: "   This document presents intelligent network management based on\n   Artificial
    Intelligent (AI) such as reinforcement-learning\n   approaches.  In a heterogeneous
    network, intelligent management with\n   Artificial Intelligent should usually
    provide real-time connectivity,\n   the type of network management with the quality
    of real-time data,\n   and transmission services generated by an application service.
    \ With\n   that reason intelligent management system is needed to support real-\n
    \  time connection and protection through efficient management of\n   interfering
    network traffic for high-quality network data\n   transmission in the both cloud
    and IoE network systems.\n   Reinforcement-learning is one of the machine learning
    algorithms that\n   can intelligently and autonomously provide to management systems
    over\n   a communication network.  Reinforcement-learning has developed and\n
    \  expanded with deep learning technique based on model-driven or data-\n   driven
    technical approaches so that these trendy techniques have been\n   widely to intelligently
    attempt an adaptive networking models with\n   effective strategies in environmental
    disturbances over variety of\n   networking areas.  For Network AI with the intelligent
    and effective\n   strategies, intent-based network (IBN) can be also considered
    to\n   continuously and automatically evaluate network status under required\n
    \  policy for dynamic network optimization.  The key element for the\n   intent-based
    network is that it provides a verification of whether\n   the represented network
    intent is implementable or currently\n   implemented in the network.  Additionally,
    this approach need to\n   provide to take action in real time if the desired network
    state and\n   actual state are inconsistent.\n\n\t "

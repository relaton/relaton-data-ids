  content: "   IGP protocols traditionally compute best paths over the network based\n
    \  on the IGP metric assigned to the links.  Many network deployments\n   use
    RSVP-TE based or Segment Routing based Traffic Engineering to\n   enforce traffic
    over a path that is computed using different metrics\n   or constraints than the
    shortest IGP path.  Various mechanisms are\n   used to steer the traffic towards
    such traffic engineered paths.\n   This document proposes a solution that allows
    IGPs themselves to\n   compute constraint based paths over the network without
    the use of\n   the above mentioned traffic engineering technologies.\n\n\t "

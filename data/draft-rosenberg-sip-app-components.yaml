  content: "An application server is defined as an entity that is capable of\nproviding
    advanced features to users. Examples of features include\ncall forwarding, call
    screening, debit card calling, web interactive\nvoice response, etc. However,
    the set of functions needed to enable a\nbroad range of such applications is quite
    large - it includes speech\nrecognition, DTMF recognition and digit collection,
    text-to-speech\nsynthesis, database interfacing, audio and video coding and decoding,\naudio
    and video bridging and mixing, and signaling, to name a few.\nSupporting such
    a large set of functions on the same box presents a\nmajor challenge. To solve
    this problem, the industry is proposing a\ndecomposition of the application server
    into two components - a media\nserver that handles the media component, and an
    application server\nthat handles the call control, data, and signaling. The interface\nthat
    has been proposed between these two elements is a control\nmechanism along the
    lines of MGCP or Megaco. In this paper, we\npropose an orthogonal decomposition,
    which breaks an application\nserver into application server components. Each component
    represents\na application server in its own right, but it provides a well defined\ncomponent
    that by itself may be a complete, but simpler, application.\n\t "

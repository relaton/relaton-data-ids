  content: "   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol allows the members of the\n
    \  group to agree on a set of GroupContext extensions.  MLS includes a\n   mechanism
    to do a wholesale replacements of all GroupContext\n   extensions, but not to
    modify individual extensions.  In this\n   document, we define a mechanism that
    allows implementations to add,\n   update, and remove each element of the GroupContext
    individually.\n   This also makes it practical for applications using MLS to exploit\n
    \  this feature of MLS to ensure that the group members are in agreement\n   on
    the state of the application in addition to MLS-related state.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a new mechanism for discovering multicast \ntree
    topology in the network. It uses the existing multicast \nforwarding state information
    to discovery tree topology in the \nsource-to-receiver(s) direction. Scalability
    is provided by \nusing a modified version of standard TTL based scoping. This
    draft \nidentifies  important issues necessary for discovering tree topology \nin
    the source-to-receiver(s) direction and discusses potential \nsolutions to handle
    them.\n\t "

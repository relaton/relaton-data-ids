  content: "A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by\npeer-to-peer
    (P2P) applications used traditionally for file-sharing,\nand more recently for
    real-time communications and live media\nstreaming.  Such applications discover
    a route to each other through\nan overlay network with little knowledge of the
    underlying network\ntopology.  As a result, they may choose peers based on information\ndeduced
    from empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal\nchoices.  We refer
    to this as the Application Layer Traffic\nOptimization (ALTO) problem.  In this
    draft we present a survey of\nexisting literature on discovering topology characteristics.\n\t "

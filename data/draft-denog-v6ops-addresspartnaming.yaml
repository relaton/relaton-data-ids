  content: "In the daily communication between technicians, engineers and other\npeople
    who need to deal with computer networks, it is often necessary\nto refer to particular
    parts of IP addresses. In the world of IPv4,\nthe term \"octet\" is well established,
    however as the use of IPv6 is\nspreading, it becomes apparent that there is no
    such commonly\naccepted term for IPv6 addresses.\n\nDiscussing and explaining
    technical matters become difficult when\ndifferent people use different terms
    for the same thing. Therefore,\nthis document discusses several naming proposal
    for those 16bit\npieces of IPv6 addreses.\n\t "

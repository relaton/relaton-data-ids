- language: en

  content: "        RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been
    used\n        in Internet protocol design. More than twenty years have passed\n
    \       since RFC3552 was written and the structure and topology of the\n        Internet
    have changed dramatically. With those changes comes a\n        question: has the
    Internet Threat Model changed? Or, is the model\n        described in RFC3552
    still mostly accurate?  This draft attempts to\n        describe a non-exhaustive
    list of the most likely updates and\n        changes in the current threat environment.
    This paper has the goal\n        of suggesting a way forward for describing the
    contemporary threat\n        model and how it might inform security aspects of
    protocol design.\n\n\t "

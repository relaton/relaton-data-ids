  content: "   MPTCP proxies and anchors are network-based functions, which support\n
    \  MPTCP connections.  The MPTCP proxy provides multipath support for\n   MPTCP-capable
    hosts on behalf of their MPTCP-unaware peers.  This\n   facilitates incremental
    deployment of MPTCP.  The MPTCP anchor\n   permits subflow establishment for MPTCP
    connections when direct\n   interaction between end hosts fails.  This permits
    tolerance to local\n   IP protocol restrictions and it provides robustness in
    case of break-\n   before-make mobility events.  MPTCP proxies and anchors are\n
    \  especially suited for wireless access environments.\n\n\n\n\t "

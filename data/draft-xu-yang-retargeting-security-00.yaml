  content: "   As a SIP request is processed along its route to the destination, the
    \n   initial request-URI can be altered without callers’ notice or \n   consent.
    The caller may concern both the final call recipient’s \n   identity and the authorities
    of the SIP intermediaries that alter the \n   request-URI. Especially when the
    caller does not know the final call \n   recipient, simply giving his/her identity
    to the caller will not help \n   the caller to decide the legitimacy of the call.
    Without a secure \n   retarget mechanism, the end-to-end security of SIP cannot
    be \n   guaranteed. This document proposes a security mechanism to provide \n
    \  the caller with credentials of SIP intermediaries that retarget a \n   request
    and the final recipient’s identity through response.  \n\n\t "

  content: "   DNSSEC employs a Key Tag field in the RRSIG and DS resource records\n
    \  in order to efficiently identify the key that produced a DNSSEC\n   signature
    and the key that should be used as a secure entry point\n   into a delegated zone.
    \ The Key Tag was not intended to be a unique\n   identifier.  Key tag collisions
    can occur in practice for keys in the\n   same zone, though they are relatively
    rare in normal operation.\n   Colliding key tags impose additional work on a validating
    resolver\n   because it then has to check signatures for each of the candidate
    set\n   of keys identified by the Key Tag.  Furthermore, they open up\n   resolvers
    to computational denial of service attacks by adversaries\n   deploying specially
    crafted zones with many intentionally colliding\n   key tags.  This document specifies
    updates to the DNSSEC protocol and\n   the process of key generation to avoid
    colliding key tags.\n\n\t "

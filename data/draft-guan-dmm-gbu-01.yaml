  content: "       Internet of Things (IoT) has been booming with rapid increase of\n
    \      various wearable devices, vehicle embedded devices and so on, and\n       providing
    the effective mobility management for these IoT devices\n       becomes a challenge
    due to the different application scenarios as\n       well as the limited energy
    and bandwidth. Many researchers have\n       focused on this topic and proposed
    several solutions based on the\n       combination of IoT features and traditional
    mobility management\n       protocols, in which most of these schemes take the
    IoT devices as\n       mobile networks and adopt the NEtwork MObility (NEMO) and
    its\n       variants to provide the mobility support. However, these solutions\n
    \      are in face of the heavy signaling cost problem. Considering that IoT\n
    \      devices generally collaborate to realize the complex functions, these\n
    \      devices may have the similar movement behaviors. This document\n       therefore
    specifies a PMIPv6-based group binding update method to\n       reduce the singling
    cost and improve the scalability for these\n       devices.\n\n\t "

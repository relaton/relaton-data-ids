- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "A new transformation format, called UTF-5 for Unicode is proposed.\nThe
    resulting string of this UTF is within a [A-V][0-9] alphanumeric\nrange. This
    enables legacy systems or protocols designed for alpha-\nnumerical character set
    only to be multilingual enabled and inter-\nnationalized immediately. Example
    of such systems are the domain\nname system and email addresses.\n\t "

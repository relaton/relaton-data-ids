  content: "The Sieve Email Filtering \"include\" extension permits users to\ninclude
    one Sieve script inside another.  This can make managing\nlarge scripts or multiple
    sets of scripts much easier, as well as\nsupporting common 'libraries' of scripts.
    \ Users are able to include\ntheir own personal scripts or site-wide scripts provided
    by the local\nSieve implementation.\n\nChange History (to be removed prior to
    publication as an RFC)\n\nChanges from -05 to -06:\na.  Aaron Stone joins as author.\nb.

  content: "   Despite the stability of the Internet technology, tremendous advances\n
    \  and important innovation are always happening.  In particular,\n   routing
    and addressing have profoundly changed during the years, with\n   interesting
    research still ongoing and engineers willing to be hear\n   about recent advance
    that may solve their operational problems.\n   However, researchers and engineers
    lack a dedicated forum where they\n   can meet and interact to discuss about routing
    and addressing.  This\n   document advocates the creation of such forum, to bring
    together\n   these communities (researchers and engineers) and offer a dedicated\n
    \  venue.\n\n\t "

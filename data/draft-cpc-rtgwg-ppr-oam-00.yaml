  content: "   This document defines OAM and traffic accounting capabilities for\n
    \  Preferred Path Routing (PPR) for IS-IS and OSPF protocols.\n   Specifically,
    this document specifies OAM capabilities that allow to\n   assert proper PPR connectivity
    and to trace PPR path information.  In\n   addition, a set of statistics and operational
    data to facilitate PPR\n   traffic accounting on a per-PPR path basis are defined.
    \ This\n   includes a number of Information Elements that extend IPFIX to export\n
    \  path information, as well as a YANG Data Model to be used in\n   conjunction
    with management and control protocols.  Collectively the\n   capabilities defined
    in this document provide network operators with\n   the necessary means to ensure
    proper working of their PPR\n   deployments.\n\n\n\t "

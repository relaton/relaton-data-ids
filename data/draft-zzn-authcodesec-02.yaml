abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism to enhance domain transfer security
    by transitioning from a shared-secret authorization model to a asymmetric cryptographic
    signature-based validation system. Using asymmetric cryptographic signatures enables
    many benefits over a shared secret, such as non-repudiation, improved auditability
    through clear identification of the authorizing entity, elimination of the need
    for registries to store and secure shared secrets, replay protection through timestamp
    validation, and reduced risk of interception since only the private key needs
    to remain secret. This document establishes the following AuthCodeSEC extension
    of EPP with the following protocol elements:</p>"

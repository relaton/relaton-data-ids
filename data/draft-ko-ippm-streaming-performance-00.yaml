  content: "   This memo defines metrics plus a methodology for post-measurement\n
    \  processing of sample metrics to evaluate network path performance\n   relative
    to streaming video traffic. The metrics are based on\n   established methodologies
    for TCP throughput testing. The post-\n   processing methodology is based on a
    model of streaming traffic that\n   allows a given sample metric to be evaluated
    against multiple sets\n   of parameters representing different streaming rates,
    delays and\n   buffering values. The results of the post-processing methodology
    are\n   derived metrics that are suitable for statistical analysis.\n\n\t "

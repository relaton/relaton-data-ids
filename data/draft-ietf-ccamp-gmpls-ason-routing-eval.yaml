  content: "The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to control
    different switching technologies as well as different applications. These include
    support for requesting TDM connections including Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous
    Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).\n\n This
    document provides an evaluation of the IETF Routing Protocols against the routing
    requirements for an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by
    ITU-T. This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   While the DNS zone master file format has always allowed comments,\n
    \  there is no existing mechanism to preserve comments once the zone has\n   been
    loaded into memory or converted to a binary representation.\n   This note proposes
    a new \"NOTE\" RR type, which is stored alongside\n   zone data and may be included
    in zone transfers, but is not returned\n   in response to DNS queries.\n\n\t "

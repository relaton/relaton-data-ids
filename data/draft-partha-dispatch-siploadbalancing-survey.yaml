  content: "   SIP Load balancing across a farm of SIP servers can be done today,\n
    \  but without generally agreed upon principles on how to best do\n   accomplish
    this.  Confounding the problem is that a SIP farm may\n   consist of hosts with
    varying capabilities, example, a SIP proxy, a\n   back-to-back user agent (B2BUA),
    a public-switched telephone system\n   (PSTN) gateway, SIP Media servers etc.
    \ The capabilities and\n   processing capacity on hosts in the farm may be different,
    sometimes\n   vastly, from each other.  This document present the survey of\n
    \  existing literature and common practice on SIP load balancing.\n\n\t "

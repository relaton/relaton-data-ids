  content: "   This document describes a method for enabling and configuring network\n
    \  access for IoT devices that are first authenticated at a server.  In\n   typical
    implementations, this server may be run by the manufacturer\n   of the IoT device
    as an online cloud service.  This specification is\n   intended for off-the-shelf
    IoT devices that have just been purchased\n   by the user.  Many of these devices
    have only limited user interfaces\n   that can be used for configuring network
    access credentials.  The\n   device configuration is also made more challenging
    by the fact that\n   these devices may exist in large numbers.\n\n\t "

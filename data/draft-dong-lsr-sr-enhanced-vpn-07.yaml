  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support\n
    \  some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent\n   performance
    requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the\n   overlay VPN connectivity
    and the characteristics provided by the\n   underlay network.  A Virtual Transport
    Network (VTN) is a virtual\n   underlay network which has a customized network
    topology and a set of\n   network resources allocated from the physical network.
    \ A VTN could\n   be used to support one or a group of VPN+ services.\n\n   This
    document specifies the IGP mechanisms with necessary extensions\n   to advertise
    the associated topology and resource attributes for\n   scalable Segment Routing
    (SR) based VTNs.  Each VTN can have a\n   customized topology and a set of network
    resources allocated from the\n   physical network.  Multiple VTNs may shared the
    same topology, and\n   multiple VTNs may share the same set of network resources
    on some\n   network segments.  A group of resource-aware SIDs are allocated for\n
    \  each VTN.  This allows flexible combination of the network topology\n   and
    network resource attributes to build a relatively large number of\n   VTNs with
    a small number of logical topologies.  The proposed\n   mechanism is applicable
    to both Segment Routing with MPLS data plane\n   (SR-MPLS) and segment routing
    with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).  This\n   document also describes the mechanisms
    of using dedicated VTN-ID in\n   the data plane instead of the per-VTN resource-aware
    SIDs to further\n   reduce the control plane overhead.\n\n\n\t "

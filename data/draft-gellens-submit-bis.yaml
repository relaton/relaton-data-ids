  content: "This memo splits message submission from message relay, allowing each
    service to operate according to its own rules (for security, policy, etc.), and
    specifies what actions are to be taken by a submission server.\n\n Message relay
    and final delivery are unaffected, and continue to use SMTP over port 25.\n\n
    When conforming to this document, message submission uses the protocol specified
    here, normally over port 587.\n\n This separation of function offers a number
    of benefits, including the ability to apply specific security or policy requirements.

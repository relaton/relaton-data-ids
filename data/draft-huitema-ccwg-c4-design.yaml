  content: "   Christian's Congestion Control Code is a new congestion control\n   algorithm
    designed to support Real-Time applications such as Media\n   over QUIC.  It is
    designed to drive towards low delays, with good\n   support for the \"application
    limited\" behavior frequently found when\n   using variable rate encoding, and
    with fast reaction to congestion to\n   avoid the \"priority inversion\" happening
    when congestion control\n   overestimates the available capacity.  It pays special
    attention to\n   the high jitter conditions encountered in Wi-Fi networks.  The
    design\n   emphasizes simplicity and avoids making too many assumption about the\n
    \  \"model\" of the network.  The main control variables are the estimate\n   of
    the data rate and of the maximum path delay in the absence of\n   queues.\n\n\t "

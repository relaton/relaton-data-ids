abstract:
- content: <p>Christian's Congestion Control Code is a new congestion control algorithm
    designed to support Real-Time applications such as Media over QUIC. It is designed
    to drive towards low delays, with good support for the "application limited" behavior
    frequently found when using variable rate encoding, and with fast reaction to
    congestion to avoid the "priority inversion" happening when congestion control
    overestimates the available capacity. It pays special attention to the high jitter
    conditions encountered in Wi-Fi networks. The design emphasizes simplicity and
    avoids making too many assumption about the "model" of the network. The main control
    variables are the estimate of the data rate and of the maximum path delay in the
    absence of queues.</p>

  content: "   IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not\n
    \  have a normative reference to another standards track document at a\n   lower
    maturity level or to a non standards track specification (other\n   than specifications
    from other standards bodies).  For example, a\n   standards track document may
    not have a normative reference to an\n   informational RFC.  Exceptions to this
    rule are sometimes needed as\n   the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe
    non-IETF standards or\n   IETF-specific modes of use of such standards.  This
    document\n   clarifies and updates the procedure used in these circumstances.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency,
    and Trust) profile for creating tamper-evident audit trails of AI- driven algorithmic
    trading decisions and executions. The VeritasChain Protocol (VCP) extends the
    SCITT architecture to address the specific requirements of financial markets,
    including nanosecond- precision timestamps, regulatory compliance with EU AI Act
    and MiFID II, and privacy-preserving mechanisms (crypto-shredding) for GDPR compliance.
    This profile defines how VCP events are encoded as SCITT Signed Statements, registered
    with Transparency Services, and verified using COSE Receipts.</p>"

  content: "   A key establishment protocol intended to run between constrained\n
    \  devices has to be both lightweight and secure.  Among the existing\n   key
    establishment families (key agreement, key transport, server-\n   assisted key
    transport or key distribution), the latter is the best\n   candidate for constrained
    devices, since it can keep cryptographic\n   operations simple at nodes sides.
    \ Nevertheless, most key\n   distribution protocols exhibit an asymmetric design,
    since they are\n   supposed to run between devices playing well-defined client
    and\n   server roles, implying different security assumptions between the\n   devices
    involved in the exchange.\n\n   MIKEY-Ticket is a key distribution protocol that
    specifies new modes\n   for the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol.  It
    answers\n   situations where the network contains a trusted third party (one or\n
    \  multiple trusted key management servers).  The general MIKEY-Ticket\n   mode
    is a key distribution scheme relying on six messages exchanged\n   between the
    node initiating the protocol (Initiator), the Key\n   Management Server (KMS)
    and the responding node (Responder).  This\n   general mode assumes that the two
    parties establishing a key with\n   each other play similar roles, with the only
    exception that one is\n   the Initiator and the other one the Responder.\n\n   However,
    this mode suffers from a risk of a Denial of Service (DoS)\n   inherited from
    the protocol design.  In addition, the protocol syntax\n   involves very large
    messages that would have to be fragmented, and\n   would therefore not be convenient
    to communications between\n   constrained nodes.  In this document, we propose
    a new MIKEY-Ticket\n   mode that solves the risk of DoS during the key establishment
    between\n   the Initiator and the Responder, relies on a 5-message exchange\n
    \  instead of a 6-message one and bases on a simplified syntax, leading\n   to
    lighter messages.\n\n\t "

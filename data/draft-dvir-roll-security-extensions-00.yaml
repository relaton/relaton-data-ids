  content: "Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of networks in which\nboth
    the routers and their interconnects are constrained.  LLN\nrouters typically operate
    with constraints on processing power,\nmemory, and energy (battery power).  LLN
    router supported traffic\nflows include point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and
    multipoint-to-\npoint. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provides the\nmechanisms
    to support those traffic flows.  The currently available\nsecurity services in
    RPL will not protect against a compromised\ninternal node that can also construct
    and disseminate fake messages. \nIn this document, a service is described that
    prevents an internal\nattacker from impersonating a Destination Oriented Directed
    Acyclic\nGraph (DODAG) root.  Moreover, the establishment and maintenance of\nany
    cryptographic key is out of the scope of the current RPL\nproposal.  In this document
    a service that allows nodes to agree on\nlocal keys with their neighborhood is
    also presented.\n\t "

  content: "Mobile IPv6 describes how a Mobile Node can change its point of \nattachment
    to the Internet. While MIPv6 focuses on unicast \ncommunications, it also proposes
    two basic mechanisms, known as \nbidirectionnal tunneling and remote subscription,
    to handle \nmulticast communications with mobile members. In the mean time, the
    \ndeployment of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) is of great \nconsideration, using
    the PIM-SM and MLDv2 protocols.\n\t "

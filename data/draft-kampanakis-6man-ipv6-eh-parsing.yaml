  content: "   IPv6 is widely used on the internet today and is expected to be\n   deployed
    more as more devices (i.e. home automation) get inter-\n   connected.  The IPv6
    header format allows for the use of Extension\n   Headers (EH).  EHs could be
    chained together with very few existing\n   guidelines by the IPv6 protocol on
    how devices should parse them,\n   which open room for security concerns and inconsistencies.
    \ This\n   document presents guidelines for parsing IPv6 EHs with a goal of\n
    \  providing a common and consistent parsing methodology for IPv6\n   implementers
    among the industry.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Link Management Protocol (LMP) has been developed as part of the Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite to manage Traffic Engineering (TE) resources and links.
    \ The GMPLS control plane (routing and signaling) uses TE links for establishing
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  This memo describes the relationship of the LMP
    procedures to 'discovery' as defined in the International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU-T), and ongoing ITU-T work.  This document provides an overview of LMP in
    the context of the ITU-T Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) and transport
    network terminology and relates it to the ITU-T discovery work to promote a common
    understanding for progressing the work of IETF and ITU-T.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

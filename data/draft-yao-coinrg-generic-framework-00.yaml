  script: Latn
  content: "   There have been a lot of academic research and industrial practice
    in\n   the area of COIN, but most of them are case-by-case design and\n   currently
    they also rely heavily on programmable network devices,\n   which lacks some generality
    and scalability, thus will impede the\n   development of COIN.  This document
    summarizes the computing\n   primitives/operations/semantics that can be implemented
    inside the\n   network, through analysis of different COIN use cases, and proposes
    a\n   generic framework of COIN in the controlled environments.  Enabling\n   technologies
    related to the framework and the standardization\n   landscape are also analyzed
    in the document.\n\n\t "

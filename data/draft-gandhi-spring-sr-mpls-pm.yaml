  content: "   RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and\n
    \  accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as\n   well
    as related metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks\n   using probe messages.
    \ This document reviews how these mechanisms can\n   be used for Delay and Loss
    Performance Measurements (PM) in Segment\n   Routing (SR) networks with MPLS data
    plane (SR-MPLS), for both SR\n   links and end-to-end SR Policies.  The performance
    measurements for\n   SR links are used to compute extended Traffic Engineering
    (TE)\n   metrics for delay and loss and are advertised in the network using\n
    \  routing protocol extensions.\n\n\n\t "

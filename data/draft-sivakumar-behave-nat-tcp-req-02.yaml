  content: "   NAT devices are available from a number of vendors and are in use by\n
    \  several residential and enterprise users.  Yet, there is much\n   variation
    in how the NAT devices work.  Application developers,\n   network administrators
    and users of NAT devices seek some level of\n   uniformity and predictability
    in how various of the NAT devices\n   operate.  The objective of this document
    is to specify the\n   operational and behavioral requirements on the NAT devices
    while\n   processing TCP packets.  A NAT device that conforms to the\n   requirements
    listed in the document will bring predictability in how\n   NATs operate with
    regard to TCP packet processing.  A NAT device is\n   said to be IETF behave compliant
    when it complies with the\n   requirements outlined in this document and other
    companion BEHAVE\n   documents like [BEH-UDP], which outlines the requirements
    for\n   processing UDP and some generic requirements.\n\t "

  content: "This draft provides a detailed description of the Rate-Halving\nalgorithm.
    \ As specified by RFC2581, Fast Recovery adjusts the\ncongestion window (cwnd)
    by transmitting new data only during the\nsecond half of the recovery interval.
    \ The Rate-Halving algorithm\nadjusts the congestion window by spacing transmissions
    at the rate of\none data segment per two segments acknowledged over the entire\nrecovery
    period, thereby sustaining the self-clocking of TCP and\navoiding a burst.  Since
    it is largely independent of the details of\nthe data retransmission strategy,
    the Rate-Halving algorithm can be\nused with several standard and experimental
    TCP implementations:\nNewReno, SACK, and ECN.\n\n\n\t "

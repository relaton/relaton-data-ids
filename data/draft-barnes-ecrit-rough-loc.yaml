  content: "Emergency calling works best when precise location is available for\nemergency
    call routing.  However, there are situations in which a\nlocation provider is
    unable or unwilling to provide precise location,\nyet still wishes to enable subscribers
    to make emergency calls.  This\ndocument describes the level of location accuracy
    that providers must\nprovide to enable emergency call routing.  In addition, we
    descibe\nhow emergency services and non-emergency services can be invoked by\nan
    endpoint that does not have access to its precise location.\n\t "

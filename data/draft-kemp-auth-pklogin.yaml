  content: "This document defines the Public Key Login (PKL) protocol, a challenge-\nresponse
    authentication mechanism using digital signatures. It provides\nstart-of-session
    authentication for firewall proxies, dial-up Network\nAccess Servers, remote email
    servers, and interactive protocols such as\nTelnet and FTP. It provides functionality
    similar to One Time Passwords\nand handheld authentication tokens, and it supports
    both one-way and\nmutual authentication. PKL uses the authentication exchanges
    specified\nin ISO/IEC 9798-3 and NIST FIPS Pub 196.\n \nThe PKL protocol provides
    strong authentication at the beginning of a\nsession, but does not by itself provide
    communication channel integrity\nor confidentiality. PKL should be used in conjunction
    with a channel\nintegrity mechanism, for example to provide authentication of
    individual\nusers over (host-keyed) Virtual Private Network connections.\n \nThis
    Internet Draft is intended to be the last version of the PKL\nspecification prior
    to publication as an Informational RFC. Comments are\nrequested no later than
    the expiration date of this draft.\n\t "

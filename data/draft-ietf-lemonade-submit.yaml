  content: "IMAP clients operating over low-bandwidth or high-latency links,\nsuch
    as cellular telephones, need to be able to submit mail messages\ncontaining all
    or part of previously-received IMAP messages.\nClients need to be able to do this
    without sloshing the bits both\nways, that is, without being forced to download
    IMAP messages solely\nto be able to upload the content in a submitted message.\nThis
    document currently identifies the two main approaches to doing\nthis (called 'IMAP
    push' and 'IMAP pull'), one which adds submission\nto IMAP, and another which
    adds the expansion of IMAP references to\nmessage submission.  This version of
    the document attempts to lay\nout the protocol mechanisms along with associated
    trade-offs and\nsecurity considerations of each.  Once a decision has been made
    to\ngo with a particular technique, this document will describe the\nspecifics
    of that choice as a standards-track proposal.\n\t "

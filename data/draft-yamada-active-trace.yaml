abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "General traceback protocols (e.g. itrace) only consider to send\ntraceback
    information from Generator to Tracer.  But they are not\nhelpful when victims
    and/or Tracer want to know who attacks them\nbecause of conventional traceback
    mechanisms have not been\nreflected in Tracer intention.  Therefore this draft
    proposes an\nadditional protocol for conventional traceback protocols,\nespecially
    itrace, to reflect in Tracer intention and be able to\ncontrol generation of traceback
    information by Generator.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document updates RFC 8182 (The RPKI Repository Delta Protocol)\n
    \  by specifying an optimized delta file retention policy based on\n   client
    access patterns.  The proposed mechanism allows RRDP servers\n   to maintain only
    the delta files required by active clients, reducing\n   storage requirements
    while maintaining compatibility with existing\n   clients.  By tracking which
    serial numbers are being requested by\n   active clients, the repository can determine
    the minimum serial\n   number needed by any client and safely prune delta files
    that update\n   from earlier serial numbers.\n\n   The proposed mechanism provides
    several benefits, including reduced\n   storage requirements, smaller notification
    files, and more efficient\n   use of bandwidth and processing resources.  It also
    maintains\n   backward compatibility with existing RRDP clients, requiring no\n
    \  changes to client implementations.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 8182 (The RPKI Repository Delta Protocol)
    by specifying an optimized delta file retention policy based on client access
    patterns. The proposed mechanism allows RRDP servers to maintain only the delta
    files required by active clients, reducing storage requirements while maintaining
    compatibility with existing clients. By tracking which serial numbers are being
    requested by active clients, the repository can determine the minimum serial number
    needed by any client and safely prune delta files that update from earlier serial
    numbers. The proposed mechanism provides several benefits, including reduced storage
    requirements, smaller notification files, and more efficient use of bandwidth
    and processing resources. It also maintains backward compatibility with existing
    RRDP clients, requiring no changes to client implementations.</p>"

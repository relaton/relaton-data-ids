  content: "This document describes a single way to perform both Mobile-IPv4  \nand
    802.11  authentication and key exchanges. Diameter Mobile-IPv4\nApplication can
    be used to consummate message sequences for both\n802.11 and Mobile IPv4.  It
    is possible to replace the currently \nproposed 802.1x Authentication/key-exchange
    with  Diameter \nMobile-IPv4 Application.\n\n\t "

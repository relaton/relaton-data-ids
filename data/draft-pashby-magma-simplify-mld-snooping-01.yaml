  content: "The purpose of this draft is to simplify the design of MLD Snooping\nswitches
    and provide a method for Solicited Node multicast addresses\nto be sent to every
    port to improve network robustment and\nmanagement.\n\nIPv6 Addressing Architecture
    requires that all nodes must join the\nassociated Solicited-Node multicast addresses
    for every unicast and\nanycast address it is assigned.  This causes MLD snooping
    switches to\ncreate potentially huge multicast forwarding tables just to handle\nNeighbor
    Discovery.  A simple change to alleviate this would be to\nallow switches to forward
    a range of addresses that include the\nSolicited-Node multicast addresses to every
    port.  This also could\nhelp in network discovery.  Similarly the same allowance
    could be\nmade for Local Network Control Block (LNCB) addresses.\n\n\t "

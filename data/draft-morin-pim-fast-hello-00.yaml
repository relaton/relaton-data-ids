  content: "This document is proposed as an update of RFC4601 and describes\n   procedures
    allowing exchanges of PIM Hellos to complete earlier when\n   a new link comes
    up, to mitigate the multicast traffic blackholing\n   issues that result from
    inconsistencies between links advertised by\n   unicast routing and the links
    on which PIM adjacencies are fully set\n   up.\n\n\t "

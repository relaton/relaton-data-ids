  content: "   Operating the global routing ecosystem entails a divers set of\n   interacting
    components, while operational practice evolved over time.\n   In that time, terms
    emerged, disappeared, and sometimes changed their\n   meaning.\n\n   To aid operators
    and implementers in reading contemporary drafts,\n   this document provides an
    overview of terms and abbreviations used in\n   the global routing operations
    community.  The document explicitly\n   does not serve as an authoritative source
    of correct terminology, but\n   instead strives to provide an overview of practice.\n\n\t "

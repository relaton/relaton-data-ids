  content: "   This document applies the generalized capability principles to the\n
    \  description of equipment (a physical thing) with applied data\n   (configuration
    state and code (software, firmware etc.)) and shows\n   how such capability specifications
    integrate with base inventory and\n   entitlement models as defined in Network
    Inventory, Software\n   Extension and Entitlement YANG models.\n\n   The approach
    is examined by example, focusing on how the potential\n   capabilities of each
    equipment type-version with applied data are\n   described, how these map to entitlements
    (licensed or policy-\n   controlled subsets of capabilities), and how they are
    instantiated as\n   inventory items.  The explanation covers both the capabilities
    of\n   equipment in terms of physical properties and the capabilities of\n   equipment
    with applied data in terms of resultant emergent\n   functionality.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes IKEv2 peer authentication via IPv6\n   Cryptographically
    Generated Addresses (CGA).  This techincque have\n   been proposed to solve several
    security issues in the absence of any\n   centralized trusted security infrastructure
    and without any pre-\n   arrangements, to provide IPSec self-evident authentication
    mode\n   between IPv6 nodes or security gateways.\n\t "

  content: "Networks which are using IPv4 addresses are using the address\ntranslation
    technologies such as NAT at end-networks for various\nreasons. However, those
    technologies sometimes prevent two-way\ntransparently communications.\nThis document
    will define a way to enhance address translation\ntechnologies such as NAT. This
    way will be able to communicate\ntransparently by adding a sub-address to IPv4.\nThis
    enhancement will be called 'NATS'(Network Address Translation\nwith Sub-Address)
    in this document.\n\t "

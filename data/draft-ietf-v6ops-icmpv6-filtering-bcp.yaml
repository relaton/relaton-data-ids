  content: "In networks supporting IPv6 the Internet Control Message Protocol\nversion
    6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of\nfunctions, and a correspondingly
    large number of message types and\noptions.  A number of security risks are associated
    with uncontrolled\nforwarding of ICMPv6 messages.  On the other hand, compared
    with IPv4\nand the corresponding protocol ICMP, ICMPv6 is essential to the\nfunctioning
    of IPv6 rather than a useful auxiliary.\n\nThis document provides some recommendations
    for ICMPv6 firewall\nfilter configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6
    messages\nthat are needed to maintain the functioning of the network but drop\nmessages
    which are potential security risks.\n\t "

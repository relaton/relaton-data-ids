- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a TLS extension that allows clients to indicate\n
    \  one or more workload identifier scopes in the ClientHello message.\n   Each
    scope consists of a URI scheme and trust domain component,\n   representing the
    administrative domain and identifier namespace in\n   which the client operates.
    \ These identifier scopes serve as hints to\n   enable the server to determine
    whether client authentication is\n   required and which policies or trust anchors
    should apply.  This\n   mechanism improves efficiency in mutual TLS deployments
    while\n   minimising the exposure of sensitive identifier information.  To\n   protect
    confidentiality, this extension can be used in conjunction\n   with Encrypted
    Client Hello (ECH).\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines new attributes to facilitate Proxy Mobile IPv6\noperations
    using RADIUS infrastructure.  The RADIUS interactions take\nplace when the Mobile
    Node attaches, authenticates and authorizes to\na Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  Furthermore,
    this document also defines\na RADIUS based interface between the Local Mobility
    Anchor and the\nRADIUS server for authorizing received initial Proxy Binding Update\nmessages
    for the mobility service session.  In addition to the\nmobility session setup
    related RADIUS interaction, this document\ndefines the baseline for both the Mobile
    Access Gateway and the Local\nMobility Anchor generated accounting.\n\nStatus

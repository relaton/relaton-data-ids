  content: "As the number of mobile terminals increases, Mobile IP[1] potentially
    \ncould make users roam around the world while also keep their \nconnection to
    the Internet uninterruptedly. In the mean time, many \norganizations are using
    NAPT[2] (Network Address Port Translator) to \nisolate private network from public
    realms. The integration of NAPT \nwith Mobile IP, however, introduces technical
    issues that must be \nresolved before they can function together. Although techniques
    such \nas UDP tunneling[3] and reverse tunneling[4] can be utilized to solve \npart
    of the problem, there are still some scenarios which need more \ndiscussion. This
    document reviews these mechanisms and presents a \nguideline for the integration
    of Mobile IP and NAPT in various \nscenarios.\n\n\t "

    proposes that a P2P protocol be\n   standardized in the IETF as a protocol used

    \  stored locally and how much can be distributed using the P2P network\n   to
    a distributed Location Server.  A number of DHT (Distributed Hash\n   Table) P2P
    protocols that solve some similar functions are given as\n   examples and could
    be used as input to this work.  Finally, existing\n   SIP and P2P work is surveyed
    with respect to this proposal.\n\t "

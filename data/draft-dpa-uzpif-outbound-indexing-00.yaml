  content: "   This document proposes an outbound, opt-in mechanism for web content\n
    \  discovery and indexing, complementing or replacing traditional\n   inbound
    crawling models such as those governed by the Robots\n   Exclusion Protocol (REP;
    [RFC9309]).  In the proposed approach,\n   servers proactively initiate authenticated
    outbound connections to\n   trusted indexers (search engines or AI systems) using
    identity-bound\n   grants, enabling explicit consent for indexing, freshness signalling,\n
    \  and content usage policy communication.\n\n   The mechanism integrates with
    identity-centric frameworks such as the\n   Universal Zero-Port Interconnect Framework
    (UZPIF; [UZPIF]) and\n   supports both traditional search engines and AI-driven
    indexing and\n   retrieval systems.  It aims to reduce unsolicited crawling abuse,\n
    \  improve signal quality for indexers, and provide site owners with\n   positive
    control over discoverability in an era of increasing AI\n   content consumption.\n\n\t "

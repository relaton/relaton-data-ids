- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft addresses the need to complement the IP mobility protocols\nwith
    respect to the co-ordination of a mobile node's network access. \nThe concept
    of Network Access Agent (NAA) is introduced as a\nfunctional entity in the network
    to assist the mobile node's IP\nhandoff strategy. The Network Access Co-ordination
    Protocol (NACP) is \nproposed as an interaction mechanism between the NAA and
    the mobile \nnode, so that the NAA can provide valuable information and \nrecommendations
    to the mobile node to consider in IP handoff. The \nNACP is conceived so that
    it is completely independent of the Mobile\nIP protocols.\n\t "

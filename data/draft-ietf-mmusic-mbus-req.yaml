  content: "In a variety of conferencing scenarios, a local communication channel\nis
    desirable for conference-related information exchange between co-\nlocated but
    otherwise independent application entities, for example\nthose taking part in
    application sessions that belong to the same\nconference.  In loosely coupled
    conferences such a mechanism allows\nfor coordination of applications entities
    to e.g. implement\nsynchronization between media streams or to configure entities\nwithout
    user interaction. It can also be used to implement tightly\ncoupled conferences
    enabling a conference controller to enforce\nconference wide control within a
    end system.\nThis document defines application scenarios and requirements for
    a\ncoordination infrastructure that provides local coordination within a\nconferencing
    end system.\nThis document is intended for discussion in the Multiparty Multimedia\nSession
    Control (MMUSIC) working group of the Internet Engineering\nTask Force.  Comments
    are solicited and should be addressed to the\nworking group's mailing list at
    confctrl@isi.edu and/or the authors.\n\t "

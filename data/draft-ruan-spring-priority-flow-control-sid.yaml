- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   To address the issue of lossless transmission for cross-data center\n
    \  services, the PFC (Priority-based Flow Control) mechanism can be\n   extended
    to wide-area networks (WANs) to solve packet loss caused by\n   network congestion
    and the problem of backpressure signal\n   transmission between WAN and RoCEv2
    network in data centers.\n\n   By leveraging SRv6 and slicing technologies, it
    is possible to\n   effectively control the propagation range and path of PFC\n
    \  backpressure signals in wide-area networks, thereby avoiding issues\n   such
    as deadlocks and the excessive propagation of congestion scope.\n\n   PFC is a
    hop-by-hop mechanism.  Given that most current WAN devices\n   do not support
    PFC function, this document proposes defining a new\n   type of SRv6 SID End.X.PFC
    to indicate the PFC-capable interface in\n   the WAN network.\n\n\t "

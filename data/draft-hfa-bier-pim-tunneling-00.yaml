  content: "   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n   provides
    multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n   requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain multicast related per-flow\n   state.  Neither does BIER require
    an explicit tree-building protocol\n   for its operation.  A multicast data packet
    enters a BIER domain at a\n   \"Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router\" (BFIR), and leaves
    the BIER domain at\n   one or more \"Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers\" (BFERs).
    \ The BFIR router\n   adds a BIER header to the packet.  Such header contains
    a bit-string\n   in which each bit represents exactly one BFER to forward the
    packet\n   to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be\n   forwarded
    is expressed by the according set of bits switched on in\n   BIER packet header.\n\n
    \  This document describes the procedure needed for PIM to be tunneled\n   through
    a BIER core. Allowing access CEs or PEs to run traditional\n   PIM multicast services
    including draft rosen multicast MVPN through a\n   core of BIER.\n\n\n\t "

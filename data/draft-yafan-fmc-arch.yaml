- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an architecture framework for achieving\nconverged
    mobile services across alternative radio access networks\n(GAN, or Generic Access
    Network), such as WLAN, WiMax, and the\ncellular network, while utilizing SIP
    for media session control\nbetween the dual mode handset (DMH) and a network SIP
    proxy.  The key\nbenefits of this architecture include (1) fast and flexible service\ndeployment
    in the IP domain, and (2) allow seamless voice call\ncontinuity services across
    IP and circuit-switched cellular domains.\n\n\t "

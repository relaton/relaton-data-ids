abstract:
- content: "<p>Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise to a slew
    of performance issues. These performance issues can be addressed by some form
    of Active Queue Management (AQM), optionally in combination with a packet scheduling
    scheme such as fair queuing. The IETF AQM and packet scheduling working group
    was formed to standardize AQM schemes that are robust, easily implemented, and
    successfully deployed in today's networks. This document describes various criteria
    for performing precautionary characterizations of AQM proposals. This document
    also helps in ascertaining whether any given AQM proposal should be taken up for
    standardization by the AQM WG.</p>"

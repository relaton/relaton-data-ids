  script: Latn
  content: "The SIP protocol defines a role for proxy servers which can forward\nrequests
    to multiple contacts associated with a specific resource or\nperson.  While each
    of these contacts is expected to send a response\nof some kind, responses for
    each branch are not necessarily sent back\nto the original requester.  The proxy
    server forwards only the \"best\"\nfinal response back to the original request.
    \ This behavior causes a\nsituation known as the Herterogeneous Error Response
    Forking Problem\n(HERFP) in which the original requester has no opportunity to
    see or\nfix a variety of potentially repairable errors.  This document\ndescribes
    a backwards compatible solution to the HERFP problem for\nINVITE transactions.\n\n\t "

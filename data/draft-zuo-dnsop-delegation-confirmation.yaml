- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Delegation occurs when an NS record is added in the parent zone for\n
    \  the child origin.  In the current DNS delegation mechanism, a\n   delegated
    zone/child zone (see Section1.1 for definition of delegated\n   zone) can specify
    any NS records at the zone apex without requiring\n   confirmation from the zone
    maintaining Glue records of the NS record.\n   Recently, new types of attacks
    that exploit this flaw have been\n   discovered.  This draft suggests a protocol-level
    solution for DNS\n   delegation confirmation to reduce the risk of these attacks.\n\n\t "

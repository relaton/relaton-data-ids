  content: "Although there are many perceived benefits to Network Address\n   Translation
    (NAT), the primary benefit of \"amplifying\" available\n   address space is not
    needed in IPv6.  In addition to its many serious\n   disadvantages there is a
    perception that other benefits exist, such\n   as a variety of management and
    security reasons that could be useful\n   for an Internet Protocol.  IPv6 does
    not support NAT by design and\n   this document shows how Network Architecture
    Protection (NAP) using\n   IPv6 can provide the benefits without the need for
    NAT.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an operational technique that uses BGP communities
    to remotely trigger black-holing of a particular destination network to block
    denial-of-service attacks.  Black-holing can be applied on a selection of routers
    rather than all BGP-speaking routers in the network.  The document also describes
    a sinkhole tunnel technique using BGP communities and tunnels to pull traffic
    into a sinkhole router for analysis.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

  content: "   We observe that attacks against HTTPS are getting more and more\n   popular.
    \ The attacks typically exploit weaknesses in PKI certificate\n   verification
    software.  These weaknesses allow a third party to\n   insert itself as a Man-In-The-Middle
    in a TLS connection, accessing\n   the content of messages that were previously
    encrypted and in some\n   case changing these messages.\n\n   TLS over HTTP allows
    clients and servers to carry a TLS conversation\n   on top of HTTP, and thus bypass
    the man-in-the-middle attackers.\n   Different deployment models are possible,
    e.g., HTTP over TLS over\n   HTTP, application-layer-protocol over TLS over HTTP,
    or HTTP over TLS\n   over HTTP over TLS.\n\n   The proposed solution allows for
    reuse of the existing TLS\n   implementation, thus minimizing the development
    costs and risks.  It\n   includes an optional obfuscation layer, to maximize the
    likelihood of\n   working unnoticed by firewalls and other MITM boxes.\n\n\t "

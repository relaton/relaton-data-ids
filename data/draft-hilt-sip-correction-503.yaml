  content: "Overload occurs in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) when SIP\n   servers
    have insufficient resources to process all SIP messages they\n   receive.  The
    SIP protocol specified in RFC 3261 provides the 503\n   (Service Unavailable)
    response code as a remedy for servers under\n   overload.  However, the current
    definition of 503 (Service\n   Unavailable) has problems and can in fact amplify
    an overload\n   condition.  This document proposes an essential correction to
    RFC\n   3261 that avoids these problems and helps SIP servers to better cope\n
    \  with overload.\n\t "

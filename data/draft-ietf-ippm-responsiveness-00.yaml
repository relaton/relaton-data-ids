  content: "   For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called lag,\n   latency,
    or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but\n   common symptom
    in today's networks.  Even after a decade of work on\n   standardizing technical
    solutions, it remains a common problem for\n   the end users.\n\n   Everyone \"knows\"
    that it is \"normal\" for a video conference to have\n   problems when somebody
    else at home is watching a 4K movie or\n   uploading photos from their phone.
    \ However, there is no technical\n   reason for this to be the case.  In fact,
    various queue management\n   solutions (fq_codel, cake, PIE) have solved the problem.\n\n
    \  Our networks remain unresponsive, not from a lack of technical\n   solutions,
    but rather a lack of awareness of the problem.  We believe\n   that creating a
    tool whose measurement matches people's every day\n   experience will create the
    necessary awareness, and result in a\n   demand for products that solve the problem.\n\n
    \  This document specifies the \"RPM Test\" for measuring responsiveness.\n   It
    uses common protocols and mechanisms to measure user experience\n   especially
    when the network is under working conditions.  The\n   measurement is expressed
    as \"Round-trips Per Minute\" (RPM) and should\n   be included with throughput
    (up and down) and idle latency as\n   critical indicators of network quality.\n\n\t "

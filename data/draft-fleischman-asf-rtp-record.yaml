  content: "This document specifies two approaches by which multimedia data (e.g.,\nMBone
    conferences), transmitted using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP), may\nbe recorded
    to Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) files. The first method\nrequires a minimum
    amount of buffering at the recording station but\nresults in recordings which
    identically preserve the received content\nincluding out of order packets, network
    ''jitter'', etc. The second\napproach requires buffering at the recording station
    but results in\nenhanced recordings (i.e., higher percentage of correctly ordered\npackets,
    elimination of a percentage of received jitter, potential\nrecovery of a percentage
    of lost packets). Both approaches record all\nreceived RTP content and the relevant
    subset of RTCP information. This\nrecording occurs transparently to the MBone
    conference or RTP session,\nand does not involve any alterations to normal RTP,
    RTCP, or ASF use.\n\t "

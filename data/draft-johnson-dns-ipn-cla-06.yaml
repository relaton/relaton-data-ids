  content: "   Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are typically characterized by high\n
    \  latency and lack of constant end to end connectivity, consistent with\n   their
    use in deep space communications.  This, however, is not the\n   limit of application
    of Bundle Protocol (BP) and related DTN enabling\n   technologies.  Through a
    collection of Convergance Layer Adapters\n   (CLAs), deployment overlaying the
    terrestrial Internet is a core\n   component of DTN implementations.  IPN is a
    integer based naming\n   scheme for DTN networks.  Notwithstanding cryptographic\n
    \  considerations, three basic components are necessary to enable a BP\n   node
    to use the underlying Internet to communicate with another BP\n   node: the IP
    address of the node, the CBHE Node Number (component of\n   any ipn-scheme URI
    identifying a BP endpoint of which that node is a\n   member), and the CLA which
    provides IP connectivity to that node.\n   This document describes RRTYPE additions
    to DNS to enable terrestrial\n   BP resource look-up.\n\n\t "

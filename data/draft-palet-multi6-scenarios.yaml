  content: "   Multihoming seems to be one of the key pieces for the deployment of\n
    \  IPv6 in the enterprise scenario, but is becoming a frequent\n   requirement
    in all kinds of networks.  In addition, other factors\n   including the deployment
    of broadband networks, the increase in the\n   variety of access technologies,
    the increase in the demand for\n   resilience/redundancy, etc., in non-enterprise
    environments, for\n   example in SOHO/home, necessarily imply the increase of
    IPv6\n   multihoming demand for a number of scenarios, which are described in\n
    \  this memo.\n\t "

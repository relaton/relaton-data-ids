  content: "   This document specifies Linearized Matrix (LM).  LM is an extensible\n
    \  protocol for interoperability between messaging providers, using\n   Matrix's
    (matrix.org (https://matrix.org)) decentralized room model.\n   LM simplifies
    the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) persistence of Matrix\n   while maintaining compatibility
    with non-linearized servers within a\n   room.  It does this by using a doubly-linked
    list of events/messages\n   per room with hub and spoke fanout.\n\n   LM's extensibility
    enables a wide range of transport protocol and\n   end-to-end encryption possibilities.
    \ This document uses Matrix's\n   room access control semantics supported by Messaging
    Layer Security\n   (MLS), transported via HTTPS and JSON.  The details of which
    server-\n   to-server transport to use and what is put over MLS are replaceable.\n\n
    \  The threat model of LM does not place trust in a central owning\n   server
    for each conversation.  Instead, it defines a hub server which\n   handles maintaining
    linearized room history for other servers in the\n   room.  This model permits
    transparent interconnection between LM\n   servers and Matrix servers, in the
    same room.\n\n\t "

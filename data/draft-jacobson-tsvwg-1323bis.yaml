  content: "This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performance\nover
    large bandwidth*delay product paths and to provide reliable\noperation over very
    high-speed paths.  It defines new TCP options for\nscaled windows and timestamps,
    which are designed to provide\ncompatible interworking with TCP's that do not
    implement the\nextensions.  The timestamps are used for two distinct mechanisms:\nRTTM
    (Round Trip Time Measurement) and PAWS (Protect Against Wrapped\nSequences).  Selective
    acknowledgments are not included in this memo.\nThis memo updates and obsoletes
    RFC-1323, a Proposed Standard, with\nsmall clarifications and corrections.\n\t "

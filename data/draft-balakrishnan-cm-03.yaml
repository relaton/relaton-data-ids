  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the Congestion Manager (CM), an end-system\nmodule
    that (i) enables an ensemble of multiple concurrent flows\nfrom a sender destined
    to the same receiver and sharing the same\ncongestion properties to perform proper
    congestion avoidance and\ncontrol, and (ii) allows applications to easily adapt
    to network\ncongestion. This CM framework integrates congestion management\nacross
    all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintains\ncongestion parameters
    (available aggregate and per-flow bandwidth,\nper-receiver round-trip times, etc.)
    and exports an API that\nenables applications to learn about network characteristics,
    pass\ninformation to the CM, share congestion information with each\nother, and
    schedule data transmissions. This document focuses on\napplications and transport
    protocols with their own independent\nper-byte or per-packet sequence number information,
    and does not\nrequire modifications to the receiver protocol stack.  The\nreceiving
    application must provide feedback to the sending\napplication about received packets
    and losses, and the latter uses\nthe CM API to update CM state.  This document
    does not address\nnetworks with reservations or service discrimination.\n\t "

  content: "Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure
    network services over an insecure network.\n\n This document describes the SSH
    Connection Protocol. It provides interactive login sessions, remote execution
    of commands, forwarded TCP/IP connections, and forwarded X11 connections. All
    of these channels are multiplexed into a single encrypted tunnel.\n\n The SSH
    Connection Protocol has been designed to run on top of the SSH transport layer
    and user authentication protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

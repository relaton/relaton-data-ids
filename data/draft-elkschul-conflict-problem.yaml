  content: "   At the IETF, we currently use a set of methods to communicate a point\n
    \  of view, to solicit input, to resolve conflict and attempt to obtain\n   consensus
    within the group.  These methods include: writing an\n   Internet Draft, discussion
    on email lists, discussion at face-to-\n   face, interim or virtual meetings,
    and design teams.  At times, these\n   methods fall short.  People become entrenched
    in their positions.  A\n   Working Group may be split for a prolonged period wasting
    time and\n   energy.  There may be a lasting impact.  While the authors support\n
    \  rough consensus, the collateral damage of this process, at times can\n   be
    considerable.  This document discusses the benefits and drawbacks\n   of each
    of the current methods of communication focusing solely on\n   their efficacy
    at conflict resolution.   A companion document will\n   propose some solutions
    including alternative methods of conflict\n   resolution.\n\n\t "

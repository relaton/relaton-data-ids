  script: Latn
  content: "   The use of the OAuth 2.0 framework for container orchestration\n   systems
    poses a challenge as managing secrets, such as client_id and\n   client_secret,
    can be complex and error-prone.  Instead of manual\n   provisioning these credentials
    the industry has moved to a\n   federation-based approach where credentials of
    the underlying\n   workload platform are used as assertions towards an OAuth\n
    \  authorization server leveraging the Client Assertion Flow [RFC7521],\n   in
    particular [RFC7523].\n\n   This specification describes a meta flow in Section
    3.1, gives\n   security recommendations in Section 4 and outlines concrete patterns\n
    \  in Appendix A.\n\n\t "

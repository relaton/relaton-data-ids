  content: "Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a \nconsequence
    new equipment providing lambda switching capability has \nbeen developed and is
    currently being deployed.  RFC 3471 [RFC3471]\nhas defined that a wavelength label
    (section 3.2.1.1) \"only has \nsignificance between two neighbors\".  However,
    in a network composed \nof a new generation of lambda switch-capable equipment,
    this document \nexplains new models that require standardization of the label.
    \ It \nhighlights new operator requirements and describes signaling and \nrouting
    extensions to satisfy those requirements. \n\nThis document is a companion to
    the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label \nSwitching (GMPLS) signaling.  It defines
    the Label Switching Capable \n(LSC) technology specific information needed when
    using GMPLS.\n\t "

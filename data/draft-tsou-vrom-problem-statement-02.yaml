  content: "   TThe dynamic allocation of computing resources on a massive scale\n
    \  through the use of virtual machines to serve a large number of\n   customers
    and applications simultaneously brings a number of benefits\n   but also a number
    of challenges to data center operations.  Such\n   challenges range from acquiring
    the information needed to provision\n   the physical servers, storage and networking
    elements, through\n   accounting for resource and application usage at the user
    level.  In\n   particular, this document describes the problem of operational
    and\n   management challenges that virtualization brings in the (carrier)\n   data
    center as an enabler of new technologies such as self-\n   provisioning and elastic
    capacity and related benefits of\n   consolidation, reduced total cost of ownership,
    and energy\n   management.  This document does not cover the problem of address\n
    \  resolution in massive data centers.  It does not cover technologies\n   related
    to VDI either.\n\n\t "

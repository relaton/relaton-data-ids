  script: Latn
  content: "A proposal is made to carry Synchronous Transport Signal\n(STS-N) services
    over packetized networks, in particular over IP\nnetworks. This has the potential
    to dramatically lower the price,\nease the provisioning and grooming, and improve
    managability of\ndelivering these types of circuits.  Two proposals are put forth
    for\ndiscussion on how STS services could be transported over an IP\nnetwork.
    \ The first proposal, referred to as SPE1/IP, is to break OC-N\nsignals down into
    their STS-1 blocks, identify the SPE components and\npacketize these for transmission
    across a packet network.  The second\nproposal, referred to as STSc/IP breaks
    down the STS signal into the\nunderlying concatenated services and transports
    configurable length\nsegments of the signal to the far end of the data network.
    \ With\neither of these approaches, different STS-N services on a given port\ncan
    be connected to different ports across the network and the\nnetwork will groom
    them onto the most optimal path available.\n\t "

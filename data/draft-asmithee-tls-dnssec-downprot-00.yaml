abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft specifies a TLS extension that adds downgrade protection\n
    \  for another TLS extension, [dnssec-chain-extension].  Without the\n   downgrade
    protection specified in this TLS extension, the only effect\n   of deploying [dnssec-chain-extension]
    is to reduce TLS security from\n   the standard \"WebPKI security\" to \"WebPKI
    or DANE, whichever is\n   weaker\".\n\n   This draft dictates that [dnssec-chain-extension]
    MUST only be used\n   in combination with this TLS extension, whose only content
    is a two\n   octet SupportLifetime value.  A value of 0 prohibits the TLS client\n
    \  from unilaterally requiring ongoing use of both TLS extensions based\n   on
    prior observation of their use (pinning).  A non-zero value is the\n   value in
    hours for which this TLS extension as well as\n   [dnssec-chain-extension] MUST
    appear in subsequent TLS handshakes to\n   the same TLS hostname and port.  If
    this TLS extention or\n   [dnssec-chain-extension] is missing from the TLS handshake
    within\n   this observed pinning time, the TLS client MUST assume it is under\n
    \  attack and abort the TLS connection.\n\n\t "

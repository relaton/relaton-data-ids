  content: "This memo presents requirements in the area of accounting and access\ncontrol
    for IP multicasting.  The scope of the requirements is\nlimited to cases where
    Authentication, Accounting and Authorization\n(AAA) functions are coordinated
    between Content Provider(s) and\nNetwork Service Provider(s).\n\nIn order to describe
    the new requirements of a multi-entity Content\nDeliver System(CDS) using multicast,
    the memo presents three basic\nbusiness models: 1) the Content Provider and the
    Network Provider are\nthe same entity, 2) the Content Provider(s) and the Network\nProvider(s)
    are separate entities and users are not directly billed,\nand 3) the Content Provider(s)
    and the Network Provider(s) are\nseparate entities and users are billed based
    on content consumption\nor subscriptions.  The requirements of these three models
    are listed\nand evaluated as to which aspects are already supported by existing\ntechnologies
    and which aspects are not.\n\nGeneral requirements for accounting and admission
    control\ncapabilities including quality-of-service (QoS) related issues are\nlisted
    and the constituent logical functional components are\npresented.\n\nThis memo
    assumes that the capabilities can be realized by\nintegrating AAA functionalities
    with a multicast CDS system, with\nIGMP/MLD at the edge of the network.\n\t "

  content: "   The problems in active-active connection to TRILL campus was\n   introduced
    in [TRILL-Active-PS]. Frame duplication was a well\n   recognized issue in that
    scenario. This draft proposes a Designated\n   Forwarder (DF) mechanism to solve
    the issue of frame duplications.\n   The basic idea is to elect one RBridge per
    VLAN from an edge group\n   to be responsible for egressing the multicast frames.
    An edge group\n   is a group of edge RBridges that a CE is multi-homed to in active-\n
    \  active mode. TRILL protocol extension for DF election is described\n   in this
    draft.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   With increasing use of DLT (distributed ledger technology) systems,\n
    \  including blockchain systems and networks, for virtual assets, there is a\n
    \  need for asset-related data and metadata to traverse system boundaries\n   and
    link their respective business workflows. Systems and networks can\n   define
    and project views, or asset states, outside of their boundaries,\n   as well as
    guard them using access control policies, and external agents\n   or other systems
    can address those views in a globally unique manner.\n   Universal interoperability
    requires such systems and networks to request\n   and supply views via gateway
    nodes using a request-response protocol. The\n   endpoints of this protocol lie
    within the respective systems or in\n   networks of peer nodes, but the cross-system
    protocol occurs through the\n   systems’ respective gateways. The inter-gateway
    protocol that allows an\n   external party to request a view by an address and
    a DLT system to return\n   a view in response must be DLT-neutral and mask the
    internal\n   particularities and complexities of the DLT systems. The view generation\n
    \  and verification modules at the endpoints must obey the native consensus\n
    \  logic of their respective networks.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS
    and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation. For the case of DS records,
    "Automating DNSSEC Delegation Trust Maintenance" (RFC 7344) provides automation
    by allowing the child to publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records holding the prospective
    DS parameters which the parent can ingest. Similarly, "Child-to-Parent Synchronization
    in DNS" (RFC 7477) specifies CSYNC records to indicate a desired update of the
    delegation's NS (and glue) records. Parent-side entities (e.g., Registries and
    Registrars) can query these records from the child and, after validation, use
    them to update the parent- side Resource Record Sets (RRsets) of the delegation.
    This document specifies under which conditions the target states expressed via
    CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC records are considered "consistent". Parent-side entities
    accepting such records from the child have to ensure that update requests retrieved
    from different authoritative nameservers satisfy these consistency requirements
    before taking any action based on them. This document updates RFC 7344 and RFC
    7477.</p>

  content: "Various proposals have been made for updating the IKE protocol. This \neffort
    has been known as 'Son of IKE (SOI)'. \nOne thing that is missing from the discussion
    is an evaluation of the \nscope of SOI, identifying which problems it should solve.
    Sections of \nthis document discuss various scenarios that are considered important
    \nfor SOI. \nOnce this scoping is done, it becomes easier to specify the \nrequirements
    of the protocol. This document also discusses protocol, \npolicy and security
    requirements for SOI, along with recommendations \nfor protocol improvement in
    such areas as modularity, extensibility, \nprotocol convergence and simplicity,
    which are important regardless \nof the scope of SOI. \n    \n\n\t "

  content: "Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Network (PPVPN)[RFC4110] uses\nsome
    forms of IP tunneling schemes to tunnel VPN traffic.  Possible\ncandidates are
    GRE, IP-in-IP, IPsec and MPLS.  The candidate\ntunneling scheme should provide
    multiplexing capability, as well as\ndynamic tunnel setup and maintenance capability.
    \ Additionally,\nsecurity is required if the VPN traffic is traversing public
    Internet\nor across Service Provider domains.  Each above candidate by itself\nis
    not sufficient to meet all these requirements.  This document\ndescribes a method
    of using IPsec signaling (i.e, IKE) to setup a GRE\ntunnel.  This IPsec GRE tunnel
    may be used as the candidate tunneling\nscheme in PPVPN network or remote access
    compulsory VPN.  This\ndocument also defines a way how the Key field in GRE header
    is used\nin IPsec GRE tunnel setup.\n\t "

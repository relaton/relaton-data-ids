  content: "This memo describes some requirements that need to be taken into account
    \nwhen developing a measurement architecture for use in IP-traffic \nengineering.
    \ It looks at the methods for collecting measurement \ninformation and possible
    problems that might be encountered while doing \nso. It links the measurement
    requirements to the efforts made in other \nIETF-working groups and tries to state
    some guidelines for defining a \nformal framework to describe how measurements
    can be organised for \ntraffic engineering purposes.\n\t "

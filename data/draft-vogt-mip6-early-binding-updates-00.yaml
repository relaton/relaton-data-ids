abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The long latency associated with Mobile IPv6's home-address and\n   care-of-address
    tests can significantly impact delay-sensitive\n   applications. We propose a
    modified binding-update procedure that\n   evades the latency of both address
    tests. The modified binding update\n   runs in half, or less, of the time that
    a standard binding update\n   takes. Moreover, the modified binding update is
    nearly equivalent to\n   the standard procedure with respect to security, and
    it increases the\n   resources required at the correspondent node only marginally.
    The\n   modification is realized as an optional, and fully\n   backward-compatible,
    extension to Mobile IPv6.\n\t "

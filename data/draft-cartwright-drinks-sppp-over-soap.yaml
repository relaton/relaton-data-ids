  content: "The Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP) is an XML protocol\nthat
    exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment data\ninto Session
    Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.\nSending XML data structures
    over Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)\nand HTTP(s) is a widely used, de-facto
    standard for messaging between\nelements of provisioning systems.  Therefore the
    combination of SOAP\nand HTTP(s) as a transport for SPPP is a natural fit.  The
    obvious\nbenefits include leveraging existing industry expertise, leveraging\nexisting
    standards, and a higher probability that existing\nprovisioning systems can be
    more easily integrated with this\nprotocol.  This document describes the specification
    for transporting\nSPPP XML structures over SOAP and HTTP(s).\n\t "

  content: "   The Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) working group is\n
    \  considering protocols for an alternative congestion control protocol\n   that
    enables a delay-insensitive networking application to minimize\n   the extra queueing
    delay it causes to other applications because of\n   additional queueing at the
    bottleneck, when these connections\n   carrying traffic for such applications
    attempt to use the available\n   bandwidth.\n\n   This document proposes an architectural
    framework for LEDBAT\n   congestion control mechanisms, based on existing work
    on congestion\n   control protocols and the requirements of the LEDBAT working
    group.\n   The architectural framework consists of a LEDBAT-congestion control\n
    \  (LEDBAT-CC) suite that provides flexibility in utilizing different\n   components
    for providing congestion control for transport connections\n   carrying delay-insensitive
    traffic.  The LEDBAT-CC suite of protocols\n   is envisioned to support the multiple
    alternative mechanisms for\n   bandwidth estimation, congestion detection and
    indication and end-\n   system flow control to comprise a network friendly congestion\n
    \  avoidance protocol.\n\n   This document is inspired by the need to standardize
    the various\n   components that constitute the network friendly congestion control\n
    \  protocol to avoid having to individually standardize a multitude of\n   distinct
    and monolithic solutions.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   BGP speakers in Internet Exchange Points exchange routes with a large\n
    \  number of peers.  To reduce the burden of maintaining many sessions,\n   IXPs
    implement and administrate BGP route servers.  Route servers\n   announce to their
    clients the paths of multiple peers by using a\n   single eBGP session.  Route
    servers, however, are restricted to\n   propagating a single path per NLRI per
    eBGP session.  This constraint\n   affects the path diversity received by clients,
    which could use paths\n   that they would not have chosen, had they known all
    possible paths.\n   To overcome this limitation, we propose in this draft the
    extension\n   of ADD-PATH to eBGP peers in the context of route servers.\n\n\t "

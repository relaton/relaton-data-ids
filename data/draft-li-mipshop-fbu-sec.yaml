  content: "This specification introduces a symmetric cryptography mechanism for\nprotecting
    signaling messages between the Mobile Node and previous\nAccess Router for Fast
    Mobile IPv6.  The method defined here utilizes\nthe Master Session Key(MSK) generated
    from EAP authentication to\nderive a fast handover key between the Mobile Node
    and the Access\nRouter in order to avoid certain attacks.  This mechanism also
    adopts\nthe Mobile Node Identifier option and the mobility message\nauthentication
    option to the FMIPv6 signaling messages.\n\t "

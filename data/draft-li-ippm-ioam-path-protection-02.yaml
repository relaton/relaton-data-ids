  content: "   In-band operation and maintenance management (IOAM, In-band OAM), as\n
    \  a network performance monitoring technology, is based on the\n   principle
    of path-associated detection to perform specific field\n   marking/coloring and
    identification on actual service flows, and\n   perform packet loss and delay
    measurement.  It can quickly perceive\n   network performance-related faults,
    and accurately delimit boundaries\n   and do troubleshooting.  However, the current
    IOAM solution has\n   shortcomings too.  For example, after the service traffic
    path\n   switching, the IOAM cannot continue working.  This paper proposes a\n
    \  scheme to achieve automatic performance monitoring through service\n   path
    switching and linkage with IOAM, which enhances the feasibility\n   of the IOAM
    scheme in large-scale deployment and the completeness of\n   IOAM technology.\n\n\t "

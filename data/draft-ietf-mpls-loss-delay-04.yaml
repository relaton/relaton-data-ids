abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the ability
    to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss and one-way and two-way
    delay, as well as related metrics such as delay variation and channel throughput.
    \ This measurement capability also provides operators with greater visibility
    into the performance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning,
    troubleshooting, and network performance evaluation.  This document specifies
    protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of these
    performance metrics in MPLS networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

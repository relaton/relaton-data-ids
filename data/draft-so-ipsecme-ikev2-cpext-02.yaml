  content: "   IPSec IKEv2, RFC 5996 [RFC5996], has been adopted by many\n   standardized
    network solutions to provide the secure transport\n   between network elements
    over third party's infrastructure.  For\n   example, the emerging Fixed Mobile
    Convergence (FMC) network solution\n   that involves Femtocell deployment requires
    the mobile operator's\n   Femtocell AP to leverage the IPSec IKEv2 to support
    mutual\n   authentication and remote IP address configuration as well as other\n
    \  auto configuration support over the broadband fixed network (BBF) of\n   which
    the mobile and fixed networks may be operated by two different\n   operators.\n\n
    \  Most of today broadband fixed networks are still relying on the IPv4\n   private
    addressing plan to support its attached devices including the\n   mobile operator's
    Femtocell AP.  Hence, the private IPv4 addressing\n   and Network Address and
    Port Translation (NA(P)T) support mostly\n   likely stays for many years to come.\n\n
    \  In FMC interworking scenario, there is a need for the mobile network\n   to
    pass on it mobile subscribers' policies to the broadband fixed\n   network (BBF)
    to maintain the service level agreement (SLA) and to\n   support remote network
    management. In addition, a broadband fixed\n   network (BBF) may partnership with
    more than one mobile operator.\n   Therefore it is important for the BBF and the
    mobile network to be\n   able to overcome the limitation of the private IPv4 addressing
    and to\n   be able to identify the user's subscription as well as to determine\n
    \  the location of the Femtocell AP that serves its mobile user over the\n   BBF
    network.\n\n   This document presents the problems for the IPSec tunneling support\n
    \  with private IPv4 addressing for FMC interworking and proposes a\n   simple
    extension to the IKEv2 to resolve the issues.\n\n\t "

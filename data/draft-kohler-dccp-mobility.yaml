  content: "This document describes a mechanism by which the set of addresses\n    bound
    to an application-level Datagram Congestion Control Protocol\n    (DCCP) connection
    [RFC4340] can change over that connection's\n    lifetime.  The essential abstraction
    is the Generalized Connection,\n    which combines multiple distinct transport-level
    DCCP connections\n    into a single application-level entity.\n\t "

  content: "Networks and network applications must be robust and reliable.  For\nmany
    applications and services, such as packetized voice, correcting a\nfailure must
    be almost instantaneous.  The first step in correcting a\nfailure is, of course,
    detecting that it occurred.  IP routing\nprotocols and signaling protocols as
    well as many application layer\nprotocols incorporate their own keepalive mechanisms
    to detect\nfailures.  Typically, these protocols detect failures on the order
    of\nseconds or tens of seconds.  While there are some physical and link\nlayer
    technologies that inherently supply link outage detection, not\nall link layers
    do this.  In order to provide for fast failure\ndetection over any type of lower
    layer, an IP layer fast keepalive\nprotocol can be used.  This draft describes
    such a protocol for quickly\ndetecting when a network layer interface of a peer
    has failed.\n\n\n\t "

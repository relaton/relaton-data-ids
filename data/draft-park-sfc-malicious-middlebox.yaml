  content: "   This document addresses problems caused by malicious middleboxes and\n
    \  proposes a scheme that can detect them in Service Function Chaining\n   (SFC)
    by combining two mechanisms: direct and indirect.  The direct\n   mechanism injects
    a tool into the middleboxes to observe and report\n   the state of each middlebox.
    \ In contrast, the indirect mechanism\n   creates a probe service chain, which
    includes trustful middleboxes,\n   to investigate the operation of other middleboxes
    in the network.\n\n\t "

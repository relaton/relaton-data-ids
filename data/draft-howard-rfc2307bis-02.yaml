abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a mechanism for mapping entities related to\n
    \  TCP/IP and the UNIX system [UNIX] into [X.500] entries so that they\n   may
    be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n   [RFC4511].  A set
    of attribute types and object classes are proposed,\n   along with specific guidelines
    for interpreting them.  The intention\n   is to assist the deployment of LDAP
    as an organizational nameservice.\n   No proposed solutions are intended as standards
    for the Internet.\n   Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge
    as to the\n   appropriate solution to such problems, leading eventually to the\n
    \  adoption of standards.  The proposed mechanism has already been\n   implemented
    with some success.\n\t "

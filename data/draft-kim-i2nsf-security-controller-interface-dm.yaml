  content: "   This document defines an information model and a YANG data model for\n
    \  the Security Controller-Facing Interface between two security\n   controllers
    in an Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF)\n   framework located in
    different Domains.  This interface is used for\n   the exchange of IPsec flow
    protection to protect the IP Communication\n   between two Network Security Functions
    (NSFs) in cross-domain\n   environments.  The YANG data model in this document
    is built on the\n   basis of the YANG data model for IPsec flow protection based
    on\n   Software-Defined Networking (SDN).\n\n\t "

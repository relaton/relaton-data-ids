  content: "   Model-driven service and network management provides a programmatic\n
    \  and standard-based approach for representing (virtual) services or\n   networks
    and configuration to the network device that are used to\n   build and deliver
    the service.  Models can be used at various phases\n   of service and network
    management life cycle such as service\n   instantiation, service provisionning,
    optimization, monitoring, and\n   diagnostic.  Also, models can be designed to
    automate network\n   management and provide closed-loop control for the sake of
    adaptive\n   and deterministic service creation, delivery, and maintenance.\n\n
    \  This document provides a framework that describes and discusses an\n   architecture
    for service and network management automation with YANG\n   modeling technologies.
    \ An applicability of YANG data models to\n   automation of virtualized network
    service is also investigated.\n\n   The document aims to exemplify an approach
    to illustrate the journey\n   from technology-agnostic services to technology-specific
    actions.\n\n\t "

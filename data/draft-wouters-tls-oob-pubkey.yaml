  content: "   This document specifies a new TLS certificate type for exchanging raw\n
    \  public keys in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport\n   Layer
    Security (DTLS) for use with out-of-band authentication.\n   Currently, TLS authentication
    can only occur via PKIX or OpenPGP\n   certificates.  By specifying a minimum
    resource for raw public key\n   exchange, implementations can use alternative
    authentication methods.\n\n   One such method is using DANE Resource Records secured
    by DNSSEC,\n   Another use case is to provide authentication functionality when
    used\n   with devices in a constrained environment that use whitelists and\n   blacklists,
    as is the case with sensors and other embedded devices\n   that are constrained
    by memory, computational, and communication\n   limitations where the usage of
    PKIX is not feasible.\n\n   The new certificate type specified can also be used
    to reduce the\n   latency of a TLS client that is already in possession of a validated\n
    \  public key of the TLS server before it starts a (non-resumed) TLS\n   handshake.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In this document, the mapping mechanism between the logical and\n   physical
    topology of collective communication is analysed in In-\n   Network Computing(INC)
    enabled network, as well as the impact of\n   topology-aware collective communication
    algorithms on INC enabled\n   large-scale computing clusters.  Requirements are
    also proposed to\n   design efficient mapping mechanism between logical and physical\n
    \  topology and topology-aware collective communication algorithms.\n\n\t "

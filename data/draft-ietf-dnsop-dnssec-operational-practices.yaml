  content: "This document describes a set of practices for operating the DNS with
    security extensions (DNSSEC). The target audience is zone administrators deploying
    DNSSEC.\n\n The document discusses operational aspects of using keys and signatures
    in the DNS. It discusses issues of key generation, key storage, signature generation,
    key rollover, and related policies.\n\n This document obsoletes RFC 2541, as it
    covers more operational ground and gives more up-to-date requirements with respect
    to key sizes and the new DNSSEC specification. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   This memo proposes to advance a performance metric RFC along the\n
    \  standards track, specifically RFC 2680 on One-way Loss Metrics.\n   Observing
    that the metric definitions themselves should be the\n   primary focus rather
    than the implementations of metrics, this memo\n   describes the test procedures
    to evaluate specific metric requirement\n   clauses to determine if the requirement
    has been interpreted and\n   implemented as intended.  Two completely independent
    implementations\n   have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2680.\n\n
    \  In this version, the results are presented in the R-tool output form.\n   Beautification
    is future work.\n\n\n\t "

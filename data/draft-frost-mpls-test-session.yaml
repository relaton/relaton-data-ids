  content: "   RFC 6374 defines procedures for packet loss and throughput\n   measurement
    in MPLS networks.  Some forms of measurement rely on the\n   existence of a stream
    of test messages that flows between measurement\n   points, from which the loss
    and throughput characteristics of the\n   underlying data channel are inferred.
    \ This document presents\n   procedures for the establishment and maintenance
    of such test\n   sessions.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>OAuth 2.0 for First-Party Applications (FiPA) [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps]
    defined a native OAuth 2.0 *direct interaction*, whereby clients call authorization
    server's _Native Authorization Endpoint_ as an HTTP REST API, whose response instructs
    client what information to collect from end-user to satisfy authorization server's
    policies and requirements. While FiPA [I-D.ietf-oauth-first-party-apps] focused
    on a one-to-one relationship between client and authorization server, this document
    is an *extension profile* adding support for authorization servers to federate
    the interaction to a downstream authorization server, instruct collection of additional
    information from users to guide request routing or instruct the usage of another
    native app for user interaction.</p>"

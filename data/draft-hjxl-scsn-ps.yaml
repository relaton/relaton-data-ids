  content: "   With the wide deployment of 4G and beyond mobile networks, a great\n
    \  number of cells need high precision frequency and/or time\n   synchronization
    for their normal operation. It is crucial to\n   configure and manage the synchronization
    network in a scalable way,\n   and simplify the monitoring and operation for synchronization\n
    \  networks. This document analyzes the use cases and requirements in\n   synchronization
    networks, and provides a problem statement for\n   scalable synchronization networks.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) mechanism is commonly\n
    \  employed to mitigate attack vectors based on forged ICMPv6 Router\n   Advertisement
    messages.  Many existing IPv6 deployments rely on RA-\n   Guard as the first line
    of defense against the aforementioned attack\n   vectors.  However, some implementations
    of RA-Guard have been found\n   to be prone to circumvention by employing IPv6
    Extension Headers.\n   This document describes the evasion techniques that affect
    the\n   aforementioned implementations, and provides advice on the\n   implementation
    of RA-Guard, such that the RA-Guard evasion vectors\n   are eliminated.\n\n\t "

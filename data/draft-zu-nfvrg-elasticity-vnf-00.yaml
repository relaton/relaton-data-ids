  content: "   This draft is an analytic of NFV applications based on the NFV\n   architecture,
    use cases and requirements. The purpose of this\n   analytic is to identify any
    NFV characteristics related issues. The\n   analytic is focusing on elasticity
    VNF with predicable performance,\n   reliability and security. Only the issues
    which are unique to NFV\n   are discussed in this document.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Current mobility solutions generally introduce an anchor point in the\nnetwork,
    e.g., HA in MIPv6, LMA in PMIPv6, GGSN in 3GPP.  The anchor\npoint is used to
    maintain the mapping between the stable IP address\n(e.g., Home address in MIPv6)
    and the current routable IP address\n(e.g., CoA in MIPv6).  However, one of the
    trend in mobile network\nevolution is to \"flatten\" mobility architecture by
    confining mobility\nsupport in the access network, e.g. at the access routers
    level,\nkeeping the rest of the network unaware of the mobility events and\ntheir
    support.  This document discusses the deployment of current IP\nmobility mechanisms
    in such a flat architecture.\n\t "

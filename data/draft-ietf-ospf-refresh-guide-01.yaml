  content: "OSPF, an IGP widely deployed in IP networks today, requires each LSA\nto
    be refreshed by the originating router every 30 minutes.  This\nmethod increases
    the protocol's robustness and solves potential\nproblems that may be caused by
    software bugs, as well as some\nproperties of the protocol itself. Though OSPF
    expects each LSA to be\nrefreshed independently, ABRs and ASBRs tend to originate
    Type 3/4/5\nLSAs within a short period of time, thus causing periodical network\nresource
    exhaustion by LSA refreshments.  This document discusses the\ntechniques that
    can be used to remedy this problem and provide smooth\nprotocol operation. It
    must be noted that discussed methods can be\napplied to other link-state routing
    protocols, such as IS-IS.\n\t "

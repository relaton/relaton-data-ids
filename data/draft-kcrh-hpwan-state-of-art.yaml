  content: "   High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WANs) represent a critical\n
    \  infrastructure for the modern global Research and Education (R&E)\n   community,
    facilitating collaboration across national and\n   international boundaries.  These
    networks include global education\n   and research networks, such as GÉANT, Internet2,
    Janet, ESnet,\n   CANARIE, CERNET, and others, and also refer to large scale commercial\n
    \  dedicated networks built by hyperscalers and operators.  They are\n   designed
    to support the ever-growing transmission of vast amounts of\n   data generated
    by scientific research, high-performance computing,\n   distributed AI-training
    and large-scale simulations.\n\n   This document provides an overview of the terminology
    and techniques\n   used for existing HP-WANs.  It also explores the technological\n
    \  advancements, operational tools, and future directions for HP-WANs,\n   emphasising
    their role in enabling cutting-edge scientific research,\n   AI training and massive
    R&E data analysis.\n\n\t "

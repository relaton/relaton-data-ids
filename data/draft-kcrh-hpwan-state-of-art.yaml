abstract:
- content: "<p>High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WANs) represent a critical
    infrastructure for the modern global Research and Education (R&amp;E) community,
    facilitating collaboration across national and international boundaries. These
    networks include global education and research networks, such as GÃ‰ANT, Internet2,
    Janet, ESnet, CANARIE, CERNET, and others, and also refer to large scale commercial
    dedicated networks built by hyperscalers and operators. They are designed to support
    the ever-growing transmission of vast amounts of data generated by scientific
    research, high-performance computing, distributed AI-training and large-scale
    simulations. This document provides an overview of the terminology and techniques
    used for existing HP-WANs. It also explores the technological advancements, operational
    tools, and future directions for HP-WANs, emphasising their role in enabling cutting-edge
    scientific research, AI training and massive R&amp;E data analysis.</p>"

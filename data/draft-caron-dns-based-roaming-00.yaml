  content: "To achieve global roaming, that is, allow any client of any service \nprovider
    (the home network) to use the facilities of any other \nnetwork provider (the
    foreign network), it is necessary to enable \nthe foreign network to find AAA
    facilities able to handle requests \nfor those users, based on the NAI provided.
    This document documents \nsuch a method, based on DNS. \n\n\t "

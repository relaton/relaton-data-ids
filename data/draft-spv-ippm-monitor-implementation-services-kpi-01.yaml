  content: "   We are using a new method to calculate services KPIs and metrics in\n
    \  the network using TWAMP protocol.  This draft outlines the\n   implementation
    of the service KPIs and there use cases in the service\n   plane in the network.
    \ The KPIs discussed in this draft include\n   Service Latency and Application
    Liveliness detection.\n\n   Service latency is defined as the time spent by the
    packet when it is\n   injected in the service module or service card till the
    time,\n   serviced packet is received back by the TWAMP server.  TWAMP server\n
    \  records the timestamp of the packet when it is injected into the\n   service
    module and then again record the timestamp when it receives\n   the packet afer
    service is applied in the data plane.\n\n   Application Liveliness detection means
    whether the application is up\n   and running in the network.  In case you want
    to monitor the http\n   application or the dns server and verify if they are up
    and running,\n   this method is applicable.  The implementation can be used for\n
    \  liveliness detection of any service in the network.\n\n\t "

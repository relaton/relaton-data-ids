abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebRTC use-cases and related requirements are defined in [draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements]
    that contains browser to browser use-cases and browser-GW/server use-cases (e.g.,
    telephony terminal). In the use-case of telephony terminal, it is necessary for
    telephony terminal to be able to attest his identity to the telephony operator.
    Unlike the current authentication specified in [draft-ietf-rtcweb-security] such
    as PKI based authentication and web based peer authentication WebRTC communication
    is directly controlled by the telephony operator, which poses new authentication
    methods, including re-using existence authentication mechanism of telephony operator
    and authentication by using web credentials. This document presents the security
    authentication of WebRTC communication for telephony terminal.</p>"

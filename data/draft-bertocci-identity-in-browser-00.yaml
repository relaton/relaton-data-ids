  content: "   This informational document aims to gather in a single place all the\n
    \  most important scenarios in which identity protocols in current use\n   leverage
    web browser features to achieve their goals and deliver\n   their intended user
    experience.  The purpose of compiling this\n   scenario collection is to make
    it easier for the identity community\n   to engage with the browser vendors, and
    in particular to preserve (or\n   enhance) user experience and expressive power
    of the identity\n   protocols in mainstream use as browsers introduce new privacy\n
    \  preserving restrictions and new identity tailored features.  By\n   providing
    a single artifact, listing scenarios in a consistent\n   format, we hope to anchor
    the conversation on concrete outcomes and\n   impact of changes on end users,
    developers, providers and in general\n   everyone contributing to identity in
    the industry.\n\n\t "

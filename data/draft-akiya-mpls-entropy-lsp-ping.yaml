  content: "   The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP)\n
    \  Ping and Traceroute are used to exercise specific paths of Equal-Cost\n   Multipath
    (ECMP).  When LSP is signaled to use Entropy Label (EL)\n   described in RFC6790,
    the ability for LSP Ping and Traceroute\n   operation to discover and exercise
    ECMP paths has been lost in\n   scenarios which LSRs apply deviating load balance
    techniques.  One\n   such scenario is when some LSRs apply EL based load balancing
    while\n   other LSRs apply non-EL based load balancing (ex: IP).  Another\n   scenario
    is when EL based LSP is stitched with another LSP which can\n   be EL based or
    non-EL based.\n\n   This document extends the MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute mechanisms
    to\n   restore the ability of exercising specific paths of ECMP over LSP\n   which
    make use of Entropy Label.  This document updates RFC4379,\n   RFC6424 and RFC6790.\n\n\n\t "

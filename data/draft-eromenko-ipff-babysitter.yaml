  content: "   Babysitter is a form of an advanced NAT, mostly for desktop clients.\n
    \  It gives mixed IP-FF and IPv4 clients access to IPv4-only Internet.\n   It
    is somewhat resembling NAT64 + DNS64 combo, and will aid during\n   transition
    period.\n\n   Assumption: We work on IPv4-only Internet, but we want to implement\n
    \  both IP-FF and IPv4 hosts inside our organization, so nodes can work\n   between
    themselves with, and take advantage of, IP-FF, but still\n   able to connect to
    the Internet.\n   If/when this assumption is invalid, and end-to-end IP-FF becomes\n
    \  commonplace, other forms of connection should be used,\n   and babysitter may
    be disabled.\n\n\n\n\t "

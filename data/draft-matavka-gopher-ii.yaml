  content: "   The Gopher protocol is over twenty years old.  Changing practices and\n
    \  unofficial extensions have caused Gopher as currently used to differ,\n   but
    remain largely compatible with, the technical specifications\n   first established
    in its first informational document, *The Internet\n   Gopher Protocol (a distributed
    document search and retrieval\n   protocol)*, known as *RFC 1436*.  Therefore,
    this document attempts\n   to establish a contemporary specification of the Gopher\n
    \  communications protocol, departing as little as possible from current\n   practice.\n\n\t "

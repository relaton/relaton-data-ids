  content: "   The Intelligent Use Task Force (IUTF) has responsibility for\n   organizing
    Dedicated Interest Groups (DIG) to research, document and\n   validate solutions
    in the area of Intelligent Use Interfaces (IUI)\n   between the various components
    of the whole digital ecosystem (WDE),\n   the resulting intelligent global network
    (IGNet), the diversity of\n   on-line facilitation services that their IUI and
    IGNet may bring to\n   people and machines. This document describes the guidelines
    and\n   procedures for the formation, operations, experimentations and\n   publications
    of IUTF Dedicated Interest Groups and their internal and\n   external relations
    with other SDOs (Standardization and Documentation\n   Organizations). Its publication
    as an IETF Draft is part of the IUCG\n   liaison.\n\n\n\n\t "

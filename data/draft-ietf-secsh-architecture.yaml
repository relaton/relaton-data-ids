  content: "The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol is a protocol for secure remote login
    and other secure network services over an insecure network.  This document describes
    the architecture of the SSH protocol, as well as the notation and terminology
    used in SSH protocol documents.  It also discusses the SSH algorithm naming system
    that allows local extensions.  The SSH protocol consists of three major components:
    The Transport Layer Protocol provides server authentication, confidentiality,
    and integrity with perfect forward secrecy.  The User Authentication Protocol
    authenticates the client to the server.  The Connection Protocol multiplexes the
    encrypted tunnel into several logical channels.  Details of these protocols are
    described in separate documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

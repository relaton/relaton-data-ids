  content: "   In the past Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used very\n
    \  rigid policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol and\n   platform.
    \ As MAC systems are more widely deployed additional\n   flexibility in mechanism
    and policy is required.  Where traditional\n   trusted systems implemented Multi-Level
    Security (MLS) and integrity\n   models, modern systems have expanded to include
    technologies such as\n   type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of policies
    and mechanisms\n   it has proven through past efforts to be virtually impossible
    to\n   accomodate all parties in one security label format and model.\n\n   To
    allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats in a network, this\n   document
    proposes a registry of label format specifications.  This\n   registry contains
    several identifiers to accomodate both integer and\n   string preferences and
    associates those identifiers with an extensive\n   document outlining the exact
    syntax and use of the particular label\n   format.\n\n\t "

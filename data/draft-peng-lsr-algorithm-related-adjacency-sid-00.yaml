  content: "   Segment Routing architecture supports the use of multiple routing\n
    \  algorithms, i.e, different constraint-based shortest-path\n   calculations
    can be supported.  There are two standard algorithms:\n   SPF and Strict-SPF,
    defined in Segment Routing architecture.  There\n   are also other user defined
    algorithms according to Flex-algo\n   applicaiton.  However, an algorithm identifier
    is often included as\n   part of a Prefix-SID advertisement, that maybe not satisfy
    some\n   scenarios where multiple algorithm share the same link resource.\n   This
    document will complement that the algorithm identifier can be\n   also included
    as part of a Adjacency-SID advertisement\n\n\t "

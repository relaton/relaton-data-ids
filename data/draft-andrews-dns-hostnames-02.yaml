abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "At the protocol level, DNS domain names and records may contain arbitrary
    binary data.  However, many domain names and records are, or refer to, hostnames,
    which are restricted by RFCs 952 and 1123 to contain only certain characters.
    Similar restrictions apply to mail domain names, RFC-821. This document identifies
    the types of domain names and records which are hostnames / mail domain names,
    and specifies the circumstances under which validation checks should be performed
    within the class IN.\n\t "

  content: "Available bandwidth along a path is an important metric that can be\nuseful
    to provide insight into the state and performance of the\nnetwork. Some methods
    have been proposed in literature for\nmeasurement of available bandwidth but they
    face the problems of\nscalability and high intrusiveness.  In this draft, we propose
    a\nmethod to measure path available bandwidth using an active approach\nthat probes
    the path. The probing mechanism used is based on TCP\nNew Reno. Once the samples
    for the available bandwidth measurement\nare obtained, more accurate results are
    calculated using a\nprediction filter.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes Phi-Ns, a new asymmetric cryptographic\nprimitive
    based on the structured decomposition of the quadratic gap\nbetween two primes.
    Phi-Ns defines a public key q and a private key p\nsuch that the difference q^2
    - p^2 is expressed as a composite value T.\nThe value T is then factored into
    small controlled components noted a,\nb, and R, and the final secret structure
    abR is encoded through a\nrandomized serialization process.\n\nThe security of
    Phi-Ns does not rely on integer factorization, the\ndiscrete logarithm problem,
    or elliptic curves. Instead, it depends on\nthe difficulty of recovering p from
    q when the attacker has no oracle,\nno structural anchor, and no method to determine
    whether a candidate p\nis correct. Because T can be recursively decomposed and
    reassembled into\nmultiple unpredictable forms, the resulting search space grows\ncombinatorially.\n\nPhi-Ns
    further supports recursive expansion of the internal abR\nstructure, allowing
    the construction of high-entropy secret states even\nwhen p and q have relatively
    small bit lengths. This enables compact\n\n\n\npublic keys, efficient computation,
    and strong post-quantum resistance\nbased on a non-factorization hardness assumption.\n\nThis
    document specifies the algorithmic model of Phi-Ns, its parameter\nchoices, and
    the serialization rules used to encode the abR structure.\nIt also outlines two
    public-key variants, PK-p and PK-q, which expose\neither p or q as the public
    value depending on deployment constraints.\n\n\n\t "

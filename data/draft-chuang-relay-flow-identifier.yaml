  content: "   To prevent spammers from using relay forwarding, we propose to\n   identify
    relay flows.  We do this by having relays categorize their\n   authenticated traffic
    flows and publish to receivers identifiers\n   associated with those flows.  This
    is a unique, persistent over time,\n   relay flow identifier name that is secured
    by some digital signature.\n   Receivers can use this identifier to help categorize
    traffic through\n   the relay and use that identifier to apply fine-grain anti-abuse\n
    \  policies instead of on the entire traffic through the relay.  This\n   document
    provides a specification for DKIM (RFC6376) for originating\n   traffic and ARC
    (RFC8617) for forwarded traffic.\n\n\t "

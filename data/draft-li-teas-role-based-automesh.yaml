  content: "   A Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label\n
    \  Switching Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE\n   LSPs.
    \ Routing protocol (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions facilitate\n   discovery of Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) LSR TE mesh\n   membership and automate the creation of
    a full mesh of TE Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs).\n\n   This document introduces
    a role-based TE mesh-group that applies to\n   the scenarios where full mesh TE
    LSPs are not necessary and TE LSPs\n   setup depends on the roles of LSRs in a
    TE mesh-group.  Interior\n   Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for automatic
    discovery of\n   role-based TE mesh membership are defined accordingly.\n\n\n\t "

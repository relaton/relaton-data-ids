  content: "Earlier papers and contributions identified issues of congestion control
    and failure recovery for link-state protocol networks, such as OSPF, ISIS, and
    PNNI networks [maunder, choudhury, pappalardo1, pappalardo2, atm01-0101]. The
    problem addressed is to enable link-state protocols to a) gracefully recover from
    massive loss of topology database information, and b) respond gracefully to network
    overloads and failures. This contribution proposes specific additional considerations
    for network congestion control/failure recovery.  Candidate mechanisms are proposed
    for control of network congestion and failure recovery, in particular we initially
    propose to investigate the following mechanisms:\na)      throttle new connection
    setups, topology-state updates, and Hello updates based on automatic congestion
    control mechanisms, \nb)      special marking of critical control messages (e.g.,
    Hello and\ntopology-state-update Ack) so that they may receive prioritized processing,\nc)
    \     database backup, in which a topology database could be automatically recovered
    from loss based on local backup mechanisms, and \nd)      hitless restart, which
    allows routes to continue to be used if there is an uninterrupted data path, even
    if the control path is interrupted due to a failure.\nWe propose that the OSPF
    and ISIS working groups include the candidate\nmechanisms in an evaluation of
    congestion control/failure recovery for OSPF and ISIS networks.  \n\n\t "

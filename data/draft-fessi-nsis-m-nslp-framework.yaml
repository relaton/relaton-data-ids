  content: "   Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets are increasingly\n   important
    functionalities that need to be provided in the Internet.\n   This document motivates
    and describes a framework for the path-\n   coupled configuration of Metering
    Entities to record monitoring and\n   measurement data and report it to a data
    collector.  Different\n   scenarios are described where such a path-coupled configuration
    is\n   useful.  Currently, the focus is on two scenarios: accounting and QoS\n
    \  measurement.\n\n   Moreover, this document gathers requirements for a path-coupled\n
    \  configuration protocol of Metering Entities.  Finally, the\n   applicability
    of the NSIS architecture for this purpose is discussed.\n   The protocol itself
    is specified in a separate document\n   [I-D.dressler-nsis-metering-nslp]\n\n\t "

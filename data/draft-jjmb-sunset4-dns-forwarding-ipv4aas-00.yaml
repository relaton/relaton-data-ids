  content: "   The depletion of IPv4 coupled with the wide spread deployment of IPv6\n
    \  for broadband globally is creating an environment where service\n   providers
    can seriously begin to consider alternate uses and\n   applications for native
    IPv6 connectivity.  Pervasive, reliable\n   support for IPv6 across many access
    technologies suggests that one\n   critical use for native IPv6 is the carry legacy
    IPv4 communications.\n   Today this is referred to as IPv4 as a Service (IPv4aaS).
    \ IPv4aaS\n   can leverage a variety of transports ranging from Mapping of Address\n
    \  and Ports (MAP) to Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) along with other\n   viable
    protocols.  Most every use case for IPv4aaS includes the use\n   of CG-NAT, however,
    this is not strictly required.  The purpose of\n   this document is to hone in
    on DNS specific behavior that must be\n   taken into consideration as the deployment
    of IPv4aaS advances\n   globally.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transition\nscenarios,
    where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports one\nIP version, but the
    host and Network B support a different IP\nversion.  Suppose that the host wishes
    to access a multicast group\nwhich is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document
    specifies an\napproach that combines stateful translation for signalling,\nencapsulation
    of multicast content moving between Network B and the\nhost, and native multicast
    routing in Network A to provide the host\nwith its desired access.\n\t "

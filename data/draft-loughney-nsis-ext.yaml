    \ This model is based upon a two-layer model, where there is a\n   transport layer
    and a signaling application model.  This two-layer\n   provides the ability to
    develope new signaling applications, while\n   retaining the use of a common transport
    layer.  This document will\n   serve as guidence on how the NSIS architecture
    can be extended.\n\t "

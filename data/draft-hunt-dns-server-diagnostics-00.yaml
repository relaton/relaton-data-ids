  content: "   The widespread adoption of DNSSEC implies more frequent DNSSEC\n   failures.
    \ Unfortunately, DNSSEC's failure mode is largely opaque to\n   the client: when
    validation fails, the only signal that the clients\n   of a validating resolver
    receive is an empty response with a SERVFAIL\n   response code.  This note proposes
    a protocol extension to allow\n   SERVFAIL responses to include additional diagnostic
    information,\n   giving the client greater insight into what went wrong and a
    better\n   chance of delivering useful problem reports to DNS operators.\n\n\t "

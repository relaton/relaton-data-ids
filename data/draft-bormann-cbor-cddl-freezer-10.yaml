  content: "   In defining the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), some\n   features
    have turned up that would be nice to have.  In the interest\n   of completing
    this specification in a timely manner, the present\n   document was started to
    collect nice-to-have features that did not\n   make it into the first RFC for
    CDDL, RFC 8610, or the specifications\n   exercising its extension points, such
    as RFC 9165.\n\n   Significant parts of this draft have now moved over to the
    CDDL 2.0\n   project, described in draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-2-draft.  The remaining\n
    \  items in this draft are not directly related to the CDDL 2.0 effort.\n\n\t "

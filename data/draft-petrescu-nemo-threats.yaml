  content: "\n   This document describes security threats related to the network\n
    \  mobility base protocol (NEMO).  Threats of Mobile IPv6 for Mobile\n   Hosts
    are only briefly touched when in need of support of related\n   NEMO threats.
    \ The NEMO signalling between MR and HA, as well as\n   the forwarding information
    at HA and nested mobility configurations\n   are considered to be the main sensitive
    points of the protocol.\n   Existing tools of Mobile IPv6 protection between MH
    and HA (IPsec),\n   dynamic routing protocol authentication, NEMO prefix table,
    ingress\n   filtering checks at HA and tunnel encapsulation limiting are\n   presented
    as protocol features affording protection against\n   threats.  NEMO threats for
    which there are no protections are\n   briefly mentioned.\n\t "

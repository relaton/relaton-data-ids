  content: "   Two security services that are required in many applications but have\n
    \  not been addressed by LDAPv3 [ldapv3] in a satisfactory manner yet\n   are
    integrity and non-repudiation. According to the latest LDAPv3\n   security draft
    [ldapv3-auth] integrity can be achieved within a\n   secure association only.
    Non-repudiation, and by this we mean digital\n   signing of operations, is mentioned
    in [ldapv3] as an example of the\n   use of the LDAPv3 extended operation mechanism.\n
    \  A disadvantage of this approach is that it would be necessary\n   to define
    a new Extended Request/Response pair for\n   each basic operation that should
    be signed.\n \n   This document defines an LDAP control called LDAPSecurityParameters\n
    \  for transferring security parameters with LDAP operations.\n   With this control
    it is possible to append digital signature\n   to LDAP operations and in this
    way provide for message\n   authenticity, message integrity, non-repudiation of
    message\n   origin and message freshness.\n\n\t "

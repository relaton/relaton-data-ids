  content: "This document describes an IMAP extension that aids in allowing a \n   client
    to maintain mailbox synchronization without performing a deep\n   sync after each
    connection. The goal is to minimize, but not \n   eliminate, the need for deep
    synchronizations. The extension defines\n   a way for a client to receive and
    acknowledge state change responses\n   from the server.\n\t "

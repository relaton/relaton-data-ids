  content: "   This document contains a plan for how providers of email services\n
    \  can manage one aspect of the problem of email abuse over IPv6.\n   Spammers
    can send mail from a very large range of IPv6 addresses,\n   and this will make
    current antispam blocklisting technology less\n   effective.  This is because
    email receivers will have to maintain\n   excessively large lists of IP blocklists
    which either consume too\n   many resources, or will become stale and therefore
    ineffective as\n   spammers quickly discard one IP address and move onto the next
    one.\n\n   This document recommends that during the transition of email from\n
    \  IPv4 to IPv6, email receivers implement a whitelisting option where\n   they
    only allow email from permitted senders over IPv6 and reject\n   email from everyone
    else sending email over IPv6.\n\n\n\t "

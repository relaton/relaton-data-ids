  content: "The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method of encapsulating
    Network Layer protocol information over point-to-point links.  PPP also defines
    an extensible Link Control Protocol, which allows negotiation of an Authentication
    Protocol.                                 This document describes a new authentication
    mechanism: the Arbitrary Handshake Authentication (AHA) protocol.  AHA seeks to
    provide for arbitrary length authentication handshakes and an authentication abstraction
    that allows the PPP client and server implementations to provide authentication
    service while knowing as little as possible of the details of the authentication
    protocol.  AHA is not an authentication protocol but rather is a carrier for authentication
    protocols.  AHA adds an additional protocol negotiation phase in order to add
    the principal's declared identity into the decision of which authentication protocol
    to use.\n\t "

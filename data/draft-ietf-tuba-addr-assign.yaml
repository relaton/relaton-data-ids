  content: "There are currently two mechanisms defined for dynamic assignment of OSI
    NSAP addresses.  This memo specifies a single mechanism for hosts to use that
    maximizes flexibility while allowing administrative control, and requires no configuration
    on the host.                                     The method described in the memo
    is intended to be implemented universally in all end systems supporting CLNP,
    both for TUBA and pure OSI systems.  This document will be submitted to ISO for
    consideration as a standard.  Additionally, the method described could also be
    used in CATNIP networks.\n\t "

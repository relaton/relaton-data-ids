  content: "   This specification defines the CBOR merge patch format and processing\n
    \  rules, as an analog to the JSON merge patch format defined in RFC\n   7396.
    \ The merge patch format is primarily intended for use with the\n   HTTP PATCH
    method and potential related CoAP methods as a means of\n   describing a set of
    modifications to a target resource's content.\n\n   This specification also defines
    how a JSON merge patch document is\n   applied to a CBOR data item and vice versa.\n\n\t "

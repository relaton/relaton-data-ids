  content: "The CAPWAP Working Group (WG) is currently looking into defining a\n    protocol
    that would enable interoperability in an IEEE 802.11 based\n    wireless local
    area network (WLAN) comprised of Wireless Termination\n    Points (WTP) and Access
    Controllers (AC) belonging to different\n    vendors.\n\n    This document presents
    a self-review of Simple Light Access Point\n    Protocol (SLAPP), one of the candidate
    protocol proposals submitted\n    to the CAPWAP WG for consideration as a CAPWAP
    protocol.  The WG has\n    requested that the authors of all candidate proposals
    to provide a\n    document which evaluates how their submission meets the objectives,\n
    \   taxonomy, and problem statement.\n\t "

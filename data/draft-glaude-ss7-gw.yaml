  content: "This memo defines an architectural framework for transporting SS7\nsignaling
    information over Internet Protocol networks. It describes a\nSignaling Gateway
    which acts as a bridge between the SS7 and IP\nnetworks. The Signaling Gateway
    can be configured as an SS7 end-node\nor as a Signal Transfer Point (STP) deployed
    singly or in a mated pair\nconfiguration. An application program interface (API)
    allows multiple\nremote devices, such as Media Gateways and Media Gateway Controllers,\nto
    register with the Signaling Gateway using TCP or UDP. The API\nconsists of MTP
    and SCCP primitives which remote devices can use to\nsend and receive ISUP and
    TCAP messages to effect PSTN call control and\naccess Intelligent Network databases.
    The MTP and SCCP primitives\nensure that application states (available, unavailable
    or congested)\nare propagated into the SS7 network.\n \nThis memo also identifies
    some functional and performance requirements\nfor SS7 signaling transport to IP-based
    application processes residing\non one or more client hosts.\n\n\t "

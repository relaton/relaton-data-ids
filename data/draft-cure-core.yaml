  content: "   This document specifies CURE (Consent Upon Recipient Engagement), a\n
    \  fully native, asynchronous mechanism for expressing and enforcing\n   recipient
    consent in email without introducing mailbox enumeration,\n   synchronous negotiation,
    or new SMTP commands.  CURE does not\n   guarantee delivery, consent, or sender
    legitimacy; rather, it\n   provides a privacy-preserving signal that mailbox providers
    MAY use\n   to improve enforcement and sender accountability.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies CURE (Consent Upon Recipient Engagement), a
    fully native, asynchronous mechanism for expressing and enforcing recipient consent
    in email without introducing mailbox enumeration, synchronous negotiation, or
    new SMTP commands. CURE does not guarantee delivery, consent, or sender legitimacy;
    rather, it provides a privacy-preserving signal that mailbox providers MAY use
    to improve enforcement and sender accountability.</p>"

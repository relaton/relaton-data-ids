  content: "   The EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) protocol defined a Well-\n
    \  Known URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): /.well-known/est.  EST also\n   defined
    several path components that clients use for PKI (Public Key\n   Infrastructure)
    services, namely certificate enrollment (e.g.,\n   /simpleenroll).  In some sense,
    the services provided by the path\n   components can be thought of as managed
    PKI-related packages.  There\n   are additional PKI-related packages a client
    might need as well as\n   other security-related packages, such as firmware, trust
    anchors, and\n   symmetric, asymmetric, and encrypted keys.  This document also\n
    \  specifies the PAL (Package Availability List), which is an XML\n   (Extensible
    Markup Language) file or JSON (JavaScript Object\n   Notation) object that clients
    use to retrieve packages available and\n   authorized for them.  This document
    extends the EST server path\n   components to provide these additional services.\n\n\t "

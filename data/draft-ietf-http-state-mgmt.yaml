  content: "This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP requests
    and responses.  It describes two new headers, Cookie and Set- Cookie, which carry
    state information between participating origin servers and user agents.  The method
    described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal, but it can interoperate
    with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's method. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

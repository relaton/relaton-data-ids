abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Though both SIP and various peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols have been
    \n   widely deployed, there is no operational experience with SIP using \n   overlay
    networks. Also, most p2p networks developed in the research \n   community do
    not deal with NAT traversal. This document attempts to \n   list the design requirements
    for a P2PSIP protocol taking into \n   account the experience gained from both
    the p2p and the SIP \n   communities. Special emphasis has been put on the SIP-DHT
    interface, \n   on the overlay performance, on NAT traversal and on security.

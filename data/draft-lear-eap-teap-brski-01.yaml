  content: "   In certain environments, in order for a device to establish any layer\n
    \  three communications, it is necessary for that device to be properly\n   credentialed.
    \ This is a relatively easy problem to solve when a\n   device is associated with
    a human being and has both input and\n   display functions.  It is less easy when
    the human, input, and\n   display functions are not present.  To address this
    case, this memo\n   specifies extensions to the Tunnel Extensible Authentication
    Protocol\n   (TEAP) method that leverages Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key\n   Infrastructures
    (BRSKI) in order to provide a credential to a device\n   at layer two.  The basis
    of this work is that a manufacturer will\n   introduce the device and the local
    deployment through cryptographic\n   means.  In this sense the same trust model
    as BRSKI is used.\n\n\t "

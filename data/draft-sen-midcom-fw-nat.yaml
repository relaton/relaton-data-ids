  content: "Bundled session applications such as FTP, H.323, SIP and RTSP, which \nuse
    a signaling/control connection to establish a data/media flow, \nare usually broken,
    en-route, by Middleboxes such as NAT. Midcom \nproposes to solve this problem
    by allowing the Middlebox to be \ncontrolled through a generalized control interface
    by an \napplication-aware entity called Midcom Agent. Since ubiquitous \ndeployment
    of Midcom is still a few years away, an interim solution \nis needed to allow
    applications traverse NAT and Firewalls \nseamlessly without the help of embedded
    Application Layer Gateways \n(ALG). In this draft, a pre-Midcom solution framework
    is developed. \nA solution for the problem of NAT/FW traversal is needed both
    for \nthe signaling and media/data paths. Two key components of the \nproposed
    solution are: (1) a Signaling Proxy server on the signaling \npath, and (2) a
    Media Proxy server on the media path. The Signaling \nserver interacts with the
    Media server through a control interface. \nAlthough the primary applicability
    of this framework is shown for \nreal-time RTP/UDP-based SIP multimedia sessions,
    these concepts \nshould be generally applicable to other types of data sessions
    \nestablished through a control connection.\n\t "

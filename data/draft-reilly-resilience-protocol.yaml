abstract:
- content: "<p>The Reilly Resilience Protocol (RRP) standardizes a verifiable method
    to prove that IT systems, cloud infrastructures, and AI pipelines are continuously
    exercised and resilient. RRP turns resilience claims into cryptographically signed
    evidence persisted in immutable storage and batched into a daily Merkle root that
    is publicly time-anchored on blockchains. The protocol outputs an executive Resilience
    Scorecard backed by independently verifiable receipts. RRP composes with the Reilly
    EternaMark (REM) protocol to ensure dual-layer digital permanence using both DOI
    archival and blockchain timestamping.</p>"

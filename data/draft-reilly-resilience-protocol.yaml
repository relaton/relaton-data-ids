  script: Latn
  content: "   The Reilly Resilience Protocol (RRP) standardizes a verifiable method\n
    \  to prove that IT systems, cloud infrastructures, and AI pipelines are\n   continuously
    exercised and resilient. RRP turns resilience claims\n   into cryptographically
    signed evidence persisted in immutable storage\n   and batched into a daily Merkle
    root that is publicly time-anchored\n   on blockchains. The protocol outputs an
    executive Resilience\n   Scorecard backed by independently verifiable receipts.
    RRP composes\n   with the Reilly EternaMark (REM) protocol to ensure dual-layer
    digital\n   permanence using both DOI archival and blockchain timestamping.\n\n\t "

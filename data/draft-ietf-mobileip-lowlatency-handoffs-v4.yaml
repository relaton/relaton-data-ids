  content: "Mobile IPv4 describes how a Mobile Node can perform IPv4-layer handoffs
    between subnets served by different Foreign Agents.  In certain cases, the latency
    involved in these handoffs can be above the threshold required for the support
    of delay-sensitive or real-time services.  The aim of this document is to present
    two methods to achieve low-latency Mobile IPv4 handoffs.  In addition, a combination
    of these two methods is described.  The described techniques allow greater support
    for real-time services on a Mobile IPv4 network by minimizing the period of time
    when a Mobile Node is unable to send or receive IPv4 packets due to the delay
    in the Mobile IPv4 Registration process.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   Mobile IPv6 return routability mechanisms require home and care-of\n
    \  address keygen tokens to be used to authorize a binding update to\n   correspondent
    nodes. The current rules dictate that such\n   authorization be performed every
    seven minutes, using tokens at most\n   three and half minutes old. This requirement
    results in an average\n   signaling traffic of around 7 bits per second when the
    hosts are not\n   moving around. This traffic load by itself is neglible, but
    can be\n   problematic for hosts in standby mode. We present a secure and\n   lightweight
    extension of return routability that can reduce this\n   signaling load to around
    0.1 bits per second, and require hosts to\n   wake up much less frequently.\n\t "

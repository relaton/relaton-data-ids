  content: "This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP)\n   payload
    format to be used for the Variable-Rate Multimode\n   Wideband (VMR-WB) speech
    codec. The payload format is\n   designed to be able to interoperate with existing
    VMR-WB\n   transport formats on non-IP networks. In addition, a file\n   format
    is specified for transport of VMR-WB speech data in\n   storage mode applications
    such as email. A MIME type\n   registration is included, for VMR-WB, specifying
    use of\n   both the RTP payload and the storage formats\n   that has a number
    of operating modes, one of which is \n   interoperable with AMR-WB (i.e., RFC
    3267) audio codec at\n   certain rates. Therefore, provisions have been made in\n
    \  this draft to facilitate and simplify data packet exchange\n   between VMR-WB
    and AMR-WB in the interoperable mode with no\n   transcoding function involved.\n\t "

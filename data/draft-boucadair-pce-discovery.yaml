  content: "This draft describes a simple mechanism that ease discovery of remote
    \n   Autonomous   Systems   (AS)   supporting   inter-domain   MPLS-based \n   constrained
    tunnels service (this service is also denoted by Path \n   Computation Service
    (PCSv)) thanks to the use of Path Computation \n   Elements (PCEs). Remote ASs
    could be managed by a single or distinct \n   Internet Network Providers (INP).
    \ \n   Particularly, this draft describes how Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) \n
    \  is used to announce Path Computation Service unique identifiers \n   across
    the Internet in order for other PCEs to be able to discover a \n   path towards
    every AS supporting this Path Computation Service.\n\t "

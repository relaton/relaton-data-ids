  content: "   With the increasing deployment of Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)\n
    \  and Route Origin Validation (ROV), the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure
    (RPKI) has become a critical component for securing\n   inter-domain routing.
    \ RPKI leverages cryptographic certificates to\n   validate the authenticity and
    authorization of IP address and AS\n   number allocations.  All RPKI objects are
    stored in distributed\n   repositories and periodically retrieved by relying parties
    (RPs).\n   This document presents a data-driven analysis of the current RPKI\n
    \  repository system, including a global survey of AS administrators and\n   an
    empirical evaluation of repository operations.  The analysis\n   reveals that
    the existing repository architecture suffers from\n   limited scalability and
    suboptimal efficiency, and is highly\n   sensitive to failures.  As the number
    of ROAs and RPs increases, the\n   growing number of point-to-point connections
    between repositories and\n   RPs, coupled with the pull-based data synchronization
    model,\n   significantly degrades the system's scalability and performance.\n
    \  Moreover, a failure or attack on any Publication Point (PP) can\n   prevent
    RPs from obtaining a complete and up-to-date view of RPKI\n   data.  This document
    further outlines the fundamental requirements\n   for building a scalable, resilient,and
    efficient RPKI repository\n   architecture to address these limitations.\n\n\t "

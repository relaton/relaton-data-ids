  content: "This document proposes an extension to [TE-NODE-CAP] in order to\nsupport
    additional TE node capabilities in the context of Point-to-\nMultiPoint (P2MP)
    LSP routing and fast reroute protection.  As for\npoint-to-point LSP, nesting
    P2MP LSPs, i.e., MPLS P2MP hierarchy, is\na desirable traffic-engineering feature.
    \ However, nesting P2MP LSPs\nrequires a mechanism to coordinate the label allocation
    of the inner\nP2MP LSP between the egress nodes of the P2MP Tunnel as described
    in\n[MPLS-UPSTREAM].  To solve this issue, a new label allocation scheme\ncalled
    Upstream Label Assignment (ULA) is defined.  Network elements\nresponsible for
    the route computation of P2MP LSP should be aware of\nthe nodes that support this
    functionality.  For that purpose, we\ndefine a new bit flag to the TE Node Capability
    Descriptor as defined\nin [TE-NODE-CAP].  The bit flag (U) enables a node to advertise
    its\ncapability to accept Upstream Label Assignment.\n\t "

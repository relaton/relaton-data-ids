  content: "Peer-to-peer applications, such as file sharing, real-time\ncommunication,
    and live media streaming, use a significant amount of\nInternet resources.  Such
    applications often transfer large amounts\nof data in direct peer-to-peer connections.
    \ However, they usually\nhave little knowledge of the underlying network topology.
    \ As a\nresult, they may choose their peers based on measurements and\nstatistics
    that, in many situations, may lead to suboptimal choices.\nThis document describes
    problems related to optimizing traffic\ngenerated by peer-to-peer applications
    and associated issues such\noptimizations raise in the use of network-layer information.\n\t "

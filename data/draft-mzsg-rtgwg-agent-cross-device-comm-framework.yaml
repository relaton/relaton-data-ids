abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of large language models (LLM), AI Agent software
    continues to emerge. AI agents deployed on different network devices need to collaborate
    to accomplish some complex tasks, such as network measurement and network troubleshooting.
    This collaboration requires cross-device communication between AI agents. This
    document proposes a cross-device communication framework for AI agents in network
    devices, and analyzes the requirements for the communication protocol.</p>"

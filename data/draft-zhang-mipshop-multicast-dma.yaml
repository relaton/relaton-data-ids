  content: "    This document addresses the problem of delivering IPv6 multicast \n
    \   traffic to MN (Mobile Node). An approach named Mobile IPv6 Multicast \n    with
    Dynamic Multicast Agent is proposed  which combines Movement \n    Based Method
    [2] and Distance Based Method [3], Such a design allows \n    MN to optimize multicast
    route, and meanwhile reduce the handoff \n    frequency by selecting new multicast
    agent dynamically. In addition to \n    weakening the triangle route problem and
    diminishing the influence of \n    handoff to multicast, this approach provides
    global mobility in \n    Internet without limitations on network topology. This
    draft is the \n    same as the earlier version, it is just an update of it.  \n\n\t "

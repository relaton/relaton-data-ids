  content: "This document defines new mechanisms for the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP) in support of privacy.  Specifically, guidelines are\nprovided for the creation
    of messages that do not divulge personal\nidentity information.  A new 'privacy
    service' logical role for\nintermediaries is defined to answer some privacy requirements
    that\nuser agents cannot satisfy themselves.  Finally, means are presented\nby
    which a user can request particular functions from a privacy\nservice.\n\t "

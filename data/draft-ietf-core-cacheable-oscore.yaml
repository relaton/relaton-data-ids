  content: "   Group communication with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\n
    \  can be secured end-to-end using Group Object Security for Constrained\n   RESTful
    Environments (Group OSCORE), also across untrusted\n   intermediary proxies.  However,
    this sidesteps the proxies' abilities\n   to cache responses from the origin server(s).
    \ This specification\n   restores cacheability of protected responses at proxies,
    by\n   introducing consensus requests which any client in a group can send\n   to
    one server or multiple servers in the same group.\n\n\t "

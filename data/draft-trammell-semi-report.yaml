  content: "   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) through its IP Stack Evolution\n
    \  program, the Internet Society, and the Swiss Federal Institute of\n   Technology
    (ETH) Zurich hosted the Stack Evolution in a Middlebox\n   Internet (SEMI) workshop
    in Zurich on 26-27 January 2015 to explore\n   the ability to evolve the transport
    layer in the presence of\n   middlebox- and interface-related ossification of
    the stack.  The goal\n   of the workshop was to produce architectural and engineering
    guidance\n   on future work to break the logjam, focusing on incrementally\n   deployable
    approaches with clear incentives to deployment both on the\n   endpoints (in new
    transport layers and applications) as well as on\n   middleboxes (run by network
    operators).  This document summarizes the\n   contributions to the workshop, provides
    an overview of the discussion\n   at the workshop, as well as the outcomes and
    next steps identified by\n   the workshop.  The views and positions documented
    in this report are\n   those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily
    reflect IAB\n   views and positions.\n\n\t "

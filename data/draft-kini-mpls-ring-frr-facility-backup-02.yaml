  content: "Fast Re-route (FRR) using facility backup is a widely deployed MPLS\nprotection
    mechanism that can protect against link and node failure.\nIt provides a fast
    protection switch mechanism to minimize traffic\nloss (typically sub 50msec) if
    the node that detects the failure\nlocally, does the repair by re-routing the
    protected traffic to go\nover the backup tunnel. A direct application of this
    mechanism to a\nring topology results in an inefficient use of link bandwidth
    that\ncould also result in degraded service. This document describes a\nmechanism
    to do it without such problems.\n\t "

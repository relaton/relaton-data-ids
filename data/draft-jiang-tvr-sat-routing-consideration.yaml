  content: "   The 3GPP has done tremendous work to either standardize or study\n
    \  various types of wireless services that would depend on a satellite\n   constellation
    network.  While the ISLs, or Inter-Satellite Links,\n   along with the routing
    scheme(s) over them are critical to help\n   fullfil the satellite services, the
    3GPP considers them out-of-scope.\n   This leaves somewhat significant work to
    be explored in the IETF\n   domain.  This draft stems from the latest 3GPP satellite
    use cases,\n   and lands on summarizing the restrictions & challenges in term
    of\n   satellite-based routing.  Based on some unique & advantageous\n   characteristics
    associated with satellite movement, the draft raises\n   briefly the general design
    principles and possible algorithms for the\n   integrated NTN+TN routing, while
    leaves the implementation details\n   for further expansion.\n\n\t "

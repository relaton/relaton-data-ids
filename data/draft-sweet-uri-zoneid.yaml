  content: "   This document describes how the zone identifier of an IPv6 scoped\n
    \  address, defined as <zone_id> in the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture\n   (RFC
    4007), can be represented in a literal IPv6 address and in a\n   Uniform Resource
    Identifier that includes such a literal address.  It\n   documents a long-standing
    usage of the IPvFuture extension point\n   provided in the Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) syntax\n   specification [RFC3986].\n\n   [ Editor's note: This draft documents
    the IPvFuture format originally\n   defined in [LITERAL-ZONE] and used by CUPS
    since 2005.  A separate,\n   incompatible format was defined and published in
    RFC 6874. ]\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides a taxonomy of methods used by manufacturers
    of\n   silicon and devices to secure private keys and public trust anchors.\n
    \  This deals with two related activities: how trust anchors and private\n   keys
    are installed into devices during manufacturing, and how the\n   related manufacturer
    held private keys are secured against\n   disclosure.\n\n   This document does
    not evaluate the different mechanisms, but rather\n   just serves to name them
    in a consistent manner in order to aid in\n   communication.\n\n   RFCEDITOR:
    please remove this paragraph.  This work is occurring in\n   https://github.com/mcr/idevid-security-considerations\n\n\t "

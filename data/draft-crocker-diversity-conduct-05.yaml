  content: "   The process of producing today's Internet technologies, through a\n
    \  culture of open participation and diverse collaboration has proved\n   strikingly
    efficient and effective, and it is distinctive among\n   standards organizations.
    \ For its early years, participation in the\n   IETF and its antecedent was almost
    entirely composed of a small group\n   of well-funded, American, white, male technicians,
    demonstrating a\n   distinctive and challenging group dynamic, both in management
    and in\n   personal interactions.  In the case of the IETF, interaction style\n
    \  can often contain singularly aggressive behavior, often including\n   singularly
    hostile tone and content.  Groups with greater diversity\n   make better decisions.
    \ Obtaining meaningful diversity requires more\n   than generic good will and
    statements of principle.  Many different\n   behaviors can serve to reduce participant
    diversity or participation\n   diversity.  This document discusses IETF participation,
    in terms of\n   the nature of diversity and practical issues that can increase
    or\n   decrease it.  The document represents the authors' assessments and\n   recommendations,
    following general discussions of the issues in the\n   IETF.\n\n\t "

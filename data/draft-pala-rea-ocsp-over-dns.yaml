  content: "   One of the most strategic problems for Internet Certification\n   Authorities
    (ICAs) is the provisioning of revocation information in\n   an efficient way.
    \ Current approaches for the distribution of OCSP\n   responses over HTTP do not
    provide efficient solutions for the high\n   volume of traffic that Internet CAs
    face when providing services for\n   highly utilized websites.  This document
    describes a new transport\n   protocol for OCSP responses to efficiently provide
    revocation\n   information about digital certificates.\n\n   In particular, this
    specification defines how to distribute OCSP\n   responses over DNS and how to
    define OCSP-over-DNS URLs in\n   certificates.  The use of the DNS system to distribute
    such\n   information is meant to lower the costs of providing revocation\n   services
    and increase the availability of revocation information by\n   using the distributed
    nature of the DNS infrastructure.\n\t "

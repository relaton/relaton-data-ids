  script: Latn
  content: "The process of producing today's Internet technologies through a culture
    of open participation and diverse collaboration has proved strikingly efficient
    and effective, and it is distinctive among standards organizations.  During the
    early years of the IETF and its antecedent, participation was almost entirely
    composed of a small group of well-funded, American, white, male technicians, demonstrating
    a distinctive and challenging group dynamic, both in management and in personal
    interactions.  In the case of the IETF, interaction style can often contain singularly
    aggressive behavior, often including singularly hostile tone and content.  Groups
    with greater diversity make better decisions.  Obtaining meaningful diversity
    requires more than generic good will and statements of principle.  Many different
    behaviors can serve to reduce participant diversity or participation diversity.
    \ This document discusses IETF participation in terms of the nature of diversity
    and practical issues that can increase or decrease it.  The document represents
    the authors' assessments and recommendations, following general discussions of
    the issues in the IETF.\n\t "

  content: "The Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) is intended to serve as a reliable
    convergence layer over single-hop deep-space radio frequency (RF) links. LTP does
    Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) of data transmissions by soliciting selective-acknowledgment
    reception reports. It is stateful and has no negotiation or handshakes. This document
    describes security extensions to LTP, and is part of a series of related documents
    describing LTP.\n\n This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking
    Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication
    as an RFC were raised. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   By design, Mobile IPv6 does not provide movement information to\n   higher
    layers or applications.  However, new breeds of\n   location-sensitive applications
    and technologies would benefit from\n   having access to such information.  This
    document outlines how the\n   knowledge of mobility can be usefully harnessed
    by applications which\n   reside in a mobile node as well as a correspondent node.
    \ It then\n   defines an application-level API to fulfill those needs.\n\t "

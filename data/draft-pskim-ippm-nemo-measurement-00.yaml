  content: "In this draft, the new measurement scheme of IP performance metrics \nis
    proposed for the mobile network in heterogeneous wireless network \nenvironment.
    In the proposed scheme, all mobile nodes (MNs) inside \nthe mobile network can
    get IP performance metrics irrespective of \nthe presence or absence of measurement
    functionality. That is, the \nproposed scheme does not require the MN to be involved
    in measuring \nIP performance metrics. The multihomed mobile router (MR) with
    \nheterogeneous wireless interfaces measures IP performance metrics \non behalf
    of the MNs inside the mobile network. Then, when MNs want \nto understand the
    condition of multiple communication paths, MNs can \nget measured IP performance
    metrics from the MR using L3 messages. \nThe proposed scheme can reduce burden
    and power consumption of MNs \nwith limited resource and battery power since MNs
    don't measure \ndirectly IP performance metrics. In addition, the proposed scheme
    \ncan reduce considerably traffic overhead over wireless links on \nmeasurement
    paths since signaling messages and injected testing \ntraffic are reduced.\n\t "

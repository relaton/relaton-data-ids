  content: "   The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized\n   experimental
    RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput\n   (L4S) and new Non-Queue-Building
    (NQB) per hop behavior.  These\n   documents describe a new architecture and protocol
    for deploying low\n   latency networking.  Since deployment decisions are left
    to\n   implementers, this document explores the potential implications of\n   those
    decisions and makes recommendations that can help drive\n   adoption and acceptance
    of L4S and NQB.\n\n\t "

  content: "As has been noticed, there is exists a huge deployment problem with\nglobal,
    interdomain IPv6 multicast: Protocol Independent Multicast -\nSparse Mode (PIM-SM)
    Rendezvous Points (RPs) have no way of\ncommunicating the information about multicast
    sources to other\nmulticast domains, as there is no Multicast Source Discovery
    Protocol\n(MSDP), and the whole interdomain Any Source Multicast model is\nrendered
    unusable; SSM avoids these problems.  This memo outlines a\nway to embed the address
    of the RP in the multicast address, solving\nthe interdomain multicast problem.
    The problem is three-fold: specify\nan address format, adjust the operational
    procedures and\nconfiguration if necessary, and modify PIM-SM implementations
    of\nthose who want to join or send to a group (Designated Routers) or\nprovide
    one (Rendezvous Points).  In consequence, there would be no\nneed for interdomain
    MSDP, and even intra-domain RP configuration\ncould be simplified.  This memo
    updatres RFC 3306.\n\t "

  content: "   This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics\n
    \  of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP\n   version
    2 (HTTP/2).  HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network\n   resources and
    a reduced perception of latency by introducing header\n   field compression and
    allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the\n   same connection.  It also introduces
    unsolicited push of\n   representations from servers to clients.\n\n   This specification
    is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the\n   HTTP/1.1 message syntax.
    \ HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.\n\n\t "

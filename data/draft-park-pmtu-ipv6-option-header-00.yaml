  content: "This document presents a new method for the PMTU discovery for IPv6. \nTo
    discover the PMTU of a path, a source node measures its actual PMTU\nusing the
    newly defined Hop-by-Hop Option header, whereas a source \nnode initially assumes
    that the PMTU of a path is the known MTU of \nthe first hop in the path in the
    previous one [1981]. In order to \nmeasure the actual PMTU, the source node sends
    the IP packet with the\nnewly defined Hop-by-Hop Option header to the destination
    node with \nthe first data packet when node is beginning. This can eliminate the
    \nchance of occurrence of several iterations of the somewhat complex \ndiscovery
    cycle (sending a packet, receiving a Packet Too Big message,\nreducing a packet
    size). Most of all, since existing PMTU has a weak \npoint for security and denial-of-service
    attacks, this document \nsuggests a security function when PMTU is going on.\nAll
    IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement newly\nOptions as
    defined in this specification.\n    \n\t "

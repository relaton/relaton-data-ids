- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The functionalities of radius server can be extended to provide new \ntypes
    of services for the users in Wireless and cellular network. \nTraditionally Radius
    servers are limited to authentication, access \nand accounting, there are few
    researchers proposing new extensions \n \n \n to provide new functionalities for
    radius server in wireless and \ncellular networks. In this draft we are proposing
    to extend the \nfunctionalities of Radius to extend it to roaming and handover
    \nsupport for the mobile terminals. Using this mechanism the mobile \nterminal
    initially gets access to the network and then when there is \na possibility of
    handover and roaming with the other access \nnetworks, mobile terminal communicates
    with the home radius server \nand creates the pre authentication information.
    In this process \ndifferent mechanisms essential for roaming and handover are
    \naddressed such as Network Selection, Handover Initiation, Security \nContext
    Management, and Mobility Management. Using this mechanism \nthe latency for handover
    and roaming can be reduced with higher \nlevel control mobility of the terminal
    during handover and roaming.\n\t "

  content: "The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX type\ndevices
    to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based Address of\nRecords.  In doing
    so it has selected a solution that is not\ncompatible with the solution that was
    specified in ETSI TISPAN and\n3GPP for subscription based business trunking.  The
    latter solution\nnot only covers E.164 numbers but also handles non-E.164 numbers
    and\nalphanumeric AOR's.\n\nThis document defines a extension of the martini mechanism
    that\nallows it to be used also with ETSI TISPAN and 3GPP standard\nsubscription
    based business trunking arrangements.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memo discusses the strategy for address assignment of the existing
    32-bit IPv4 address space with a view toward conserving the address space and
    limiting the growth rate of global routing state.  This document obsoletes the
    original Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR) spec in RFC 1519, with changes
    made both to clarify the concepts it introduced and, after more than twelve years,
    to update the Internet community on the results of deploying the technology described.
    \ This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

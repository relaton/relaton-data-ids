  content: "This document discusses TCP/IP traffic on ISDN links and makes recommendations
    to Network Application and Router developers with a view to reducing the cost
    of using ISDN.                                        This topic is partly related
    to current activity in the PPP Working Group on controls for Protocol Spoofing,
    but mainly targets the developers of Network software such as Resource Sharing
    protocols, for example Network Service and Directory Sharing.\n\t "

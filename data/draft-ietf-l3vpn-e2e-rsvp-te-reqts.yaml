  content: "Today, customers expect to run triple-play services through BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs.
    Some service providers will deploy services that request Quality of Service (QoS)
    guarantees from a local Customer Edge (CE) to a remote CE across the network.
    As a result, the application (e.g., voice, video, bandwidth-guaranteed data pipe,
    etc.) requirements for an end-to-end QoS and reserving an adequate bandwidth continue
    to increase.\n\n Service providers can use both an MPLS and an MPLS Traffic Engineering
    (MPLS-TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) to meet their service objectives. This document
    describes service-provider requirements for supporting a customer Resource ReSerVation
    Protocol (RSVP) and RSVP-TE over a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

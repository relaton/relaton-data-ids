  content: "In certain topologies, it is not necessary to run a multicast rout-\ning
    protocol.  It is sufficient to learn group membership informa-\ntion and simply
    forward based upon that information.  This draft\ndescribes a mechanism for forwarding
    based solely upon IGMP member-\nship information.\n \nThis document is a product
    of an individual.  Comments are solicited and\nshould be addressed to the author.\n\t "

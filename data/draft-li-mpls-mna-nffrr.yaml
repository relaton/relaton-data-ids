  content: "   Protection switching for MPLS traffic was first introduced in \"Fast\n
    \  Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels\".  Since then, Fast\n   Reroute
    (FRR) has been successfully used in many MPLS networks to\n   help ensure high
    availability in the face of failures.\n\n   If there are multiple failures in
    a network, there are circumstances\n   where FRR, if applied multiple times, can
    result in sub-optimal\n   behavior, such as forwarding loops.  Thus, it is useful
    to indicate\n   in the forwarding plane that the attached traffic should not be\n
    \  subjected to further FRR redirection.\n\n   This document describes a network
    action for identifying such traffic\n   to be used in conjunction with \"MPLS
    Network Action (MNA) Header\n   Encodings\".\n\n\t "

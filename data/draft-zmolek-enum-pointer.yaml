- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Current notions of service field tags in ENUM NAPTR records would \nframe
    the service exposure problem as a tradeoff between the privacy \nand heft involved
    in revealing detailed service information on the \none hand or the arbitrary constraint
    of such information on the \nother. This draft suggests an alternative approach
    that keeps NAPTR \nrecord size small, places service exposure policy and presence
    \ncapabilities in the hands of the ENUM registrant where it belongs, \nand minimizes
    impact to the ENUM registrar and their respective DNS \narchitecture. \n\n\t "

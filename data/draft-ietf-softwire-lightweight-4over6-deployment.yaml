  content: "   Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism for providing IPv4 services to\n
    \  clients connected to a single-stack IPv6 network.  The architecture\n   is
    similar to DS-Lite, but the network address translation function\n   is relocated
    from the tunnel concentrator to the tunnel client, hence\n   reducing the amount
    of state which must be maintained in the\n   concentrator to a per-customer level.
    \ This document discusses the\n   applicability, describes various deployment
    models and provides\n   deployment considerations for Lightweight 4over6.\n\n\t "

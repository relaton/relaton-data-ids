  content: "   Privacy protection is the bigger and bigger concern of many\n   governments
    and public in general. ND has a few open man-in-the-\n   middle attack vectors.
    MITM is considered among the most dangerous\n   attack types because of information
    leakage. This document proposes\n   minimal modifications for ND to protect IPv6
    nodes against still\n   open MITM attacks. It could be implemented gradually on
    any nodes,\n   with the biggest benefit from support on routers.\n\n\t "

  content: "Many Service Providers offer Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to
    their customers, using a technique in which customer edge routers (CE routers)
    are routing peers of provider edge routers (PE routers). The Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone
    network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets
    across the provider's backbone. This is known as a \"BGP/MPLS IP VPN\". The base
    specification for BGP/MPLS IP VPNs presumes that the routing protocol on the interface
    between a PE router and a CE router is BGP. This document extends that specification
    by allowing the routing protocol on the PE/CE interface to be the Open Shortest
    Path First (OSPF) protocol.\n\n This document updates RFC 4364. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

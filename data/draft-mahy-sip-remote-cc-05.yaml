abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "\n   This document describes how to use the SIP REFER method and the\n
    \  dialog package to manipulate conversations, dialogs, and sessions on\n   remote
    User Agents.  Specifically it extends the REFER mechanism to\n   allow the specification
    of a response that a UA should send in a\n   dialog.  This functionality is most
    useful for collections of loosely\n   coupled User Agents that wish to present
    a coordinated user\n   experience.  It does not require a Third-Party Call Control\n
    \  controller to be involved in any of the manipulated dialogs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for\n
    \  network diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public\n   policy.
    \ The Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP)\n   framework, information
    model, and protocol have been developed for\n   measurement task dissemination,
    initialization, reporting and\n   storing.\n\n   In the context of Large-Scale
    Measurement of Broadband Performance\n   (LMAP), measurement results are currently
    made available in the\n   repository to the public either at the finest granularity
    level (e.g.\n   as a list of results of all individual tests), or in a very high\n
    \  level human- readable format.\n\n   This document uses ALTO protocol to provide
    access to large-scale\n   network measurement results, flexible enough to enable
    querying of\n   specific and possibly aggregated data.\n\n\t "

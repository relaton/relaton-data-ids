  content: "   The current MVPN specifications do not define encoding and procedures\n
    \  for advertising in a single route binding of multiple multicast\n   streams
    of a given MVPN customer to a single provider's tunnel.  This\n   document defines
    such encoding and procedures. These procedures allow\n   in certain situations
    to reduce MVPN control plane load (note though\n   that these procedures have
    no impact on the data plane load).  The\n   procedures specified in this document
    assume that BGP is used for\n   transmission of MVPN customers' routing information
    within the\n   service provider(s) infrastructure.\n\n\nSpecification of Requirements\n\t "

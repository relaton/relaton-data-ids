  content: "Presence federation involves the sharing of presence information\nacross
    multiple presence systems.  Most often, presence federation is\nassumed to be
    between different organizations, such as between two\nenterprises or between and
    enterprise and a service provider.\nHowever, federation can occur within a single
    organization or domain.\nThis can be the result of a multi-vendor network, or
    a consequence of\na large organization that requires partitioning.  This document\nexamines
    different use cases and models for intra-domain federation.\n\t "

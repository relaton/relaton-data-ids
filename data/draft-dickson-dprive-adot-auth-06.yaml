  content: "   This Internet Draft proposes a mechanism for DNS resolvers to\n   discover
    support for TLS transport to authoritative DNS servers, to\n   validate this indication
    of support, and to authenticate the TLS\n   certificates involved.\n\n   This
    requires that the name server _names_ are in a DNSSEC signed\n   zone.\n\n   This
    also requires that the delegation of the zone served is\n   protected by [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack],
    since the NS names are the\n   keys used for discovery of TLS transport support.\n\n
    \  Additional recommendations relate to use of various techniques for\n   efficiency
    and scalability, and new EDNS options to minimize round\n   trips and for signaling
    between clients and resolvers.\n\n\t "

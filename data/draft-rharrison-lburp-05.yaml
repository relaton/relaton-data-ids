  script: Latn
  content: "The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Bulk Update/Replication
    Protocol (LBURP) allows an LDAP client to perform a bulk update to an LDAP server.
    The protocol frames a sequenced set of update operations within a pair of LDAP
    extended operations to notify the server that the update operations in the framed
    set are related in such a way that the ordering of all operations can be preserved
    during processing even when they are sent asynchronously by the client. Update
    operations can be grouped within a single protocol message to maximize the efficiency
    of client-server communication.\n\n The protocol is suitable for efficiently making
    a substantial set of updates to the entries in an LDAP server. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

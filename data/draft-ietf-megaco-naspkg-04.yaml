  content: "This document is intended to satisfy the requirements in section \n11.2.5
    of the Megaco/H.248 requirements document.  It defines five \npackages: \n- the
    base NAS package contains properties and events supported by \nall NAS terminations;
    \n- the NAS Incoming package contains properties and events  \nsupported by NAS
    terminations involved in calls initiated by the \ncircuit network; \n- the NAS
    Outgoing package contains properties supported by NAS \nterminations involved
    in calls outgoing to the circuit network; \n- the NAS Control package contains
    an event supported by a NAS \nControl termination, which allows the MG to indicate
    a request to \ninitiate a data connection to a terminal served by the switched
    \ncircuit network; \n- the NAS ROOT package contains properties supported by an
    MG which \nis also capable of supporting at least the NAS and NAS Incoming \npackages.\n\t "

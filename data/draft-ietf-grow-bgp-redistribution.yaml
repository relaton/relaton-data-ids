  content: "This document proposes the redistribution extended community.  This\nnew
    extended community allows a router to influence how a specific\nroute should be
    redistributed towards a specified set of eBGP\nspeakers. Several types of redistribution
    communities are proposed.\nThe first type may be used to indicate that a specific
    route should\nnot be announced over a specified set of eBGP sessions. The second\ntype
    may be used to indicate that the attached route should only be\nannounced with
    the NO_EXPORT community over the specified set of eBGP\nsessions and the third
    type may be used to indicate that the attached\nroute should be prepended n times
    when announced over a specified set\nof eBGP sessions.\n\t "

  content: "   Virtual network overlays are extremely useful for supporting\n   multicast
    applications in multi-tenant data center networks, by\n   distributing the per-tenant
    multicast state and forwarding actions at\n   the network edges with minimal control
    plane load and simpler\n   forwarding in the core.  A virtual overlay network
    may use existing\n   encapsulations such as MPLS-in-GRE or newer IP based encapsulations\n
    \  such as VXLAN and NVGRE.\n\n   IP multicast sources and receivers are very
    commonly spread out\n   across multiple subnets.  Sources and receivers may also
    be spread\n   within and outside a single network domain such as a data center.\n
    \  Hence, a Layer-3 multicast paradigm is the most suitable and\n   efficient
    approach for delivery of IP multicast traffic.\n\n   BGP based MVPNs provide a
    good basis for providing a solution to\n   support IP multicast across these overlay
    networks.  An appropriate\n   subset of the MVPN control plane and procedures
    are sufficient to\n   support the requirements, providing for a simpler model
    of operation.\n   This document describes the use of BGP based MVPNs alongwith
    the new\n   IP-based virtual network overlay encapsulations to provide a Layer-3\n
    \  virtualization solution for IP multicast traffic, and specifies\n   mechanisms
    to use the new encapsulations while continuing to leverage\n   the BGP MVPN control
    plane techniques and extensions.\n\n\t "

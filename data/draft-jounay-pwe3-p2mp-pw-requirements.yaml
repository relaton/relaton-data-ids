  content: "This document presents a set of requirements for providing an \n   unidirectional
    Point-to-Multipoint PWE3 (Pseudowire Emulation Edge to \n   Edge) emulation. The
    requirements identified in this document are \n   related to architecture, signaling
    and maintenance aspects of a \n   Point-to-Multipoint PW operation. They are proposed
    as guidelines for \n   the standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential
    \n   applications Point-to-Multipoint PWs SHOULD be used to optimize the \n   support
    of multicast services as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual \n   Private Network working
    group.\n\t "

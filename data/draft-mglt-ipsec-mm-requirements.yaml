  content: "   Currently IPsec mobility is the purpose of MOBIKE [RFC4555] which is\n
    \  the IKEv2 multihoming and mobility extension.  More specifically,\n   MOBIKE
    mobility support provides the ability to change the outer IP   address of a tunnel
    mode Security Association.  On the other hand\n   MOBIKE multihoming support provides
    the ability of a peer to inform\n   its correspondent that alternate IP addresses
    may be used if the\n   current IP address does not work any more.  This draft
    presents\n   requirements to extend mobility and multihoming facilities.  This\n
    \  includes the use of simultaneous IP addresses as well as other IPsec\n   mode
    like transport mode.\n\t "

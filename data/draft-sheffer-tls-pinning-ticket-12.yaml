  content: "Misissued public-key certificates can prevent TLS clients from appropriately
    authenticating the TLS server. Several alternatives have been proposed to detect
    this situation and prevent a client from establishing a TLS session with a TLS
    end point authenticated with an illegitimate public-key certificate. These mechanisms
    are either not widely deployed or limited to public web browsing.\n\n This document
    proposes experimental extensions to TLS with opaque pinning tickets as a way to
    pin the server's identity. During an initial TLS session, the server provides
    an original encrypted pinning ticket. In subsequent TLS session establishment,
    upon receipt of the pinning ticket, the server proves its ability to decrypt the
    pinning ticket and thus the ownership of the pinning protection key. The client
    can now safely conclude that the TLS session is established with the same TLS
    server as the original TLS session. One of the important properties of this proposal
    is that no manual management actions are required.\n\t "

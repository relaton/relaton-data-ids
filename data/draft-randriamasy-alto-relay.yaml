  content: "IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer\ntraffic
    Optimization) that includes a \"Network Map Service\" and an\n\"Endpoint Ranking
    Service\" and thus incentives for application\nclients to connect to ISP preferred
    Endpoints.  These services\nprovide a view of the Network Provider (NP) topology
    to overlay\nclients.  However, NPs remain reluctant to implement the ALTO\nprotocol
    for security reasons.  In particular, they do not want their\ntopology to be easily
    unveiled to third parties and thus more\nvulnerable to misuse.\n\nThis document
    proposes a scheme to preserve Network Provider\nconfidentiality while allowing
    the use of ALTO information for\napplications.  It introduces an \"ALTO Relay\"
    that gets the provider\nconfidential ALTO response and hands it to a functional
    entity called\na Connection Relay.  Meanwhile the ALTO Client gets a status and\ndirections
    to connect to Connection Relay, that then will hand the\ndesired application data.
    \ The benefit for Application Clients\naccepting ALTO transactions involving ALTO
    Relays is a better quality\nof experience.\n\t "

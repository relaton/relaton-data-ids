  content: "This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).  TFRC is a\n
    \   congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-\n    effort
    Internet environment.  It is reasonably fair when competing\n    for bandwidth
    with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of\n    throughput over time compared
    with TCP, making it more suitable for\n    applications such as telephony or streaming
    media where a relatively\n    smooth sending rate is of importance.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines method for negotiation of a set of capabilities\n
    \  specific to a Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Hello Adjacency.  The\n   document
    uses the TLVs for the LDP Capabilities defined in [RFC5561]\n   to be used for
    exchanging capabilities over LDP Hello Adjacencies.\n   The Hello Adjacency capabilities
    can be thought of as \"Traffic\n   Forwarding Capabilities\" (TFC).  Some capabilties
    already exist that\n   can be re-used for hello adjacency specific capabilities
    and it is\n   likely that some may be defined in future.  This document defines
    the\n   mechanism to advertise LDP TFCs for a hello adjacency as well as\n   mechanism
    to enable and disable TFCs after a hello adjacency is\n   formed between LDP peers.\n\n\n\t "

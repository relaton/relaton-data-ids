  content: "   When a mobile device (referred to as Station (STA) in this work)\n
    \  tries to connect to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), it needs to\n   first
    perform mutual authentication with the EAP server of the\n   network.  As a result
    of successful authentication, a Pairwise Master\n   Key (PMK) will be generated,
    and distributed to the STA and the\n   Authenticator of the network by the EAP
    server respectively.  The PMK\n   is used for securing the subsequent communications
    between the STA\n   and the Wireless Termination Point (WTP) it attaches to.  In\n
    \  practice, the authenticator may not be deployed on the WTP.  In this\n   case,
    an approach is required to help the WTP to obtain the PMK.\n   This work tries
    to discuss the issues related with this topic and\n   proposes a RADIUS extension
    to address the problem.\n\n\t "

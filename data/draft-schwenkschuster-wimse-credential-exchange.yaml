  content: "   WIMSE defines Workload Identity and its representation through\n   credentials.
    \ Typically, a credential is provisioned to the workload,\n   allowing it to represent
    itself.  The credential format is usually\n   chosen by the platform.  Common
    formats are JSON Web Tokens or X.509\n   certificates.  However, workloads often
    encounter situations where a\n   different identity or credential is required.\n\n
    \  This document describes various situations where a workload requires\n   another
    credential.  It also outlines different ways this can be\n   acchieved and compares
    them.\n\n\t "

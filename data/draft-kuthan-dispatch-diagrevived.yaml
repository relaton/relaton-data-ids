  content: "A major responsibility of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servers\n
    \  is to provide application-layer routing.  SIP routing can be quite\n   complex
    and lead to similarly complicated paths that SIP requests\n   traverse on the
    way to their actual destinations.  It is therefore\n   important to be in position
    to troubleshoot errors that occur along a\n   SIP path, inside and outside troubleshooters'
    administrative domains.\n   Particularly important for the troubleshooters is
    knowledge of where\n   an error occurred in a SIP path.  This document introduces
    a new\n   header field called Debug.  The purpose of the header field is to\n
    \  convey extra debugging information that can be used to locate errors\n   in
    SIP implementations involved in processing of a SIP transaction.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a set of standardized BGP communities to signal
    inter-AS routing security policy intent. Current mechanisms such as ROA [RFC6482]
    [RFC9582] and ASPA [ASPA-Profile] [ASPA-Verification] provide validation outcomes,
    but leave "NotFound" or "Unknown" states operationally ambiguous. This document
    defines transitive communities that allow an Origin AS to explicitly express its
    security policy expectations, such as a preference for strict handling of ROA
    or ASPA validation ambiguity, to downstream Autonomous Systems (AS). Unlike validation
    states, these communities do not assert correctness or authorization. Instead,
    they communicate origin-declared policy intent to all downstream ASes, enabling
    them to correlate this intent with locally derived validation results. By enabling
    explicit signaling of security expectations without exporting validation state,
    this mechanism allows downstream ASes to make more informed policy decisions while
    reducing the risk of accidental outages caused by misinterpretation of ambiguous
    validation outcomes. This mechanism is orthogonal to existing routing security
    validation technologies and does not alter their semantics or deployment models.</p>

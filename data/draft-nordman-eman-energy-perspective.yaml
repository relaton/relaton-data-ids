  content: "This memo discusses applicability for energy management features to\nvarious
    types of devices and buildings.  It describes the variety of\napplications that
    can use the EMAN energy framework and associated\nMIB modules.  P otential examples
    are building networks, home energy\ngateway, etc.  Finally, the document will
    also discuss relationships\nof the framework to other architectures and frameworks
    (such as\nsmartgrid).  The applicability statement will explain the\nrelationship
    between the work in this WG and the other existing\nstandards such as those from
    the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, and others.\n\t "

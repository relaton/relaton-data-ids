abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) as [RFC5213].
    PMIPv6 enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways
    without changing the IP address. PMIPv6 also provides limited multi-homing support
    to multi-mode mobile devices. Proxy mobility is based on the assumption that changes
    in host IP stacks are undesirable. Link layer implementations can hide the actually
    used physical interfaces from the IP stack. These techniques can be used to achieve
    inter-access technology handovers or flow mobility, i.e., the movement of selected
    flows from one access technology to another. It is assumed that an IP layer interface
    can simultaneously and/or sequentially attach to multiple MAGs (possibly over
    multiple media). This document provides an informational applicability statement
    that analyzes the issues involved with this approach (i.e. hiding access technology
    changes from host IP layer) and characterizes the contexts in which such use is
    or is not appropriate to achieve inter-access handovers or flow mobility.</p>"

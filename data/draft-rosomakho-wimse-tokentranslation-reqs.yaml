  content: "   This document outlines the requirements for workload token\n   translation
    within the context of the Workload Identity in Multi\n   System Environments (WIMSE).
    \ Token translation may be required for\n   interoperability between workloads
    or for complying with security\n   requirements of multi-system environments.
    \ This requirement document\n   considers various aspects of token translation,
    such as changes in\n   token format, content encoding, cryptographic properties,
    and context\n   embedding.  Additionally, this document raises security\n   considerations
    to be addressed by specific token translation\n   implementations, including replay
    attacks, access control, and\n   privacy concerns.\n\n\t "

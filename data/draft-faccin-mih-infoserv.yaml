  content: "Handover Information Services may be used to assist handovers between\none
    network to another network or within a network, based on stored\nnetwork knowledge.
    \ Information Services can be used to provide\nessential network related information
    e.g. topology and channel\ninformation which may allow a moving host to select
    an appropriate\nlink-layer connection to make, amongst available networks, whether\nusing
    the same technology or heterogeneous technologies.\n\nThis document is an effort
    to describe use cases and transport\nrequirements for handover information services,
    when they are\ntransported over IP networks.\n\n\n\t "

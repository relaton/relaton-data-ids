  content: "The fundamental problem in managing a large mailing list is matching bounce
    messages to subscription addresses.                                 Often a bounce
    message refers to a failing address that does not appear on the mailing list.
    One of the mailing list subscribers is forwarding messages to that address. Which
    subscriber? As the list grows, this question becomes more and more difficult to
    answer.                        The owner hack completely eliminates this problem
    _right now_. It automatically and reliably identifies the subscription address
    relevant to each bounce message. It provides the address in a form that is trivial
    for automated bounce handlers to parse. It requires support from the local mailer,
    but it does not require support from any other hosts.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the CITTAMARKET Protocol v1.0, an open\n   standard
    for the immutable identification and timestamping of\n   Artificial General Intelligence
    (AGI) systems.  The protocol\n   leverages the Bitcoin blockchain's Proof-of-Work
    to solve the\n   architectural problem of coordinating distributed autonomous
    systems\n   without centralized control.  It defines a four-layer architecture\n
    \  for creating unforgeable \"Sovereign Identity\" records.  Priority of\n   this
    invention is cryptographically anchored in Bitcoin blocks\n   #927277, #927579,
    #928154, and #928185.\n\n\t "

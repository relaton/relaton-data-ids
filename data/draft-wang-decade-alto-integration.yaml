  content: "   While DECADE architecture is going to provide a framework to use in-\n
    \  network storage with standard interface for content distribution,\n   there
    are still cases when many in-network storage servers provide\n   the same content.
    \ Then traffic optimization mechanism is needed to\n   select one best replica
    for the user request.  This document is going\n   to discuss the integration of
    Application Layer Traffic Optimization\n   (ALTO) protocol into DECADE so as to
    optimize network traffic.\n\n\t "

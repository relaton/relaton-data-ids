  content: "This document suggests the GR enhancement for BSR, BIDIR and\n  PIM-SM.
    \n\n -This draft suggests a mechanism to refresh \n\n  E-BSR state and to learn
    RP-Set on Rebooted E-BSR Router quickly. \n \n\n -This draft suggests a mechanism
    for PIM-BIDIR Downstream Routers to \n\n  refresh the (*, G) state only after
    'Rebooted Upstream Router has\n\n  learnt the RP Information and DF election is
    complete'. \n \n\n -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-SM Downstream Router
    to \n\n  delay the (*, G) joins to allow RP Information to be learnt on \n\n  Rebooted
    Upstream Router. It also suggests the mechanism to refresh \n\n  the Assert-Winner
    or Assert-Loser state on Rebooting Router.\n\t "

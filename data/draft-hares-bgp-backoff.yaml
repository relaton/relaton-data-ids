  content: "This document describes mechanisms for methods for damping the \noscillations
    of BGP-4 [1] peers by increasing the time between \nautomatic start functions
    of the BGP peers.  The increase of time \nbetween automatic start functions will
    be denoted as a backoff of \nthe automatic start functions by this draft. \nThis
    draft is an informational RFC which provides a description of \nmechanisms for
    back-off of the automatic start function in bgp-4 \npeer reconnections. This Informational
    RFC includes descriptions \nabout the back-off mechanisms and how this information
    is recorded \nin the BGP-4 MIB version 2 [2]. \nThe expontential back-off mechanism
    contained in this draft was \nfirst recorded in a draft of the bgp-4 specification.
    \ The author \nrequests that anyone with information regarding the original authors
    \nof that work contact the author.  The lack of credit for those\nauthors is based
    on the author's lack of knowledge the originators\nof the expotential back-off.\n\t "

  content: "The rapid growth of the Internet and the increasing number of \nInternet
    users have led to a wide deployment of network edge caching \nproxies. These systems
    have been very successful in accelerating Web \ncontent delivery and reducing
    the load on origin Web servers.  \nHowever, the specific role of these network
    edge caching proxies as \na gateway between Web users and content providers suggests
    utilizing \nthem for intelligent services beyond simple caching.\n\t "

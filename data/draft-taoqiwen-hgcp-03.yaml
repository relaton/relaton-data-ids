  content: "   In an era where AI-generated content has become indistinguishable\n
    \  from human writing, the Human-Generated Content Protocol (HGCP)\n   proposes
    a voluntary signing framework that enables human authors to\n   publicly acknowledge
    their expressions.  Rather than detecting or\n   classifying content origin, HGCP
    allows individuals to declare, in a\n   structured and verifiable format, that
    they take responsibility for a\n   specific piece of content.  The protocol is
    platform-neutral,\n   identity-flexible, and suitable for both real-name and pseudonymous\n
    \  use.  It does not evaluate accuracy, originality, or quality; it\n   simply
    enables people to say: “This is mine, and I stand by it.” By\n   providing a lightweight,
    human-first declaration format, HGCP aims to\n   preserve the visibility of human
    agency within an increasingly\n   synthetic information ecosystem.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo is submitted as input to the draft PINT (PSTN and Internet\n
    \  Internetworking) Informational RFC.  This document describes an\n   internetworking
    architecture of the Public Switched Telephone Network\n   (PSTN) and the Internet
    based on the Lucent prototype.  This\n   architecture enables access to PSTN  services
    from the Internet.  The\n   four basic PSTN services that could be made available
    to an Internet\n   User are described. We have used the World Wide Web as an example
    to\n   show how these PSTN services can be seamlessly integrated into the\n   Internet.
    Next a Service Support Transport Protocol for reliable\n   transfer of service
    request from the Internet to the PSTN network is\n   described. A simple Management
    Information Base (MIB) that is used\n   for uploading information and performing
    authentication checks is\n   then described.\n\t "

  content: "   This document is a supporting draft to draft-arumuganainar-rtgwg-DPS-\n
    \  Requirements-00. The DPS draft talks about high level architecture to\n   implement
    dynamic path selection based on application. The DPS draft\n   suggests the implementation
    to be done in three steps:\n\n   1) DPS Signaling: Here participating routers
    communicate with each\n   other to exchange application related information\n\n
    \  2) Profile Based Filter: This section describes how packets can be\n   classified
    and filtered\n\n   3) DPS Routing Frame Work: This ensures that separated traffic\n
    \  remains separated through out the network\n\n   While overall architecture
    is still valid, this draft suggests an\n   enhancement to the DPS Signaling component.
    The currently implemented\n   technique uses BGP for the signaling requirements.
    Whilst this is\n   good for certain cases, applications that can be off loaded
    to the\n   secondary link are pre-decided. It restricts behavior from responding\n
    \  to dynamic network conditions. For example, a network administrator\n   would
    want to off load some of the non-critical applications over the\n   secondary
    link, however when there is acute congestion within the\n   network, they might
    want the router to behave aggressively by off\n   loading more applications to
    the secondary circuit. Yet while doing\n   so there should not be any asymmetric
    routing on the network.\n\n   Since BGP is essentially a control plane protocol,
    it is not aware of\n   what is happening on the network in the forwarding plane,
    hence there\n   is a need to do the signaling in the forwarding plane. This drafts\n
    \  suggest one such mechanism. Here  the idea is to exchange the Path\n   Preference
    information at layer 4 level. Such signaling could happen\n   during TCP connection
    establishment phase. When done this way, a\n   decision can be taken for each
    of the session and hence making it\n   more dynamic than the one that can achieved
    through BGP.\n\n\t "

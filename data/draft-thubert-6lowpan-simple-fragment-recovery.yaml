- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an\n802.15.4
    frame can have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worst\ncase, a packet might
    end up fragmented into as many as 18 fragments\nat the 6LoWPAN shim layer.  If
    a single one of those fragments is\nlost in transmission, all fragments must be
    resent, further\ncontributing to the congestion that might have caused the initial\npacket
    loss.  This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward and\nrecover individual
    fragments that might be lost over multiple hops\nbetween 6LoWPAN endpoints.\n\t "

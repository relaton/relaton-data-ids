abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Lockb0x Protocol, a standards-based framework
    for creating Codex Entries (machine-readable Controllable Electronic Records)
    that bind together storage proofs, blockchain anchors, encryption metadata, signatures,
    and provenance. The protocol enables interoperability across decentralized and
    cloud storage systems while providing auditability and compliance with legal frameworks
    such as UCC Article 12.</p>"

  content: "This Internet-Draft presents the mechanism and corresponding\nsignalling
    protocol extensions for provisioned and dynamic lightpath\nrestoration schemes.
    The mechanisms proposed cover shared meshed\nrestoration as well as provisioned
    and non-provisioned schemes. The\nformer (equivalent to lightpath protection)
    implies the provisioning\nof backup lightpaths in advance before failures occur.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "\n   The document suggests various optimizations for presence that uses\n
    \  the SIP/SIMPLE protocol.  The suggestions are based on a separate\n   document
    that contains scaling analysis and requirements.  The\n   current document reviews
    only suggestions that are not yet part of\n   the work of the various SIP working
    groups while approved and in-work\n   optimizations are reviewed in the scaling
    document.  The intention\n   here is to keep these suggestions at this document
    as a place holder\n   until a set of requirements will be discussed and accepted
    and the\n   work on optimizations will commence.\n\n\t "

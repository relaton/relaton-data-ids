  script: Latn
  content: "   The purpose of SPUD is to provide a standardized layer below the\n
    \  transport layer, to behavior as a communication channel between the\n   host
    and network devices.  So when a new transport protocol is\n   deployed, it's easy
    for network devices to cooperate with it.  New\n   transports could have a common
    encapsulation to middleboxes.  On the\n   other hand, the transport layer could
    also make use of the state of\n   network devices collected by the SPUD, to improve
    transport\n   performance.\n\n   This document provides some exemplary use cases
    for SPUD, especially\n   in stateful firewall and TCP optimization.  The objective
    of this\n   draft is not to cover all conceivable p2a or a2p signaling in detail.\n
    \  Rather, the intention is to explain the requirements in these use\n   cases
    as far as it is required to complement the problem statement of\n   the SPUD.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO method defines a means for\ntransporting
    mid-dialog application layer data between user agents.\nIts initial use was to
    support the transport of ISUP mid-call\nmessages which could not be mapped to
    any other SIP request method.\nHowever, since its initial usage for that purpose,
    INFO has seen\nwidespread abuse as a means for introducing non-standard and\nnon-interoperable
    extensions to SIP.  For this reason, we now believe\nINFO should be considered
    harmful, and therefore, deprecated in its\ncurrent form.\n\t "

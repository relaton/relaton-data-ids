  content: "   Extending TRILL to multiple levels has one challenge that is not\n
    \  addressed by the already-existing capability of IS-IS to have\n   multiple
    levels. The issue is with RBridge nicknames. There have been\n   two proposed
    approaches.  One approach, which we refer to as the\n   \"unique nickname\" approach,
    gives unique nicknames to all the\n   RBridges in the multilevel campus, either
    by having the\n   level-1/level-2 border RBridges advertise which nicknames are
    not\n   available for assignment in the area, or by partitioning the 16-bit\n
    \  nickname into an \"area\" field and a \"nickname inside the area\" field.\n
    \  The other approach, which we refer to as the \"aggregated nickname\"\n   approach,
    involves assigning nicknames to the areas, and allowing\n   nicknames to be reused
    in different areas, by having the border\n   RBridges rewrite the nickname fields
    when entering or leaving an\n   area. Each of those approaches has advantages
    and disadvantages. The\n   design in this document allows a choice of approach
    in each area,\n   allowing the simplicity of the unique nickname approach in\n
    \  installations in which there is no danger of running out of\n   nicknames,
    and allowing nickname rewriting to be phased into larger\n   installations on
    a per-area basis.\n\n\n\n\t "

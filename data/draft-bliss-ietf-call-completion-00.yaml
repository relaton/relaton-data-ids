abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the interoperability problems surrounding the
    call-completion feature that allows a callee to put a caller's request into a
    queue by which the caller can be notified to call back the callee at later time.
    This document analyzes how different solutions inter-operate and tries to make
    recommendation on how to best meet this requirement</p>"

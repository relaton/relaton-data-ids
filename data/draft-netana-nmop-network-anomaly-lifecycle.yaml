  content: "   Network Anomaly Detection is the act of detecting problems in the\n
    \  network.  Accurately detect problems is very challenging for network\n   operators
    in production networks.  Good results require a lot of\n   expertise and knowledge
    around both the implied network technologies\n   and the connectivity services
    provided to customers, apart from a\n   proper monitoring infrastructure.  In
    order to facilitate network\n   anomaly detection, novel techniques are being
    introduced, including\n   programmatical, rule-based and AI-based, with the promise
    of\n   improving scalability and the hope to keep a high detection accuracy.\n
    \  To guarantee acceptable results, the process needs to be properly\n   designed,
    adopting well-defined stages to accurately collect evidence\n   of anomalies,
    validate their relevancy and improve the detection\n   systems over time, iteratively.\n\n
    \  This document describes a well-defined approach on managing the\n   lifecycle
    process of a network anomaly detection system, spanning\n   across the recording
    of its output and its iterative refinement, in\n   order to facilitate network
    engineers to interact with the network\n   anomaly detection system, enable the
    \"human-in-the-loop\" paradigm and\n   refine the detection abilities over time.
    \ The major contributions of\n   this document are: the definition of three key
    stages of the\n   lifecycle process, the definition of a state machine for each
    anomaly\n   annotation on the system and the definition of YANG data models\n
    \  describing a comprehensive format for the anomaly labels, allowing a\n   well-structured
    exchange of those between all the interested actors.\n\n\t "

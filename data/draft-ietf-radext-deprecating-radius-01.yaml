  content: "   RADIUS crypto-agility was first mandated as future work by RFC 6421.\n
    \  The outcome of that work was the publication of RADIUS over TLS (RFC\n   6614)
    and RADIUS over DTLS (RFC 7360) as experimental documents.\n   Those transport
    protocols have been in wide-spread use for many years\n   in a wide range of networks.
    \ They have proven their utility as\n   replacements for the previous UDP (RFC
    2865) and TCP (RFC 6613)\n   transports.  With that knowledge, the continued use
    of insecure\n   transports for RADIUS has serious and negative implications for\n
    \  privacy and security.\n\n   It is no longer acceptable for RADIUS to rely on
    MD5 for security.\n   It is no longer acceptable to send device or location information
    in\n   clear text across the wider Internet.  This document therefore\n   deprecates
    insecure uses of RADIUS, and mandates the use of secure\n   TLS-based transport
    layers.  We also discuss related security issues\n   with RADIUS, and give many
    recommendations for practices which\n   increase security and privacy.\n\n\t "

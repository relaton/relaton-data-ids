abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 4684, "Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol
    Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"
    provides a powerful and general means for BGP speakers to exchange and propagate
    Route Target reachability information which is used for cooperative route filtering.
    However, the complexity of implementing the entire specification may have impeded
    its widespread deployment. This document specifies the subset of functionality
    which is required for a provider edge router ("PE") to originate Route Target
    NLRI. Such PEs need not implement any filtering functionality.</p>

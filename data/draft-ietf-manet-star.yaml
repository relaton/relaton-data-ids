  content: "The Source-Tree Adaptive Routing (STAR) protocol is intended for use\nby
    nodes (static and mobile) in an ad hoc network or an internet.  A\nrouter in STAR
    communicates to its neighbors the parameters of its\nsource routing tree, which
    consists of each link that the router\nneeds to reach every known destination
    (and address range) in the ad\nhoc network or internet. To conserve transmission
    bandwidth and\nenergy, a router communicates changes to its source routing tree
    only\nwhen the router detects new destinations, the possibility of looping,\nor
    the possibility of node failures or network partitions.\n\t "

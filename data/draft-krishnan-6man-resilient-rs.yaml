  script: Latn
  content: "   When an interface on a host is initialized, the host transmits Router\n
    \  Solicitations in order to minimize the amount of time it needs to\n   wait
    until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is\n   received.  In
    certain scenarios, these router solicitations\n   transmitted by the host might
    be lost.  This document specifies a\n   mechanism for hosts to cope with the loss
    of the initial Router\n   Solicitations.  Furthermore, on some links, unsolicited
    multicast\n   Router Advertisements are never sent and the mechanism in this\n
    \  document is intended to work even in such scenarios.\n\n\t "

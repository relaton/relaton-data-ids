  content: "   DNSSEC was to large extent designed for off-line signing.  A number\n
    \  of new opportunities arise when on-line signing is used.  In negative\n   answers
    case there is no real need for the wildcard proof and the\n   server can just
    state that the queried name and type do not exist in\n   a single NSEC/NSEC3 record.
    \ But such a minimally covering NSEC\n   record that shares the name with the
    query name can not set the\n   NXDOMAIN RCODE.  Still, some applications want
    to explicitly know if\n   the name does exist.  This document allocates a new
    DNS RRtype that\n   can be used to signal nonexistence of the owner names of NSEC/NSEC3\n
    \  records.\n\n\t "

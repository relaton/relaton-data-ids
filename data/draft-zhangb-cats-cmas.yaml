abstract:
- content: "<p>In the context of CATS applications, resource modeling and dynamic
    scheduling face core challenges: heterogeneous computing resources (e.g., CPUs,
    GPUs, FPGAs) with differentiated characteristics are difficult to unify through
    traditional coarse-grained metrics (e.g., virtual machine/container counts). Moreover,
    dynamically changing resource states (e.g., resource occupancy, service instance
    load cycles) complicate routing table maintenance in network nodes, creating bottlenecks
    for resources scheduling. This document provides a service-oriented computing
    capability modeling framework, abstracting heterogeneous resources into standardized
    service units for efficient resource allocation.</p>"

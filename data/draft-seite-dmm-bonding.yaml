  content: "   The Quality of Experience of fixed network user can be improved with\n
    \  multiple WAN interfaces Residential Gateway (RG), i.e.  RG supporting\n   more
    than one WAN interface (e.g.  LTE and DSL), so that it can take\n   benefit of
    multihoming advantages.  This document discusses the use\n   of IP mobility protocols
    (NEMO [RFC3753] and Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275]),\n   and their Multiple care-of-address
    extension [RFC5648], to meet\n   multihomed RG requirements.  This document also
    defines a new\n   mobility option, the bonding option, for IP mobility protocols.
    \ This\n   option is used by the mobility entities to configure the interface\n
    \  bonding where packets, of a given IP flow, are distributed.\n\n\t "

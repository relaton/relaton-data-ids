  content: "   The Domain Name System (DNS) naming syntax provides no meta-data for\n
    \  indicating administrative transitions through the hierarchy.  For\n   example,
    it does not distinguish the higher-level portions that\n   operate as public registries,
    versus those that operate as private\n   organizations.  This specification creates
    a basic overlay mechanism\n   for defining a logical Perimeter between administrative
    entities\n   through the naming hierarchy.  The mechanism can then be applied
    for\n   a variety of independent administrative indications.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In Inter-AS scenario, as usual, multiple Path Computation Elements
    \n   (PCEs) will take part in path computation. [PCE-DISCO-OSPF], [PCE-\n   DISCO-ISIS],PCE-DISCO-BGP]
    or some other means can be used to \n   discover all underling PCEs, but there
    is lack of solutions to find \n   out those PCEs and their sequence which are
    engaged in computing an \n   end-to-end inter-AS TE LSP.  This document proposes
    a solution to \n   identify these PCEs and their sequence which can be used to
    compute a \n   TE LSP across multiple ASes.  \n\n\n\t "

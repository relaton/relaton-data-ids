- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines an efficient, robust, and scalable scheme for\nmessage
    compression when the transmission path between the compressor\nand decompressor
    is unreliable, i.e. prone to errors, losses, and\nmisordering.  The scheme is
    applicable in particular to compression\nof SIP, RTSP, SDP, and HTTP messages.
    \ A major case of application is\nthe compression of SIP protocol messages over
    bandwidth limited\nlinks, such as cellular links.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the Control And Provisioning of Wireless\n
    \  Access Points (CAPWAP) Handover Protocol (CAPWAPHP) which is a\n   protocol
    allowing the access controller of CAPWAP Working Group\n   architecture to anchor
    and manage 802.11 handovers of the stations\n   between a collection of Wireless
    Termination Points (access points).\n   The protocol, like IEEE's IAPP aims to
    ensure that a station is\n   connected to a single access point and provides an
    efficient context\n   transfer mechanism during handover using neighbor graphs.
    \ CAPWAPHP\n   handles local MAC and Split MAC with separate procedures.  CAPWAPHP\n
    \  can be transported using CAPWAP protocol.\n\n\n\t "

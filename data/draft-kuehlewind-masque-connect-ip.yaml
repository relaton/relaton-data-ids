abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft specifies a new HTTP method CONNECT-IP to proxy IP\n   traffic.
    \ CONNECT-IP uses HTTP/3 Datagrams to use QUIC Datagrams for\n   efficient transport
    of proxied IP packets, with the possibility to\n   fallback to HTTP/3 over reliable
    QUIC streams, or even HTTP 1.x and\n   2.\n\n   CONNECT-IP supports two modes:
    a tunneling mode where IP packets are\n   forwarded without modifications and
    flow forwarding mode which\n   supports optimization for individual IP flows forwarded
    to the\n   targeted peer.  To request tunneling or flow forwarding, a client\n
    \  connects to a proxy server by initiating a HTTP/3 connection and\n   sends
    a CONNECT-IP request which either indicates the address of the\n   proxy or the
    target peer.  The proxy then forwards payload received\n   on that stream or in
    an HTTP datagram with a certain stream ID.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes the revocation of an access token in the case\n
    \  that a client uses the access token illegally or maliciously.\n   Contrast
    to the existing revocation defined in RFC7009, the proposed\n   revocation is
    initiated by a resource server when the abnormal\n   behaviors of a client such
    as too many DB queries are detected. The\n   revocation process after revocation
    initiation is based on RFC7009.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Unrelated(out-of-bailiwick) name server names are required for DNS\n
    \  hosting services.  However, using unrelated name server names\n   increases
    the name resolution costs.  This document proposes using\n   in-domain name servers
    as much as possible for name resolution of\n   unrelated name server names to
    reduce the name resolution costs.\n\n\t "

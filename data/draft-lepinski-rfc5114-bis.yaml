  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes eight Diffie-Hellman groups that can be used\n
    \  in conjunction with IETF protocols to provide security for Internet\n   communications.
    \ The groups allow implementers to use the same groups\n   with a variety of security
    protocols, e.g., SMIME, Secure Shell\n   (SSH), Transport Layer Security (TLS),
    and Internet Key Exchange\n   (IKE).\n\n   All of these groups comply in form
    and structure with relevant\n   standards from ISO, ANSI, NIST, and the IEEE.
    \ These groups are\n   compatible with all IETF standards that make use of Diffie-Hellman
    or\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cryptography.\n\n   These groups and the
    associated test data are defined by NIST on\n   their web site [EX80056A], but
    have not yet (as of this writing) been\n   published in a formal NIST document.
    \ Publication of these groups and\n   associated test data, as well as describing
    how to use Diffie-Hellman\n   and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for key agreement
    in all of the\n   protocols cited below, in one RFC, will facilitate development
    of\n   interoperable implementations and support the Federal Information\n   Processing
    Standard (FIPS) validation of implementations that make\n   use of these groups.\n\n\t "

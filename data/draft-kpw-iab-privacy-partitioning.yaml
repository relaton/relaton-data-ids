  content: "   This document describes the principle of privacy partitioning, which\n
    \  selectively spreads data and communication across multiple parties as\n   a
    means to improve the privacy by separating user identity from user\n   data.  This
    document describes emerging patterns in protocols to\n   partition what data and
    metadata is revealed through protocol\n   interactions, provides common terminology,
    and discusses how to\n   analyze such models.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In RFC 2826, the IAB set out the benefits of a globally unique public\n
    \  name space.  As alternative contexts of resolution emerge, such as\n   those
    implied by RFC 7686, maintaining a single namespace for the\n   Internet requires
    a method to indicate the context of resolution for\n   a name.  This document
    proposes a registry for such alternative\n   resolution contexts as well as a
    set of pointer resource record types\n   useful for allowing conformant resolvers
    which query for the name in\n   the DNS to be redirected to the appropriate alternative
    resolution\n   context.\n\n\t "

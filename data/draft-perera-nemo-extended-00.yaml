  content: "This draft proposes a solution for extended network mobility support,\nthat
    is a mechanism to enable optimal routing between mobile network\nnodes and its
    correspondent nodes. The proposed scheme not only\nprovides optimal routing for
    the mobility aware nodes but also\nmaintains the benefits of mobility transparency.
    Our solution\nachieves route optimization by expecting the Mobile Router to take\nthe
    role of an Access Router thereby reducing the number of external\nsignaling messages
    a node behind the Mobile Router needs to perform.\nIn order to further reduce
    the number of signaling messages beyond\nthe scope of the mobile network we further
    propose the Mobile Router\nto play the role of an Home Agent for NEMO-enabled
    nodes.\n\n\t "

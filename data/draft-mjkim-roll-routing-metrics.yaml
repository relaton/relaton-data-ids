- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies routing metrics to be used in path\ncalculation
    for Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL).\nLow power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs) have unique characteristics\ncompared with traditional wired networks or
    even with similar ones\nsuch as mobile ad-hoc networks.  By contrast with typical
    Interior\nGateway Protocol (IGP) routing metrics using hop counts or link\nattributes,
    this document specifies a set of routing metrics suitable\nto LLNs.\n\t "

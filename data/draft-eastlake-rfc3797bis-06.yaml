  content: "   This document describes a method for making random selections in such\n
    \  a way as to promote public confidence in the unbiased nature of the\n   choice.
    \ This method is referred to in this document as \"verifiable\n   selection\".
    \ It focuses on the selection of the voting members of the\n   IETF Nominations
    Committee (NomCom) from the pool of eligible\n   volunteers; however, similar
    techniques could be and have been\n   applied to other selections.  It provdes
    an optional extension for\n   multiple rounds of such selection that can be induced
    by earlier\n   selectees without compromising the unpredictable nature of the\n
    \  selections.  This document obsoletes RFC 3797.\n\n\t "

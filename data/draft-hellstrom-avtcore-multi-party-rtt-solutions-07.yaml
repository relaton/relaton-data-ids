  content: "   This document specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media\n   handling
    in multi-party calls.  The main discussed transport is to\n   carry Real-Time
    text by the RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode\n   according to RFC 4103.  The
    mechanisms enable the receiving\n   application to present the received real-time
    text media, separated\n   per source, in different ways according to user preferences.
    \ Some\n   presentation related features are also described explaining suitable\n
    \  variations of transmission and presentation of text.\n\n   Call control features
    are described for the SIP environment.  A\n   number of alternative methods for
    providing the multi-party\n   negotiation, transmission and presentation are discussed
    and a\n   recommendation for the main ones is provided.  The main solution for\n
    \  SIP based centralized multi-party handling of real-time text is\n   achieved
    through a media control unit coordinating multiple RTP text\n   streams into one
    RTP stream.\n\n   Alternative methods using a single RTP stream and source\n   identification
    inline in the text stream are also described, one of\n   them being provided as
    a lower functionality fallback method for\n   endpoints with no multi-party awareness
    for RTT.\n\n   Bridging methods where the text stream is carried without the\n
    \  contents being dealt with in detail by the bridge are also discussed.\n\n   Brief
    information is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC\n   environment.\n\n
    \  The intention is to provide background for decisions, specification\n   and
    implementation of selected methods.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an approach to support multicast listeners\nand
    senders located within a moving IPv6 network (NEMO). A NEMO\nis built up by at
    least one Mobile Router (MR) and a set of Mobile\nNetwork Nodes (MNNs).  The MR
    handles all routing related tasks to \nprovide connectivity between the MNNs and
    an access network\nincluding mobility management.  Correspondingly the MR also\nsubscribes
    to multicast groups and forwards emerging multicast\ntraffic on behalf of a MNN.\nFor
    optimised routing of multicast data a hierarchical multicast\nagent is introduced
    as a logical entity providing an anchor to the\nmulticast tree.  In the MR a corresponding
    functionality is defined\nwhich decides on the location of the specific agent
    to be used for a\ndistinct multicast traffic.\n\nConventions used in this document\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].\n\t "

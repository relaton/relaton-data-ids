abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Currently, network equipment already has some Northbound Interfaces,\n
    \  such as SNMP, NETCONF, TL1; and some languages are also provided to\n   describe
    the data model, such as MIB, SCHEMA and even YANG.  While\n   till now, there
    is not a clear defined information model.  In NETCONF\n   domain, some standards
    are being defined.  In order to reduce the\n   cost of NMS integration in customer
    side, a clear defined information\n   model is necessary, just like the SID in
    TMF.\n\n\n\t "

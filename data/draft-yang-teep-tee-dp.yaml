  content: "   In big data area, computing resource manager like MESOS[MESOS],\n   YARM[YARN],
    kubernets[Kubernetes] or computing framework like\n   Spark[Spark], use Master-Worker
    structure to split computing task.\n   In the master component, the computing
    task will be splited into\n   different child tasks.  Each of thess child tasks
    will be loaded to a\n   executor which is managed by Worker.  The Master and Worker
    are\n   usually exist as cluster, cloud or other distributed framework.  When\n
    \  the big data tasks needs to be processed in TEE in lifecycle, this\n   document
    could be used for Master to provision child tasks in\n   distributed TEEs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects\n
    \  to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n   different
    domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\" of protocols
    over a horizontal unified, defragmented IoT\n   architecture.  Such an architecture
    will make objects accessible to\n   applications across organizations and domains.
    \ Towards this goal,\n   quite a few proposals have been made to build an application-layer\n
    \  based unified IoT platform on top of today's host-centric Internet.\n   However,
    there is a fundamental mismatch between the host-centric\n   nature of todays
    Internet and mostly information-centric nature of\n   the IoT system.  To address
    this mismatch, an information-centric\n   network (ICN) architecture can provide
    a common set of protocols and\n   services, called 'ICN-IoT', which can be used
    to build IoT platforms.\n   ICN-IoT leverages the salient features of ICN, and
    thus provides\n   naming, security, mobility support,scalability, and efficient
    content\n   and service delivery.\n\n   This draft summarizes general IoT demands,
    and covers the challenges\n   and design considerations ICN faces to realize a
    ICN-IoT framework\n   based on ICN architecture.\n\n\t "

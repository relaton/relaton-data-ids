  content: "   This document introduces additional measurements by using the same\n
    \  spin bit signal as defined in [I-D.trammell-tsvwg-spin] and\n   [I-D.trammell-ippm-spin].
    \ The spin bit signal alone is not enough to\n   evaluate correctly in every network
    condition the RTT of a flow.  In\n   order to solve this problem, it is theorized
    the possibility of\n   introducing an additional validation signal called delay
    bit, similar\n   to what is done by the Valid Edge Counter (VEC), but using just
    one\n   bit instead of two.  An alternative with two bits is also introduced\n
    \  with a so called loss bit.  More in general a loss signal is defined\n   to
    measure packet loss and two alternatives are presented with one\n   bit and two
    bits.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network as a\nhybrid
    of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes of\nOSPF operation.
    \ Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as LSA\ndatabase synchronization
    are performed using the broadcast model, but\nthe network is represented using
    the point-to-multipoint model in the\nrouter LSAs of the routers connected to
    it.  This allows an accurate\nrepresentation of the cost of communication between
    different routers\non the network, while maintaining the network efficiency of
    broadcast\noperation.  This approach is relatively simple and requires minimal\nchanges
    to OSPF.\n\t "

  content: "   To send data packets from one host to another in traditional local\n
    \  area networks, one needs to know the MAC of destination host.  This\n   is
    called the address resolution and is handled by the ARP (Address\n   Resolution
    Protocol) protocol.  However the ARP Request and ARP\n   Response mechanism in
    Software-Defined Networking (SDN) (RFC7149) is\n   different from that in traditional
    local area networks.  In SDN, when\n   there are no flow registrations in switches
    to forward ARP packets,\n   ARP packets have to be sent to the controller first.
    \ As resolving\n   the ARP packets may be time consuming depending on the load
    on the\n   controller and may potentially have different implications on address\n
    \  resolution in SDN, characterization of this delay performance can\n   thus
    help users to know the approximate delay before the actual data\n   forwarding
    process.  In this document, we define performance\n   parameters to characterize
    the delay metrics of address resolution in\n   SDN.\n\n\t "

  content: "   As the increasing use of DNSSEC and IPv6, there are more public\n   evidence
    and concerns on IPv6 fragmentation issues due to larger DNS\n   payloads over
    IPv6.  This memo introduces an simple improvement on\n   authoritative server
    by replying additional truncated response just\n   after the normal large response.\n\n

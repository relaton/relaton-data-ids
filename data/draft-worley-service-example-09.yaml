  content: "   The \"music on hold\" feature is one of the most desired features of\n
    \  telephone systems in the business environment.  \"Music on hold\" is\n   where,
    when one party to a call has the call \"on hold\", that party's\n   telephone
    provides an audio stream (often music) to be heard by the\n   other party.  Architectural
    features of SIP make it difficult to\n   implement music-on-hold in a way that
    is fully compliant with the\n   standards.  The implementation of music-on-hold
    described in this\n   document is fully effective and standards-compliant, and
    has a number\n   of advantages over the methods previously documented.  In particular,\n
    \  it is less likely to produce peculiar user interface effects and more\n   likely
    to work in systems which perform authentication than the\n   method of RFC 5359.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes a snapshot of the reasoning behind a proposed new\n
    \  namespace, the Host Identity namespace, and a new protocol layer, the\n   Host
    Identity Protocol, between the internetworking and transport\n   layers.  Herein
    are presented the basics of the current namespaces,\n   strengths and weaknesses,
    and how a new namespace will add\n   completeness to them.  The roles of this
    new namespace in the\n   protocols are defined.  The memo describes the thinking
    of the\n   authors as of Fall 2003.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In certain models of inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label Switching\n
    \  (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) spoofing attack against\n   VPN
    sites is a key concern. For example, MPLS-based VPN inter-\n   provider model
    \"C\" is not favoured, owing to security concerns in the\n   dataplane, even though
    it can scale with respect to maintenance of\n   routing state. Since the inner
    labels associated with VPN sites are\n   not encrypted during transmission, a
    man-in-themiddle attacker can\n   spoof packets to a specific VPN site. In this
    paper, we propose a\n   label-hopping technique which uses a set of randomized
    labels and a\n   method for hopping amongst these labels using the time instant
    the\n   packet leaves the port from a sending Provider Edge Router. To\n   prevent
    the attacker from identifying the labels in polynomial time,\n   we also use an
    additional label. The proposed technique can be\n   applied to other variants
    of inter-provider MPLS based VPNs where\n   Multi-Protocol exterior-BGP (MP-eBGP)
    multi-hop is used. As we\n   address a key security concern, we can make a case
    for the deployment\n   of MPLS based VPN inter-provider model \"C\". Specifically
    we use the\n   TicToc based Precision Time Protocol LSP to provide the timing
    for\n   determining the time instant at which the packet is sent from the\n   remote
    end Provider Edge Router and hence calculating when it must\n   have left that
    peer at the Provider Edge Router in the near /\n   receiving end.\n\n   This version
    of the document suggests a better method for gaining\n   more finely granular
    time slices. This is done by running the PTP LSP\n   between the ASBRs in the
    ASes that are providing the inter-AS L3VPN\n   service.\n\n\t "

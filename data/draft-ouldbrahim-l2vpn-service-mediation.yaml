  content: "        [SWALLOW-IW] describes an approach for interworking a native \n
    \       ATM SPVC segment with an ATM/FR-based pseudowire. The approach \n        requires
    that an ATM edge device to encode the remote MPLS \n        provider edge IP address
    within the NSAP destination address \n        per call-basis, and covers mostly
    ATM and FRF.8 specifications. \n        This draft covers other scenarios where
    a) the native layer-2 \n        edge doesn’t have a priori knowledge of the remote
    PE IP \n        addresses, b) the Layer-2 Provider Edge and the layer-2 network
    \n        can be native Frame Relay (FR) using native layer-2 signaling \n        protocols,
    c) the native layer-2 network can use not only NSAP \n        addressing but as
    well E.164, X.121, or any preferred native \n        addressing scheme, and d)
    the interface between the MPLS/IP \n        network and native layer-2 network
    can be FRF.10/X.76 \n        interface. We refer to the above problem space as
    \"Service \n        Mediation\" to indicate that the native layer-2 signaling
    is \n        terminated at the MPLS/IP device attached to the layer-2 \n        network
    and the \"mediated\" service is an end-to-end connection \n        built from
    two segments: one segment is in its native layer-2 \n        form which we denote
    as Native Wire (NW) established using \n        native layer-2 signaling protocols
    and the other segment is a \n        pseudowire (PW) established using PWE3/L2VPN
    signaling \n        protocols. \n\t "

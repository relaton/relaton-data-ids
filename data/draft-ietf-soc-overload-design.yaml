abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when SIP
    servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages they receive.  Even
    though the SIP protocol provides a limited overload control mechanism through
    its 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable
    to overload.  This document discusses models and design considerations for a SIP
    overload control mechanism.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

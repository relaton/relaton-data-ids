  content: "   This document is an analysis of multiple interfaces in a mobile node\n
    \  using Mobile IPv6 or a mobile router using NEMO Basic Support.  The\n   current
    Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support are suitable for a single\n   network interface.
    \ When a mobile node or a mobile router has\n   multiple interfaces, the current
    Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support\n   cannot directly be used for them.  In this
    document, we describe some\n   problems for a mobile node which has multiple network
    interfaces when\n   the mobile node is using Mobile IPv6 as an aspect of a node.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document attempts to discuss some of the definitions required to\nundertake
    the specifications of such benchmarks, and also to discuss\nsome of the possible
    ways to benchmark a routing protocol performance\nwithin a network, and some of
    the implications of those benchmarks.\nThe definition of convergence is discussed
    first, then polling\nnetwork devices. Several tests which are commonly used to
    measure\nnetwork convergence are examined.\nThis draft does not attempt to define
    what techniques should be used\nto benchmark network convergence, but only to
    provide considerations\nthat testers shoudl consider when attempting to measure
    netowrk\nconvergence using various methods.\n\t "

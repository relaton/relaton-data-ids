  content: "   This document describes a mechanism to optimize the path between the\n
    \  multicast router and multicast source in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.\n   The
    basic idea is that when a multicast translation router has an\n   IPv4 path and
    an IPv6 path to the same multicast data source, and\n   both IPv4 and IPv6 joins
    are received, only one path is used.  One\n   path is pruned, instead of the same
    traffic flowing over both v4 and\n   v6 paths.  By adding a metric to the IPv4
    path, the multicast\n   translation router can determine which path to receive
    multicast\n   data: IPv4 path, IPv6 path or both.  Therefore, an optimization
    path\n   will typically be chosen when an identical v4/v6 traffic flow exists.\n\n\n\t "

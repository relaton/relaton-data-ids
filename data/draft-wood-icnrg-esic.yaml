  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes how to transport CCNx packets inside an\n   encrypted
    session between peers that share a traffic secret, such as\n   that which is derived
    from [CCNxKE].  The peers create an outer\n   naming context to identify the encryption
    session in one direction\n   between the consumer and the producer.  The consumer
    sends encrypted\n   Interest messages to the producer, who responds with encrypted\n
    \  Content Objects.  Inside the outer context, the consumer sends\n   Interests
    with different names, which the producer may respond to or\n   may send InterestReturns
    for.  There does not need to be a naming\n   relationship between the outer names
    and the inner names.  The inner\n   content is still protected by normal CCNx
    authentication mechanisms\n   and possiby encrypted under other schemes.\n\n\t "

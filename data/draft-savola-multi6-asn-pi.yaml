  content: "In IPv6, the current IPv4 site multihoming practises have been\noperationally
    disabled, to prevent a creation of an unmanageable\nswamp of more specific routes.
    \ Some argue that the lack of a\ncomprehensive site multihoming solution is hindering
    the deployment\nof IPv6.  This memo presents a few proposals for end-sites with\nautonomous
    system (AS) number to be able to derive a provider\nindependent block of addresses
    from the first half of the 16-bit AS-\nnumber space.  This could enable a temporary
    IPv6 site multihoming\nsolution for those that already employ similar mechanisms
    in IPv4.\n\t "

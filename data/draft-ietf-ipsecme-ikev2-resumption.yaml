  content: "The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain computational
    and communication overhead with respect to the number of round trips required
    and the cryptographic operations involved. In remote access situations, the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, which adds several more
    round trips and consequently latency.\n\n To re-establish security associations
    (SAs) upon a failure recovery condition is time consuming especially when an IPsec
    peer (such as a VPN gateway) needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with
    various endpoints. A high number of concurrent sessions might cause additional
    problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment.\n\n In order to avoid the
    need to re-run the key exchange protocol from scratch, it would be useful to provide
    an efficient way to resume an IKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension
    to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly
    efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.\n\n A client can
    reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected. The proposed approach encodes
    partial IKE state into an opaque ticket, which can be stored on the client or
    in a centralized store, and is later made available to the IKEv2 responder for
    re-authentication. We use the term ticket to refer to the opaque data that is
    created by the IKEv2 responder. This document does not specify the format of the
    ticket but examples are provided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

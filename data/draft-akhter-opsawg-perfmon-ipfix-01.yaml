  script: Latn
  content: "   There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of\n
    \  network applications and the network service in handling user data.\n   This
    performance data provides information essential in validating\n   service level
    agreements, fault isolation as well as early warnings\n   of greater problems.
    \ This document describes IPFIX Information\n   Elements related to performance
    measurement of network based\n   applications.  In addition, to the performance
    information several\n   non-metric information elements are also included to provide
    greater\n   context to the reports.  The measurements use audio/video\n   applications
    as a base but are not restricted to these class of\n   applications.\n\n\t "

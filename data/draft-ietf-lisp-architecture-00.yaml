  content: "   LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking system by\n
    \  separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN\n   addresses.
    \ This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as\n   a critically necessary
    evolutionary architectural step for the\n   Internet.  In LISP, nodes have both
    a 'locator' (a name which says\n   _where_ in the network's connectivity structure
    the node is) and an\n   'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent
    handle\n   for the node).  A node may have more than one locator, or its locator\n
    \  may change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the\n   same
    identifier.\n\n   This document gives additional architectural insight into LISP,
    and\n   considers a number of aspects of LISP from a high-level standpoint.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Current routing mechanism is based on the shortest path, which only\n
    \  take the link status and the path accessibility into consideration,\n   without
    the security and trustworthiness of links and forwarding\n   nodes.  As security
    has become an important factor to the user.  This\n   paper proposes to add security
    factor in the routing process.\n\n   With the frequent occurrence of security
    incidents, services security\n   is an essential demand for the users.  As there
    are many security\n   devices in the ISP's network, this draft proposes secure
    routing\n   mechanism.  The purpose of secure routing is to converge security
    and\n   routing to ensure the secure data transmission.\n\n   The scope is transmission
    process security, while end-to-end security\n   and application layer security
    are out of scope.\n\n\t "

  content: "ALTO servers require automated operation, where the topology of the\nunderlying
    networks is incorporated into network maps automatically.\nIn addition to the
    Client-to-Server API defined in the ALTO protocol\ndocument, two more standardized
    API are required: an API between the\nALTO Server and networking nodes (e.g. routers),
    through which the\nALTO Server can get topology information from the network,
    and an API\nbetween the ALTO Servers, through which they can exchange topology\nand
    status information between themselves.\n\t "

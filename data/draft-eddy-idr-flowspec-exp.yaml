  content: "   This document discusses new extensions beyond the existing BGP\n   mechanisms
    that support mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service\n   (DDoS) attacks.  The
    new extensions are focused on enabling an\n   increase in collaborative inter-domain
    defenses involving multiple\n   network providers, and enhancing the ability to
    describe desired\n   filtering rules and actions.  This document is primarily
    intended for\n   discussion, and later on some ideas contained within it may be\n
    \  exported into other documents or specifications.  In some cases,\n   simple
    examples and proof-of-concept protocol mechanisms are\n   described, but this
    document is not intended to become a standard or\n   final protocol specification.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document articulates the requirements and basic components of a\n
    \  policy-based management architecture.  It focuses on the storage and\n   retrieval
    of policy rules from a directory-based repository, for use\n   in the management
    of network devices.  The architecture is described\n   in terms of its functional
    components and operational characteristics.\n   It is intended to be device and
    vendor independent, interoperable and\n   scalable.\n \n   There are three basic
    sections of this draft, addressing:\n \n   o the motivation for policy-based management
    that briefly describes\n     the requirements for a policy framework architecture;\n
    \n   o a reference model that defines a first-level functional\n     decomposition
    and captures the key concepts in defining policy\n     tools, policy rules, the
    use of a repository and schema, and the\n     mechanisms underlying the definition,
    storage and retrieval of\n     policies; and\n \n   o an architecture that describes
    each of the functional components,\n     and includes a narrative about how the
    architecture will execute.\n\t "

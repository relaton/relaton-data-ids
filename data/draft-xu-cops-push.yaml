  script: Latn
  content: "   COPS (RFC 2748) was originally designed for pull mode operation.  The\n
    \  message exchanges for pull mode are efficient and support a close\n   relationship
    between the protocol operations and state associated\n   with particular events
    detected at the Policy Enforcement Point\n   (PEP).  The operation of push mode,
    as defined in COPS-PR (RFC 3084),\n   is more awkward.  Push mode involves extra
    messaging between the PEP\n   and the Policy Decision Point (PDP) if one again
    wants to associate\n   state arising from specific events (this time detected
    at the PDP)\n   with specific protocol operations.\n\n   This memo proposes to
    modify RFC 2748 to make push mode operation\n   more efficient.  Comments are
    invited on whether there are issues\n   with the proposed solution.\n\n\t "

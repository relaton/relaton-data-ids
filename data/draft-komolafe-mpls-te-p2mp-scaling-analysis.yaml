  content: "Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is\ndeployed
    in providers' core networks, and the scaling properties\nhave been analyzed to
    show how much control state must be maintained\nto support a full mesh of edge-to-edge
    point-to-point (P2P) Label\nSwitched Paths (LSPs) in various network topologies
    and with several\ndifferent scaling techniques.\n\nPoint-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    MPLS-TE LSPs are very interesting to\nservice providers as a means to provide
    multicast services (such as\nTV distribution, or multicast VPN connectivity) across
    core MPLS\nnetworks. P2MP LSPs have different scaling properties than P2P LSPs,\nand
    service providers need to understand whether existing protocols\nand implementations
    can support the network sizes and service levels\nthat they are planning in their
    P2MP MPLS-TE networks.\n\nThis document presents an analysis of the scaling properties
    MPLS-TE\ncore networks that support P2MP LSPs.\n\t "

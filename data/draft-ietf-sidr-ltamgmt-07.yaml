  content: "   This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP) to\n
    \  manage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure
    (RPKI). It is common in RP software (not just in the\n   RPKI) to allow an RP
    to import TA material in the form of self-signed\n   certificates. However, this
    approach to incorporating TAs is\n   potentially dangerous. (These self-signed
    certificates rarely\n   incorporate any extensions that impose constraints on
    the scope of\n   the imported public keys, and the RP is not able to impose such\n
    \  constraints.) The facility described in this document allows an RP to\n   impose
    constraints on such TAs. Because this mechanism is designed to\n   operate in
    the RPKI context, the most important constraints are the\n   Internet Number Resources
    (INRs) expressed via RFC 3779 extensions.\n   These extentions bind address spaces
    and/or autonomous system (AS)\n   numbers to entities. The primary motivation
    for the facility described\n   in this document is to enable an RP to ensure that
    INR information\n   that it has acquired via some trusted channel is not overridden
    by the\n   information acquired from the RPKI repository system or by the putative\n
    \  TAs that the RP imports. Specifically, the mechanism allows an RP to\n   specify
    a set of overriding bindings between public key identifiers and\n   INR data.
    These bindings take precedence over any conflicting bindings\n   acquired by the
    putative TAs and the certificates downloaded from the\n   RPKI repository system.
    This mechanism is designed for local use by an RP,\n   but any entity that is
    accorded administrative control over a set of RPs\n   may use this mechanism to
    convey its view of the RPKI to RPs within its\n   jurisdiction. The means by which
    this latter use case is effected is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n\n\t "

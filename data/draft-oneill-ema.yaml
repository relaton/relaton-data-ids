  content: "This draft outlines a system  for domain-based routing and\naddressing
    support in handling edge mobility such as encountered in\ncellular systems and
    Internet roaming.  The system includes novel\nfeatures for IP session, address
    and localised host redirect route\nmanagement which promise significant scaling
    benefits compared to\nother micro-mobility solutions. In addition, the system
    is closely\nintegrated with the Mobile IP architecture for both signalling and\ndata
    forwarding, so that a rich set of capabilities and Internet\nServices are possible,
    and incremental deployment of EMA is possible\nwithin and between AS's. The draft
    also suggests a specific protocol\nbased on TORA for the implementation of such
    an architecture. It\nadvocates the creation of a specific IETF working group to
    address\nan overall architecture for edge mobility routing, specific\nextensions
    to existing routing protocols to accomplish that\narchitecture, and extensions
    to existing Internet technologies such\nas Mobile IP to support this architecture.\n\n\t "

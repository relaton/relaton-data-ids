  content: "   A host needs to configure itself with its own global unicast IP\n   addresses,
    default gateway IP addresses, and DNS resolver IP\n   addresses.  For the IPv6
    address of DNS resolver, there is need to\n   define alternative automatic configuration
    mechanism that enables for\n   an IPv6 host to configure its own DNS resolver
    IPv6 addresses by\n   itself, even when there is no other additional autoconfiguration\n
    \  mechanism applied.\n\t "

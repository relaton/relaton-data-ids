  content: "   A typical requirement with any cryptographic key management system
    is\n   to provide discovery, retrieval, distribution, and management of keys\n
    \  across entities needing to perform the necessary security operations.\n   However
    there exists no standard mechanism to automatically discovery\n   the keys, but
    rather the keys are either provisioned statically or\n   shared beforehand via
    non standard mechanisms.  This document defines\n   machanisms for an entity to
    automatically discover the key(s)\n   associated with other entities using the
    WebFinger protocol.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the concept of a Meta-layer: a programmable
    coordination substrate that operates above content layers on the Internet. The
    Meta-layer enables communities, individuals, and agents to appear, annotate, and
    govern together in shared digital space, independent of underlying platforms.
    It is not a replacement for existing web or transport protocols, but a complementary
    infrastructure that integrates with them. The draft outlines the motivation, terminology,
    use cases, implementation model, risks, security considerations, and potential
    IANA registries for future work.</p>"

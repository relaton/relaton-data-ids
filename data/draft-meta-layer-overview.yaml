  content: "   This document introduces the concept of a Meta-layer: a programmable\n
    \  coordination substrate that operates above content layers on the\n   Internet.
    \ The Meta-layer enables communities, individuals, and\n   agents to appear, annotate,
    and govern together in shared digital\n   space, independent of underlying platforms.
    \ It is not a replacement\n   for existing web or transport protocols, but a complementary\n
    \  infrastructure that integrates with them.  The draft outlines the\n   motivation,
    terminology, use cases, implementation model, risks,\n   security considerations,
    and potential IANA registries for future\n   work.\n\n\t "

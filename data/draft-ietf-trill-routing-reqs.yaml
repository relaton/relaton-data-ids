  content: "\n   RBridges provide the ability to have an entire domain, with multiple
    \n   physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows \n   for
    zero configuration of switches within an RBridge domain, optimal \n   pair-wise
    routing, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary \n   loops, and potential
    additional advantages as well.  The design also\n   supports VLANs, allows forwarding
    tables to be based on destinations \n   within the RBridge domain (rather than
    station destinations, allowing \n   internal forwarding tables to be smaller than
    in conventional bridge \n   systems).\n   The intent is to re-uses one or more
    existing routing protocols to\n   accomplish these goals.\n\n   This document
    lays out the background and specific requirements of\n   potential routing protocols
    to be considered for use in this design.\n   In particular, this document defines
    what is needed to accomodate\n   this design using IS-IS (or OSPF) as a basis
    for RBridge protocols.\n\n\t "

  content: "RTSP defines the setup and control for on demand and live streaming\nmedia
    sessions, which are delivered via an external media transport\nprotocol such as
    RTP/UDP.  RTSP does not define a mechanism to change\nthe content during an on-going
    streaming session.  Such a mechanism\nimproves the streaming experience when a
    user browses through\nmultiple offerings on a single streaming site.\n\nThis document
    describes several methods to improve content switching.\nThe basic principle is
    to re-use already established transport\nsessions (e.g.  RTP/UDP sessions) and
    negotiate new content to be\ndelivered on the existing sessions.  If additional
    transport sessions\nare necessary, those sessions are established separately.
    \ This\nprinciple of re-using the RTSP control and transport sessions\ndecreases
    the content switch delay to a large extent and improves the\nend-user experience.\n\nThe
    present document defines a mechanism for switching to new\ncontent, both when
    the client already has the content description\navailable and when it does not.\n\nThis
    document additionally considers switching of a single media\nstream in a session,
    when several alternative media components are\navailable.  For instance, the content
    may provide several alternate\naudio tracks in different languages to be played
    with a single video\nstream.\n\nThe principle of Fast Content Switching and Start-up
    is also defined\nin 3GPP TS 26.234 [3GPP.26.234] for RTSP 1.0 [RFC2326].\n\t "

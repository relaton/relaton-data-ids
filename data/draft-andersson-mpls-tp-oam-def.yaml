  content: "At first glance the acronym \"OAM\" seems to be well known and well\nunderstood.
    \ Looking at it a bit more closely reveals a set of\nrecurring problems that are
    revisited time and again.  This document\nhas one primary and a secondary goal.
    \ The primary goal is to find an\nunderstanding of OAM that is feasible for the
    MPLS Transport Profile\n(MPLS-TP)effort.  The secondary goal is to make this understanding\napplicable
    in a wider scope\n\t "

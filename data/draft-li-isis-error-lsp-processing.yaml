  content: "Recommendations for Interoperable Networks using Intermediate System\nto
    Intermediate System (IS-IS) [RFC3719] highlights a number of\ndifferences between
    the IS-IS protocol as described in ISO 10589 and\nthe protocol as it is deployed
    today.\n\nThis document outlines a number of differences found in the China\nMobile
    backbone network, which is constructed using routers from\nseveral manufacturers.
    \ These differences include LSP checksum\ncalculation, zero checksum LSP processing,
    zero remaining lifetime\nLSP processing, and corrupt LSP processing.  This document
    is\nintended to provide best current practices to facilitate\ninteroperability
    and maintain network stability.\n\t "

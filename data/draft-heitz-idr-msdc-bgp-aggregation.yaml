  content: "   A design for a fabric of switches to connect up to one million\n   servers
    in a data center is described.  At that scale, it is\n   impractical for every
    switch to maintain knowledge about every other\n   switch and every other link
    in the fabric.  Aggregation of routes is\n   an excellent way to scale such a
    fabric.  However, aggregation\n   presents some problems under link failures or
    switch failures.  This\n   design solves those problems.\n\n\n\t "

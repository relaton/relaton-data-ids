  content: "   Establishing authenticity of a stream of datagrams in the presence
    of\n   multiple receivers is naively achieved through the use of per-packet\n
    \  asymmetric digital signatures, but at high computational cost for\n   both
    senders and receivers.  Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant\n   Authentication
    (TESLA) instead employs relatively cheap symmetric\n   authentication, achieving
    asymmetry via time-delayed key disclosure,\n   while adding latency to verification
    and imposing requirements on\n   time synchronization between receivers and the
    sender to prevent\n   forgery.  This document introduces Asymmetric Loss-Tolerant\n
    \  Authentication (ALTA), which employs an acyclic graph of message\n   authentication
    codes (MACs) transmitted alongside data payloads, with\n   redundancy to enable
    authentication of all received payloads in the\n   presence of certain patterns
    of loss, along with regularly paced\n   digital signatures.  ALTA requires no
    time synchronization and\n   enables authentication of payloads as soon as sufficient\n
    \  authentication material has been received.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a framework to negotiate end-to-end the \n'Quality'
    of a multimedia session 'as the end-user to perceive \nit'. This UPQoS (User Perceived
    QoS) negotiation is achieved at \nsession signaling level using two types of new
    SDP extensions, which \nthis document proposes to specify. All session control
    elements - \nuser agents as well as proxies - involved in the multimedia session
    \nsetup may participate to the UPQoS negotiation\n\t "

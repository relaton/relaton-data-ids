- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6\nand
    IPsec/IKE and show how the two protocols can interwork.  We\npropose a set of
    extensions to the PF_KEY framework which allows\nsmooth and solid operation of
    IKE in a Mobile IPv6 environment.  The\nfirst extension is called PF_KEY MIGRATE
    and is for migrating the\nendpoint addresses of a IPsec Security Association pair
    in tunnel\nmode.  The second extension is named SADB_X_EXT_PACKET and allows IKE\nto
    make the right choice for address selection in bootstrapping\nprocess.  Both extensions
    are helpful for assuring smooth\ninterworking between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE
    and achieving\nperformance optimization.\n\t "

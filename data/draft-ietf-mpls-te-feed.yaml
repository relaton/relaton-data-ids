  content: "One key component of traffic engineering is a concept known as \nconstraint
    based routing. In constraint based routing a topology \ndatabase is maintained
    on all participating nodes. This database \ncontains a complete list of all the
    links in the network that \nparticipate in traffic engineering and for each of
    these links a set \nof constraints, which those links can meet. Bandwidth, for
    example, \nis one essential constraint. Since the bandwidth available changes
    \nas new LSPs are established and terminated the topology database \nwill develop
    inconsistencies with respect to the real network. It is \nnot possible to increase
    the flooding rates arbitrarily to keep the \ndatabase discrepancies from growing.
    A new mechanism is proposed \nwhereby a source node can learn about the successes
    or failures of \nits path selections by receiving feedback from the paths it is
    \nattempting. This information is most valuable in failure scenarious \nbut is
    benificial during other path setup functions as well. This \nfed-back information
    can be incorporated into subsequent route \ncomputations, which greatly improves
    the accuracy of the overall \nrouting solution by significantly reducing the database
    \ndiscrepancies.\n\t "

  content: "This document presents a new method - PXP- to connect IPvX islands\n   together
    over IPvY network and reduce the reliance on the relays of\n   existing transition
    mechanisms by shifting the burden to edge\n   gateways on each island.  In this
    method, direct tunnels are set up\n   between the IPvX islands, and a P2P overlay
    network is maintained\n   between their gateways to propagate information of tunnel
    end points.\n\n\t "

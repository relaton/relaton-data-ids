- language: en

  content: "   This document defines Rapid Start, a congestion-control startup\n   algorithm
    that grows the window by 3× per RTT until queue buildup is\n   observed, so that
    a sender can reach the path BDP faster than with\n   classic 2× slow start.  When
    congestion is observed, Rapid Start\n   immediately scales the window relative
    to the bytes that have passed\n   through the bottleneck and then hands over to
    normal recovery and\n   congestion avoidance.\n\n\t "

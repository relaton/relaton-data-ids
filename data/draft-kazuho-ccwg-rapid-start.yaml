abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Rapid Start, a congestion-control startup algorithm
    that grows the window by 3× per RTT until queue buildup is observed, so that a
    sender can reach the path BDP faster than with classic 2× slow start. When congestion
    is observed, Rapid Start immediately scales the window relative to the bytes that
    have passed through the bottleneck and then hands over to normal recovery and
    congestion avoidance.</p>"

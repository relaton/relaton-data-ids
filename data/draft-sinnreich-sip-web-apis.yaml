  content: "This memo describes a standards based approach to enable web based\n   interactive
    multimedia communications.  The objective is giving web\n   developers the software
    tools to add communication widgets to web\n   pages.\n\n   The proposed SIP API
    does not necessarily require SIP protocol\n   expertise by web developers for
    basic multimedia communications\n   though it can be extended to port complex
    VoIP services to the web.\n   The SIP API can also support the transition from
    network\n   infrastructure based VoIP to rich web based communications.\n\n   The
    benefits of the formal REST architecture of the web are extended\n   to real time
    communications.\n\n   Only two standard application layer protocols are required:
    HTTP for\n   signaling data communications such as in SIP and/or XMPP and UDP
    for\n   real time media transport. We consider replacing SDP with metadata\n   about
    media, displays and user controls.\n\n   RTP data functionality can also be moved
    to the application itself.\n   NAT traversal and other functions are delegated
    to HIP.\n\n\t "

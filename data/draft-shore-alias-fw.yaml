  content: "     In an increasingly complex internet it is becoming more common for\n
    \    endpoints to want to influence the behavior of network devices, and\n     for
    those devices to want to communicate with endpoints for autho-\n     rization
    and policy discover.  Frameworks and protocols are evolv-\n     ing for communication
    with application intermediaries and with net-\n     work edge policy enforcement
    devices.  One area that has received\n     relatively little attention to date
    is communication between end-\n     points and transport intermediaries.  This
    document presents a\n     problem statement and an overview of different communication
    mod-\n     els.\n\t "

  content: "The multi-granularity concept in optical networks is the ability to\nsimultaneously
    switch different levels of granularity inside a given\noptical network. Optical
    multi-granularity and particularly waveband\nswitching raises some issues for
    GMPLS. These have been partially\naddressed in [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG] from
    the CCAMP Working\nGroup. However, enabling multi-granularity in optical networks\ndemands
    the definition of a more complete set of requirements\nconsidering the management,
    control, routing and signaling issues\nand their impacts in the GMPLS protocols
    suite.\n\t "

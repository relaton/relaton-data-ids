  script: Latn
  content: "   The QUIC transport protocol is intended to be a general purpose\n   transport,
    but is currently defined for client-server operation only.\n   To be applicable
    to all use cases, it needs to develop support for\n   peer-to-peer connection
    establishment.  This memo describes how this\n   can be done, in outline form.
    \ Future work is needed to determine if\n   such peer-to-peer use of QUIC is desirable
    and, if so, to define a\n   complete and workable standard for peer-to-peer QUIC
    connection\n   establishment.\n\n\t "

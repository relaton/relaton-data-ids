  content: "Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible that\nthey
    have received new mail. Most of these methods involve polling\nto check for new
    messages periodically. A push method handled by the\nfinal delivery agent gives
    users quicker notifications and saves\nserver resources. This document does not
    specify the notification\nmethod but is expected that using existing instant messaging\ninfrastructure
    such as Zephyr, ICQ, or SMS messages will be popular.\nThis draft describes an
    extension to the Sieve mail filtering\nlanguage that allows users to give specific
    preferences for\nnotification of Sieve actions.\n\t "

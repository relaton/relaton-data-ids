  content: "   The Diameter Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC) solution\n   describes
    a mechanism for exchanging information about Diameter\n   Overload among Diameter
    nodes.  A DOIC node is a Diameter node that\n   acts as either a reporting node
    are a reacting node.  A reporting\n   node originates overload reports, requesting
    reacting nodes to reduce\n   the amount of traffic sent.  DOIC allows Diameter
    agents to act as\n   reporting nodes, reacting nodes, or both, but does not describe
    agent\n   behavior.  This document explores several use cases for agents to\n
    \  participate in overload control, and makes recommendations for\n   certain
    agent behaviors to be added to DOIC.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for transporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
    (L2TP), facilitates the tunneling of PPP packets across an intervening packet-switched
    network.  And yet a third protocol, PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) describes how to
    build PPP sessions and to encapsulate PPP packets over Ethernet.  L2TP Active
    Discovery Relay for PPPoE describes a method to relay Active Discovery and Service
    Selection functionality from PPPoE over the reliable control channel within L2TP.
    \ Two new L2TP control message types and associated PPPoE-specific Attribute Value
    Pairs (AVPs) for L2TP are defined.  This relay mechanism provides enhanced integration
    of a specific feature in the PPPoE tunneling protocol with L2TP.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

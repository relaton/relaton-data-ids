  content: "Vendors of consumer electronics and network gear have produced and\nsold
    hundreds of thousands of Internet hosts with globally routable\nInternet Protocol
    addresses embedded within their products' firmware.\nThese products are now in
    operation world-wide and primarily include,\nbut are not necessarily limited to,
    low-cost routers and middleboxes\nfor personal or residential use.\n\nThis 'hard-coding'
    of globally routable IP addresses within the\nhost's firmware presents significant
    problems to the operation of the\nInternet and to the management of its address
    space.\n\nThis document means to clarify best current practices in the Internet\ncommunity.
    \ It denouces the practice of embedding references to\nunique, globally routable
    IP addresses in Internet hosts, describes\nsome of the resulting problems, and
    considers selected alternatives.\nIt is also intended to remind the Internet community
    of the ephemeral\nnature of unique, globally routable IP addresses and that the\nassignment
    and use of such addresses is temporary and therefore\nshould not be used in fixed
    configurations.\n\t "

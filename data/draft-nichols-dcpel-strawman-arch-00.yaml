- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Diffserv (RFC 2474, 2475, and 3086) made explicit that \nIP QoS can be
    separated into the differentiated \ntreatment given to packets in the forwarding
    path and \nthe task of configuring these forwarding path \ncomponents to allocate
    QoS according to policy and \navailability. The IETF Diffserv WG described the
    \nforwarding path architecture in detail and specified \nsome specific forwarding
    path elements. This draft \nattempts a similar approach of specifying the elements
    \nof a diffserv control plane, gives a general \narchitecture and example solution
    that fits into this \narchitecture, and lays out some issues. An example of a
    \ndiffserv control plane architecture is presented, \nderived from the control
    plane described in RFC2638, \nand an example implementation of that approach is
    \nbriefly described. The authors hope to stimulate a \ndiscussion of the architectural
    model and its elements \nand to elicit more example solutions that may fit, \nchange,
    or extend the model. \n\nA control plane must be configurable, secure, and \nmonitorable.
    The authors believe the operations and \nmanagement issues of a diffserv control
    plane must be \nmade explicit and the approach to solving them properly \nconstrained.
    Resolving operational and management \nissues is key to moving to availability
    of IP QoS. \n\nA pdf version of this document is available at: \nwww.pollere.com

  content: "   When multiple Mobile Routers share the same prefix, a Home Agent must\n
    \  be able to verify whether the Mobile Routers share the same Mobile\n   Network
    or not.  Otherwise, the Home Agent may not be able to forward\n   a data packet
    to a correct recipient since the recipient may not be\n   connected to the mobile
    router the Home Agent chooses to forward the\n   packet.  This document describes
    a Token based Duplicate Network\n   Detection mechanism that enables a Home Agent
    to detect whether\n   multiple Mobile Rotuers claiming the same prefix are in
    the same\n   Mobile Network.\n\t "

  content: "This draft specifies a third generation wireless architecture that is
    consistent with the requirements set by the International\n   Telecommunications
    Union (ITU) for International Mobile\n   Telecommunications 2000 (IMT-2000)systems.
    \ IMT-2000 systems will\n   provide wireless voice, high speed data, and multimedia
    services.\n   This draft has been developed by the Telecommunications Industry\n
    \  Association (TIA) Standards Subcommittee TR45.6.  As a guiding\n   principle
    this draft has leveraged the use of RFCs and Internet\n   drafts wherever possible,
    including Mobile IP and AAA. A network\n   reference model is provided, along
    with a set of more detailed\n   requirements. Finally a list of supporting RFCs
    and Internet Drafts\n   is presented.\n\t "

  content: "For many reasons, remote participation in IETF meetings has increased.\nAs
    the Internet grows, so does the participation by engineers worldwide.\nRemote
    participation with more than one person is considered a hub.\n\nThree types of
    remote hubs are defined.   Some exist today; other types\nmay exist in the future.
    \  Each has its own characteristics.\n\n   - Remote Participation Hubs (future)\n
    \  - Remote Viewing Hubs (today)\n   - Enduring Local Meetups (today)\n\nThis
    document defines a Remote Viewing Hub (RVH).  Other documents\ndefine the other
    types of hubs.  A common structure of sections will be\nused as far as possible
    for all hub types.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Incident Detection Message Exchange Format version 2 (IDMEFv2)\n
    \  provides a way to describe any incidents detected on cyber and/or\n   physical
    infrastructures.\n\n   The format is agnostic so it can be used in standalone
    or combined\n   cyber (SIEM), physical (PSIM) and availability (NMS) monitoring\n
    \  systems.  IDMEFv2 can also be used to describe cyber and physical\n   potential
    threats (CTI/PTI).\n\n   IDMEF improves situational awareness by facilitating
    correlation of\n   multiple types of events using the same base format thus enabling\n
    \  efficient detection of complex and combined cyber and physical\n   attacks
    on critical infrastructures.\n\n   If approved this document would obsolete RFC4767.\n\n\t "

  content: "There are multiple environments where IPv6 transition techniques can\nbe
    used.  There are multiple IPv6 transition techniques.  This\ndocument describes
    the applicability of transition techniques based\non the Tunnel Setup Protocol(TSP)
    used in different environments,\nsuch as: provider, enterprise, unmanaged networks,
    cable-dsl\noperators, wireless operators, mobile hosts and networks.  TSP\nenables
    the automation of prefix assignment, DNS delegation and\nrouting preferences.
    \ TSP supports IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv4 over IPv6\nencapsulations, as well as UDP-IPv4
    encapsulation for IPv4 NAT\ntraversals, through automatic NAT discovery.\n\t "

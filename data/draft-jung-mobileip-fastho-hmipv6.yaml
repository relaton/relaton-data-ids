  content: "This document addresses Fast Handover over HMIPv6 networks. The MIPv6
    \nmobility could be more enhanced by combining FMIPv6 with HMIPv6, in \nwhich
    MIPv6 is benefited from all the advantages of the respective \nschemes. An additional
    benefit by combining FMIPv6 with HMIPv6 is that \nthe overall handover latency
    in FMIPv6 will be more reduced since in \nHMIPv6 the MN sends a location update
    with the local MAP, rather than \nthe HA and CN that are typically further way.
    This document describes \nhow to use FMIPv6 for HMIPv6 (F-HMIPv6). The F-HMIPv6
    is designed to \nbe friendly with the data transport feature of HMIPv6. In F-HMIPv6,
    \nthe tunnel for fast handover is established between MAP and NAR, \nrather than
    between PAR and NAR. For this purpose, the MN exchanges \nthe FMIPv6 messages
    with MAP, not PAR. The F-HMIPv6 utilizes the \nFMIPv6 messages for handover support
    without further defining any new \nmessages. \n\t "

  content: "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technique whereby a device,\nknown
    as an RFID 'reader', can remotely sense the presence of, and\naccess embedded
    memory on, a transponder known as a 'tag'. Tags may be\naffixed to objects as
    a means of tracking the location and movement of\nsaid objects within facilities
    equipped with RFID readers.  Typically,\nreaders communicate with upstream devices,
    in this document referred to\nas 'controllers', to receive control commands and
    upload read tag\ninformation.\n\nThis draft specifies the Simple Lightweight RFID
    Reader Protocol, or\nSLRRP (pronounced 'slurp'), to be used to convey configuration,
    control,\nstatus, and tag information between controllers and readers in an IP-\nbased
    network.\n\t "

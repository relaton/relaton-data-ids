    management protocols in the Internet community.  In\nparticular, it describes
    managed objects used for managing tunnels\nof any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
    \ Extension MIBs may be\ndesigned for managing protocol-specific objects. Likewise,\nextension
    MIBs may be designed for managing security-specific\nobjects.  This MIB does not
    support tunnels over non-IP networks.\nManagement of such tunnels may be supported
    by other MIBs.\n\t "

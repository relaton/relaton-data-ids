  content: "This document describes a framework and Service Provider requirements
    \n   for operating Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic \n   engineering
    (TE) networks over Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. \n    \n   Operation of
    an MPLS-TE network as a client network to a GMPLS \n   network has enhanced operational
    capabilities than provided by a co-\n   existent protocol model (ships in the
    night). \n    \n   The GMPLS network may be a packet or a non-packet network,
    and may \n   itself be a multi-layer network supporting both packet and non-packet
    \n   technologies. A MPLS-TE Label Switched Path (LSP) originates and \n   terminates
    on an MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR). The GMPLS network \n   provides transparent
    transport for the end-to-end MPLS-TE LSP. \n    \n   Specification of solutions
    is out of scope for this document.\n\t "

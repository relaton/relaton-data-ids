  content: "   The intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track as an\n
    \  Informational RFC.\n \n   The EDIINT [AS1], [AS2] and [AS3] message formats
    do not currently\n   contain any provisions for preservation of the filename of
    a\n   transmitted EDI business document from one Trading Partner to\n   another.\n
    \  \n   However,within certain trading communities, it is not uncommon for\n   Trading
    Partners to require a specific filenames for EDI business\n   documents to trigger
    specific backend processing. So it is\n   the goal of this informational document
    to outline the procedures\n   and mechanisms required to preserve filenames of
    EDI business\n   documents.\n\n\t "

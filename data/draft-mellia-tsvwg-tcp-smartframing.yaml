  content: "In this document we present an enhancement to the TCP protocol, \n\ncalled
    TCP Smart Framing, or TCP-SF for short, that enables the Fast \n\nRetransmit/Recovery
    algorithm even when the congestion window is \n\nsmall, i.e., for short-lived
    flows, as most of the current Internet \n\ntraffic is.  Without modifying the
    TCP congestion control based on \n\nthe additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease
    paradigm, TCP-SF \n\nadopts a novel segmentation algorithm: while Classic TCP
    starts \n\nsending IW segments, a TCP-SF source is allowed to always send an \n\ninitial
    window of 4 smaller segments, whose aggregate payload is \n\nequal to the connection's
    SMSS. This key idea can be implemented on \n\ntop of any TCP flavor, from Tahoe
    to SACK, and requires \n\nmodifications to the server behavior only.\n\t "

  content: "The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [2] provides a standard method for transporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP datagrams are often encapsulated
    in HDLC frames [1] when used over standard analog modems.                                                    This
    document describes the extensions to PPP encapsulation and HDLC framing to support
    Quality of Service (QoS) over low bandwidth links.      This document is a submission
    to the IETF ISSLL working group. Comments are solicited and should be addressed
    to the working group's mailing list at issll@mercury.lcs.mit.edu and/or the author.
    \                           This document is an update of the previous version
    which was named 'draft-andrades-framing-ext-00.txt' and was revised as a result
    of discussions with Carsten Bormann, as well as the discussions at the September
    30th meeting of the ISSLL working group.\n\t "

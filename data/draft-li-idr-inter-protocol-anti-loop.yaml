  content: "   BGP and IGP are commonly used network protocols during network\n   construction.
    \ At the beginning of BGP protocol design, EBGP and IBGP\n   loop prevention are
    considered.  Similarly, the IGP protocol has a\n   loop prevention mechanism.
    \ In actual deployment, some or even all\n   routes of the two protocols are imported
    to each other.  Route import\n   causes the loss of the anti-loop attribute of
    the protocol.  As a\n   result, the anti-loop fails.\n\n   This document provides
    a feasible solution to the above problems.\n   Attribute information is added
    when routes are imported between\n   protocols.  The added attribute information
    can be advertised to\n   neighboring neighbors through BGP peers or IGP peers.
    \ How the new\n   attributes are advertised using IGP peers is beyond the scope
    of this\n   article.\n\n\n\t "

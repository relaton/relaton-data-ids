  content: "   The application of summoning emergency assistance by using a phone
    to\n   call 9-1-1 in North America has been ingrained in society for 40+\n   years.
    \ A successful emergency response to a caller in need, is\n   dependent upon the
    responders receiving accurate location information\n   to effect timely action.
    \ Traditional wireline telephony is able to\n   utilize the location of the physical
    wires as a source of information\n   for caller location, whereas wireless technologies
    require more\n   exotic mechanisms to locate a 9-1-1 caller.\n\n   Mechanisms
    for locating a cellular caller dialing 9-1-1 is based on\n   20 year old technology,
    which was designed for outdoor environments,\n   and does not perform sufficiently
    when used to locate an emergency\n   caller from within a home or office building
    environment.\n\n   With growing trends in mobile cellular usage, large portions
    of\n   subscribers are relying solely on their mobile phones to make\n   emergency
    calls.  Emergency response time suffers when that caller is\n   located indoors.\n\n
    \  This document defines the problem statement and solutions for\n   expanding
    the current set of methods used to locate a cellular caller\n   to 9-1-1.  The
    expansion of the methods includes connections to\n   services that are outside
    the normal administrative domain of the\n   cellular provider, hence both the
    privacy and security aspects of\n   connecting these systems are taken into consideration.\n\n\t "

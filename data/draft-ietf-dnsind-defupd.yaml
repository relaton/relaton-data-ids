  script: Latn
  content: "Not all applications that perform dynamic updates using the protocol specified
    in [UPDATE] want their updates applied immediately.  A case in point is [DHCP],
    wherein the DHCP lease time should control the lifetime of associated DNS data
    even if the DHCP client or server is not available at the time the DHCP lease
    expires.                                        The essence of this proposal is
    that DNS Dynamic Updates should be deferrable for some time delay period, after
    which they will be executed normally.  Furthermore, RRs added or updated by a
    deferred update can have expiration times specified for them, as enforced by the
    automatic Dynamic Updates.  Automatic serial number changes (as in [UPDATE]),
    dynamic zone slave notification (see [NOTIFY]) and incremental zone transfer (see
    [IXFR]) will jointly see to it that the zone changes are propagated with expedience.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The NAT-PT, one of the IPv6 transition mechanisms, supports IPv6 node\n
    \  in a NAT-PT domain to communicate with IPv4-only nodes outside.\n   However,
    due to the IP datagram conversion at the NAT-PT server, \n   NAT-PT node has a
    problem in establishing the end-to-end security \n   using the IPsec IKE and AH
    mode. This memo describes the reason why \n   the problem is caused and proposes
    a solution for assuring the \n   end-to-end security using IPsec in the NAT-PT
    environment. \n\t "

  content: "This paper Discusses several points Lacking in the presentation of the\nIEPS
    Specification, and Condemns others as unwarranted mandates, which\ndefines the
    Internet and its use as a Vehicle for WAR. The Alternative,\n'GWEBS', develops
    is a more realistic foundation that supports saving\nlives (Addressing the Concerns
    of all People in General, Regardless)\nduring the Occurrence of some Catastrophic
    Event, which is the mandate it mintains regarding the Implementation of a Uniform
    Universal Protocol\nthat is the foundation for the 'Global Wide Emergency Broadcast
    System'\nthat is used to Protect the lives and Livelihoods of all the Inhabitants\nof
    Our Planet. Furthermore, this paper also addresses a more fundamental\nconcern
    that requires the involvement of the UN (United Nations), which\nwould mandate
    the Implementation of a World Wide Global Internet Backbone for every Country.
    The Development of such World Wide Global\nInfrastructure (A Global System to
    be sure) would guarantee uniform Access for All People, and would establish the
    necessary Foundation,\ninfrastructure, as would be required for any Global Wide
    Emergency\nBroadcast System (GWEBS) to work. \nIn other words, this paper supports
    the belief that Information, and the\nexchange or the sharing related thereto,
    is just as important as the\nSustenance Consumed, which indeed, is the Vital Necessity
    used to \nsustain Life itself.\n\t "

  content: "   A server in the Domain Name System can use a mechanism called\n   \"referral\"
    to indicate that the server is not authoritative for a\n   given zone, and to
    redirect the query to another, more appropriate\n   server.  The mechanism was
    originally specified such that a referral\n   might be to any location in the
    DNS.  Operational experience\n   indicates dubious value to referrals other than
    those to zones below\n   the zones for which a server is authoritative.  This
    memo therefore\n   recommends such referrals and discourages other kinds of referrals.\n\n\t "

  content: "As use of the Internet has become widespread, it's become increasingly\nclear
    that the URL -- the mechanism most users employ to designate\nresources -- is
    inherently confusing to non-technical users, and to a\ngreat extent, is unusable
    by them.  For that reason, an easier naming\nscheme that employs human-friendly
    names ('HFNs') is desirable and\nnecessary.  Such schemes have been discussed
    at length in RFCs 1737[1],\n2276[2] and 2168[3].\n\nAs use of the Internet has

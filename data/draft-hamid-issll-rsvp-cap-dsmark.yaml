  content: "The DCLASS object is proposed in [DCLASS] to represent and carry \nDifferentiated
    Services Code Points (DSCPs) within RSVP messages. The\nprinciple use of the DCLASS
    object is to carry DSCP information\nbetween a DS network and upstream nodes that
    may wish to mark packets\nwith DSCP values. A network element in the DS network
    determines the\nvalue for DSCP which is further carried as a DCLASS object in
    RSVP \nRESV message to the sender host. The RSVP capability negotiation CAP\nObject
    [RSVP_CAP] is proposed to convey end host/upstream node \nCapabilities to the
    downstream network.\n\n\t "

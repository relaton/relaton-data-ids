  content: "   This document describes a mechanism to establish traffic\n   engineering
    IP tunnels. Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) is\n   used as a signaling protocol
    described in Generalized\n   Multi-Protocol Lable Swithing (GMPLS) RSVP Traffic
    Engineering\n   technology, but no MPLS forwarding capability is assumed on the\n
    \  switched path. IP routing is used to switch IP traffic trunks.\n   A simple
    GMPLS RSVP Traffic Engineering extension is needed to\n   setup the IP Route Switched
    Paths (RSPs).\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initial\n   assessment
    of proposed TCP modifications.  The goal of the test suite\n   is to allow researchers
    to quickly and easily evaluate their proposed\n   TCP extensions in simulators
    and testbeds using a common set of well-\n   defined, standard test cases, in
    order to compare and contrast\n   proposals against standard TCP as well as other
    proposed\n   modifications.  This test suite is not intended to result in an\n
    \  exhaustive evaluation of a proposed TCP modification or new\n   congestion
    control mechanism.  Instead, the focus is on quickly and\n   easily generating
    an initial evaluation report that allows the\n   networking community to understand
    and discuss the behavioral aspects\n   of a new proposal, in order to guide further
    experimentation that\n   will be needed to fully investigate the specific aspects
    of such\n   proposal.\n\n\t "

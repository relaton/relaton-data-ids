  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft proposes a new optional event to trigger address\n   resolution
    using IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.  This helps optimize router\n   performance, and
    can help mitigate certain potential ND-related\n   denial-of-service attacks.
    \ Upon receiving a DAD-NS message, the\n   neighbor solicitation message used
    to detect duplicate addresses, if\n   the target address encoded in the DAD-NS
    is not a duplicate address,\n   the receiving device responds by triggering address
    resolution for\n   the target address in the DAD-NS, in preparation for expectant
    future\n   communication with the sending device.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes some additions to the specification of the\n   Protocol
    Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) Protocol\n   regarding security issues
    of its link-local messages.  Although the\n   new specifications for IPsec architecture
    (RFC 4301) and\n   Authorization Header (RFC 4302) permit the use of anti-replay,
    they\n   counsel against its use for multi-sender, multicast Security\n   Associations.
    \ This makes PIM-SM vulnerable to Denial of Service\n   (DoS) attack.  In this
    document, a new proposal is presented to\n   protect PIM link-local messages while
    activating the anti-replay\n   mechanism as well.  This proposal builds on the
    new Security\n   Association lookup method that has been specified in RFC 4301
    and RFC\n   4302.\n\t "

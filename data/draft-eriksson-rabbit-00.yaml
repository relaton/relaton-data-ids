  content: "This document identifies and categorizes the components of routing,\nswitching,
    forwarding, and addressing that may be used in routing\narchitectures.  The intention
    is to support the development of a new\nrouting architecture for the Internet.\nThe
    addressing architecture, address allocation and assignment\nprinciples, and possibilities
    for renumbering are important aspects\nwhen designing a routing architecture.
    \ How routing information is\nlearned and methods for distributing it are other
    issues discussed in\nthis document.  A number of methods for data traffic forwarding
    are\nalso described and evaluated\n\n\t "

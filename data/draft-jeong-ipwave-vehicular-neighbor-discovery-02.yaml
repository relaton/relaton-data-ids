  content: "   This document specifies an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)\n
    \  for rapid network prefix and service discovery in vehicular networks.\n   It
    is assumed that a vehicle or a Road-Side Unit (RSU) have an\n   external network
    interface and their internal network.  The extended\n   IPv6 ND called vehicular
    ND can support vehicle-to-infrastructure\n   communications as well as vehicle-to-vehicle
    communications.  This\n   document defines new ND options to allow a vehicle to
    announce the\n   network prefixes and services inside its internal network to
    another\n   vehicle or RSU.\n\n\t "

  content: "A number of protocols have been defined at the IETF to handle IP\nmobility
    and multi-homing - each of the defined protocols satisfies a\ndifferent set of
    requirements - however, there is an overlap on some\nof the requirements and features
    among many of these protocols.  In\npractice, a combination of the protocols are
    likely to be deployed in\na system.  There are various such combinations plausible,
    but some\ncombinations are more realistic than others.  This document analyzes\nthe
    overall mobility and multi-homing architecture and highlights\nsome key points
    to consider while deploying an architecture\nconsisting of one or more of these
    protocols.  The protocols\nconsidered in scope for this document include Mobile
    IPv4 (MIPv4),\nMobile IPv6 (MIPv6), Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), Fast Mobile\nIPv6
    (FMIPv6), Network-based Local Mobility Management (NetLMM),\nMOBIKE, Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP), and Shim6.\n\t "

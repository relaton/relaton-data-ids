  content: "   The SIP event notification framework is specified in RFC 3265.  The\n
    \  framework restricts usage to notifications of events related to the\n   SIP
    state.  However, there is growing interest in the community for\n   relaxing that
    constraint and using the SIP event notification\n   framework for reporting changes
    in state that is not directly related\n   to SIP.  For example, it has been suggested
    a usage of the framework\n   for reporting events related to a vehicle state,
    files stored in a\n   device, calendar events, and Sieve notifications.  This
    memo\n   discusses the benefits of a mechanism for general event notifications\n
    \  using SIP.\n\n\t "

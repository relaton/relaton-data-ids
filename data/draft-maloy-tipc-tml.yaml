  content: "   This document describes a ForCES [ForCES] Transport Mapping layer\n
    \  (TML) based on the Transparent Inter Process Communication service\n   [TIPC].
    \ It is intended to be used when the ForCES protocol is\n   transported over L2
    carriers such as Ethernet, RapidIO or PCI-\n   Express.  TIPC has been specially
    designed for efficient and easy-to-\n   use communication over L2 carriers, and
    is typically used to define\n   clusters of loosely coupled nodes in such environments.\n\t "

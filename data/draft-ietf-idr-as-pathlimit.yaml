  content: "   This document describes the 'AS path limit' (AS_PATHLIMIT) path\n   attribute
    for BGP.  This is an optional, transitive path attribute\n   that is designed
    to help limit the distribution of routing\n   information in the Internet.\n\n
    \  By default, prefixes advertised into the BGP graph are distributed\n   freely,
    and if not blocked by policy will propagate globally.  This\n   is harmful to
    the scalability of the routing subsystem since\n   information that only has a
    local effect on routing will cause state\n   creation throughout the default-free
    zone.  This attribute can be\n   attached to a particular path to limit its scope
    to a subset of the\n   Internet.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Kerberos protocol does not allow ticket extensions.  This make it\nharder
    to deploy features like PKCROSS.\n\nSince the Kerberos protocol did not specified
    extensibility for the\nTicket structure and the current implementations are aware
    of the\ncontents of tickets, the extension protocol cannot simply extend the\nTicket
    ASN.1 structure.  Instead, the extension data needs to be\nhidden inside the ticket.\n\nThis
    protocol defines two methods to add extend the tickets.  The\nfirst method requires
    updated clients and is more in line with the\nfuture development of Kerberos.
    \ The second way does not require\nupdate client.  To take advantage of this protocol
    the server (KDC or\napplication server) need to update a well.  The two methods
    are\nequivalent and there is a 1-1 mapping between them.\n\t "

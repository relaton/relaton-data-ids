  content: "   The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success\n
    \  in information technology of the last half century.  As the Internet\n   becomes
    pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for\n   many domain-specific
    solutions, but it also has been extended to\n   better fit the specificities of
    the different use cases.  For\n   Internet addressing in particular, as it is
    defined in RFC 791 for\n   IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively, there exist
    many\n   extensions.  Those extensions have been developed to evolve the\n   addressing
    capabilities beyond the basic properties of Internet\n   addressing.  This document
    discusses the properties the IP addressing\n   model, showcasing the continuing
    need to extend it and the methods\n   used for doing so.\n\n\t "

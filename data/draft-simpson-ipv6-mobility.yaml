  content: "This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent routing
    of IPv6 datagrams to Mobile Nodes in the Internet.  The Mobile Node is always
    identified by its Home-Address, regardless of its current point of attachment
    to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a Mobile Node is also associated
    with a Care-Of-Address, which provides information about its current point of
    attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for registering the Care-Of-Address
    with a Home Agent.  The Home Agent sends traffic destined for the Mobile Node
    through a tunnel to the Care-Of-Address.\n\t "

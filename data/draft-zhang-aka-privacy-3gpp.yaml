  content: "   This document contains a privacy protection scheme for the AKA\n   agreement
    in the 3GPP standards.  Specifically, this document\n   RECOMMENDS that each user
    owns a encryption key updated in real time,\n   with which to encrypt the user
    identity.  Comparing with the\n   asymmetric encryption and alias assignment,
    the symmetric encryption\n   scheme proposed in this document not only reduce
    the computation\n   burden, but also prevent the legal user from being located
    and\n   tracked.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes these new SDP \"proto\" attribute values:\n
    \  \"QUIC\", \"QUIC/RTP/SAVP\", \"QUIC/RTP/AVPF\", and \"QUIC/RTP/SAVPF\", and\n
    \  describes how SDP Offer/Answer can be used to set up an RTP\n   connection
    using QUIC as a transport protocol.\n\n   These proto values are necessary to
    allow the use of QUIC as an\n   underlying transport protocol for applications
    that commonly use SDP\n   as a session signaling protocol to set up RTP connections
    with UDP as\n   its underlying transport protocol, such as SIP and WebRTC.\n\n\t "

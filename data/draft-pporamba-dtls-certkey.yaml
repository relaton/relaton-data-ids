  content: "   The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) stands for the universal\n   interconnection
    of smart objects and back end users with the help of\n   IP protocols.  Secure
    key management among the smart objects is an\n   important aspect of IoT security.
    \ Due to the high levels of resource\n   constraints of the devices in terms of
    memory, battery capacity and\n   CPU power, and other network characteristics
    such as mobility,\n   scalability, heterogeneity and limited bandwidth, the conventional\n
    \  security protocols cannot be directly deployed in IoT networks in\n   their
    raw formats.  We propose a lightweight DTLS-based keying\n   mechanism for CoAP
    IoT smart objects which supports the scalability\n   of the network and node mobility.
    \ In addition to the key\n   establishment part the protocol also provides node
    authentication.\n   The protocol consumes less device resources and minimum network\n
    \  bandwidth by incurring low message overhead.  The smart objects can\n   securely
    access the network and obtain certificates after an initial\n   configuration
    irrespective of the manufacturer standards.\n\n\n\t "

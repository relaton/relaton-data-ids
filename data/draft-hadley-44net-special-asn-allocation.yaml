abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes reserving a pool of Autonomous System Numbers
    (ASNs) for the Amateur Radio Digital Communications Network (44Net, also known
    as AMPRNet). 44Net traces its origins to the early 1980s when the Class A network
    44.0.0.0/8 was set aside for amateur packet radio, enabling worldwide experimental
    and operational use by licensed radio amateurs. Recent work, including Ursini’s
    proposal to reserve the IPv6 block 44::/16 for amateur radio, demonstrates ongoing
    efforts to secure dedicated Internet resources for the community. To complement
    these efforts, this document recommends reserving approximately 25,000 ASNs for
    distribution to licensed radio operators and 44Net operators to support past,
    present, and future allocations, simplify routing and resource management, and
    make it straightforward to identify 44Net participants on the global Internet.</p>"

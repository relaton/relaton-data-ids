  content: "The OSI transport service may be realized through a variety of transport/network
    protocol combinations.  Regrettably, few of the combinations actually interoperate
    with each other.  As such, even if all OSI-capable end-systems enjoyed full-connectivity,
    they would not be able to uniformly interoperate.                                                                                                                            This
    memo examines the problem and proposes an approach in order to develop solutions
    to this problem.\n\t "

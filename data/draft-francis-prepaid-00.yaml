  content: "Prepaid voice services have proven to be extremely successful.  \nThere
    is a desire to replicate this success for data services. \nPrepaid for data presents
    new technical challenges, primarily due to  \nthe wide range of billing that may
    be applied to data services---\nvolume or time billing, differential billing by
    type of application \n(gaming, steaming, browsing, voice), billing by destination,
    and \neven billing of specific content.  Furthermore, a single data \nprepaid
    service may need to accomodate simultaneous network access \nby multiple devices
    (phone, laptop, PDA). \nThis paper discusses design issues for a protocol between
    a prepaid \napplication and the data network element.  It defines an \narchitecture
    and terminology.  It describes basic characteristics of \ndata prepaid service,
    as well as some advanced features.  It \nanalyzes the main technical issues, especially
    performance issues.  \nFinally, this paper describes the semantics of an illustrative
    \nprepaid data service protocol.  This document does not, however, \nspecify such
    a protocol.  \n\n\t "

  content: "Stateless DHCPv6 [DHCPv6Light] is a light-weight DHCPv6 [DHCPv6]\nprotocol
    in which the server manages only the service parameters like\nDNS server addresses,
    NTP server addresses etc., and hence there is\nno need to maintain the state of
    the clients, perhaps, it doesn't\nneed to store any information about the clients
    at all.  So, a\nrenumbering event or change in some of the configuration parameters\ncannot
    be notified to the clients by the stateless DHCPv6 server.\nThis specification
    provides a solution for this.\n\t "

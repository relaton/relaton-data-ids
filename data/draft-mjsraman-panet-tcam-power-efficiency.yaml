- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification entails enabling power and performance management\n
    \  in Routers (multi-chassis and single chassis) with respect to TCAM\n   and
    SRAM usage on intelligent router line cards  that implement\n   Virtual Aggregation
    of routes.\n\n   The version 00 of this document had several errata that have
    been\n   addressed in this version. This scheme relates to unicast alone since\n
    \  multicast entries are programmed only after consultation with the\n   unicast
    entries in the software plane in the Route processor. Hence\n   this scheme does
    not apply to multicast.\n\n\t "

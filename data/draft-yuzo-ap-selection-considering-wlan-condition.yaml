  content: "This document discusses AP selection method utilizing the number of \nframe
    retransmissions in addition to received signal strength (RSSI).\nIn a real environment,
    WLANs are congested by lots of mobile nodes,\nand sometimes influenced by other
    WLAN devices. They result in \ndeterioration of communication quality. In such
    environment, \neach mobile node has to select an AP with better performance for
    \nkeeping its own communication stable. To enable this, we employ \nthe number
    of frame retransmissions and RSSI as selection indexes.\nWe then describe an architecture
    design and implementation for our\nproposed scheme.\n\t "

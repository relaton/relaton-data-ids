abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "For various reasons it may be desirable to separate the\n   functionality
    of a mobility agent, such as the home and foreign\n   agents in Mobile IP [Perkins96],
    from their link-layer presence on a\n   given network.  This draft outlines mechanisms
    based on the Tunnel\n   Establishment Protocol [Calhoun98a] for accomplishing
    this.  The\n   tunnels so established will not be visible to a mobile node and\n
    \  therefore provide a transparent way to build hierarchies of mobility\n   agents,
    which can lessen the frequency of Mobile IP re-\n   registrations.\n\t "

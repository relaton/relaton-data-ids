  content: "   This document describes the features and attributes a network quality\n
    \  framework must have to be useful for different stakeholders.  The\n   stakeholders
    included are developers of Applications, End-Users, and\n   Network Operators
    and Vendors.  At a high level, End-Users need an\n   understandable network metric.
    \ Application developers need a network\n   metric that allows them to evaluate
    how well their application is\n   likely to perform given the measured network
    performance.  Network\n   Operators and Vendors need a metric that facilitates
    troubleshooting\n   and optimization of their networks.  Existing network quality
    metrics\n   and frameworks typically address the needs of one or two of these\n
    \  stakeholders, but we have yet to find one that bridges the needs of\n   all
    three.\n\n\t "

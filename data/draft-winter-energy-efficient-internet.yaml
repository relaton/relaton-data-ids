  content: "   Climate change and cost drives all sectors of industry and society
    as\n   a whole towards more energy-efficient technology, products and life\n   styles.
    \ The collection of Internet infrastructure and the attached\n   devices are a
    large user of electrical energy and therefore of course\n   are no exception regarding
    this trend.  This memo attempts to\n   identify obstacles and more importantly
    technology options for an\n   energy-efficient Internet with a focus on the protocols
    that are the\n   product of the IETF.\n\n\t "

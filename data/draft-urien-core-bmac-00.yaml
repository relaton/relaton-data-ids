  script: Latn
  content: "   In this draft context, things are powered by micro controllers units\n
    \  (MCU) comprising a set of memories such as static RAM (SRAM), FLASH\n   and
    EEPROM. The total memory size, ranges from 10KB to a few\n   megabytes.\n   In
    this context code and data integrity is a major security issue,\n   for the deployment
    of Internet of Things infrastructure. The goal of\n   the bijective MAC (bMAC)
    is to compute an integrity value, which\n   cannot be guessed by malicious software.\n
    \  In classical keyed MAC, MAC is computing according to a fix order.\n   In the
    bijective MAC, the content of N addresses is hashed according\n   to a permutation
    P (i.e. bijective application).\n   The bijective MAC key is the permutation P.\n
    \  The number of permutations for N addresses is N!. So the computation\n   of
    the bMAC requires the knowledge of the whole space memory; this\n   is trivial
    for genuine software, but could very difficult for\n   corrupted software.\n\n\n\t "

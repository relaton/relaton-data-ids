  content: "This note sets requirements for a new routing and addressing \narchitecture
    for the Internet.  These requirements were \ndeveloped by the IRTF's Routing Research
    Group. \nThis draft is the product of Group ~B, which is one of the \nsubgroups
    in the IRTF-Routing Research Group working on \nrequirements for routing solutions
    for the future.  This \ndocument sets out requirements that we believe are important
    \nfor a future routing architecture and routing protocols.  The \nIRTF Routing
    Research Group (RRG) does not endorse this set of \nrequirements or any other
    set of requirements as the one and \nonly set of requirements. \n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Many protocols provide for header fields to be added to a packet on\n
    \  ingress to a network domain and removed on egress from that domain.\n   Examples
    of such fields are Tenant ID for multi-tenant networks,\n   ingress port ID and/or
    type, and other identity or handling directive\n   fields.  These fields mean
    that a packet may be accompanied by\n   supplemental information as it transits
    the network domain that would\n   not be present with the packet or not be visible
    if it were simply\n   forwarded in a traditional manner.  A particular concern
    is that\n   these fields may harm privacy by identifying, in greater detail, the\n
    \  packet source and intended traffic handling.  This document provides\n   Security
    Considerations for the inclusion of such fields with a\n   packet.\n\n\t "

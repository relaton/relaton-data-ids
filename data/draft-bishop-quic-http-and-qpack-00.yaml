abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   HTTP/2 [RFC7540] uses HPACK [RFC7541] for header compression.\n   However,
    HPACK relies on the in-order message-based semantics of the\n   HTTP/2 framing
    layer in order to function.  Messages can only be\n   successfully decoded if
    processed by the receiver in the same order\n   as generated by the sender.  This
    draft refines HPACK to loosen the\n   ordering requirements for use over QUIC\n
    \  [I-D.hamilton-quic-transport-protocol] and describes changes to\n   [I-D.shade-quic-http2-mapping]
    to leverage the new compression.\n\n\t "

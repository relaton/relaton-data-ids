  content: "This document defines a mechanism by which a SIP server acting as a\ntraditional
    Private Branch Exchange (PBX) can register with a SIP\nService Provider (SSP)
    to receive phone calls for extensions\ndesignated by phone numbers.  In order
    to function properly, this\nmechanism relies on the fact that the phone numbers
    are fully\nqualified and globally unique.\n\t "

  content: "EAP-Double-TLS is an EAP protocol that extends EAP-TLS. In EAP-TLS, \na
    full TLS handshake is used to mutually authenticate a peer and \nserver and to
    share a secret key. EAP-Double-TLS extends this \nauthentication negotiation by
    establishing a secure connection based \non the use of Pre Shared Keys (PSK).
    The secure connection may then \nbe used to allow the server and the peer to securely
    exchange their \nidentity and to update security attributes for next sessions.
    \n    \nEAP-Double-TLS allows the peer and the server to establish keying \nmaterial
    for use in the data connection between the peer and the \nauthenticator. The keying
    material is established implicitly between \npeer and server based on the TLS
    Pre-Shared-Key handshake. \n\n\t "

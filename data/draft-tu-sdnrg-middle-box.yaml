  content: "   This document describes a middle box to improve the utilization of\n
    \  data centers. By first combining Clos network with Software Defined\n   Network
    (SDN), the middle box is programmable and nonblocking. SDN\n   controller in the
    middle box can collect information such as traffic\n   load, port speed, and resources
    utilization, which can be used to\n   get better efficiency. The nonblocking feature
    can effectively\n   reduce the delay caused by the middle box thus get the better\n
    \  performance. Furthermore, the middle box is transparent for the\n   original
    network, so it can be readily implemented for today's data\n   centers.\n\n\t "

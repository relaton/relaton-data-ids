  content: "   The HTTP/2 spec requires that TLS renegotiation not be employed when\n
    \  the negotiated application protocol is HTTP/2.  This document defines\n   an
    extension to HTTP/2 which permits renegotiation to be employed by\n   peers which
    mutually consent to do so, while allowing peers to\n   understand whether renegotiation
    is permitted before attempting it.\n\n\t "

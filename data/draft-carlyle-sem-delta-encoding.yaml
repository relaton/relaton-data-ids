  content: "   Semantic Delta Encoding with HTTP defines an efficient stateless\n
    \  mechanism for multiple clients to become synchronised and stay\n   synchronised
    with a large resource through the transmission of\n   semantic deltas (distinct
    from RFC3229), and supports a long poll\n   option for timely delivery.  It is
    intended to support web browsers\n   needing to keep up to date with changes of
    state on an origin server\n   as well as to support a wide variety of other realtime
    and non-\n   realtime synchronisation requirements between communicating systems.\n\n\t "

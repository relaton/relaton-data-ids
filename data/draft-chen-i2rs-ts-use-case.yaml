  content: "   Traffic steering (TS) mechanisms are designed to improve the overall\n
    \  utilization of network resources in terms of bandwidth and services,\n   and
    to optimize traffic flow in terms of latency and jitter through\n   the network.
    \ Most existing TS systems require human intervention to\n   monitor and manage
    the assignment of specific paths to specific flows\n   or traffic types, reducing
    the effectiveness of TS.  I2RS, as a near\n   real time programmatic interface
    to the routing system, provides the\n   ability to manage TS systems in a more
    dynamic and iterative way.\n   This document describes several TS use cases for
    I2RS.\n\n\n\t "

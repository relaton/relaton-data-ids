  content: "Ethernet VLANs are quite commonly used in enterprise networks for the\n
    \  purposes of traffic segregation.  This document describes how such\n   VLANs
    can be readily used to deploy IPv6 networking in an enterprise,\n   including
    the scenario of early deployment prior to availability of\n   IPv6-capable switch-router
    equipment, where IPv6 may be routed in\n   parallel with the existing IPv4 in
    the enterprise and delivered at\n   Layer 2 via VLAN technology.  The IPv6 connectivity
    to the enterprise\n   may or may not enter the site via the same physical link.\n\t "

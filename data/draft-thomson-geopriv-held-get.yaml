- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes how an HTTP GET request to an HTTP-Enabled\nLocation
    Delivery (HELD) resource is handled by the server\nresponsible for that resource.
    \ This ensures that requests generated\nby user agents that are unaware of the
    special status of a URI do not\nresult in unhelpful responses and enables the
    use of HTTP GET for\nlocation configuration and dereference.\n\t "

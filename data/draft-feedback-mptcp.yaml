  content: "   Many video applications require extremely low latency and high image\n
    \  quality.  However, the limited bandwidth in wireless networks fails\n   to
    meet the peak rate requirements for multiple video flows.  MPTCP\n   is suitable
    for wireless edge networks, supporting the simultaneous\n   use of multiple networks
    on mobile devices.  Nevertheless, accurately\n   scheduling video data blocks
    to different subflows to satisfy their\n   low latency requirements is challenging
    due to their micro-burst\n   characteristic.  This document proposes a novel cross-layer
    feedback\n   method for video applications in edge networks, called the Cross-\n
    \  Layer Information-based One-Way Delay Predictive Scheduler (CPS).\n   With
    these information, the MPTCP scheduler can accurately predict\n   one-way delay
    and adaptively schedules video data blocks to the\n   optimal subflow.\n\n\t "

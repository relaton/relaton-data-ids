  content: "   This document describes the mechanism of sleep mode control.  The\n
    \  router which manages a network can control IPv6 sleepy nodes and\n   deliver
    the packets from/to exterior networks.  The IPv6 router can\n   keep the IPv6
    sleepy node as sleep state and handle the packets from/\n   to the IPv6 sleepy
    nodes.  Also, this document describes the\n   mechanism of sleep mode control
    using synchronization information.\n\n\t "

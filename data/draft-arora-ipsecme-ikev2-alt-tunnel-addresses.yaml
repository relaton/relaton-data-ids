  content: "IKEv2 is a protocol for setting up Virtual Private Network (VPN) \n  tunnels
    from a remote location to a gateway so that the VPN client \n  can access services
    in the network behind the gateway. Currently the\n\n  IKE SAs and tunnel mode
    Ipsec SA's are created implicitly between the  \n  IP addresses that are used
    when the IKE_SA is established. These IP  \n  addresses are then used as the outer
    (tunnel header) addresses  \n  for tunnel mode IPSEC packets (transport mode IPsec
    SAs are beyond  \n  the scope of this document). This document defines an IKEv2
    extension  \n  that allows the outer tunnel header addresses for the tunnel mode
    \ \n  IPSEC packets to be different than the IKE peer IP addresses.\n\t "

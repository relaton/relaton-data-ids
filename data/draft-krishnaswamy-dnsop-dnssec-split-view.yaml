  content: "   The security extensions to the Domain Name System (DNSSEC) allow for\n
    \  integrity protection, whereby it is possible to make a determination\n   of
    the verity of data returned from the Domain Name System in\n   response to a query.
    \ Current operation of the Domain Name System\n   also allows for the creation
    of multiple views of data, where the\n   answer returned in response to a query
    is dependent on the origin of\n   the query.  Data integrity and the ability to
    return possibly\n   conflicting values as in split-views may be construed to be
    mutually\n   conflicting goals; but this apparent dichotomy is resolvable in\n
    \  practice through careful configuration.  This document provides\n   recommendations
    for configuring a manageable split-view DNSSEC\n   environment in a representative
    enterprise network.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document updates RFC7862, Network File System (NFS) version 4\n
    \  minor version 2, by adding two operations to prevent the client from\n   destroying
    session when getting the reply of a mis-ordered request\n   with NFS4ERR_SEQ_MISORDERED.\n\n
    \  In NFSv4 minor version 1, sequence ID is used to ensure that the size\n   of
    the needed reply cache is tightly bounded.  If the server gets a\n   mis-ordered
    request, the client will often break the session and\n   establish a new session
    with the server.  This approach results in a\n   significant burden on the client
    and the server.  During the process\n   of session rebuilding, IO performance
    will be affected.  This is\n   especially troublesome when network latency is
    substantial, as, for\n   example when client and server are in different locations.
    \ This\n   document will propose extensions to NFSv4 that would allow client\n
    \  reconnection to be dispensed with.\n\n\n\t "

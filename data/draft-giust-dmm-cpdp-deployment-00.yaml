- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The DMM working group is currently looking at solutions for mobility\n
    \  management based on control and data plane separation.  In this\n   context,
    the network entities in charge for the mobility control\n   function are separated
    from the data plane nodes, responsible mainly\n   for, but not limited to, data
    packet forwarding.  This vision allows\n   for the design of different interaction
    methods between the mobility\n   control function and the data plane nodes.  One
    of such mechanisms\n   being currently discussed devises an SDN-based abstraction
    layer\n   between control and data planes, embodied by an SDN Network\n   Controller.
    \ This latter interfaces to the mobility control function\n   through a north-bound
    interface (NBI), and programs the underneath\n   infrastructure through a south-bound
    interface (SBI), e.g., OpenFlow.\n\n   This draft describes multiple deployment
    scenarios for NBI and SBI\n   interworking, given that multiple network controllers
    could be\n   deployed in order to meet performance requirements e.g., related
    to\n   latency.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document  describes a new authenticated encryption\nmode of operation
    of block ciphers called 'Integrity\nAware Parallelizable Mode (IAPM)' which is
    simple,\nefficient, highly parallelizable, and provably secure.\nOne of the main
    features distinguishing the new mode\n(IAPM) from existing modes is that along
    with providing\nconfidentiality of the payload, the new mode also pro-\nvides
    authenticity of the payload. This is particularly\nrelevant to the ESP security
    protocol of IPsec.\n\t "

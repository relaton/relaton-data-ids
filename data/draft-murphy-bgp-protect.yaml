  content: "BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed before\nthe
    Internet environment became perilous, is designed with little\nconsideration for
    protection of the information it carries.  There are\nno mechanisms in BGP to
    protect against attacks that modify, delete,\nforge, or replay data, any of which
    has the potential to disrupt overall\nnetwork routing behavior.\nThis internet
    draft discusses some of the security issues with BGP\nrouting data dissemination,
    and possible security solutions and the\ncosts of those solutions.  This internet
    draft does not discuss security\nissues with forwarding of packets.\n\n\t "

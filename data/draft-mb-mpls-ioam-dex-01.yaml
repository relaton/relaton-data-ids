  script: Latn
  content: "   In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM), defined\n
    \  in RFC 9197, is an on-path telemetry method to collect and transport\n   the
    operational state and telemetry information that can be used in\n   calculating
    various performance metrics.  IOAM Direct Export (IOAM-\n   DEX) is one of the
    IOAM Option types, in which the operational state\n   and telemetry information
    are collected according to the specified\n   profile and exported in a manner
    and format defined by a local\n   policy.  MPLS Network Actions (MNA) techniques
    are meant to indicate\n   actions to be performed on any combination of Label
    Switched Paths\n   (LSPs), MPLS packets, and the node itself, and also to transfer
    data\n   needed for these actions.  This document explores how MNA can be used\n
    \  for collecting on-path operational state and telemetry information\n   using
    IOAM-DEX Option.\n\n\t "

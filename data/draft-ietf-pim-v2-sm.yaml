  content: "This document describes a protocol for efficiently routing to\nmulticast
    groups that may span wide-area (and inter-domain)\ninternets.  We refer to the
    approach as Protocol Independent\nMulticast--Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) because it is
    not dependent on any\nparticular unicast routing protocol, and because it is designed
    to\nsupport sparse groups as defined in [1][2]. This document describes\nthe protocol
    details. For the motivation behind the design and a\ndescription of the architecture,
    see [1][2]. Section 2 summarizes\nPIM-SM operation.  It describes the protocol
    from a network\nperspective, in particular, how the participating routers interact
    to\ncreate and maintain the multicast distribution tree.  Section 3\ndescribes
    PIM-SM operations from the perspective of a single router\nimplementing the protocol;
    this section constitutes the main body of\nthe protocol specification.  It is
    organized according to PIM-SM\nmessage type; for each message type we describe
    its contents, its\ngeneration, and its processing.\n\t "

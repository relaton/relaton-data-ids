  content: "   This document describes how AODV [1] can be extended for the support\n
    \  of MANET multipath routing. In AODV, the route information is not\n   avilable
    either at the source or at the destination. So, AODV\n   is less appropriate in
    establishing multiple routes with more\n   desirable properties, compared with
    DSR [2]. But, for the sake of\n   reliability and load balancing, in this draft,
    we describe how\n   we can extend AODV to establish multiple routes from the source\n
    \  to the destination.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Policy-Enabled Path Computation Framework [PCE-POLICY] introduced\n
    \  the use of the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM), [RFC3060], as a\n   framework
    for supporting path computation policy within the context\n   of the Path Computation
    Element (PCE)-Based Architecture, [RFC4655].\n   This document defines the Path
    Computation Policy Information Model\n   (PCPIM), which provides the specifics
    of using PCIM as the method for\n   supporting path computation policy.  PCPIM
    includes classes that\n   model constraints, conditions, actions, variables and
    values\n   associated with supporting path computation policy. While PCPIM was\n
    \  conceived to operate within the path computation element (PCE)-based\n   architecture,
    it can be applied to any path computation methodology.\n\n\t "

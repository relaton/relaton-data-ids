  content: "IPv6 deployment is delayed by the existence of millions of subscriber\nnetwork
    address translators (NATs) that cannot be upgraded to support\nIPv6.  This document
    specifies a mechanism for traversal of such\nNATs.  It is based on an address
    mapping and on a mechanism whereby\nsuitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain
    IPv6 connectivity via\na stateless server, known as a SAMPLE server, operated
    by their\nInternet Service Provider.  SAMPLE is an alternative to the Teredo\nprotocol.\n\t "

  content: "The WARC (Web ARChive) format specifies a method for combining\n   multiple
    digital resources into an aggregate archival file together\n   with related information.
    \ Resources are dated, identified by URIs,\n   and preceded by simple text headers.
    \ By convention, files of this\n   format are named with the extension \".warc\"
    and have the MIME type\n   application/warc.  The WARC file format is a revision
    and\n   generalization of the ARC format used by the Internet Archive to\n   store
    information blocks harvested by web crawlers.  This document\n   specifies version
    0.16 of the WARC format.\n\t "

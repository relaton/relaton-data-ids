  content: "This memo defines a signing procedure for Japanese message in the context
    of security multipart. The procedure guarantees signature validity even if messages
    are processed through message transfer agents which carelessly transform character
    set encodings.                                         To sign Japanese message
    digitally, local forms such as EUC/Japanese, Shift-JIS, etc., are first converted
    into the transfer form, ISO-2022-JP with an appropriate set of MIME headers. Then
    it is duplicated into two objects. The first object is transformed into the signature
    form defined in this memo and a detached digital signature is calculated over
    it. A 'Multipart/Signed' part is created with the second object and the detached
    digital signature. Japanese text is verified as the signature form instead of
    the transfer form.                                                      To encrypt
    Japanese message, the transfer form, ISO-2022-JP with an appropriate set of MIME
    headers, is used.\n\t "

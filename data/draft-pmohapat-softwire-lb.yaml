  content: "Payloads carried over a Softwire mesh service as defined by BGP\nEncapsulation
    Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) information\nexchange often carry
    a number of identifiable, distinct flows.  It\ncan in some circumstances be desirable
    to distribute these flows over\nthe equal cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist
    in the packet\nswitched network.  Currently, the payload of a packet entering
    the\nSoftwire can only be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers.\nThus
    the load balancing decision of a core router is only based on\nthe encapsulating
    header, presenting much less entropy than available\nin the payload or the encapsulated
    header since the Softwire\nencapsulation acts in a tunneling fashion.  This document
    describes a\nmethod for achieving comparable load balancing efficiency in a\nnetwork
    carrying Softwire mesh service over Layer Two Tunneling\nProtocol - Version 3
    (L2TPv3) over IP or Generic Routing\nEncapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to what
    would be achieved without\nsuch encapsulation.\n\t "

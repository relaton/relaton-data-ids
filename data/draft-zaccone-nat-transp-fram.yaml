  content: "This document describes a framework for the transport of IP traffic\nfrom
    different routing realms inside a single network. In other\nwords, this document
    describes a framework enabling a network\noperator to enable the parallel use
    of different IP routing realms\nwithin a single operated network.\nThis framework
    may, for instance, be applied in the context of IPv4\nprivate networks using an
    address reuse technology to offer internet\nconnectivity or in the context of
    IPv4 and IPv6\ninterworking/migration.\nTill now, operating multiple realms within
    a single physical network\nwas realised by the use of tunneling technologies.
    This document will\nintroduce a non-tunnel based scheme for multiple realms interworking.\n\n\t "

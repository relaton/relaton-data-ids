  content: "   In the scenarios of both client to service and service to service\n
    \  interconnections, the host-oriented addressing mechanism turns out to\n   be
    ineffective, and employment of a standalone service ID in routing\n   network
    could facilitate the fine-grained interfaces of underlay\n   networking capabilities,
    as well as cross connections among services\n   residing at multiple sites.\n\n\t "

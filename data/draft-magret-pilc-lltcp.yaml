  content: "This document specifies a protocol enhancement allowing TCP connec-\ntions
    to switch from an active state to an idle state during a wire-\nless link's outage.
    Within such state all timers are cancelled and\npackets' transmission is suspended.
    The protocol defines a mechanism\nby which the mobile station may detect a link
    failure and changes TCP\nconnections' state to idle. This same mechanism allows
    the mobile\nhost to detect connectivity regain. All TCP connections are then\nresumed.\nThe
    protocol defines how the supervisor host, which can monitor the\nwireless link
    quality, can alert the fixed host of a failure of the\nwireless link.  The fixed
    host can suspend the outgoing activity with\nthe unreachable mobile node. When
    the fixed hosts start receiving\npackets from the mobile node, the activity can
    be resumed.\nThis protocol increases the capacity of both parties involved in
    a\ncommunication that is carried via a wireless link to handled connec-\ntivity
    disruption without impacting the overall performance of the\nTCP connections.\n\t "

  content: "   In the DNS, resolvers employ caching to reduce both latency for end\n
    \  users and load on authoritative name servers.  The process of\n   resolution
    may result in one of three types of responses: (1) a\n   response containing the
    requested data; (2) a response indicating the\n   requested data does not exist;
    or (3) a non-response due to a\n   resolution failure in which the resolver does
    not receive any useful\n   information regarding the data's existence.  This document
    concerns\n   itself only with the third type.\n\n   RFC 2308 specifies requirements
    for DNS negative caching.  There,\n   caching of type (1) and (2) responses is
    mandatory and caching of\n   type (3) responses is optional.  This document updates
    RFC 2308 to\n   require negative caching for DNS resolution failures.\n\n\t "

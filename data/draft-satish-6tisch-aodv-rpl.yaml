  content: "   Asymmetrical link based time-sensitive traffic flows with highly\n
    \  reliable shortest end-to-end route discovery is pre-requisite in IPv6\n   over
    the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6tisch) Networks.  To achieve,\n   this document
    specifies a resource reservation based reactive P2P\n   route discovery mechanism
    for hop-by-hop routing (storing mode) based\n   on Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector
    Routing (AODV) RPL protocol for\n   6tisch Networks.  Two separate instances are
    used to achieve\n   directional paths based on asymmetric links in between source
    and\n   destination.\n\n\t "

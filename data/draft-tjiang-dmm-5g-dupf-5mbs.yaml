  content: "   The drafts [I-D.zzhang-dmm-5g-distributed-upf] and\n   [I-D.zzhang-dmm-mup-evolution]
    have described the 5G mobile user\n   plane (MUP) via the refinement of distributed
    UPFs and a more radical\n   proposal by integrating gNB & UPF as a single network
    function (NF).\n   Some user plane implementation requirements that vendors and\n
    \  operators are exploring are not introducing changes to 3GPP\n   architecture
    & signaling, if possible.  The document 3GPP TS 23.247\n   [_3GPP-23.247] for
    5G multicast and broadcast services, or 5MBS,\n   specifies the 5GS architecture
    to support MBS communication.  Thanks\n   to the addition of new 5GS network functions
    (NFs) and MB-interfaces\n   on 5G CP & UP, specifically if coupled with the increasingly
    popular\n   satellite-related requirements, these would certainly post additional\n
    \  provisioning & implementation challenges to the underlay transport\n   infrastructure.\n\n
    \  This document is not an attempt to do 3GPP SDO work in IETF.\n   Instead, it
    discusses how to potentially integrate distributed UPFs\n   with the delivery
    of 5MBS communication, as well as the benefits of\n   using distributed UPFs to
    handle 5MBS traffic delivery.\n\n\t "

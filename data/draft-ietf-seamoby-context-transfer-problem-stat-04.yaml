  content: "In IP access networks that support host mobility, the routing paths \nbetween
    the host and the network may change frequently and rapidly. \nIn some cases, the
    host may establish certain routing-related \nservices on subnets that are left
    behind when the host moves. \nExamples of such services are AAA, header compression,
    and QoS. In \norder for the host to obtain those services on the new subnet, the
    \nhost must explicitly re-establish the service by performing the \nnecessary
    signaling flows from scratch. In some cases, this process \nwould considerably
    slow the process of establishing the mobile host \non the new subnet. An alternative
    is to transfer information on the \nexisting state associated with these services,
    or context, to the \nnew subnet, a process called 'context transfer'. This document
    \ndiscusses the desirability of context transfer for facilitating \nseamless IP
    mobility.\n\t "

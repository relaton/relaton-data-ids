  content: "   The OCB authenticated-encryption algorithm is specified in RFC 7523,\n
    \  but only for blockciphers with 128-bit blocks such as AES.  This\n   document
    extends RFC 7523 by specifying how OCB is used with\n   blockciphers of any blocklength.
    \ When the blocklength is 128 bits,\n   this specification and that in RFC 7523
    are identical.\n\n\t "

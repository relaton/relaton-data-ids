  content: "   The deployment of carrier-side stateless solution requires some\n   particular
    considerations in mobile network contexts.  The widely\n   existed legacy network
    restricts the development of IP address\n   provisioning based on DHCP-PD.  The
    memo provided several potential\n   approaches to facilitate the issues and provide
    the possibilities\n   leveraging 3GPP mechanism.  The stateless algorithm is required
    to be\n   updated depending to the preferred solution accordingly.\n\n\n\t "

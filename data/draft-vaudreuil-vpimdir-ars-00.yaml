  content: "The telephone number delegation and call routing system is a\nhierarchitecal
    system. ITU standard E.164 defines the structure of the\ntelephone number as follows:\n{country
    code) (Nationally significant part)\nThe country code may be from one to three
    digits, and the total length\nmay be up to 16 digits.  The nationally significant
    portion may be\narbitraily divided on any number boundary.  In many countries
    numering\nplans, the divisions are not uniform, that is, the 'area codes' or\n'City
    codes' may be of varying lengths within a single country and the\ntotal number
    of digits may be variable.\nWithin this flexiblity, it is always the case that
    the delegation of\nauthority is done left-to-right. With this assumption, a numbering\ntree
    can be built on a digit-by-digit basis can represent any of these\nhierarchical
    structures.  DNS permits the delegation of authority on\narbitary boundaries such
    that a delegation to country code '1', '44',\nand '972' can all coexist under
    a single numbering plan root.  The\nsame applies for 'area codes', 'City codes'
    or 'service selectors'\nwithin numbering plans.\nThe protocol mechanics outlined
    in this document are devised in such a\nmanner that the clients do not need any
    knowledge of the numbering\nplan itself to correctly construct a query of the
    Address Resolution\nService.  The client may mechanically collect digits, format
    the\nquery, and receive a response to any telephone number in the world.\n\n\t "

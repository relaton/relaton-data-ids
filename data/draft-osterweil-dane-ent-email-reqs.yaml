  content: "   Individuals and organizations have expressed a wish to have the\n   ability
    to send encrypted and/or digitally signed email end-to-end.\n   One key obstacle
    to end-to-end email security is the difficulty in\n   discovering, obtaining,
    and validating email credentials across\n   administrative domains.  This document
    addresses foreseeable adoption\n   obstacles for encrypted and digitally signed
    email in enterprises,\n   and outlines requirements.  Some of the requirements
    below are not\n   DANE specific, and all may not be solvable with a DANE solution,
    but\n   are included for completeness and as an attempt to give a holistic\n   view
    of enterprise email security requirements.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The REFER method is defined in RFC 3515.  That RFC defines the syntax\n
    \  of the REFER request and some of the machinery involved in its\n   execution,
    but it defines the semantics of the method only so far as\n   to specify that
    the recipient will initiate a request to the target\n   specified in the Refer-To
    header.  But since almost all requests that\n   can be sent by the recipient are
    inherently part of an encompassing\n   UA action that affects the state of the
    recipient in ways that are\n   not directly reflected in SIP protocol actions,
    the standardized\n   action of initiating a request implicitly has further consequences\n
    \  which are often not clearly specified.  As a result, various SIP\n   call-control
    proposals assume that a UA receiving a REFER will\n   perform the UA operation
    that is needed at that moment without\n   specifying clearly how the UA recognizes
    which UA operation is\n   needed.  As a result there are now five semantically
    distinct defined\n   uses of REFER.  All five uses bear a family resemblance,
    and each\n   involves sending a SIP request, but the exact meaning of each use
    is\n   logically independent of the others, and the rules by which a UA\n   distinguishes
    the five cases are at best implicit.\n\t "

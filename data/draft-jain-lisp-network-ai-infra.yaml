abstract:
- content: "<p>The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) control plane provides
    the mechanisms to support Scale-Up, Scale-Out and Scale- Across backend networks
    within AI infrastructure. This document describes how LISP enables a unified control
    plane architecture that accommodates different scaling technologies, offering
    flexibility in deployment. By leveraging lisp mechanisms including EID-to-RLOC-
    mapping/pxTR registrations, publication-subscription and VPN instance-based segmentation
    ([RFC9300][RFC9301][RFC9437][I-D.ietf- lisp-site-external-connectivity][I-D.ietf-lisp-vpn]),
    the architecture delivers scalable high bandwidth for large training workloads,
    ultra-low-latency collective operations, and a simplified control framework that
    seamlessly spans heterogeneous accelerator fabrics. This approach allows AI/ML
    applications (whether focused on training or inference) to run workloads efficiently
    with resiliency on a converged infrastructure, supporting diverse deployment scenarios
    using the same underlying network fabric.</p>"

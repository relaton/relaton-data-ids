  content: "A recent Internet Draft [1] argues that the common use of POST to\n     proide
    a uniform method of passing blocks of data to an application,\n     is being misused
    in the definition of new application protocols, such\n     as the Internet Printing
    Protocol. Cohen et. al. argue that a new\n     PUSH method be defined for this
    purpose. This Internet Draft argues\n     that the existing POST method proides
    all of the required\n     functionality for back end applications, such as Print,
    without\n     sacrificing the leels of security that customers expect. More\n
    \    importantly, from the customer\\022s point of iew, it does this without\n
    \    any impact to existing, installed network components.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network\n
    \  Interconnection (CDNI).  The purpose of the framework is to provide\n   an
    overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the\n   relationships
    among the various components necessary to interconnect\n   CDNs.  CDN Interconnection
    requires the specification of several\n   interfaces and mechanisms to address
    issues such as request routing,\n   metadata exchange, and the acquisition of
    content by one CDN from\n   another.  The intent of this document is to outline
    what each\n   interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces\n
    \  and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed\n   specification
    to other documents.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document explores issues with Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)
    that result from the use of various encoding schemes such as UTF-8 and the ASCII-Compatible
    Encoding produced by the Punycode algorithm.  It focuses on the importance of
    agreeing on a single encoding and how complicated the state of affairs ends up
    being as a result of using different encodings today.\n\t "

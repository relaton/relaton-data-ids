  content: "   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming\n   pervasive
    for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data\n   center (DC) networks
    and as the next generation VPN services in\n   service provider (SP) networks.\n\n
    \  As service providers transform their networks in their COs toward\n   next
    generation data center with Software Defined Networking (SDN)\n   based fabric
    and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), they want to\n   be able to maintain
    their offered services including Multicast VPN\n   (MVPN) service between their
    existing network and their new Service\n   Provider Data Center (SPDC) network
    seamlessly without the use of\n   gateway devices. They want to have such seamless
    interoperability\n   between their new SPDCs and their existing networks for a)
    reducing\n   cost, b) having optimum forwarding, and c) reducing provisioning.\n
    \  This document describes a unified solution based on RFCs 6513 & 6514\n   for
    seamless interoperability of Multicast VPN between EVPN and MVPN\n   PEs. Furthermore,
    it describes how the proposed solution can be used\n   as a routed multicast solution
    in data centers with only EVPN PEs.\n\n\n\t "

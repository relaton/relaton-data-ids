    format, the Format for Incident information Exchange (FINE),\nwhich will facilitate
    the exchange of incident information among\ncomputer security incident response

    such as organizations, regions, and countries.\nImplementations of FINE will also
    be useful for reactionary analysis\nof current threats and support the proactive
    identification of trends\nthat can lead to incident prevention.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) transport paths can be\n   statically
    provisioned via a Network Management System (NMS) or\n   dynamically provisioned
    via a control plane. The transport paths\n   provided by MPLS-TP are used as a
    server layer for pseudowires\n   carrying client signals other than IP or MPLS.
    It may be necessary\n   to support MPLS-TP pseudowires, to extend across multiple
    domains.\n\n   This document outlines the requirements and solution for\n   coordinating
    MPLS-TP transport paths and a multi-segment PWs that\n   will traverse multiple
    domains, where some domains are statically\n   provisioned, and other domains
    that are dynamically provisioned.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union
    Telecommunication\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\n
    \  (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities\n   of
    a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\n\t "

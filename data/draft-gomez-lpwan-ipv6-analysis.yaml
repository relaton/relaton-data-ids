  content: "   Connecting Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) to the Internet is\n
    \  expected to provide significant benefits to these networks in terms\n   of
    interoperability, application deployment, and management, among\n   others.  However,
    the constraints of LPWANs, often more extreme than\n   those of typical 6Lo(WPAN)
    technologies, constitute a challenge for\n   the 6LoWPAN suite in order to enable
    IPv6 over LPWAN.  Considering\n   the typical characteristics of LPWAN technologies,
    this document\n   analyzes the design space and challenges related with enabling
    IPv6\n   over LPWAN.\n\n\t "

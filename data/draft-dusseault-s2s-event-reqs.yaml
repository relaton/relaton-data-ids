  content: "Server-to-server event pipelines are required in situations where an\nevent
    source generates events for a number of end-users (or simply\ngenerates events
    without an idea of who the end recipients might be),\nand sends these events to
    an event or notification aggregator\nservice.  These kinds of event source servers
    are common in messaging\n(for example, voice messaging servers and calendar servers
    might send\nevents to a user's main messaging server or to a single-purpose\nnotification
    server).  A general set of requirements is outlined here\nfor the server-to-server
    aspect of these kinds of scenarios.\n\t "

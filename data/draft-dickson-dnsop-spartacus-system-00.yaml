  content: "   This is the SPARTACUS DNS gateway system.  It is designed to\n   facilitate
    the transport of DNS messages opaquely, across problematic\n   sections of the
    Internet.  It uses JSON encoding, and HTTP(S) as the\n   protocol for transport.\n\n
    \  The main criteria of SPARTACUS is that it preserve DNS messages\n   verbatim,
    and that only properly formatted DNS messages are passed.\n\n   There are two
    modes (so far) defined: DNS forwarder (dns clients\n   point to a local gateway,
    which forwards to a remote gateway for\n   sending to a DNS resolver); and transparent
    proxy (DNS packets are\n   intercepted, passed to a local gateway, which sends
    them to the\n   remote gateway, with original destination IP address etc. encoded,\n
    \  and used by the remote gateway as the destination).\n\n   DNS messages are
    NAT-friendly, so changes to IP or UDP headers do not\n   impact them.  Thus, SPARTACUS
    does not interfere with TSIG, SIG(0),\n   or Eastlake Cookies.\n\n   This document
    describes the system, the components, and behavior,\n   with examples.\n\n\t "

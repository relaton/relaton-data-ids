  content: "   This document presents seven YANG 1.1 modules.  Three IETF modules,\n
    \  and four supporting IANA modules.\n\n   The three IETF modules are: ietf-ssh-common,
    ietf-ssh-client, and\n   ietf-ssh-server.  The \"ietf-ssh-client\" and \"ietf-ssh-server\"
    modules\n   are the primary productions of this work, supporting the\n   configuration
    and monitoring of SSH clients and servers.\n\n   The four IANA modules are: iana-ssh-encryption-algs,
    iana-ssh-key-\n   exchange-algs, iana-ssh-mac-algs, and iana-ssh-public-key-algs.\n
    \  These modules each define YANG enumerations providing support for an\n   IANA-maintained
    algorithm registry.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   This
    draft contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with\n   finalized
    values at the time of publication.  This note summarizes\n   all of the substitutions
    that are needed.  No other RFC Editor\n   instructions are specified elsewhere
    in this document.\n\n   Artwork in this document contains shorthand references
    to drafts in\n   progress.  Please apply the following replacements:\n\n   *  AAAA
    --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-\n      types\n\n   *
    \ BBBB --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-trust-\n      anchors\n\n
    \  *  CCCC --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-keystore\n\n   *
    \ DDDD --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-\n      server\n\n
    \  *  EEEE --> the assigned RFC value for this draft\n   Artwork in this document
    contains placeholder values for the date of\n   publication of this draft.  Please
    apply the following replacement:\n\n   *  2024-03-16 --> the publication date
    of this draft\n\n   The \"Relation to other RFCs\" section Section 1.2 contains
    the text\n   \"one or more YANG modules\" and, later, \"modules\".  This text
    is\n   sourced from a file in a context where it is unknown how many modules\n
    \  a draft defines.  The text is not wrong as is, but it may be improved\n   by
    stating more directly how many modules are defined.\n\n   The \"Relation to other
    RFCs\" section Section 1.2 contains a self-\n   reference to this draft, along
    with a corresponding reference in the\n   Appendix.  Please replace the self-reference
    in this section with\n   \"This RFC\" (or similar) and remove the self-reference
    in the\n   \"Normative/Informative References\" section, whichever it is in.\n\n
    \  Tree-diagrams in this draft may use the '\\' line-folding mode defined\n   in
    RFC 8792.  However, nicer-to-the-eye is when the '\\\\' line-folding\n   mode
    is used.  The AD suggested suggested putting a request here for\n   the RFC Editor
    to help convert \"ugly\" '\\' folded examples to use the\n   '\\\\' folding mode.
    \ \"Help convert\" may be interpreted as, identify\n   what looks ugly and ask
    the authors to make the adjustment.\n\n   The following Appendix sections are
    to be removed prior to\n   publication:\n\n   *  Appendix A.1.  Initial Module
    for the \"Encryption Algorithm Names\"\n      Registry\n\n   *  Appendix A.2.
    \ Initial Module for the \"MAC Algorithm Names\"\n      Registry\n\n   *  Appendix
    A.3.  Initial Module for the \"Public Key Algorithm Names\"\n      Registry\n\n
    \  *  Appendix A.4.  Initial Module for the \"Key Exchange Method Names\"\n      Registry\n\n
    \  *  Appendix B.  Change Log\n\n\t "

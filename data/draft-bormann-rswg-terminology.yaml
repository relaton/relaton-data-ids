  content: "   The canonical format for RFCs is called RFCXML, with the currently\n
    \  effective details originally documented in the RFC 799x series.  This\n   format
    has experienced some uncontrolled evolution since, partially\n   caused by an
    unwillingness to recognize the need for overt,\n   deliberate evolution.\n\n   Controlled
    RFCXML evolution is going to be complex.  Its discussion\n   will need agreed
    terminology, without which it will devolve into a\n   Tower of Babel.\n\n\t "

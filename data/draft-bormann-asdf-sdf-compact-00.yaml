  content: "   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts\n
    \  to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models\n   in
    the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for\n   use in the
    development of the One Data Model liaison organization\n   (OneDM) definitions.
    \ Tools convert this format to database formats\n   and other serializations as
    needed.\n\n   The SDF format is mainly intended for interchange between machine\n
    \  generation and machine processing.  However, there often is a need\n   for
    humans to look at and edit SDF models.\n\n   Similar to the way Relax-NG as defined
    in ISO/IEC 19757-2 has an XML\n   format and a compact format (Annex C), this
    specification defines a\n   compact format to go along SDF's JSON format.\n\n
    \  The present version of this document is mostly a proof of concept,\n   but
    was deemed useful to obtain initial feedback on the approach\n   taken.\n\n\t "

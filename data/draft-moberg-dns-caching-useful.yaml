  content: " This memo suggests that the usage of very small TTL values in SOA RRs\n
    [1] for dynamic environments such as when using DHCP with DNS dynamic\n updates
    [2] will affect the performance of the DNS as a whole in a\n negative manner and
    should therefore be avoided.\n \n However, this memo is in no way meant to be
    an exhaustive analysis\n of the issue, more of an invitation to discuss how to
    avoid\n future scalability issues while still providing expected service.\n\n\t "

  content: "Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the capabilities
    to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected information in specific header
    fields, and to use non-ASCII characters in envelope addresses.  It also requires
    being able to express those addresses and the information based on them in mail
    header fields.  This document specifies an experimental variant of Internet mail
    that permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8, rather than ASCII, as the base
    form for Internet email header field.  This form is permitted in transmission
    only if authorized by an SMTP extension, as specified in an associated specification.
    \ This specification Updates section 6.4 of RFC 2045 to conform with the requirements.
    \ This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

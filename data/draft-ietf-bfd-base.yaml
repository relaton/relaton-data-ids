  content: "This document describes a protocol intended to detect faults in the bidirectional
    path between two forwarding engines, including interfaces, data link(s), and to
    the extent possible the forwarding engines themselves, with potentially very low
    latency.  It operates independently of media, data protocols, and routing protocols.

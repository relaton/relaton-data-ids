abstract:
- content: <p>Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting the design
    of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, "what network will best fit
    these needs?" A part of fitting network design to requirements is the problem
    of complexity, an idea often measured by "seat of pants" methods. When would adding
    a particular protocol, policy, or configuration be "too complex?" This document
    suggests a series of continuums along which network complexity might be measured.
    No suggestions are made in measuring complexity for each of these continuums are
    provided; this is left for future documents.</p>

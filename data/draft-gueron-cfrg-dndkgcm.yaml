  content: "   This document specifies an authenticated encryption algorithm called\n
    \  Double Nonce Derive Key AES-GCM (DNDK-GCM). It operates with a 32-\n   byte
    root key and is designed to encrypt with a 24-byte random nonce\n   and optionally
    to provide for key commitment.\n\n   Encryption takes the root key and a 15-byte
    portion of the random\n   nonce, and derives a fresh 32-byte encryption key and
    (optionally) a\n   key commitment value. Then, it invokes AES-GCM with the derived
    key\n   and the remaining bytes of the nonce, and outputs the ciphertext,\n   authentication
    tag and the key commitment value.\n\n   Although this is not the primary use case,
    it is also possible to use\n   DNDK-GCM with a non-repeating but non-random nonce
    (i.e., a \"counter-\n   based nonce\").\n\n   The low collision probability in
    a collection of 24-byte random\n   nonces and the per-nonce derivation of an encryption
    key extend the\n   lifetime of the root key, and the scheme can support processing
    up to\n   2^64 bytes under a given root key.\n\n   DNDK-GCM introduces a relatively
    small overhead compared to using\n   AES-GCM directly, and its security relies
    only on the standard\n   assumption that AES acts as a pseudorandom permutation.\n\n\t "

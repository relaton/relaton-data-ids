  content: "   Some recent Internet technology developments relate to improvements\n
    \  in communications latency.  For instance, improvements in radio\n   communications
    or the recent work in IETF transport, security, and\n   web protocols.  There
    are also potential applications where latency\n   would play a more significant
    role than it has traditionally been in\n   the Internet communications.  Modern
    networking systems offer many\n   tools for building low-latency networks, from
    highly optimised\n   individual protocol components to software controlled, virtualised\n
    \  and tailored network functions.  This memo views the developments\n   from
    a system viewpoint, and considers the potential future stresses\n   that the strive
    for low-latency support for applications may bring.\n\n\t "

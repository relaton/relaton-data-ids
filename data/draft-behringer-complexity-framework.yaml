  content: "   Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there
    is\n   no generally accepted definition of the term.  Complexity metrics\n   exist
    in a wide range of research, but most of them address only a\n   particular aspect
    of a network, for example the complexity of a graph\n   or software.  There is
    a desire to define the complexity of a network\n   as a whole, as deployed today
    to provide Internet services.  This\n   document provides a framework to guide
    research on the topic of\n   network complexity.\n\n\t "

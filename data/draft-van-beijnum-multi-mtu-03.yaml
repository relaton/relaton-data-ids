  content: "In the early days of the internet, many different link types with\nmany
    different maximum packet sizes were in use.  For point-to-point\nor point-to-multipoint
    links, there are still some other link types\n(PPP, ATM, Packet over SONET), but
    multipoint subnets are now almost\nexclusively implemented as ethernets.  Even
    though the relevant\nstandards mandate a 1500 byte maximum packet size for ethernet,
    more\nand more ethernet equipment is capable of handling packets bigger\nthan
    1500 bytes.  However, since this capability isn't standardized,\nit is seldom
    used today, despite the potential performance benefits\nof using larger packets.
    \ This document specifies mechanisms to\nnegotiate per-neighbor maximum packet
    sizes so that nodes on a\nmultipoint subnet may use the maximum mutually supported
    packet size\nbetween them without being limited by nodes with smaller maximum\nsizes
    on the same subnet.\n\t "

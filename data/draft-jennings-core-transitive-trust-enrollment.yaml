  content: "   This document provides a sketch of a rendezvous protocol that allows\n
    \  constrained internet devices such as sensors to securely connect into\n   a
    system that uses them.  The solution is based on the idea that each\n   device
    will be manufactured with a one time password that can be used\n   by the customer
    to tell the device which controller to enroll with,\n   and the device will be
    manufactured to contact a given Transfer\n   Server that is used to tell the device
    which system to connect to.\n   The administrator of the device will be able to
    get this one time\n   password from the device using a QR code, and then will
    be able to\n   use that one time password to inform a Transfer Server which system\n
    \  the device should connect to.  The device will contact the Transfer\n   Agent,
    get this information, and then connect to the appropriate\n   system.\n\n\t "

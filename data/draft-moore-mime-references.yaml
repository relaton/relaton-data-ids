  content: "This memo defines a new MIME content-type 'multipart/references', which
    can be used to denote a set of MIME contents, of which any one may reference the
    others by its MIME content-id.  This mechanism may be used by presentation languages
    that wish to be able to reference MIME objects, or by other applications (file
    transfer, authentication, delivery reports) which need to supply related information
    about another MIME object.\n\t "

  content: "Conventional deployments store keys on PC hard disks, application- \nserver
    hard disks, or in tokens, and also introduce complications  \nfor user enrollment
    and management.  User and administrator  \nfrustration with the conventional approach
    has cramped development  \nof a market for PKI.  As a result, PKI has not reached
    its  \nutilization potential and is far from becoming ubiquitous. \n \nThis document
    describes architecture for deployment of secure and  \nefficient digital signature
    capabilities based on a centralized key- \nmanagement approach and emphasizes
    the importance of not disrupting  \nexisting identity and authentication management
    and application  \ninfrastructure.  An alternative architecture is documented
    here so  \nthat PKI deployments will lower their associated administrative  \nburdens
    and deliver improved scalability.\n\t "

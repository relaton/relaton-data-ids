  content: "   This memo describes a family of deterministically generated Nothing\n
    \  Up My Sleeve (NUMS) elliptic curves over prime fields offering high\n   practical
    security in cryptographic applications, including Transport\n   Layer Security
    (TLS) and X.509 certificates.  The domain parameters\n   are defined for both
    classical Weierstrass curves, for compatibility\n   with existing applications,
    and modern twisted Edwards curves,\n   allowing further efficiency improvements
    for a given security level.\n\n\t "

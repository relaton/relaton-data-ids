abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   As part of the work on MPLS Network Actions (MNA) a debate arose\n
    \  concerning how existing MPLS implementations handle Special Purpose\n   Labels
    (SPLs) especially in the context of processing the MPLS\n   Entropy Label.  The
    question applies to the relative placement of the\n   Entropy Label Indicator
    (ELI) and the MNA Base SPL in the MPLS label\n   stack.  This question is applicable
    to the use of the ELI and any new\n   base SPL (bSPL), or to the relative placement
    of any two bSPLs\n   including the Extension Label that precedes any extended
    SPL.\n\n   In order to discover what deployed implementations currently do, it\n
    \  is proposed that the MPLS working group chairs poll participants to\n   answer
    specific questions about their implementations.  This document\n   is a working
    draft of the questions to be asked.\n\n   It is not intended that this document
    should progress to publication\n   as an RFC.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses how to use of SCTP for IP handover support. \n
    \  With the help of the dynamic address reconfiguration, the SCTP with \n   the
    ADDIP extension (called mSCTP) would provide soft handover for \n   the mobile
    terminals without any additional support of routers/agents \n   in the networks.
    For location management, the mSCTP could be used \n   along with Mobile IP, Session
    Initiation Protocol or Reliable Server \n   Pooling. We also discuss the use of
    mSCTP along with Mobile IP for \n   Internet mobility support.\n\t "

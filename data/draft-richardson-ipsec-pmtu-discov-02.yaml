  content: "This document describes the problem of getting accurate Path MTU infor-\nmation
    in the presence of untrusted routers. Typical Path MTU discovery\nis done by sending
    packets with the don't fragment bit set, and listen-\ning for ICMP messages from
    routers that want to fragment the packets.\nUnfortunately, these messages could
    be forged, and IPsec based security\nsystem(s) can not pass make direct use of
    these messages. An alternate,\nbackwards compatible algorithm is suggested.\n\n\t "

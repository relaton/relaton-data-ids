  content: "This document describes a mechanism to establish end-to-end disjoint \nLSPs
    in a multiple area domain, as required for inter-area end-to-end protection. This
    mechanism relies on the joint computation of the working and backup LSPs segments
    in each area. A new RSVP-TE object called the Associated Route Object, ARO, is
    defined and used in the signaling messages in support of this scheme.\n\t "

  content: "   BGP Flow Specification allows conveying flow specifications and\n   traffic
    Action/Rules associated to perform different actions based on\n   the traffic
    features.  One of the applications is to steer one\n   specific flow into its
    specific path.  However, in some scenarios,\n   the traffic forwarding paths are
    not constant and change over time.\n\n   This document extends BGP Flow Specification
    with scheduling time\n   information to identify the packets arrived at different
    time slot.\n   Based on that, the headend can perform different actions at different\n
    \  time for the same traffic.\n\n\t "

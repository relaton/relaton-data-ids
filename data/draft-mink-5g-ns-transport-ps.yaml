  content: "   This document describes problem statements for realizing an end-to-\n
    \  end network slicing that is expected to provide service-oriented\n   communications
    between users and applications.  3GPP introduced the\n   network slicing concept
    in the 5G architecture (3GPP Release 15),\n   however, it mainly focuses on mobile
    access and core domains.  In\n   order to reap the benefit of the concept, a network
    slicing needs to\n   be designed across multiple domains of the network including
    non-3GPP\n   parts.  This document analyzes the current 3GPP 5G network slicing\n
    \  architecture and summarizes problem statements for the interworking\n   between
    the 5G network slicing and the transport network.\n\n\t "

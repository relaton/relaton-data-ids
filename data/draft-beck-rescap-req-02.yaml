  content: "A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on the\nInternet
    as a means of identifying various resources, services, and\ndestinations.  However,
    a means of attaching a set of attributes or\ncharacteristics to a given resource
    identifier and subsequently\nassessing those attributes or characteristics has
    not been specified\nand deployed.\n\nA particularly important resolution service
    of this general type is\none which, when given a mail address identifying a particular
    mail\nrecipient, will return a series of attributes describing the\ncapabilities
    of that recipient.  This differs from a directory\nservice in that no searching
    or other advanced query operations are\ninvolved.\n\nTwo tasks are envisioned.
    \ The first task will be to define a general\nresolution protocol that will translate
    resource identifiers to a\nlist of attributes.  The second task will be to define
    an\nadministrative model and update protocol that can be used to set\nup and maintain
    the information the resolution protocol accesses.\n\nThis document defines the
    requirements for these two protocols.\n\t "

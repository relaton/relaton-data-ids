abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method for carrying OpenFlow messages over
    Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) using the Bundle Protocol (BP). The method encapsulates
    OpenFlow messages as BP payloads and defines the mapping between OpenFlow messages
    and Bundles, the payload format, and addressing and multiplexing considerations
    based on DTN Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs). This document further discusses conditions
    that may occur on intermittently connected or high-latency links, including fragmentation,
    duplicate delivery, out-of-order arrival, and expiration, and defines corresponding
    message handling rules. These rules enable the transmission of OpenFlow messages
    across DTN without modifying the semantics of the OpenFlow protocol.</p>"

  content: "   This document specifies a method for carrying OpenFlow messages over\n
    \  Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) using the Bundle Protocol (BP).  The\n   method
    encapsulates OpenFlow messages as BP payloads and defines the\n   mapping between
    OpenFlow messages and Bundles, the payload format,\n   and addressing and multiplexing
    considerations based on DTN Endpoint\n   Identifiers (EIDs).  This document further
    discusses conditions that\n   may occur on intermittently connected or high-latency
    links,\n   including fragmentation, duplicate delivery, out-of-order arrival,\n
    \  and expiration, and defines corresponding message handling rules.\n   These
    rules enable the transmission of OpenFlow messages across DTN\n   without modifying
    the semantics of the OpenFlow protocol.\n\n\t "

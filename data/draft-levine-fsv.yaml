  content: "   Flexible Sender Validation (FSV) is a lightweight validation\n   technique
    to detect and deter some kinds of e-mail address\n   forgery.  It publishes information
    in the DNS about IP\n   addresses authorized to send mail for a domain, one in
    a\n   family of IP based mail validation proposals dating back to\n   Paul Vixie's
    original in 2002[5].  FSV uses redundant copies\n   of IP data to permit both
    efficient use by very high-volume\n   mail servers, and simple implementation
    on low to moderate\n   volume mail servers.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Based on the QoS architecture and the DS codepoints defined in\nRFC2474
    and RFC2475 we define an application that creates a trusted\nenvironment. We introduce
    the notion of Trusted Networks (TN) a\nnetwork that has to satisfy a set of rules
    that can be specified by\neach network owner. Packets originating from this or
    another TN can\nbe treated with higher confidence and  higher QoS than packets
    from\nuntrusted networks. The basic tool of our proposal is ingress\nfiltering
    RFC2827. This approach may apply to both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\t "

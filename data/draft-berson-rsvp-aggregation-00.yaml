  content: "The Internet Integrated Services (IIS) architecture[2] has a\n   fundamental
    scaling problem in that per flow state is maintained at\n   all routers and end-systems
    supporting a flow.  This draft examines\n   the use of aggregation as a technique
    to reduce the amount of state\n   needed to provide IIS, and describes the modifications
    to RSVP to\n   support aggregation.  In our approach, routers at the edge of a\n
    \  region doing aggregation keep detailed IIS state, while in the\n   interior
    of this region, routers keep a greatly reduced amount of\n   state.  Packets will
    be tagged at the edge with scheduling\n   information that will be used in place
    of the detailed IIS state.\n   The aggregation scheme described will allow large
    scale deployment of\n   IIS without overloading routers with state and associated
    processing.\n\t "

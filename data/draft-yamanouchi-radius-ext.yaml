  content: "     This memo describes an  extension of RADIUS authentication protocol\n
    \    (RFC2138)   and RADIUS accounting    protocol (RFC2139) to  provide\n     authentication
    service about multicast receivers and senders to the\n     ingress and egress
    routers, and to  keep track of the receiving and\n     sending  clients for multicast
    data   feed service management.  New\n     services and  attributes are added
    \ to the RADIUS definitions while\n     the   authentication transaction  mechanisms
    \  are preserved.   The\n     authentication server  authenticates the multicast
    \ receiver/sender\n     by using the  CHAP-based  mechanism.  The account  server
    \ logs the\n     start and stop points of multicast route  usage.  This extension
    is\n     intended  to  be used in  conjunction  with the  IGMP extension for\n
    \    multicast receiver and sender authentication.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines an extension to The OAuth 2.0\n   Authorization
    Framework that enables the authorization server to\n   dynamically provide the
    client using it with additional information\n   about the current protocol interaction
    that can be validated by the\n   client and that enables the client to dynamically
    provide the\n   authorization server with additional information about the current\n
    \  protocol interaction that can be validated by the authorization\n   server.
    \ This additional information can be used by the client and\n   the authorization
    server to prevent classes of attacks in which the\n   client might otherwise be
    tricked into using inconsistent sets of\n   metadata from multiple authorization
    servers, including potentially\n   using a token endpoint that does not belong
    to the same authorization\n   server as the authorization endpoint used.  Recent
    research\n   publications refer to these as \"IdP Mix-Up\" and \"Malicious Endpoint\"\n
    \  attacks.\n\n\t "

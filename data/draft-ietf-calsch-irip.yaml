    Interoperability Protocol [ITIP] to a real-time\ntransport. Calendaring entries

    [RFC-2045], [RFC-2046],\n[RFC-2047], [RFC-2048] and [RFC-2049].\n \nThis document
    is based on the calendaring and scheduling model defined\nby [ICMS].\n \nThis
    document is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF)
    Calendaring and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group.\nMore information about the
    IETF CALSCH working group activities can be\nfound on the IMC website at http://www.imc.org,

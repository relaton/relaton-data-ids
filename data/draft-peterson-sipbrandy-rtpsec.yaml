  content: "   Although the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) includes a suite of\n
    \  security services that has been expanded by numerous specifications\n   over
    the years, there is no single place that explains how to use SIP\n   to establish
    confidential media sessions.  Additionally, existing\n   mechanisms have some
    feature gaps that need to be identified and\n   resolved in order for them to
    address the pervasive monitoring threat\n   model.  This specification describes
    best practices for negotiating\n   confidential media with SIP, including both
    comprehensive protection\n   solutions which bind the media to SIP-layer identities
    as well as\n   opportunistic security solutions.\n\n\t "

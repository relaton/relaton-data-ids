  script: Latn
  content: "   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861 going back to RFC 1970) was defined\n
    \  at a time when link-local multicast was as reliable and with the same\n   network
    cost (send a packet on a yellow-coax Ethernet) as unicast and\n   where the hosts
    were assumed to be always on and connected.\n\n   Since 1996 we've seen a significant
    change with both an introduction\n   of wireless networks and battery operated
    devices, which poses\n   significant challenges for the old assumptions.  We are
    also seeing\n   datacenter networks where virtual machines are not always on and\n
    \  connected, and scaling of multicast can be challenging.\n\n   This specification
    contains extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\n   which remove most use of multicast
    and make sleeping hosts more\n   efficient.  The specification includes a default
    mixed mode where a\n   link can have an arbitrary mix of hosts and/or routers
    - some\n   implementing legacy Neighbor Discovery and some implementing the\n
    \  optimizations in this specification.  The optimizations provide\n   incremental
    benefits to hosts as soon as the first updated routers\n   are deployed on a link.\n\n\t "

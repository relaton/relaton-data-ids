  content: "   In many IETF documents several key words are used to signify the\n
    \  requirements in the spefcification. This document defines the\n   requirement
    levels imposed by these words as they should be\n   interpreted in IETF documments.
    The requirement levels are basically\n   equivalent to the ones proposed by RFC
    2119[1]. But easier to\n   understand the strength of key words and to introduce
    new key words\n   to the hierarchy of requirement levels if ever there's a need.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IP addressing with references (referred to
    as IPREF) and how it can be used with IPv4 and IPv6. IPREF is a private-to-private
    technology where hosts on private networks communicate with hosts on other private
    networks directly. Special addresses, called IPREF addresses, are used for the
    purpose. It also describes how hosts on private networks may publish their IPREF
    addresses via Domain Name System (DNS).</p>"

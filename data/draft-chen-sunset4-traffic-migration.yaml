  content: "   In order to make a graceful IPv4 sunset, this memo described a method\n
    \  helping traffic migration to IPv6.  With the growth of IPv6 traffic,\n   operators
    could safely turn off IPv4 and evolve to IPv6-only network.\n   In order to achieve
    the goal, new traffic-migration options have been\n   proposed in DHCPv6 and PCP.
    \ IPv6 traffic steering could be performed\n   using those configurations.\n\n\t "

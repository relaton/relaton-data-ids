  content: "   This memo lists the security issues not addressed by SIPS and other\n
    \  drafts in progress.  It provides two solutions to it.  First solution\n   calls
    for fixing issues one by one.  The second solution avoids the\n   security issues
    altogether.  It has potential to obviate the need of\n   'Security Consideration'
    section from IETF documents.  It requires\n   wider acceptance from the community.
    \ Author is requesting IETF\n   community to voice it's opinion and share the
    second solution with\n   non-IETF members also to have their opinion.\n\n\t "

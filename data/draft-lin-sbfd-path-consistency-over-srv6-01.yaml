  content: "   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor\n   paths
    between nodes. Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified\n   mechanism which
    is suitable for monitoring of paths that are setup\n   dynamically and on a large
    scale network. In SRv6, when a headend\n   use S-BFD to monitor the segment list/CPath
    of SRv6 Policy, the\n   forward path of control packet is indicated by segment
    list, the\n   reverse path of response control packet is via the shortest path\n
    \  from the reflector back to the initiator (headend) as determined by\n   routing.
    The forward path and reverse path of control packet are\n   likely inconsistent
    going through different intermediate nodes or\n   links. This document describes
    a method to keep the forward path and\n   reverse path of S-BFD consistent when
    detecting SRv6 Policy.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>When a packet is sent from one host to the other, one normally expects
    that exactly one copy of the packet that was sent arrives at the destination.
    It is, however, possible that a packet is either lost or that multiple copies
    arrive. In earlier work, a metric for packet loss was defined. This metric quantifies
    the case where a packet that is sent does not arrive at its destination within
    a reasonable time. In this memo, a metric for another case is defined: a packet
    is sent, but multiple copies arrive. The document also discusses streams and methods
    to summarize the results of streams. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"

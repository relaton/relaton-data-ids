  content: "   Bundled exchanges provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP\n   request+response
    pairs to transmit or store them together.  They can\n   include multiple top-level
    resources with one identified as the\n   default by a manifest, provide random
    access to their component\n   exchanges, and efficiently store 8-bit resources.\n\n\t "

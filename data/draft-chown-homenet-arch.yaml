  content: "   This text describes evolving networking technology within small\n   \"residential
    home\" networks.  The goal of this memo is to define the\n   architecture for
    IPv6-based home networking and the associated\n   principles and considerations.
    \ The text highlights the impact of\n   IPv6 on home networking, illustrates topology
    scenarios, and shows\n   how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed
    in home\n   networking.  The architecture describes the need for specific\n   protocol
    extensions for certain additional functionality.  It is\n   assumed that the IPv6
    home network runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack\n   network, but there are no
    recommendations in this memo for the IPv4\n   part of the network.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the raionale and requirements for in-band\n
    \  signalling of Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics for the\n   Internet
    Protocol (IP) There has been extensive work on QoS for IP,\n   leading to the
    development of RSVP, NSIS and other protocols.  New\n   requirements emerging
    from the use of IP to carry services such as\n   video and voice are leading in
    turn to additional requirements for\n   QoS signalling. The authors believe that
    these can best be met by\n   adding in-band signalling to IP, complementing the
    existing protocols\n   for QoS signalling.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a stateless transport mechanism and message\n
    \  content between an Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) and its UAS Service\n   Supplier
    (USS) for Network Remote ID (Net-RID) messages.  It\n   leverages the Broadcast
    Remote ID (B-RID) messages as constructed by\n   the UA, or constructed by the
    Ground Control Station (GCS) from the\n   Command-and-Control (C2) messages that
    are then sent directly over\n   UDP from the UAS.  These messages are authenticated
    by the DRIP\n   Authentication messages if originating from the UA.  When originating\n
    \  from the GCS, CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) signed by the GCS's DRIP Entity\n   Tag
    (DET), are used.\n\n   Transport privacy is out-of-scope in this approach per
    the stateless\n   design.  Some proposals are offered for data privacy that require\n
    \  some minimal state.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol's\n
    \  schema RFC RFC7643 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643)\n   defines
    the complex core schema attributes \"roles\" and\n   \"entitlements\".  For both
    of these concepts, frequently only a\n   predetermined set of values are accepted
    by a SCIM service provider.\n   The values that are accepted may vary per customer
    or tenant based on\n   customizable configuration in the service provider's application
    or\n   based on other criteria such as what services have been purchased.\n   This
    document defines an extension to the SCIM 2.0 standard to allow\n   SCIM service
    providers to represent available data pertaining to\n   roles and entitlements
    so that SCIM clients can consume this\n   information and provide easier management
    of role and entitlement\n   assignments.\n\n\t "

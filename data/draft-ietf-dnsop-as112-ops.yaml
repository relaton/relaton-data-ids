  content: "Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that are
    not globally unique. Examples are the addresses designated in RFC 1918 for private
    use within individual sites.\n\n Devices in such environments may occasionally
    originate Domain Name System (DNS) queries (so-called \"reverse lookups\") corresponding
    to those private-use addresses. Since the addresses concerned have only local
    significance, it is good practice for site administrators to ensure that such
    queries are answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries to
    follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered
    within the site.\n\n It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful
    answers to such queries. In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use
    addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries
    is large and growing. The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed sink for
    such queries in order to reduce the load on the IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers.
    The AS112 project is named after the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was assigned
    to it.\n\n This document describes the steps required to install a new AS112 node
    and offers advice relating to such a node's operation. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

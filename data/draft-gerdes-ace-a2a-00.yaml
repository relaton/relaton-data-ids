  content: "   Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of\n   processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.  Due to these
    constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily applicable.  Nevertheless,
    an authentication and\n   authorization solution is needed to ensure the security
    of these\n   devices.\n\n   During the lifecycle of a constrained device, responsibility
    for\n   managing authorization policies for the constrained device may change\n
    \  several times.  To ensure the security of the constrained devices,\n   the
    authorization to authorize must be transferred to the new\n   principal in a secure
    way.\n\n   The Delegated CoAP Authorization Framework (DCAF) specifies how\n   resource-constrained
    nodes can delegate defined authentication- and\n   authorization-related tasks
    to less-constrained devices called\n   Authorization Managers, thus limiting the
    hardware requirements of\n   the security solution for the constrained devices.\n\n
    \  This document defines how DCAF can be used to manage the\n   Authorization
    Manager of a constrained device and introduces a\n   flexible authorization solution
    for the whole lifecycle of a\n   constrained device.\n\n\t "

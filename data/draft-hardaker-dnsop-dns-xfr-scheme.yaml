- content: "<p>The DNS protocol provides an in-band mechanism for transferring the
    contents of a zone from a server to a client. This is most frequently used when
    secondary servers are transferring the DNS zone content from their configured
    primary server. This document defines a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme
    for referencing DNS servers from which DNS zone contents can be transferred.</p>"

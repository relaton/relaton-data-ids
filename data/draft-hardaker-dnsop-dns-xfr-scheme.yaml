  content: "   The DNS protocol provides an in-band mechanism for transferring the\n
    \  contents of a zone from a server to a client.  This is most\n   frequently
    used when secondary servers are transferring the DNS zone\n   content from their
    configured primary server.\n\n   This document defines a Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) scheme for\n   referencing DNS servers from which DNS zone contents can
    be\n   transferred.\n\n\t "

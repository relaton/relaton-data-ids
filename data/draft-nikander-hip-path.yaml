  content: "   With the extensions defined in this document Host Identity Protocol\n
    \  (HIP) can traverse legacy Network Address Translators (NATs) and\n   certain
    firewalls.  The extension will be useful as part of the base\n   exchange and
    with the HIP Registration Extension.  By using a\n   rendezvous server an additional
    entity inside the network is\n   utilized, which not only allows but also supports
    more restrictive\n   NATs to be traversed.\n\n\t "

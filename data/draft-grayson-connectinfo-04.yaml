  content: "   This document describes a syntax for the Connect-Info attribute used\n
    \  with the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)\n   protocol,
    enabling clients to provide servers information pertaining\n   to the operation
    of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network.\n\n   The document has been developed by the
    Wireless Broadband Alliance's\n   Access Network Metrics project team.  This project
    was formed to\n   addresses the adoption of RADIUS used to support Wi-Fi authentication\n
    \  in environments that are increasingly complex; with multiple possible\n   overlapping
    networks, operating using different Wi-Fi technology\n   generations, utilizing
    varied spectrum allocations, and where the AAA\n   provider wants to ensure their
    users are getting a great Wi-Fi\n   experience.  In such environments, the Wi-Fi
    industry can benefit\n   from a consistent framework that provides visibility
    of Wi-Fi network\n   metrics, increasing confidence in Wi-Fi to support carrier
    use-cases,\n   and consequently driving adoption.\n\n   The use of a well defined
    syntax for the Connect-Info attribute that\n   simultaneously supports existing
    Wi-Fi implementations while also\n   addressing new requirements may have wider
    applicability by the\n   broader Wi-Fi community.\n\n   This document is an independent
    submission.  It is not an IETF\n   standard and does not have IETF consensus.\n\n\t "

  content: "IPv6 hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration are able to\nautomatically
    configure their IPv6 address and default router\nsettings. However, further settings
    are not available.   If such\nhosts wish to automatically configure their DNS,
    NTP or other\nspecific settings the stateless variant of the Dynamic Host\nConfiguration
    Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) could be used.   This\ncombination of Stateless Address
    Autoconfiguration and stateless\nDHCPv6 could be used quite commonly in IPv6 networks.
    \  However,\nhosts using such a combination currently have no means by which to
    be\ninformed of changes in stateless DHCPv6 option settings, e.g. the\naddition
    of a new NTP server address, changes in DNS search paths, or\nfull site renumbering.
    This document is presented as a problem\nstatement from which a solution should
    be proposed in a subsequent\ndocument.\n\t "

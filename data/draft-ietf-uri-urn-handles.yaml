  content: "The Handle System provides identifiers for digital objects and other resources
    in distributed computer systems.  These identifiers are known as handles.  The
    system ensures that handles are unique and that they can be retained over long
    time periods.   Since the system makes no assumptions about the characteristics
    of the items that are identified, handles can be used in a wide variety of systems
    and applications.      The handle system has the following components:  naming
    authorities, handle generators, the global handle server, local handle servers,
    caching handle servers, client software libraries, proxy servers, and administrative
    tools.  For reasons of performance and availability, the global, local, and caching
    servers are implemented as distributed systems comprising many server computers.
    \ All components, except the local handle server, have been implemented and are
    available for general use by the research community.     The handle system provides
    all the capabilities listed in RFC1737, K. Sollins, L. Masinter, 'Functional Requirements
    for Uniform Resource Names', 12/20/1994.\n\t "

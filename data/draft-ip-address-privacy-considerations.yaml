  content: "   This document provides an overview of privacy considerations related\n
    \  to user IP addresses.  It includes an analysis of some current use\n   cases
    for tracking of user IP addresses, mainly in the context of\n   anti-abuse.  It
    discusses the privacy issues associated with such\n   tracking and provides input
    on mechanisms to improve the privacy of\n   this existing model.  It then captures
    requirements for proposed\n   'replacement signals' for IP addresses from this
    analysis.  In\n   addition, existing and under-development techniques are evaluated
    for\n   fulfilling these requirements.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the Multimedia Internet KEYing-Sakai-Kasahara
    Key Encryption (MIKEY-SAKKE), a method of key exchange that uses Identity-based
    Public Key Cryptography (IDPKC) to establish a shared secret value and certificateless
    signatures to provide source authentication.  MIKEY-SAKKE has a number of desirable
    features, including simplex transmission, scalability, low-latency call setup,
    and support for secure deferred delivery.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

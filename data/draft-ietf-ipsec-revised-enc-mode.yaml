  content: "The ISAKMP/Oakley document [HC97] describes a proposed standard for\n
    \  using the Oakley Key Exchange Protocol in conjunction with ISAKMP to\n   obtain
    authenticated and secret keying material for use with ISAKMP,\n   and for other
    security associations such as AH and ESP for the IETF\n   IPsec DOI.\n \n   The
    public-key encryption method of carrying out Phase 1 of the key\n   exchange in
    the ISAKMP/Oakley document provides significant security\n   advantages over the
    other alternatives and should be the method of\n   choice in many implementations.
    Unfortunately, as currently\n   described in [HC97] the method requires two public
    key\n   encryption and decryption operations from both the Initiator and\n   the
    Responder. The present document describes a small modification\n   to this method.
    The resulting scheme requires only one public key\n   encryption and decryption
    operation from each party, while maintaining\n   (and even improving on) the strong
    security properties of the\n   ISAKMP/Oakley public-key encryption mode.\n \n
    \  Remark: This document is NOT self-contained, it is intended as an\n   addendum
    to the authentication methods defined in [HC97].\n   In particular, it uses notation
    and definitions of [HC97].\n   Thus, it is best read in conjunction with [HC97].\n\t "

  content: "This document provides an independent reference for the XML \nprocessing
    profile developed by the WebDAV WG in [RFC2518]. It does \nthis by copying Section
    14 and Appendix 4 as well as examples from \nAppendix 3 of [RFC2518] and editing
    out any WebDAV specific parts. \n\nThis information has been broken out into its
    own independent \nreference in order to make it easier for other standards to
    \nreference just the WebDAV XML processing profile without having to \nreference
    the entire WebDAV standard or require their readers to \nunderstand which parts
    of the profile are WebDAV specific and which \nparts are not.\n\t "

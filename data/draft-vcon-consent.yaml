  content: "   This document defines a consent attachment type for Voice\n   Conversations
    (vCon), establishing standardized mechanisms for\n   recording, verifying, and
    managing consent information within\n   conversation containers.  The consent
    attachment addresses privacy\n   compliance challenges through structured metadata
    including\n   consenting parties, temporal validity periods, and cryptographic\n
    \  proof mechanisms.\n\n   The specification defines the mandatory and optional
    fields for\n   consent attachments, including expiration timestamps, party\n   references,
    dialog segments, and consent arrays.  It supports\n   granular consent management
    through purpose-based permissions and\n   integrates with the AI Preferences vocabulary
    for automated\n   processing systems.  The attachment type incorporates SCITT
    (Supply\n   Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) for cryptographic\n   transparency
    and provides integration patterns for consent ledger\n   services.\n\n   Key features
    include automated consent detection during conversation\n   processing, auditable
    consent records with cryptographic proofs,\n   support for consent revocation
    through superseding statements, and\n   integration with existing privacy regulations.
    \ The consent\n   attachment enables organizations to maintain compliance while\n
    \  providing sufficient structure for automated processing and\n   verification
    of consent throughout the vCon lifecycle.\n\n\t "

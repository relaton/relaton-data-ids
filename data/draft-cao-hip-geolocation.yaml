  content: "This document defines a new parameter for delivering geographic\n   location
    in Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  For mobile users using\n   HIP, one generic
    mechanism is proposed to share or update their geo-\n   location information with
    either rendezvous servers or their peers.\n   In addition, geo-location privacy
    is also protected with the help of\n   the ENCRYPTED parameter.\n\n\t "

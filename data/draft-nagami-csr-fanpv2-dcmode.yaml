  content: "    This memo describes the specification of FANPv2 (Flow Attribute\n
    \   Notification Protocol version 2) distributed control mode (DC-mode).\n    The
    FANPv2 is a protocol used by Cell Switch Routers (CSRs) to\n    communicate mapping
    information between a specific packet flow and a\n    virtual connection that
    conveys the packet flow.  In the DC-mode,\n    the control message exchange for
    a packet flow between each pair of\n    neighboring CSRs is initiated independently
    from the message\n    exchange for the same flow between any other pair of CSRs.
    The\n    DC-mode is applicable to the control of both unicast and multicast\n
    \   cut-through paths.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document optionally updates [RFC6378], \"MPLS Transport Profile\n
    \  (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection\", to change non-revertive operation to be\n   aligned
    with the behavior defined in [RFC4427] and in an effort to\n   satisfy the ITU-T's
    protection switching requirements.  An operator\n   command, Manual Switch to
    Working (MS-W) is also included to revert\n   traffic to the working path in non-revertive
    operation.\n\n\t "

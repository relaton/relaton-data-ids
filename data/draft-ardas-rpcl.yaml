  content: "Routing policies define a set of rules and actions to be applied by  proto-\n
    \  cols  when they send and receive routing updates.  When a protocol receives\n
    \  an updates, routing policies are used to determine if, and with what infor-\n
    \  mation  a  route  gets  added  to the Routing Information Base (RIB).  When\n
    \  preparing to send a routing update, routing policy is consulted to  see  if\n
    \  the  route  is  to be sent and if so, what information is to be included in\n
    \  the update.  The Routing Policy Configuration Language (RPCL)  specifies  a\n
    \  language for defining routing policies in a router.\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "   This document describes a mechanism whereby a DNS resolver can\n   opportunistically
    refresh the TTLs of cached records of a zone using\n   serial number information
    carried in responses from the zone's\n   nameservers.  As well as improving resolver
    response time by reducing\n   the need to make upstream queries, the mechanism
    can also reduce the\n   workload of authoritative servers.\n\n\t "

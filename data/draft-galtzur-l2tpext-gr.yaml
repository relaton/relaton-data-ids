  content: "This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the \nnegative
    effects on L2TP traffic caused by L2TP Control Connection \nEndpoint (LCCE) control
    plane restart, specifically by the restart of \nits control protocol component,
    on LCCEs that are capable of \npreserving the L2TP forwarding component ( a.k.a.
    the L2TP data \nplane) across the restart. \nThe mechanism described in this document
    is applicable to all LCCEs, \nboth those with the ability to preserve Forwarding
    State during the \ncontrol plane (CP) restart and those without (although the
    latter \nneeds to implement only a subset of the mechanism described in this \ndocument).\n\t "

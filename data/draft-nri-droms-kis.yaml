  content: "Within the metanetwork of networks that exchange electronic mail,  there
    are many directory services that provide partial coverage ofnetwork users; that
    is, directories with information about some subset of a particular network's user
    population.  Searching the collection of available directories is time-consuming
    and requires knowledge of each directory's user interface.  Although X.500 is
    currently under study as a basis for an Internet-wide directory service, it is
    unlikely that a universal user registry will be in place in the near future.  The
    Knowbot Information Service provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous directory
    services that simplifies the task of locating users in the combined network.\n\t "

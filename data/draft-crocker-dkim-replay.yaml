  content: "   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM, RFC6376) permits claiming some\n
    \  responsibility for a message by cryptographically associating a\n   domain
    name with the message.  For data covered by the cryptographic\n   signature, this
    also enables detecting changes made during transit.\n   DKIM survives basic email
    relaying.  In a Replay Attack, a recipient\n   of a DKIM-signed message re-posts
    the message to other recipients,\n   while retaining the original, validating
    signature, and thereby\n   leveraging the reputation of the original signer.  This
    document\n   discusses the resulting damage to email delivery, interoperability,\n
    \  and associated mail flows.  A significant challenge to mitigating\n   this
    problem is that it is difficult for receivers to differentiate\n   between legitimate
    forwarding flows and a DKIM Replay Attack.\n\n\t "

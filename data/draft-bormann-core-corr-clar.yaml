- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 7252 defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along\n
    \  with a number of additional specifications, including RFC 7641, RFC\n   7959,
    RFC 8132, and RFC 8323.  RFC 6690 defines the link format that\n   is used in
    CoAP self-description documents.\n\n   Some parts of the specification may be
    unclear or even contain errors\n   that may lead to misinterpretations that may
    impair interoperability\n   between different implementations.  The present document
    provides\n   corrections, additions, and clarifications to the RFCs cited; this\n
    \  document thus updates these RFCs.  In addition, other clarifications\n   related
    to the use of CoAP in other specifications, including RFC\n   7390 and RFC 8075,
    are also provided.\n\n\t "

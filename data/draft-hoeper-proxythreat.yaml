  content: "This memo defines a threat model for access networks with AAA\nproxies.
    \ Use cases of current and future applications in which AAA\nproxies are employed
    are described and it is discussed how proxies\ncould launch attacks in the defined
    use cases.  The risk associated\nwith these attacks in each use case is analyzed.
    \ In addition,\nmitigation techniques used in current AAA deployments are discussed\nand
    best practices for mitigating the identified attacks are\nidentified.  As a result,
    this draft can serve as a guideline for\nrisk assessments and problem mitigation
    by providers, implementers\nand protocol designers of systems with proxies.\n\t "

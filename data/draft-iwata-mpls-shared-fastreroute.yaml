  content: "This document proposes an enhanced scheme for fast rerouting which\nprovides
    means of quickly repairing LSPs in cases of link/node\nfailures. It also provides
    for the sharing of backup LSPs and their\nresources and thus allows minimization
    of requirements for backup\nresources.\n\t "

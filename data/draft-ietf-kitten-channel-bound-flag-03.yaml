  content: "   Channel binding is a technique that allows applications to use a\n
    \  secure channel at a lower layer without having to use authentication\n   at
    that lower layer.  The concept of channel binding comes from the\n   Generic Security
    Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-\n   API).  It turns out that
    the semantics commonly implemented are\n   different than those specified in the
    base GSS-API RFC (RFC2743), and\n   that that specification has a serious bug.
    \ This document addresses\n   both the inconsistency as-implemented and the specification
    bug.\n\n   This Internet-Draft proposes the addition of a \"channel bound\" return\n
    \  flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context()\n   functions.
    \ Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior\n   reflecting existing
    implementation deployments, and a behavior that\n   is only safe when the application
    specifically tells the GSS-API that\n   it (the application) supports the new
    behavior.  Additional API\n   elements related to this are also added, including
    a new security\n   context establishment API.\n\n\t "

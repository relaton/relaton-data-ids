  content: "   This document describes the AVORS (Avoiding Registration Storms)\n
    \  concept that allows the resumption of active UE (User Equipment)\n   registrations
    on other SIP Proxies within the SIP voice architecture.\n   The concept can be
    mapped on any architecture having a distributed\n   structure and could work for
    different protocols.  In this document,\n   the concept is exemplary explained
    regarding an architecture for\n   voice and could also be mapped on a 3GPP (3rd
    Generation Partnership\n   Project) architecture.  The AVORS concept increases
    service\n   continuity, improves network resilience and offers savings potential.\n
    \  Additionally, this document gives an outlook regarding stateless\n   voice
    architectures, load calculation aspects, and Service Based\n   Interfaces (SBI)
    with session data base interworking.  Security\n   aspects are considered in the
    security chapter.  As stated above the\n   AVORS principle is not only limited
    to the SIP protocol and could be\n   adopted by other protocols.\n\n\t "

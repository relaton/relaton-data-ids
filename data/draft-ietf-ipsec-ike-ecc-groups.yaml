  content: "   This document describes additional elliptic curve groups for use\n
    \  in IKE (as defined in RFC 2409) and IKEv2 (as defined in RFC 3406).\n   These
    groups are defined to align IKE and IKEv2 with other ECC\n   implementations and
    standards, and in addition, many of them\n   provide higher strength than the
    previousley defined Oakley\n   groups.\n\n\t "

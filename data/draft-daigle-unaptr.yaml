  content: "The purpose of this document is to define a new, straightforward Dynamic
    Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS) application to allow mapping of domain names
    to URIs for particular application services and protocols.  Although defined as
    a new DDDS application, dubbed U-NAPTR, this is effectively an extension of the
    Straightforward NAPTR (S-NAPTR) DDDS Application. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

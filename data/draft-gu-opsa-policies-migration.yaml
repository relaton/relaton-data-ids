  content: "   Virtualization and Virtual Machine (VM) migration provide Data Center\n
    \  with feasibility and improves the utilization of limited physical\n   resource,
    e.g. switches/routers, servers and links.  Meanwhile, a\n   variety of policies
    (e.g.  ACL, firewalls, load balancers, IPS and\n   QoS) are deployed in Data Center
    to improve system security and\n   gurantee SLA.  Those polices are executed by
    rules configured or\n   generated on network devices.  E.g. packet filtering policies
    are\n   executed by Access Control List on switches or firewalls.  Another\n   example
    is Load balancer (LB) who extablishes TCP/HTTP connections\n   with external clients
    and balances connections among server farm.\n   During this process, TCP connection
    tables are dynamically generated\n   on LB.  When VM migrates, the network devices
    that processing and\n   forward VM's packets may change.  In order to keep VM's
    running\n   serives and guanrantee security on new place, VM-relevant policies,\n
    \  including static policies as well as the dynamically generated\n   information,
    need to migrate with VM.\n\n   This draft describes some examples of the policies
    that need to\n   migrate with VM, the problems that need to consider when migrate\n
    \  polices in Data Center.  The goal is to justify that it is necessary\n   for
    IETF to make new effort on management of virtualized Data Center.\n\n\t "

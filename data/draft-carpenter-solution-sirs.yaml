  script: Latn
  content: "IETF specifications may not receive significant review,\nespecially beyond
    a single working group, until they\nare submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant
    problems\nwith a specification often are not detected until a\nproblematic approach
    has been adopted and considerable\neffort has been spent developing and documenting
    this\napproach. Major changes to address problems identified\nlate in the process
    take considerable effort and\nsignificantly delay a document that its authors\nbelieved
    to be ready for publication. The procedure\ndescribed in this document is intended
    to solve, or\npalliate, a number of related problems that have been\nobserved
    in the IETF process. The basic model is to\ncreate a team of Senior IETF Reviewers
    (SIRS), and have\nall documents receive a certain number of reviews by\nSIRs,
    prior to being submitted for publication. Review\nby SIRs at a very early stage
    is strongly encouraged.\n\t "

  content: "   SDSA approach is to assure that packets, going out the multihomed\n
    \  site, have the correct source address, regarding to the ISP and thus\n   to
    avoid the ingress filtering problem.  In that purpose, SDSA takes\n   into account
    the source address in the site routing decision for\n   outgoing packets, when
    default-route is involved.\n\n\t "

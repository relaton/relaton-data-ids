  content: "  Multicast is a preferred approach to send a single message to\n  multiple
    recipients but it is typically lossy. CoAP is the choice of\n  messaging for IoT.
    If using multicast to transmit CoAP messages\n  there is a risk they get lost
    and a further risk that sequences of\n  messages get disrupted and leave the system
    in an unknown or\n  unpleasant state.\n\n  In the device world we might want to
    guarantee that a whole sequence\n  of commands arrives at the device. For example
    a sequence to Open,\n  Report, Do some action, and Close. It is better that all
    of these\n  messages arrive or all of them do not arrive rather than have some\n
    \ of them arrive and to not know which ones failed.\n\n  CoAP messages tend to
    be small due to constrained resources on the\n  recipient devices. Existing frame
    sizes though are relatively large\n  so it is possible to pack these frames with
    several smaller CoAP\n  messages and send them as a group.\n\n  CoAP Multicast
    proposes the simplest way to do this. It is a device\n  independent method and
    adds no need for encryption channels.\n\n\n\t "

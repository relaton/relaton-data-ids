  content: "   This document considers control of photonic plugs in devices with\n
    \  packet functions from an architecture perspective.  Three specific\n   control
    solution deployment strategies are examined:\n\n   *  network technology partitioned
    domain controllers, with an\n      orchestrator (higher level controller) to coordinate
    the domain\n      controllers\n\n   *  single controller dealing with all network
    technologies\n\n   *  single control fabric in which components, from various
    vendors,\n      each focused on a specific control function, interact as peers
    to\n      provide holistic control of the network\n\n   For all of the examined
    control solution deployment strategies, the\n   control functions specializing
    in photonics determine the photonic\n   network setup on-going and these control
    functions directly control\n   the photonics of the network including the photonic
    plugs in devices\n   with packet functions.  There is a clear separation of concerns\n
    \  between packet function control and photonic function control such\n   that
    the control can be partitioned so that control functions\n   specializing in control
    of the packet network can control\n   corresponding functions in the device with
    packet functions with no\n   interference from the photonic control functions
    and vice versa.\n\nAbout This Document\n\n   This note is to be removed before

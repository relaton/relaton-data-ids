  content: "   This document is intended to inform the community about the impact
    of\n   the deployment of the proposed Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) standard\n
    \  that encrypts Server Name Indication (SNI) and other data.  Data\n   encapsulated
    by ECH (ie data included in the encrypted\n   ClientHelloInner) is of legitimate
    interest to on-path security\n   actors including those providing inline malware
    detection, parental\n   controls, content filtering to prevent access to malware
    and other\n   risky traffic, mandatory security controls etc.\n\n   The document
    includes observations on current use cases for SNI data\n   in a variety of contexts.
    \ It highlights how the use of that data is\n   important to the operators of
    both public and private networks and\n   shows how the loss of access to SNI data
    will cause difficulties in\n   the provision of a range of services to end-users,
    including the\n   potential weakening of cybersecurity defences.  Some mitigations
    are\n   identified that may be useful for inclusion by those considering the\n
    \  adoption of support for ECH in their software.\n\n\t "

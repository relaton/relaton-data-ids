  content: "   An OAuth 2.0 client requires specific information to interact with
    an\n   authorization server, including a client identifier issued by that\n   server.
    \ The OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591]\n   defines a mechansim
    for dynamic client registration that removes the\n   need for manual registration.
    \ This provides a more scalable\n   mechanism that can be used by clients that
    do not have a pre-existing\n   relationship with an authorization server, or where
    manually\n   configuring such relationships is prohibitive from a cost and scale\n
    \  perspective.  Examples of deployments that benefit from dynamic\n   client
    registration includes modern cloud architectures where\n   microservices are created
    on demand to meet scale requirements or for\n   use with emerging protocols like
    the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n   [MCP] which requires clients to register
    with an authorization server\n   even if they do not have a predefined relationship
    with the\n   authorization server.  Similar to modern cloud native workloads,
    MCP\n   service integrations may be ephemeral in nature.  The OAuth 2.0\n   Dynamic
    Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591] defines a software\n   statement that includes
    metadata about the client and is signed by a\n   developer or trusted third party.
    \ This specification describes the\n   use of specific third party credentials
    issued to workloads and\n   applications as software statements.  The specification
    describes two\n   types of credentials that may be used as software statements.
    \ The\n   first is Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE)\n
    \  credentials.  The second is the use of JWT representation of a\n   Verifiable
    Credentials [VC-JWT]\n\n\t "

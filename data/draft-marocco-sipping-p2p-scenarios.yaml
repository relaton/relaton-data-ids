  content: "This document provides a detailed description of some scenarios where\nSIP
    Connectivity could be easily achieved only in a peer to peer\nfashion.  Other
    than identifying use cases where a P2P SIP overlay\nNetwork is the only affordable
    solution, it describes how, under some\ncircumstances, signaling and media communications
    both to and from\npublic domains can be achieved with P2P SIP.  Furthermore, it\nidentifies
    some additional elements which can be shared by community\nmembers or let out
    by access providers for extending SIP Connectivity\nto such limited environments.\n\t "

  content: "RFC 2724 presented an analysis and taxonomy of RTFM attributes, and\nproposed
    adding new attributes and new types of attribute.  Many of\nthose 'new' attributes,
    especially the distribution-valued attributes,\nhave now had several years implementation
    experience.  This document\nproposes that these attributes be implemented, i.e
    that the RTFM\nArchitecture and Meter MIB RFCs be re-written to include them.\n\n\t "

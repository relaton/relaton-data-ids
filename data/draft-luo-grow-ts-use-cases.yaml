  content: "   Due to the dramatically increased network traffic and the desire of\n
    \  differentiated services, it is essential for operators to provide the\n   traffic
    steering service under limited network resources and maximize\n   their benefits
    at the same time.\n\n   This document lists some typical use cases for traffic
    steering\n   services.  This document does not attempt to enumerate all kinds
    of\n   scenarios, but rather it describes several key features of these\n   scenarios
    from which solutions may be constructed.\n\n\n\t "

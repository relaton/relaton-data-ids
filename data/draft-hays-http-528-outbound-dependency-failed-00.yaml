  content: "   This document defines a new HTTP 5xx status code, 528 (Outbound\n   Dependency
    Failed), used to indicate that a server received, parsed,\n   and processed a
    request correctly, but could not complete it because\n   a required downstream
    dependency malfunctioned or was in a non-\n   transient failure state.\n\n   Unlike
    500 (Internal Server Error), which SHOULD be reserved for\n   actual faults within
    the responding service (including improper error\n   handling), 528 explicitly
    signals that the responding service\n   operated as intended and the failure lies
    in a dependency.  Unlike\n   503 (Service Unavailable), 528 does not imply a temporary
    condition\n   expected to recover without intervention.\n\n\t "

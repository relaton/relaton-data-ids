abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new HTTP 5xx status code, 528 (Outbound Dependency
    Failed), used to indicate that a server received, parsed, and processed a request
    correctly, but could not complete it because a required downstream dependency
    malfunctioned or was in a non- transient failure state. Unlike 500 (Internal Server
    Error), which SHOULD be reserved for actual faults within the responding service
    (including improper error handling), 528 explicitly signals that the responding
    service operated as intended and the failure lies in a dependency. Unlike 503
    (Service Unavailable), 528 does not imply a temporary condition expected to recover
    without intervention.</p>"

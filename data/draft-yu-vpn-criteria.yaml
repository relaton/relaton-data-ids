  content: "A variety of mechanisms for implementing Virtual Private Network\n(VPN)
    utilizing public IP network infrastructure have been proposed\nin [1,2,3,4] and
    more may be emerging. This document attempts to\nidentify a set of criteria for
    evaluating such mechanisms. The\ncriteria could be used by IETF for evaluating
    a VPN proposal before\nadvancing it to standard track or by VPN Service Providers
    or\nenterprise network administrators for choosing which mechanism to use\nin
    order to implement their desired VPN networks. The mechanisms this\ncriteria addresses
    are exclusively for implementing IP based VPNs, as\noppose to non-IP based ones,
    such as Frame Relay based VPNs, etc.\n\n\t "

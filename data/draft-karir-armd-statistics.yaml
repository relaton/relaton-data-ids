  content: "   As large scale data centers continue to grow with an ever-increasing\n
    \  number of virtual and physical servers there is a need to re-\n   evaluate
    performance at the network edge.  Performance is often\n   critical for large
    scale data center scale applications and it is\n   important to minimize any unnecessary
    latency or load in order to\n   streamline the operation of services at such large
    scales.  To\n   extract maximum performance from these applications it is important\n
    \  to optimize and tune all the layers in the data center stack.  One\n   critical
    area that requires particular attention is the link-layer\n   address resolution
    protocol that maps an IP address with the\n   specific hardware address at the
    edge of the network.\n\n   The goal of this document is to characterize this problem
    space in\n   detail in order to better understand the scale of the problem as\n
    \  well as to identify particular scenarios where address resolution\n   might
    have greater adverse impact on performance.\n\n\n\t "

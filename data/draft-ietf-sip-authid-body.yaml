  content: "RFC 3261 introduces the concept of adding an S/MIME body to a Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) request or response in order to provide reference integrity
    over its headers.  This document provides a more specific mechanism to derive
    integrity and authentication properties from an 'authenticated identity body',
    a digitally-signed SIP message, or message fragment.  A standard format for such
    bodies (known as Authenticated Identity Bodies, or AIBs) is given in this document.
    \ Some considerations for the processing of AIBs by recipients of SIP messages
    with such bodies are also given. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

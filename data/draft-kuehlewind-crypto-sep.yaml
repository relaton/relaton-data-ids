- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Based on the increasing deployment of session resumption mechanisms\n
    \  where cryptographic context can be resumed to transmit application\n   data
    with the first packet without delay for connection setup and\n   negotiation,
    this draft proposes a split to separate connections used\n   to set up encryption
    context and negotiate capabilities from\n   connections used to transmit application
    data.  While cryptographic\n   context and endpoint capabilities need to be be
    known before\n   encrypted application data can be sent, there is otherwise no\n
    \  technical constraint that the crypto handshake has to be performed on\n   the
    same transport connection.  This document discusses requirements\n   on the cryptographic
    protocol to establish medium- to long-lived\n   association that can be used by
    different transport protocols that\n   implement different transport services.\n\n\t "

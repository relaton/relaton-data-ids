  script: Latn
  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) architecture [SR-ARCH] introduces a new MPLS\n
    \  paradigm in which a sender of a packet is allowed to partially or\n   completely
    specify the route the packet takes through the network by\n   using stacked MPLS
    labels. The current SR architecture requires an\n   end-to-end MPLS Label Switched
    Path (LSP) between any two SR-enabled\n   routers (e.g., two adjacent hops of
    a given explicit path). In order\n   to enable SR to be deployed even when there
    are non-MPLS routers\n   along the path between two SR-enabled routers, it is
    desirable to\n   have an alternative, which allows the use of IP-based tunnels
    (e.g.,\n   GRE tunnels) to connect two SR-enabled routers. This document\n   describes
    a mechanism for such usage.\n\n\t "

  content: "   <EDITOR NOTE: This document does not change the status (MUST, MAY,\n
    \  RECOMMENDED, etc) of any of the algorithms listed in [RFC8624]; that\n   is
    the work of future documents.  Instead, this document moves the\n   canonical
    list of algorithms from [RFC8624] to an IANA registry.\n   This is done for two
    reasons: 1) to allow the list to be updated more\n   easily, and, much more importantly,
    2) to allow the list to be more\n   easily referenced.>\n\n   The DNSSEC protocol
    makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to\n   provide authentication of
    DNS data and proof of non-existence.  To\n   ensure interoperability between DNS
    resolvers and DNS authoritative\n   servers, it is necessary to specify both a
    set of algorithm\n   implementation requirements and usage guidelines to ensure
    that there\n   is at least one algorithm that all implementations support.  This\n
    \  document updates [RFC8624] by moving the canonical source of\n   algorithm
    implementation requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC\n   from [RFC8624] to
    an IANA registry.  Future extensions to this\n   registry can be made under new,
    incremental update RFCs.\n\n\t "

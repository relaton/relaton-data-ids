  content: "This document captures use cases and associated requirements for an\nIPv6
    Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) router.  Specifically, the\ncurrent version
    of this document focuses on the provisioning of an\nIPv6 CPE router and the provisioning
    of IPv6 Home Devices attached to\nit.  It also addresses IPv6 traffic forwarding
    and IPv6 CPE Router\nsecurity.  This document also identifies areas for future\nconsideration.
    \ These areas include prefix sub-delegation, IPv6\nmulticast, transition and tunneling
    mechanisms, provisioning\nconsistency between DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, and DNS support.
    \ This\ndocument does not address IPv4 use cases or requirements, as they are\nwidely
    understood; however, it is expected that IPv6 CPE Routers will\nalso support IPv4.\n\t "

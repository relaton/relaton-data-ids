  content: "Relentless congestion control is a simple modification that can be\napplied
    to almost any AIMD style congestion control: instead of\napplying a multiplicative
    reduction to cwnd after a loss, cwnd is\nreduced by the number of lost segments.
    \ It can be modeled as a\nstrict implementation of van Jacobson's Packet Conservation\nPrinciple.
    \ During recovery, new segments are injected into the\nnetwork in exact accordance
    with the segments that are reported to\nhave been delivered to the receiver by
    the returning ACKs.\n\nThis algorithm offers a valuable new congestion control
    property: the\nTCP portion of the control loop has exactly unity gain, which should\nmake
    it easier to implement simple controllers in network devices to\naccurately control
    queue sizes across a huge range of scales.\n\nRelentless Congestion Control conforms
    to neither the details nor the\nphilosophy of current congestion control standards.
    \ These standards\nare based on the idea that the Internet can attain sufficient\nfairness
    by having relatively simple network devices send uniform\ncongestion signals to
    all flows, and mandating that all protocols\nhave equivalent responses to these
    congestion signals.\n\nTo function appropriately in a shared environment, Relentless\nCongestion
    Control requires that the network allocates capacity\nthrough some technique such
    as Fair Queuing, Approximate Fair\nDropping, etc.  The salient features of these
    algorithms are that\nthey segregate the traffic into distinct flows, and send
    different\ncongestion signals to each flow.  This alternative congestion control\nparadigm
    is described in a separate document, also under\nconsideration by the ICCRG.\n\nThe
    goal of the document is to illustrate some new protocol features\nand properties
    might be possible if we relax the \"TCP-friendly\"\nmandate.  A secondary goal
    of Relentless TCP is to make a distinction\nbetween the bottlenecks that belong
    to protocol itself, vs standard\ncongestion control and the \"TCP-friendly\" paradigm.\n\t "

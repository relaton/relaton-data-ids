  content: "Networks of low power wireless devices introduce novel IP routing\n   issues.
    \ Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and\n   smart objects,
    have difficult constraints: very limited memory,\n   little processing power,
    and long sleep periods.  As most of these\n   devices are battery-powered, energy
    efficiency is critically\n   important.  Wireless link qualities can vary significantly
    over time,\n   requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize topology\n
    \  change energy costs.  Routing over such low power and lossy networks\n   has
    requirements that existing mesh protocols only partially address.\n   This document
    provides a brief survey of the strengths and weaknesses\n   of existing protocols
    with respect to this class of networks.  It\n   provides guidance on how lessons
    from existing and prior efforts can\n   be leveraged in future protocol design.\n\t "

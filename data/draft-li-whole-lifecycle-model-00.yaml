  content: "Dynamic composing Web Services provides an efficient mechanism to \noffer
    complex large systems. Substantial progress has already been \nmade towards composing
    Web Services. Unfortunately, these approaches \ncannot build a model of the whole
    life cycle of composed Web Services. \nIn order to solve this problem, this draft
    designed a whole life cycle model named Service-Cloud model based on the forming
    picture of clouds \nin nature. Service-Cloud model can describe the whole life
    cycle of the composed web Services: discovery, compose, publish, and terminate.\n\t "

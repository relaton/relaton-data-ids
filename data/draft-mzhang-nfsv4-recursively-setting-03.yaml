  content: "   In recent years, the concept of near-data computing has been widely\n
    \  recognized in storage architectures.  The core idea is to process\n   data
    nearby, reduce the overhead of network transmission, and utilize\n   the computing
    capability of smart devices (such as intelligent NICs,\n   smart SSDs, and DPUs).
    \ This reduces CPU and memory usage of clients\n   (computing nodes) and improves
    data processing efficiency.  This\n   design idea is applied in NFSv4.2 or future
    NFS verions, such as\n   Server-Side Copy, in which client sends the control command
    and the\n   storage server copies data without passing through the data between\n
    \  the client and storage server.  Compared with traditional copy\n   operations,
    data is read from the source storage server and then\n   written to the target
    storage server after two network transmissions.\n   Data transmission on the network
    is reduced, and bandwidth resources\n   are greatly released.  In addition, the
    client changes from an\n   original data copy executor to a data copy controller,
    and a specific\n   execution action is executed by the storage server.  Therefore,
    a\n   large amount of computing resources and memory resources are saved on\n
    \  the client side.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the problem statement for IPv6-based vehicle-\n
    \  to-infrastructure networking.  Dedicated Short-Range Communications\n   (DSRC)
    is standardized as IEEE 802.11p for the wireless media access\n   in vehicular
    networks.  This document addresses the extension of IPv6\n   as the network layer
    protocol in vehicular networks and is focused on\n   the networking issues in
    one-hop communication between a Road-Side\n   Unit (RSU) and vehicle.  The RSU
    is connected to the Internet and\n   allows vehicles to have the Internet access
    if connected.  The major\n   issues of including IPv6 in vehicular networks are
    neighbor discovery\n   protocol, stateless address autoconfiguration, and DNS
    configuration\n   for the Internet connectivity over DSRC.  Also, when a vehicle
    and an\n   RSU have an internal network, respectively, the document discusses\n
    \  the issues of the internetworking between the vehicle's internal\n   network
    and the RSU's internal network (e.g., prefix discovery,\n   prefix exchange, and
    service discovery), and also security and\n   privacy issues.\n\n\t "

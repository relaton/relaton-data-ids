  content: "   The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) defines the specification\n
    \  of congestion window sizes for data sessions.  In addition, an LNS\n   is given
    the capability to turn off sequence number processing for\n   a data session,
    provided the LAC did not include the Sequencing\n   Required AVP during session
    setup.  This document specifies a\n   mechanism whereby an L2TP peer can dynamically
    change the maximum\n   window size values being used for a data session, in order
    to\n   provide the flexibility to operate with smaller window sizes when\n   history-bound
    protocols are operating over a session, and larger\n   window sizes when no history-bound
    protocols are operating over a\n   session.\n\n\t "

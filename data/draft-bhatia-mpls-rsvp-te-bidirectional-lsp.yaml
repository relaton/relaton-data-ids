  content: "There are several applications that require symmetric Multiprotocol\nLabel
    Switching (MPLS) path between two points.  This cannot be\nachieved with regular
    MPLS as the LSPs are unidirectional.  If\nsymmetry is required, a separate LSP
    in each direction is required\nfor bidirectional traffic flow.  Generalized MPLS
    on the other hand,\nhas provisions for setting up a bidirectional LSP.  This document\nuses
    the extensions introduced for GMPLS and applies it to regular\nMPLS for establishing
    bidirectional LSPs.  Additionally, it also\ndescribes how bi-directional symmetrical
    Fast Reroute using both one-\nto-one and facility backup can be achieved.\n\t "

  content: "\n   This memo presents a method for annotating XML schemas expressed
    in\n   the RELAX NG language and transforming them to a form suitable for\n   direct
    inclusion in an XML source of an I-D or RFC.  The XSLT\n   (Extensible Stylesheet
    Language Transformations) stylesheet\n   performing the transformation also automatically
    generates cross-\n   references between RELAX NG pattern definitions and their
    references.\n\n\n\t "

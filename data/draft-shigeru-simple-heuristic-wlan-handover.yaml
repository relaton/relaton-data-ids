  content: "   This document discusses handover decision criteria for avoiding\n   deterioration
    in communication quality during WLAN handover, in\n   particular at handover initiation.
    \ We first describe problems for\n   handover decision criteria employed by existing
    mobility management\n   technologies, such as Mobile IP and mSCTP.  We then propose
    the\n   number of frame retransmissions as a simple heuristic for handover\n   decisions
    and discuss its advantages and disadvantages.  \n   In addition, we introduce
    our proposed method using the number \n   of frame retransmissions.\n\n\n\t "

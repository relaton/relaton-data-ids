  content: "During the last few years, awareness has been raised about a number of
    \"blind\" attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP) and similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks range from throughput
    reduction to broken connections or data corruption.  These attacks rely on the
    attacker's ability to guess or know the five-tuple (Protocol, Source Address,
    Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport
    protocol instance to be attacked.  This document describes a number of simple
    and efficient methods for the selection of the client port number, such that the
    possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  While this is
    not a replacement for cryptographic methods for protecting the transport-protocol
    instance, the aforementioned port selection algorithms provide improved security
    with very little effort and without any key management overhead.  The algorithms
    described in this document are local policies that may be incrementally deployed
    and that do not violate the specifications of any of the transport protocols that
    may benefit from them, such as TCP, UDP, UDP-lite, Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP), Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and RTP (provided
    that the RTP application explicitly signals the RTP and RTCP port numbers).  This
    memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.\n\t "

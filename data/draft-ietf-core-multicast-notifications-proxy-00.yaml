abstract:
- content: <p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) allows clients to "observe"
    resources at a server and to receive notifications as unicast responses upon changes
    of the resource state. Instead of sending a distinct unicast notification to each
    different client, a server can alternatively send a single notification as a response
    message over multicast, to all the clients observing the same target resource.
    When doing so, the security protocol Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful
    Environments (Group OSCORE) can be used to protect multicast notifications end-to-end
    between the server and the observer clients. This document describes how multicast
    notifications can be used in network setups that leverage a proxy, e.g., in order
    to accommodate clients that are not able to directly listen to multicast traffic.
    The present version -00 refers to version -12 of draft-ietf-core- observe-multicast-notifications,
    which includes content about proxies that is also included in the present document.
    Such content will be removed from draft-ietf-core-observe-multicast-notifications
    in its next revision.</p>

  content: "[LDUP Model] describes the architectural approach to replication of\nLDAP
    directory contents.  This document describes the information\nmodel and schema
    elements which support LDAP Replication Services\nwhich conform to [LDUP Model].\n\nDirectory
    schema is extended to provide object classes, subentries,\nand attributes to describe
    areas of the namespace which are under\ncommon administrative authority, units
    of replication (ie, subtrees,\nor partitions of the namespace, which are replicated),
    servers which\nhold replicas of various types for the various partitions of the\nnamespace,
    which namespaces are held on given servers, and the\nprogress of various namespace
    management and replication operations.\nAmong other things, this knowledge of
    where directory content is\nlocated will provide the basis for dynamic generation
    of LDAP\nreferrals for clients who can follow them.\n\t "

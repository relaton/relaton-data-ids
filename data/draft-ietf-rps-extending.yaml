  content: "This Internet Draft  describes guidelines for  extending the Routing  Policy\nSpecification
    Language  (RPSL) [3,  4].    Our  experiences with  PRDB  [2],\nRIPE-81 [6], and
    \ RIPE-181 [5]  taught us  that RPSL had  to be  extensible.\nThese languages
    were not  extensible and each transition  to a new  language\nturned out to be
    quite  painful.  As a  result, extensibility was a  primary\ndesign goal for  RPSL.
    New  routing protocols  or new  features to  existing\nrouting protocols can be
    easily handled using RPSL's dictionary class.   New\nclasses or new attributes
    to the existing classes can also be added.\n\n\t "

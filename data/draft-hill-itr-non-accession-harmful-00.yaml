  content: "  One of the treaties administered by the International\n  Telecommunications
    Union is the International Telecommunications\n  Regulations (ITRs), whose purpose
    is to promote the development of\n  telecommunication services.  The 1988 version
    of the ITRs opened the\n  way for privatisation, liberalization, and the growth
    of the Internet\n  and mobile networks.  Given the subsequent significant structure
    and\n  technological changes, the ITU membership agreed to meet in 2012 to\n  revise
    the ITRs.  While consensus was found on an overwhelming\n  majority of the treaty
    text, some provisions proved to be\n  controversial, leading to a split in the
    membership and sharp\n  criticism of selected provisions.\n\n  As a result, some
    ITU Member States did not sign the treaty.  This\n  document analyses that criticism
    and attempts to place it in context;\n  it identifies problems that may arise
    if states to not accede\n  to the treaty, and suggests a way forward, concluding
    that not\n  acceding may have undesirable results for the citizens of\n  non-signatory
    countries and for interoperability in general.\n\n\t "

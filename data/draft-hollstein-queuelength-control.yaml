  content: "   This document specifies a new control. The client can use it to tell\n
    \  the server the number of responses it expects for a series of\n   requests
    that were sent in asynchronous mode. This enables the\n   server to better pack
    usually small LDAP result messages into send\n   buffers that better match the
    TCP maximum transfer unit. From this\n   a substantial improvement in network
    ressource utilization, response\n   time and throughput is expected.\n\n\n\n\t "

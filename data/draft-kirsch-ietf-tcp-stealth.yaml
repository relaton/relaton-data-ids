  script: Latn
  content: "   TCP servers are visible on the Internet to unauthorized clients, as\n
    \  the existence of a TCP server is leaked in the TCP handshake before\n   applications
    have a chance to authenticate the client.\n\n   We present a small modification
    to the initial TCP handshake that\n   allows TCP clients to replace the TCP ISN
    in the TCP SYN packet with\n   an authorization token.  Based on this information,
    TCP servers may\n   then chose to obscure their presence from unauthorized TCP
    clients.\n\n   This RFC documents the specific method for calculating the\n   authorization
    token to ensure interoperability and to minimize\n   interference by middleboxes.
    \ Mandating support for this method in\n   operating system TCP/IP implementations
    will ensure that clients can\n   connect to TCP servers protected by this method.\n\n\t "

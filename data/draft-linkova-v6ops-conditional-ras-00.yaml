  content: "   This document discusses most common scenarios of connecting an\n   enterprise
    network to multiple ISPs using provider aggregatable\n   address space (PA).  The
    problem of enterprise multihoming without\n   address translation of any form
    has not been solved yet as it\n   requires both the network to select the correct
    egress ISP based on\n   the packet source address and hosts to select the correct
    source\n   address based on the desired egress ISP for that traffic.\n   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming]
    proposes a solution to\n   this problem by introducing a new routing functionality
    (Source\n   Address Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink selection issue and\n
    \  using Router Advertisements to influence the host source address\n   selection.
    \ While the above-mentioned document focus is on solving\n   the general problem
    and to cover various complex use cases, this\n   document describes how the solution
    proposed in\n   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] can be adopted for
    limited\n   number of common use cases.  In particular the focus is on scenarios\n
    \  when a enterprise network has two Internet uplinks used either in\n   primary/backup
    mode or simultaniously and hosts in that network might\n   not yet properly support
    multihoming as described in [RFC8028].\n\n\t "

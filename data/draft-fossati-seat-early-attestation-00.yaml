abstract:
- content: "<p>The TLS handshake protocol allows authentication of one or both peers
    using static, long-term credentials. In some cases, it is also desirable to ensure
    that the peer runtime environment is in a secure state. Such an assurance can
    be achieved using remote attestation which is a process by which an entity produces
    Evidence about itself that another party can use to appraise whether that entity
    is found in a secure state. This document describes a series of protocol extensions
    to the TLS 1.3 handshake that enable the binding of the TLS authentication key
    to a remote attestation session. This enables an entity capable of producing attestation
    Evidence, such as a confidential workload running in a Trusted Execution Environment
    (TEE), or an IoT device that is trying to authenticate itself to a network access
    point, to present a more comprehensive set of security metrics to its peer. These
    extensions have been designed to allow the peers to use any attestation technology,
    in any remote attestation topology, and to use them mutually.</p>"

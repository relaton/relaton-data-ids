  content: "   The TLS handshake protocol allows authentication of one or both peers\n
    \  using static, long-term credentials.  In some cases, it is also\n   desirable
    to ensure that the peer runtime environment is in a secure\n   state.  Such an
    assurance can be achieved using remote attestation\n   which is a process by which
    an entity produces Evidence about itself\n   that another party can use to appraise
    whether that entity is found\n   in a secure state.  This document describes a
    series of protocol\n   extensions to the TLS 1.3 handshake that enable the binding
    of the\n   TLS authentication key to a remote attestation session.  This enables\n
    \  an entity capable of producing attestation Evidence, such as a\n   confidential
    workload running in a Trusted Execution Environment\n   (TEE), or an IoT device
    that is trying to authenticate itself to a\n   network access point, to present
    a more comprehensive set of security\n   metrics to its peer.  These extensions
    have been designed to allow\n   the peers to use any attestation technology, in
    any remote\n   attestation topology, and to use them mutually.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Current methods for managing traffic through content inspection tend\n
    \  to process all sessions similarly.  Internet traffic examples like\n   DDoS
    mitigation require all data to pass through one of a limited\n   number of scrubbing
    centers, which create both natural choke points\n   and the potential for widespread
    collateral damage should a center\n   become overloaded.  Similar issues exist
    with email SPAM and malware\n   filtering, traffic shaping, etc.  We propose a
    method to utilize\n   existing HTTP and HTTPS protocols that enables destinations
    to\n   temporarily confer trust on sources, and for trusted traffic to be\n   routed
    and processed differently from untrusted traffic.\n\n\t "

    on state migration in Data Center (DC). This use case draft is composed to introduce

    several DC providers to make sure the use cases introduced in this draft are real
    problem from these DC providers' perspective, instead of technology driven. The
    purpose of this draft is to figure out which states should be considered in the
    beginning stage of state migration effort.</p>"

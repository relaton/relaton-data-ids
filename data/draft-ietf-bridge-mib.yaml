  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,
    it describes managed objects used for managing MAC bridges based on the IEEE 802.1D-1990
    standard between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.  Provisions are made for support
    of transparent bridging.  Provisions are also made so that these objects apply
    to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.                                    The
    MIB module contained in this memo is updated to be defined using the SNMPv2 SMI
    [1], but is otherwise identical to that contained in [10].\n\t "

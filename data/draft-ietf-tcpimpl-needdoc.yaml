  content: "   The TCP-IMPL working group has documented a number of TCP\n   implementation
    problems [PADHV98].  However, a significant number\n   still have not been fully
    described and documented in the form used\n   in [PADHV98].  This memo briefly
    describes a number of these,\n   including commentary as to the authors' opinions
    regarding the\n   importance of documenting the problem.  This memo is *not* intended\n
    \  to ever see light as an RFC of some form; its sole function is to\n   facilitate
    working group discussion of which problems are more\n   pressing to document than
    others, and to aid in arriving at a\n   decision as to when [PADHV98] will be
    sufficiently complete to merit\n   its publication as an Informational RFC.\n\n
    \  We divide the descriptions into ''serious'' problems, meaning those    we think
    should be included in [PADHV98] prior to its publication;\n   ''security'' problems,
    which might not be viewed as implementation\n   problems per se, but represent
    significant security problems of which\n   TCP implementors should be aware; and
    ''less serious'' problems, those\n   that, if the working group fails to find
    volunteers to document them,\n   should not hold up [PADHV98].\n \n   It might
    be worthwhile to separate the security problems out into\n   their own document.
    \ We particularly solicit working group input on\n   this subject.\n\n\t "

  content: "Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [HC98] has several modes\nwith
    different number of message passes. For those who want to save\ntheir bandwidth,
    three-pass Aggressive Mode is a good choice since\nit has minimal number of message
    passes in Phase 1.\nThe public-key primitive method in Aggressive Mode provides\nsignificant
    security advantages over the other alternatives and\nshould be the method of choice
    in many implementations. In this\nmethod, however, the responder must pay computational
    cost as\nexpensive as modular exponentiation BEFORE identifying the\ninitiator.
    This feature can be abused by malicious initiators for a\nDenial-of-Service (DoS)
    attack. The purpose of this document is to\nsolve this problem in digital-signature
    method by using falling-\ntogether (FT) mechanism [MI98], [MI99] in conjunction
    with\nstateless-connection technique [AN97] and an appropriate use of\nCookies
    [KS99].\n\n\t "

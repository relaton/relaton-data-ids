  content: "When a call travels end-to-end relayed from the PSTN to SIP then\nproblems
    occur with E.164 number ownership.  Additionally, there are\nsecurity challenges
    when the PSTN-VoIP gateway has to authenticate\nand authorize the calling party.
    \ Without addressing these two\naspects the overall security story is weak or
    non-existent.  This\ndocument aims to investigate these two aspect; it does, however,
    not\ninvestigate current E.164 number handling with RFC 4474 (\"SIP\nIdentity\").
    \ Such an analysis is provided by other documents already.\n\t "

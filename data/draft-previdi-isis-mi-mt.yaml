  content: "This draft describes a mechanism that allows a single router to   \nshare
    one or more links among multiple IS-IS routing protocol \ninstances. \n\nMultiple
    instances allow the deployment of multiple address-families \nas well as multiple
    instances of the same address-family and it is \nan alternative to Multi-Topology
    IS-IS. Routers will form instance \nspecific adjacencies, exchange instance specific
    routing updates and \ncompute paths utilizing instance specific LSDB information.
    Each PDU \nwill contain a new TLV identifying the instance to which the PDU \nbelongs.
    This allows a network operator to deploy multiple IS-IS \ntopologies in parallel,
    using the same set of links when required \nand still have the capability of computing
    topology specific paths. \nThis draft does not address the forwarding paradigm
    that needs to be \nused in order to ensure data PDUs are forwarded according to
    the \ntopology to which they belong.\n\t "

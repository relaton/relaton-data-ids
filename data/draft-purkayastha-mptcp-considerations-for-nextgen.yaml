  content: "   MPTCP is deployed in devices which have multiple interfaces to\n   different
    networks.  It takes advantage of these multiple interfaces\n   to improve user
    experience by bandwidth aggregation, redundancy, and\n   increased reliability
    by having a fallback option.  This document\n   describes scenarios where next
    generation (5G) mobility management\n   frameworks may impact MPTCP operations
    thus potentially jeopardizing\n   achievement of some of these gains.\n\n\t "

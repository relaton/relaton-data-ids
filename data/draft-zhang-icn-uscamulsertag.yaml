  content: "   Based on the important concepts and research challenges described in\n
    \  RFC 7927, we consider multi-service tagging technology to be an\n   effective
    name mechanism for audio and video content in ICN. Since\n   audio and video traffic
    is the primary traffic transmitted over the\n   Internet, it will greatly advance
    the current Internet architecture\n   to the ICN architecture, the name mechanism
    for creating audio and\n   video content. This article discusses typical cases
    of improvements\n   using name mechanisms, including content resource exchange
    between\n   different ISPs, resource caching of content naming information, and\n
    \  data distribution for different transmission quality requirements in\n   low
    latency environments.\n\n\n\t "

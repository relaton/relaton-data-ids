  content: "The RSVP model for communicating requests to network devices along a\ndatapath
    has proven useful for a variety of applications beyond what\nthe protocol designers
    envisioned, and while the architectural model\ngeneralizes well the protocol itself
    has a number of features that\nlimit its applicability to applications other than
    IntServ.  Network\nLayer Signaling uses the RSVP on-path communication model and\nprovides
    a lightweight transport layer for non-QoS signaling\napplications, such as discovery
    or diagnostics.  It is based on a\n\"two-layer\" architecture that divides protocol
    function into\ntransport and application.  This document describes the transport\nprotocol.\n\t "

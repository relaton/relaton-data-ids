  content: "Currently P2P applications have accounts for large cross-ISP traffic.
    \nThis document proposes a method to reduce cross-ISP traffic by \nsetting cooperative
    ISP-friendly trackers in the ISP's network.\n \nThrough improving the random node
    selection mechanism in P2P\n\ntracker-based application, we can effectively reduce
    cross-ISP\n \ntraffic as well as the cost of network equipments and network\n
    \noperation. \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nIn examples, \"C:\" and
    \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and \nserver respectively. \n\nThe key
    words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].\n\t "

  content: "Mobile multicast is a research hotspot. Some mobile multicast schemes
    \nwas proposed, but most of them depend on the traditional group \nmembership
    management protocol and concern on the reconstruction of multicast delivery tree
    by various algorithms, and they little \nconsider the mobile group membership
    management. So in this memo, we \nextend the MLD protocol to support the mobile
    multicast group management. The extension is compatible with the traditional MLD
    protocols, and it can also be applied to the IGMP protocol to manage the mobile
    multicast in IPv4.  \n\t "

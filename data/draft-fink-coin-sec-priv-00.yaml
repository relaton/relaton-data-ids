  content: "   With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber-security and data\n
    \  protection are of increasing importance.  This is especially the case\n   regarding
    cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with\n   the physical world.
    \ Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to\n   financial and physical damage
    and endanger human lives and well-\n   being.  Thus, hard security and privacy
    requirements are necessary to\n   be met.  Furthermore, thorough investigation
    of incidents is\n   essential for ultimate protection.  In-network computing allows
    the\n   processing of traffic and data directly in the network and at line-\n
    \  rate.  Thus, the in-network computing paradigm presents a promising\n   solution
    for efficiently providing security and privacy mechanisms as\n   well as event
    analysis.  This document discusses select mechanisms to\n   demonstrate how in-network
    computing concepts can be applied to\n   encounter current shortcomings of cyber-security
    and data privacy.\n\n\t "

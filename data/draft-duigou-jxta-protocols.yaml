  content: "The JXTA protocols defines a suite of six XML-based protocols that\n   standardize
    the manner in which peers self-organize into peergroups,\n   publish and discover
    peer resources, communicate, and monitor each\n   other. The Endpoint Routing
    Protocol (ERP) is the protocol by which a\n   peer can discover a route (sequence
    of hops) to send a message to\n   another peer potentially traversing firewalls
    and NATs. The\n   Rendezvous Protocol (RVP) is used for propagating a message
    within a\n   peergroup. The Peer Resolver Protocol (PRP) is the protocol used
    to\n   send a generic query to one or more peers, and receive a response (or\n
    \  multiple responses) to the query. The Peer Discovery Protocol (PDP)\n   is
    used to publish and discover resource advertisements. The Peer\n   Information
    Protocol (PIP) is the protocol by a which a peer may\n   obtain status information
    about another peers. The Pipe Binding\n   Protocol (PBP) is the protocol by which
    a peer can establish a\n   virtual communication channel or pipe between one or
    more peers. The\n   JXTA protocols permit the establishment a virtual network
    overlay on\n   top of physical networks allowing peers to directly interact and\n
    \  organize independently of their network location and connectivity.\n   The
    JXTA protocols have been designed to be easily implemented on\n   unidirectional
    links and asymmetric transports.\n\t "

  content: "The Simple Agent Communication Protocol (SACP) is an application\nprotocol
    designed to facilitate communication of data and facts\nbetween software agents
    over the Internet. While designed with\nagents in mind, it is also suited to applications
    where the agent\nmetaphor can be applied, such as autonomous processes, or to
    systems\nwhich might be accessed by agents, such as databases or directories.\nApplications
    which need to transmit or receive machine-readable\ndata, or structured information
    that is stored hierarchically, are\nideally suited to SACP.\n\t "

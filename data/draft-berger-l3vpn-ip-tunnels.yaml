  content: "This memo describes a routing architecture that is most applicable to\nCustomer
    Edge (CE)-based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).\n\nIn this architecture, customer
    devices use BGP to exchange VPN routes\nwith one another. The BGP UPDATES include
    a new attribute that\nidentifies the endpoint of a tunnel that can be used to
    reach a\nparticular VPN prefix.  The encapsulation strategy described in this\nmemo
    is more flexible than that described in RFC 4364. In this\narchitecture, the edge
    router can encapsulate the original datagram\ntwice, as in RFC 4364. In this case,
    the inner header provides VPN\ncontext and the outer header identifies the tunnel
    between edge\nrouters. Alternatively, the edge router can encapsulate the original\ndatagram
    only once, with the tunnel providing both VPN context and\nidentifying a tunnel
    to the remote edge router.Contents\n\t "

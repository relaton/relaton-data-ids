  content: "Security of the IP Network is always one of the primary concerns of\nthe
    network design and normally used layered approach.  It is\nrecommended not to
    rely on a single layer of defense, but to\nconfigure multi-layer security measures.\n\nThe
    primary purpose of this paper is to propose a simple and\neffective solution to
    enhance the security of EDGE devices which are\nconnected to external users in
    a Service Provider network.  Most\nService Providers commonly use ingress filtering
    as one of the\nmethods to filter traffic to secure edge devices of their\ninfrastructure
    from external users.  The proposed technique will use\na special wildcard mask
    on the network addresses to limit the\naccessibility of the Service Provider EDGE
    devices from external\nusers.  This will greatly enhance the security of the Service\nProvider's
    edge devices from malicious attacks such as Denial of\nService (DoS).\n\t "

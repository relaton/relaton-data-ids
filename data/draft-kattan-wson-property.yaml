  content: "Wavelength Switched Optical Network will extend GMPLS protocols to to\n
    \  manage wavelength across DWDM optical networks.  In many situations\n   the
    control plane needs to know additional information regarding\n   wavelengths.
    \ The current proposal identify a way to carry some\n   property information along
    with wavelength information.  Control\n   plane can leverage the knowledge of
    such properties during its\n   operations.\n\n\t "

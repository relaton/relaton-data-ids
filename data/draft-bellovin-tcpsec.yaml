  content: "   The TCP-MD5 option is commonly used to secure BGP sessions between\n
    \  routers, although it is known to have many serious deficiencies.\n   This memo
    presents requirements for a TCP segment authentication\n   mechanism that is intended
    to replace TCP-MD5.  While TCP-MD5 was\n   designed to protect TCP sessions whose
    payload is BGP, the\n   applicability of the mechanism described herein is broader.
    \ This\n   mechanism can be applied to any TCP connection, regardless of\n   payload.\n\n\t "

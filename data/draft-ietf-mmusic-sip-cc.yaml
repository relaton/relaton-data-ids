  content: "This document describes a set of extensions to SIP which allow for\nvarious
    call control services. Example services include blind\ntransfer, transfer with
    consultation, multi-party calls, bridged\nconferences, and ad-hoc conferencing.
    The services are supported in a\nfully distributed manner, so that they can be
    provided without a\ncentral conference server. However, a SIP proxy can act as
    a\nconference server to provide these services. For the various services\ndescribed
    here, we overview the requirements for the service, and\nspecify the protocol
    functions needed to support it. We then define a\nbasic set of SIP primitives
    which can be used to construct these\nservices, and others.\n\n\t "

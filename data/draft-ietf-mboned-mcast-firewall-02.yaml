  content: "In this document, we discuss the issues surrounding the traversal of IP
    multicast traffic across a firewall, and describe possible ways in which a firewall
    can implement and control this traversal.  We also explain why some firewall mechanisms
    - such as SOCKS - that were designed specifically for unicast traffic, are less
    appropriate for multicast.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

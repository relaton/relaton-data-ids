  content: "   This document specifies a new Diameter Application to support the\n
    \  Mobile IPv6's bootstrapping mechanism during the AAA authentication\n   and
    authorization phase based on PANA.  PANA is used as a protocol\n   for network
    authentication between mobile nodes and access networks.\n   During the PANA authentication
    phase, the mobile node's initial\n   configuration information like its home address,
    home agent address\n   and IKEv2/IKEv1 pre-shared keying material is piggybacked
    to the PANA\n   messages cryptographically protected by the PANA SA.  The Diameter\n
    \  and PANA message formats to support the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in\n   the
    integrated bootstrapping scenario are defined.\n\t "

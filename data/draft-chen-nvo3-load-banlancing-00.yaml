  script: Latn
  content: "   Traditional ECMP can not balance loads well in the data center\n   network
    because it splits loads at the granularity of flow.  Packets\n   belong to a single
    flow have to be delivered along the same path.\n   Though it is able to avoid
    packet reordering, it may degrade the\n   bandwidth utilization.\n\n   This document
    describes method of splitting a single flow to across\n   multiple parallel paths
    without causing packet reordering, which is\n   more effective when large flows
    exist.  The specific path selection\n   algorithm is NOT discussed in this document.\n\n\n\t "

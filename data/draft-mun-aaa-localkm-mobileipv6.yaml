  content: "This document describes a way to distribute secure key for optimizing\nAAA
    authentication procedure while a mobile node is away from it's \nhome. The AAA
    infrastrucrue is used as an underlying framework which \nenables a Mobile-IPv6
    node to get an global authentication by \nidentifying it with an unique identifier
    NAI. The Diameter messages \nare exchanged to transfer information of mobile node
    between home and\nforeign AAA servers.\nThe steps to complete an authentication
    procedure for mobile node in \nthe visited link may be reduced by delegating the
    role for generating\nand synchronizing keys to AAA server in the visited domain.\nThe
    implications to existing entities supporting mobility such as\nattendant, AAA
    server in home and visited domain are discussed.\nThe delegation is introduced
    and the related security issues \nare pointed out.\n\t "

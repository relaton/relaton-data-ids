  content: "   Time-Variant Routing (TVR) involves calculating a path, or subpath\n
    \  within a network, taking into account the timing of message\n   transmission
    or receipt as an integral part of the overall route\n   computation.  The results
    of a TVR computation are influenced by the\n   specific time at which the path
    is needed, and the computation is\n   performed without any discernible alterations
    to the network topology\n   or other cost functions associated with the route.\n\n
    \  This document introduces requirements for TVR computations to improve\n   network
    communication and resource efficiency.\n\n\t "

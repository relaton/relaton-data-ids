  content: "Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the\nInternet
    today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many\nnetworks.  One technique
    to improve the network efficiency of P2P\napplications is to introduce storage
    capabilities within the network.\nThe DECADE Working Group has been formed with
    the goal of developing\nan architecture to provide this capability.  This document
    presents\nan architecture, discusses the underlying principles and identifies\ncore
    components and protocols supporting the architecture.\n\t "

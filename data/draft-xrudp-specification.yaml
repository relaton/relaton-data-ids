  content: "   XRUDP (eXtended Reliable UDP) is a modern UDP-based transport\n   protocol
    providing reliable, in-order, message-oriented delivery\n   with congestion control,
    security, NAT traversal, and extensibility.\n   It is designed for scenarios demanding
    reliable and efficient\n   message delivery over unreliable networks, such as
    real-time\n   signaling, IoT, gaming, and edge computing. This document specifies\n
    \  the XRUDP packet format, state machine, negotiation, and interaction\n   with
    applications.\n\n\t "

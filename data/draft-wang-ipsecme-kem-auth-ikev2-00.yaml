  content: "   This draft specifies a new authentication mechanism, called KEM based\n
    \  authentication, for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2\n   (IKEv2)
    [RFC7296].  This is motivated by the fact that ML-KEM is much\n   more efficient
    that ML-DSA, which are the post-quantum algoirhtms for\n   mitigating the pontential
    security threats again quantum computers.\n   The KEM based authenticationth for
    the IKV2 is achieved via\n   introduing a new value of the IKEv2 Authentication
    Method registry\n   mantained by IANA.  For using the new authentication method,
    two\n   peers MUST send the SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS Notify, defined by\n   [RFC9593]，to
    negotiate the supported KEM algorithms.  After that, the\n   correponding KEM
    certificates and cipthertext are exchanged via the\n   INTERMEDIATE Exchange.
    \ Finally，the IKE messages are authenticated\n   via the shared secret encapsulated
    between the two peers.  This\n   documents also specifies the instantiation with
    ML-KEM for this new\n   general authenticaiton method for the IKEv2.\n\n   [EDNOTE:
    Code points for KEM-based authentication may need to be\n   assigned in the IKEv2
    Authenticaion Method registry, maintained by\n   IANA]\n\n\t "

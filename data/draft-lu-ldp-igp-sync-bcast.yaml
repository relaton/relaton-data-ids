  script: Latn
  content: "[LDP-IGP-SYNC] describes a mechanism to prevent black-holing traffic \n(e.g.
    VPN) when IGP is operational on a link but LDP is not. If this \nmechanism is
    applied to broadcast links that have more than one \nLDP/IGP peer, the cost-out
    procedure can only be applied to the link \nas a whole but not an individual peer.
    When a new LDP peer comes up \non a broadcast network, this can result in loss
    of traffic through \nother established peers on that network. This document describes
    a \nmechanism to address that use-case without dropping traffic. The \nmechanism
    does not introduce any protocol changes.\n\t "

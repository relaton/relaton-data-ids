  content: "The NetLMM WG is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for network-\nbased
    localized mobility management (NetLMM), taking basic support \nfor registration,
    de-registration and handover of single Mobile Node \n(MN) into account in the
    RFC 5213 [1]. When a whole subnet moves into \nthe PMIPv6 domain through the Mobile
    Router (MR), the scheme should \nbe considered to provide and maintain the connectivity
    for the Mobile \nNetwork Node (MNN) in the mobile network (NEMO). This document
    \ndiscusses the deployment consideration of NEMO support in PMIPv6 \nnetwork and
    proposes the possible solution accordingly.\n\t "

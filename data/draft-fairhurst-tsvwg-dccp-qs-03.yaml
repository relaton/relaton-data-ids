  content: "This document specifies the use of the Quick-Start mechanism by the \nDatagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  DCCP is a transport \nprotocol that allows
    the transmission of congestion-controlled, \nunreliable datagrams.  DCCP is intended
    for applications such as \nstreaming media, Internet telephony, and on-line games.
    \ In DCCP, an \napplication has a choice of congestion control mechanisms, each
    \nspecified by a Congestion Control Identifier (CCID). This document \nspecifies
    general procedures applicable to all DCCP CCIDs and \nspecific procedures for
    the use of Quick-Start with DCCP CCID-2 and \nCCID-3.  Quick-Start enables a DCCP
    sender to cooperate with any \nQuick-Start routers along the end-to-end path to
    determine an \nallowed sending rate at the start and, at times, in the middle
    of a \nDCCP connection (e.g., after an idle or application-limited period).  \nThe
    present specification is provided for use in controlled \nenvironments, and not
    as a mechanism that would be intended or \nappropriate for ubiquitous deployment
    in the global Internet.\n\t "

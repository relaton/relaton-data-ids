    \  (SIP) user agents (UAs) should implement the dialog event package in\n   order
    to be usable in systems that implement end-point controlled\n   call-control (EPCC)
    features.  The guidelines are in addition to the\n   basic requirements for dialog
    event package implementation in RFC\n   3265 and RFC 4235.\n\n\n\t "

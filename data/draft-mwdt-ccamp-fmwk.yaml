  content: "   To ensure an efficient data transport, meeting the requirements\n   requested
    by today's transport services, the unification of control\n   and management of
    microwave and millimeter wave radio link interfaces\n   is a precondition for
    seamless multilayer networking and automated\n   network wide provisioning and
    operation.\n\n   This document describes the required characteristics and use
    cases\n   for control and management of radio link interface parameters using
    a\n   YANG Data Model. It focuses on the benefits of a standardized\n   management
    model that is aligned with how other packet technology\n   interfaces in a microwave/millimeter
    wave node are modeled, the need\n   to support core parameters and at the same
    time allow for optional\n   product/feature specific parameters supporting new,
    unique innovative\n   features until they have become mature enough to be included
    in the\n   standardized model.\n\n   The purpose is to create a framework for
    identification of the\n   necessary information elements and definition of a YANG
    Data Model\n   for control and management of the radio link interfaces in a\n
    \  microwave/millimeter wave node.\n\n\t "

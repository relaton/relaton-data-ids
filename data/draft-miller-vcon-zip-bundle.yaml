abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the vCon Zip Bundle (.vconz) file format for
    packaging one or more vCon conversation data containers with their associated
    media files into a single, self-contained ZIP archive. While vCons support external
    file references via HTTPS URLs with content hashes, these dependencies create
    availability and portability challenges. The vCon Zip Bundle addresses this through
    a standardized archive format that includes all referenced files, supports multiple
    vCons with automatic deduplication based on content hashes, preserves data integrity
    through hash verification, and enables offline processing. This specification
    maintains full compatibility with all vCon security forms (unsigned, signed, encrypted)
    as defined in the vCon core specification.</p>"

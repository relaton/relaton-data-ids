  content: "   This document defines the vCon Zip Bundle (.vconz) file format for\n
    \  packaging one or more vCon conversation data containers with their\n   associated
    media files into a single, self-contained ZIP archive.\n   While vCons support
    external file references via HTTPS URLs with\n   content hashes, these dependencies
    create availability and\n   portability challenges.  The vCon Zip Bundle addresses
    this through a\n   standardized archive format that includes all referenced files,\n
    \  supports multiple vCons with automatic deduplication based on content\n   hashes,
    preserves data integrity through hash verification, and\n   enables offline processing.
    \ This specification maintains full\n   compatibility with all vCon security forms
    (unsigned, signed,\n   encrypted) as defined in the vCon core specification.\n\n\t "

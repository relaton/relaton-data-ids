  script: Latn
  content: "   With more and more enterprises using cloud based services, the\n   distances
    between the user and the applications are growing.  A lot\n   of the current applications
    are designed to work across LAN's and\n   have various inherent assumptions.  For
    multiple applications such as\n   High Performance Computing and Electronic Financial
    markets, the\n   response times are critical as is packet loss, while other\n
    \  applications require more throughput.\n\n   [RFC3031] describes the architecture
    of MPLS based networks.  This\n   draft extends the MPLS architecture to allow
    for latency, loss and\n   jitter as properties.  It describes requirements and
    control plane\n   implication for latency and packet loss as a traffic engineering\n
    \  performance metric in today's network which is consisting of\n   potentially
    multiple layers of packet transport network and optical\n   transport network
    in order to make a accurate end-to-end latency and\n   loss prediction before
    a path is established.\n\n   Note MPLS architecture for Multicast will be taken
    up in a future\n   version of the draft.\n\n\n\t "

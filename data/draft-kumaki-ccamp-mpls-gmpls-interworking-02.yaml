  content: "In order to deploy GMPLS technology in the existing IP/MPLS networks,
    \nvarious operation, deployment and interworking aspect of MPLS/GMPLS \nneeds
    to be addressed.  \n                   \nFrom the deployment perspective, GMPLS
    architecture document lists \n[RFC3945] three different scenarios in which GMPLS
    technology can be \ndeployed: overlay, augmented and integrated. Reference [GMPLS-mig]
    \naddresses the problem of migration from MPLS to GMPLS networks using \nthe integrated
    model. This draft addresses the same problem space for \naugmented model and illustrates
    the applicability of augmented model \nin deploying GMPLS technology in existing
    IP/MPLS networks. \n                   \nAnother very important aspect of MPLS/GMPLS
    interworking is ability \nto effectively use GMPLS services in IP/MPLS networks.
    This includes \nability to specify GMPLS LSPs in signaling requests based on the
    type \nof the setup desired, as well as considerations for the operation \naspects
    of using GMPLS LSPs. \n              \nIn this draft, we highlight some deployment
    and MPLS/GMPLS \ninterworking requirements and propose solutions to address them.
    We \nalso highlight some operation aspects and the possible solution and \nprovide
    applicability statement for the available options. \n\t "

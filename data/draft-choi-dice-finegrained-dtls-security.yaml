  content: "   This document proposes a method that can selectively apply\n   application
    data encryption to the DTLS record layer. The CoAP used\n   for resource-constrained
    devices defines the use of DTLS as a basic\n   security mechanism, and CoAP standard
    specifies the use of AES_CCM\n   that provides data integrity and confidentiality
    as a cipher suite\n   for DTLS. However, not all CoAP messages require both data
    integrity\n   and confidentiality. For example, in case of CoAP messages that\n
    \  include information for turning a light off at home or in a building,\n   or
    simple ACK information, encryption might not be necessary because\n   such information
    might not be useful to attackers. Furthermore, from\n   the perspective of effective
    resource use of resource-constrained\n   devices, reducing the computation load
    required to perform data\n   encryption every time is necessary. This document
    describes the\n   methods for CoAP nodes to establish DTLS security channels using
    the\n   AES_CCM cipher suite, and to selectively apply the encryption\n   function
    in the DTLS record layer by considering sensitivity to\n   application data leakage.\n\n\n\n\t "

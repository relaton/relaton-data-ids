  content: "   This memo presents the observations and results obtained from two \n
    \  test-beds designed to study and evaluate the performance and \n   feasibility
    of rapid fault notification via flooding. Flooding-based \n   fault notification
    [2,3] is an alternative to signaling-only \n   notification approaches, which
    has the advantages of: scalability and \n   the ability to meet bounded recovery-time
    constraints, if needed.  \n    \n   We implemented flooding-based notification
    at both the transport and \n   packet layers. For optical transport networks the
    flooding mechanism \n   (e.g. [3]), was realized using enhancements to the Link
    Management \n   Protocol (LMP), while for packet/MPLS networks the flooding was
    \n   realized using enhancements to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). We \n   present
    experiences and performance measurements from these \n   implementations on FreeBSD/Linux
    platforms, and also present the \n   protocol enhancements that were made to LMP
    and OSPF, respectively, \n   to realize the rapid flooding function. \n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label
    Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). Extended from MPLS technologies, MPLS-TP
    introduces new OAM capabilities, transport oriented path protection mechanism,
    and strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by network management systems.
    This document addresses the security aspects that are relevant in the context
    of MPLS-TP specifically. It describes the security requirements for MPLS-TP; potential
    securities threats and migration procedures for MPLS-TP networks and MPLS-TP inter-connection
    to MPLS and GMPLS networks. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network. This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
    Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF Last Call.
    [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert the
    correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF Consensus.]</p>"

  content: "   Disaggregated media refers to the ability for a user to create a\n
    \  multimedia session combining different media streams, coming from\n   different
    devices under his or her control, so that they are treated\n   by the far end
    of the session as a single media session.  This\n   document lists several use
    cases that involve disaggregated media in\n   SIP.  Additionally, this document
    analyzes what types of\n   disaggregated media can be implemented using existing
    protocol\n   mechanisms, and the pros and cons of using each of those mechanisms.\n
    \  Finally, this document describes scenarios that are not covered by\n   current
    mechanisms and proposes new IETF work to cover them.\n\n\t "

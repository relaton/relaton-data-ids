  content: "   This short memo outlines the author's thoughts about the challenges\n
    \  and opportunities with the IETF's administrative support activities,\n   currently
    organised as part of the IETF Administrative Support\n   Activities (IASA), IETF
    Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC),\n   and IETF Trust.\n\n   This memo
    is just input for discussion that the IETF community should\n   have.  The memo
    is a part of the author's goal to document the status\n   and various challenges
    and opportunities in the context of the so\n   called \"IASA 2.0\" project.\n\n
    \  The memo has no particular official standing, nor does it claim to\n   represent
    more than the authors' thinking at the time of writing.\n\n\t "

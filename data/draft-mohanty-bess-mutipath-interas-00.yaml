  script: Latn
  content: "   By default, The Border Gateway Protocol, BGP only installs the best-\n
    \  path to the IP Routing Table.  BGP multi-path is a well known feature\n   that
    enables installation of multiple paths to the IP Routing Table.\n   This is done
    to achieve load balancing while forwarding traffic.  For\n   a path to be eligible
    as a multi-path, certain criteria need to be\n   fulfilled.  Inter-AS VPNs are
    commonly deployed to span organizations\n   across Service Provider boundaries.
    \ In this draft, we describe an\n   issue relating to multi-path load balancing
    that can arise in an\n   Option B Inter-AS Deployment.  With the help of a representative\n
    \  topology, we illustrate the problem and then present two simple\n   schemes
    as the solution to the problem.  We also note as a matter of\n   independent interest
    that the same underlying issue is applicable to\n   deployments that employ next-hop-self
    behavior (implicit or explicit)\n   downstream and the multi-path feature upstream.\n\n\t "

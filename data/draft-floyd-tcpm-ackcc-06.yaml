- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a possible congestion control mechanism for acknowledgement
    (ACKs) traffic in TCP.  The document specifies an end-to-end acknowledgement congestion
    control mechanism for TCP that uses participation from both TCP hosts: the TCP
    data sender and the TCP data receiver.  The TCP data sender detects lost or Explicit
    Congestion Notification (ECN)-marked ACK packets, and tells the TCP data receiver
    the ACK Ratio R to use to respond to the congestion on the reverse path from the
    data receiver to the data sender.  The TCP data receiver sends roughly one ACK
    packet for every R data packets received.  This mechanism is based on the acknowledgement
    congestion control in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol's (DCCP's) Congestion
    Control Identifier (CCID) 2.  This acknowledgement congestion control mechanism
    is being specified for further evaluation by the network community.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

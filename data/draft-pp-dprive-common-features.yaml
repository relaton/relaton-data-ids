  content: "   Encryption between recursive and authoritative DNS servers is\n   currently
    being defined in two modes: unauthenticated and fully-\n   authenticated.  These
    two modes have some features in common, and\n   this document defines those common
    features so that the documents\n   defining the modes do not need to point to
    each other.\n\n\t "

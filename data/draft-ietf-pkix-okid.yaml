  content: "In general, certificates need not be communicated with communication or\nstorage
    media that are integrity-secure or authentic. This is because\ncertificates are
    digitally signed and users are expected to validate the\nsignatures using configured
    trust anchors. However, distribution of\ntrust anchor certificates, self-signed
    end-entity certificates, or bare\n(unsigned) public keys requires a mechanism
    for establishing the\nauthenticity of the certificate or public key.\n\t "

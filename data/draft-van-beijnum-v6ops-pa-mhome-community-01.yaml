  content: "When an organization wants to connect to the internet using two or more\nInternet
    Service Providers (multihoming), this is usually done by\nsetting up BGP routing
    between the organization in question and each of\nits ISPs. For this, the multihomed
    organization needs a block of address space. This can either be a provider independent
    (PI) address block that belongs to the organization, or a block out of the provider
    aggregatable (PA) address space of one its ISPs.\n\nWith IPv4, an address block
    of at least /24 will generally be suitable\nfor multihoming, whether its origin
    is PI or PA. However, until now,\nISPs were encouraged to only accept /32 and
    shorter prefixes from IPv6\nPA space, while end-users generally receive a /48.
    This makes\nmultihoming with PA address space in IPv6 very difficult. This memo\ndescribes
    a new well-known BGP community attribute for tagging prefixes\nused for multihoming
    with PA space in order to facilitate filtering,\nrather than filter based on prefix
    length alone.\n\n\t "

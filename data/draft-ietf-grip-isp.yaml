  content: "The purpose of this document is to express the general Internet\n   community's
    expectations of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) with\n   respect to security.\n
    \n   It is not the intent of this document to define a set of requirements\n   that
    would be appropriate for all ISPs, but rather to raise awareness\n   among ISPs
    of the community's expectations, and to provide the\n   community with a framework
    for discussion of security expectations\n   with current and prospective service
    providers.\n\t "

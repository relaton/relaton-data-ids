  content: "This document presents a user perspective to the notion of DNS search\nlayers
    as defined by John Klensin's DNS search model [DNS_SEARCH]. In\nparticular, the
    authors look at the integration of name lookup\nresults from layer 2, 3 and 4
    services to discuss the presentation of\nthese results across popular desktop
    applications such as Web\nbrowsing and email clients. The goal of this document
    is not to\npropose a standard UI to the DNS search problem (clearly something\nout
    of the scope of any IETF work). Instead, the document seeks to\ndemonstrate that
    layered search services can be easily integrated\nwithin traditional desktop applications;
    hence that deployment of DNS\nsearch services is realistic and could rapidly be
    achieved. It is\nimportant to understand that the proposed form of integration
    and\nchoice of user interfaces are not fundamental. In fact, the authors\nexpect
    many competing systems to pursue different alternative\nsolutions. However, in
    order to achieve critical deployment mass, it\nis crucial to demonstrate that
    the architectural model proposed by\nDNS search lends itself to simple user interfaces
    where different and\npossibly competing services can complete each other to provide
    a more\nprecise and complete navigation experience for the end-user. This\ndraft
    attempts to fulfill that goal by looking at possible solutions\nfor popular navigation
    use cases.\n\t "

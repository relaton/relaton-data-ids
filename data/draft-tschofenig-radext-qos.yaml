  content: "   This document describes an extension to the RADIUS protocol that\n
    \  performs authentication, authorization, and accounting for Quality-\n   of-Service
    reservations.\n\n   The described extensions allow network elements to authenticate
    the\n   initiator of a reservation request (if desired), to ensure that the\n
    \  reservation is authorized, and to account for established QoS\n   resources.\n\n
    \  Flexibility is provided by offering support for different\n   authorization
    models and by decoupling specific QoS attributes\n   carried in the QoS signaling
    protocol from the AAA protocol.  This\n   document is the RADIUS complement to
    the DIAMETER QoS application.\n\n\t "

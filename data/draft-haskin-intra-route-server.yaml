  content: "This document describes the use of route servers for dissemination of
    external routes acquired by AS border routers among routers belonging to the same
    AS.  The intention of the proposed technique is to reduce overhead and management
    complexity of maintaining numerous IBGP/IDRP sessions while providing IGP independent
    way of route distribution.\n\t "

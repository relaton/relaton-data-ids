- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the \"regex\" extension to the Sieve email\nfiltering
    language.  In some cases, it is desirable to have a string\nmatching mechanism
    which is more powerful than a simple exact match,\na substring match or a glob-style
    wildcard match.  The regular\nexpression matching mechanism defined in this draft
    provides users\nwith much more powerful string matching capabilities.\n\nChange
    History (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC)\n\nChanges from draft-murchison-sieve-regex-08:\n\no
    \ Updated to XML source.\n\no  Documented interaction with variables.\n\nChanges
    from draft-ietf-sieve-regex-00:\n\no  Various cleanup and updates.\n\no  Added
    trial text specifying comparator interactions.\n\nOpen Issues (to be removed prior
    to publication as an RFC)\n\no  The major open issue with this draft is what to
    do, if anything,\n\nabout localization/internationalization.  Are [IEEE.1003-2.1992]\n\ncollating
    sequences and character equivalents sufficient?  Should\n\nwe reference the Unicode
    technical specification?  Should we punt\n\nand publish the document as experimental?\n\no
    \ Is the current approach to comparator integration the right one to\n\nuse?\n\no
    \ Should we allow shorthands such as \\\\b (word boundary) and \\\\w\n\n(word
    character)?\no  Should we allow backreferences (useful for matching double words,\n\netc.)?\n\t "

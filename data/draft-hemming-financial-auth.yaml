  content: "This document defines a mechanism where by the use of public key cryptography
    and message digest algorithms can authenticate financial transactions such that
    the digital key can replace the need for a paper signature or other authorisations
    process.                                 This mechanism can be used, therefore,
    to generate digital cheques and other instructional transactions such as the purchase
    or sale of financial instruments and the commitment to accept risks.\n\t "

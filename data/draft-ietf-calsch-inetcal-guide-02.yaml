  content: "This document describes the various Internet calendaring and scheduling
    standards and works in progress, and the relationships between them.  Its intent
    is to provide a context for these documents, assist in their understanding, and
    potentially aid in the design of standards-based calendaring and scheduling systems.
    \ The standards addressed are RFC 2445 (iCalendar), RFC 2446 (iTIP), and RFC 2447
    (iMIP).  The work in progress addressed is \"Calendar Access Protocol\" (CAP).
    \ This document also describes issues and problems that are not solved by these
    protocols, and that could be targets for future work.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

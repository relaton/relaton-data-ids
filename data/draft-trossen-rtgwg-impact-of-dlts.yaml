- language: en

  content: "   This document discusses the impact of distributed ledger technologies\n
    \  being realized over IP-based provider networks.  The focus here lies\n   on
    the impact that the DLT communication patterns have on efficiency\n   of resource
    usage in the underlying networks.  We provide initial\n   insights into experimental
    results to quantify this impact in terms\n   of inefficient and wasted communication,
    aligned along challenges\n   that the DLT realization over IP networks faces.\n\n
    \  This document intends to outline this impact but also opportunities\n   for
    network innovations to improve on the identified impact as well\n   as the overall
    service quality.  While this document does not promote\n   specific solutions
    that capture those opportunities, it invites the\n   wider community working on
    DLT and network solutions alike to\n   contribute to the insights in this document
    to aid future research\n   and development into possible solution concepts and
    technologies.\n\n   The findings presented here have first been reported within
    the\n   similarly titled whitepaper released by the Industry IoT Consortium\n
    \  (IIC) [IIC_whitepaper].\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for the global\n
    \  (or local) DNS names of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as\n   appliances
    and sensors.  By this scheme, the DNS name of an IoT\n   device can be autoconfigured
    with the device's category and model in\n   wired and wireless target networks
    (e.g., home, office, shopping\n   mall, smart grid, and road network).  This DNS
    name lets IoT users\n   (e.g., home residents and customers) in the Internet (or
    local\n   network) easily identify each device for monitoring and remote-\n   controlling
    it in the target network.\n\n\t "

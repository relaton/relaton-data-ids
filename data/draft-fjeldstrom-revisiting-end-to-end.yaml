abstract:
- content: <p>This document revisits the end-to-end argument by re-deriving its premises
    under contemporary operational conditions. Rather than treating "end-to-end" as
    a slogan about host-to-host reachability, it examines how the original argument
    defines an endpoint in functional and administrative terms, and evaluates whether
    those assumptions continue to hold in modern networks.</p>

  content: "   The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey path\n   computation
    requests and responses both between Path Computation\n   Clients (PCCs), Path
    Computation Elements (PCEs) and cooperating\n   PCEs, support of traffic engineering
    in Multiprotocol Label Switching\n   (MPLS), Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) and Segment
    Routing (SR) networks.\n   In PCEP, due to the different implementing of PCC tunnel
    capability,\n   especially bidirectional SR tunnels, the PCE can only provides
    path\n   computation functions between the PCCs which adopt identical\n   mechanisms.\n\n
    \  With the introduction and evolvement of 5G and other network\n   scenarios,
    the scale of bearing and transport network has developed\n   to a high level.
    \ On the other hand, with the improvement of network\n   slicing ability, network
    equipments can provide network slicing\n   service, such as enhanced VPNs (VPN+).
    \ Transport network employing\n   time slot isolation technology, such as FlexE,MTN,can
    provide\n   advanced timeslot slicing for the high quality customer services.\n
    \  The high quality customer services, for example industry production\n   service,
    demand for superior SLA and end-to-end timeslot service\n   slicing, regardless
    of whether it is across of different network\n   equipment providers or across
    of different regions.  Therefore, there\n   is an urgent need of a method to support
    PCE to provide end-to-end\n   path computation and establishment of SR tunnels
    regardless of PCC\n   enables different protocol selections.\n\n   This document
    specifies the extensions to PCE communication Protocol\n   (PCEP) to carry bidirectional
    SR tunnel capability advertisement\n   information in PCEP message to enhance
    PCE ability to perceive the\n   protocol mechanism supported by PCC.\n\n\n\t "

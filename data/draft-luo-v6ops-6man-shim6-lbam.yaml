  content: "Load balancing is a key factor for both IPv4 to IPv6 transition\nmechnisms,
    e.g.NAT-PT or Tunnel broker, and Multihoming to improve\ntheir scalability and
    Robustness.  In fact, that is a method, by\nwhich IP packet can be distributed
    across a pool of servers, instead\nof directing to a single server.Load balancing
    has been widely used\nby NAT, Web service and FTP service.  However, current load
    balancing\nsoftware and implementations have problems such as poor scalability,\ninability
    to balance session flow, long latency time and topological\nconstraint on server
    pool.\n\nThis document describes a method using pseudo-anycast and pseudo-\nmobility
    based on Mobile IPv6 to implement load balancing in session\nlevel in IPv6 network,
    by which those problems above can be solved.\nFuthermore, this method only need
    little modification to Mobile IPv6\nin the servers' and agent's side; as for the
    general users, it need\nnot any modification.\n\t "

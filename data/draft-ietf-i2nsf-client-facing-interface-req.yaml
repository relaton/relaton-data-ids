- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document captures requirements for Client-Facing interface to\n
    \  the Security Controller as defined by [RFC8327].  The interface is\n   expressed
    using objects and constructs understood by Security Admin\n   as opposed to vendor
    or device specific expressions associated with\n   individual product and feature.
    \ This document identifies a broad set\n   of requirements needed to express Security
    Policies based on User-\n   constructs which are well understood by the User Community.
    \ This\n   gives ability to decouple policy definition from policy enforcement\n
    \  on a specific security functional element, be it a physical or\n   virtual.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Although SCTP provides multihoming function, a single point of\nfailure
    may occur due to its lack of source address selection.\nRFC2960 describes that
    'a host should pick the most divergent source-\ndestination pair.' But, it also
    describes that selecting source\naddress is implementation matter. In RFC3257,
    Coene et al. have\nclaimed that a host must take careful in selectiong its source\naddress.
    In this document, we propose a way of outgoing interface\nselection and its corresponding
    source address selection in SCTP.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>BGP Flow Specification (Flow-spec) provides a mechanism for distributing
    traffic filtering and policy-based forwarding rules. Existing works enables traffic
    steering into an SR Policy. However, in Artificial Intelligence (AI) network scenarios,
    "elephant flows" may require deterministic forwarding over specific segment lists
    within an SR Policy candidate path. This document specifies a new BGP Flow-spec
    Redirect action that identifies a specific segment list within an SR Policy.</p>

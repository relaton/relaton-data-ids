  content: "This draft defines Fair Marker (FM), which can be used as a component
    \ in a Differentiated Services traffic conditioner. FM controls token distribution
    from  the  token  bucket  to  the  flows originating  from the  same subscriber
    network, in order to enforce fairness among them. FM may  use  different  fair
    \ token  allocation algorithms. Presently, we assume that FM is used to mark packets
    for Assured Forwarding.\n\t "

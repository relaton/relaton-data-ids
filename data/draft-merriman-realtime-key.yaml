- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "With the increase in privacy-enabling cryptographic software, there exists
    the growing problem of verification of the 'validity' of a cryptographic 'key'.
    That is, the recipient of (for example) a PGP-signed email message from an unknown
    person generally has no ready, convenient means to verify that the 'signature'
    on the message actually belongs to the sender. To verify the relationship between
    a cryptographic 'key' and an identity (real or anonymous), it is necessary for
    an individual to contact one of several existing 'manual' keyservers as a separate
    process, request the key (if it exists on that keyserver), and retrieve it before
    being able to use it for any reference or validation purposes.          This draft
    is meant to propose a protocol/system that would both enable the automatic retrieval
    of cryptographic keys, and the exchange of keys between servers (both new keys,
    and those deleted through revocation certificates). This proposal could be extended
    to allow retrieval of cryptographic certificates and/or 'credentials' with relatively
    minor difficulty.\n\t "

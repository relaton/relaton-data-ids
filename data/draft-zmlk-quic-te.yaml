  content: "   This document defines a method for supporting QUIC-enabled service\n
    \  differentiation for traffic engineering through multipath and QUIC\n   connection
    identifier (CID) encoding.  This approach enables end-host\n   networking stacks
    and applications to select packet routing paths in\n   a wide area network (WAN),
    potentially improving end-to-end\n   performance, cost, and reliability.  The
    proposed method can be used\n   in conjunction with segment-routing traffic engineering
    technologies,\n   such as SRv6 TE.\n\n\t "

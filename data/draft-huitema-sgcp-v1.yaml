  content: "This document describes an application programming interface (SGCI) and\na
    corresponding protocol (SGCP) for controlling Voice over IP (VoIP)\nGateways from
    external call control elements. The SGCP assumes a call\ncontrol architecture
    where the call control 'intelligence' is outside\nthe gateways and handled by
    external call control elements.\n \nThe document is structured in 5 main sections:\n
    \n*    The introduction presents the basic assumptions and the relation to\n     other
    protocols such as H.323, RTSP, SAP or SIP.\n\n*    The interface section presents
    a conceptual overview of the SGCP,\n     presenting the naming conventions, the
    usage of the session\n     description protocol SDP, and the five procedurs that
    compose SGCP:\n     Notifications Request, Notification, Create Connection, Modify
    Con-\n     nection and Delete Connection.\n \n*    The protocol description section
    presents the SGCP encodings, which\n     are based on simple text formats, and
    the transmission procedure\n     over UDP.\n \n*    The security section presents
    the security requirement of SGCP, and\n     its usage of IP security services
    (IPSEC).\n \n*    An example section presents two detailed examples of call set
    up\n     procedures using SGCP.\n \n*    The description of the changes between
    version 1.0 and version 1.1\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes passive DAD techniques over on-demand ad-hoc\n
    \  routing protocols such as AODV and DYMO.  In order to achieve these\n   two
    goals: (a) improving the accuracy of detecting address conflicts\n   and (b) reducing
    the time taken to detect these conflicts, this\n   document provides several techniques
    using additional information\n   including sequence, location, or neighbor knowledge.\n\n\t "

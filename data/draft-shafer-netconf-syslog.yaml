- language: en

  content: "   SYSLOG is the most prevalent mechanism for delivering event\n   notification
    data off networking devices.  NETCONF is intended to\n   provide a standard mechanism
    for performing configuration operations\n   on networking devices.  The two areas
    will overlap, giving rise to a\n   need for receiving notification data over NETCONF.\n\n
    \  This document presents a simple mechanism for accessing SYSLOG data\n   over
    NETCONF, implemented using the existing NETCONF RPC\n   infrastructure.\n\t "

  content: "This memo defines a framework for the collection of physical topology
    information.  Physical topology is defined as the physical interconnection of
    communication ports between communication devices.  The framework allows for topology
    determination within and across a broad spectrum of devices.  It establishes a
    set of guidelines for topology mechanisms used to distribute and collect topology
    information, and describes the behavior of a management station required to collect
    topology information across a potentially large and diverse set of communication
    devices.  A companion memo will provide an experimental portion of the Management
    Information Base (MIB) which is derived from this framework and allows the management
    workstation to gather physical topology information from the devices in the network.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), resource certificates
    completely obscure names or any other information that might be useful for contacting
    responsible parties to deal with issues of certificate expiration, maintenance,
    roll-overs, compromises, etc. This document describes the RPKI Ghostbusters Record
    containing human contact information that may be verified (indirectly) by a Certification
    Authority (CA) certificate. The data in the record are those of a severely profiled
    vCard. [STANDARDS- TRACK]</p>"

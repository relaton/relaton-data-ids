  content: "   We study the performance of the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and the\n   interpolated
    ON-OFF voice over the differentiated services\n   Internet.  Both the Premium
    and Assured services are tested, and\n   their relative performance is investigated.
    Using these services, at\n   the DS3 rate, the call handling capacity can be doubled,
    at the\n   expense of packetization delay and a few milliseconds packet delay.\n
    \  Also, at a reasonable load level, if the Assured flows are smooth\n   their
    playout delay could be limited to a few milliseconds. This is\n   true even in
    the presence of the higher-priority Premium flows.  The\n   loss rate of the Assured
    packets at the RIO buffer is observed to be\n   within the order of 10^(-06),
    where as the best effort packet loss\n   rate is within the order of 10^(-02).
    \ Finally, shaping the Premium\n   traffic reaches diminishing returns; shaping
    could often exceedingly\n   increase the end-to-end delay and jitter of the Premium
    traffic.\n \n   A pdf or ps version of this document is available at:\n   http://www.comm.toronto.edu/~hnaser/page2.html#pub96\n\n\t "

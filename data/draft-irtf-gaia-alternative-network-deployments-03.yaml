  content: "   This document presents a taxonomy of \"Alternative Network\n   Deployments\",
    and a set of definitions and shared properties.  It\n   also surveys the technologies
    employed in these networks, and their\n   differing architectural characteristics.\n\n
    \  The term \"Alternative Network Deployments\" includes a set of network\n   access
    models that have emerged in the last decade.  These networks\n   aim to bring
    Internet connectivity to people, using topological,\n   architectural and business
    models different from the so-called\n   \"traditional\" ones, where a company
    deploys or leases the network\n   infrastructure for connecting the users, who
    pay a subscription fee\n   to be connected and make use of it.\n\n   Several initiatives
    throughout the world have built large scale\n   Alternative Networks, using predominantly
    wireless technologies\n   (including long distance) due to the reduced cost of
    using unlicensed\n   spectrum.  Wired technologies such as fiber are also used
    in some of\n   these alternate networks.\n\n   The emergence of these networks
    has been motivated by a variety of\n   factors such as the reluctance of network
    operators to provide wired\n   and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas.
    \ In these cases,\n   the networks have self-sustaining business models that provide
    more\n   localized communication services as well as Internet backhaul support\n
    \  through peering agreements with traditional network operators.  In\n   other
    cases, networks are built as a complement to commercial\n   Internet access provided
    by \"traditional\" network operators.\n\n   The present classification considers
    extant network models such as\n   Community Networks, which are self-organized
    and decentralized\n   networks wholly owned by the community; networks owned by
    individuals\n   who act as Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs); networks\n
    \  owned by individuals but leased out to network operators who use them\n   as
    a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, and finally\n   there are
    networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless\n   resources of the users.\n\n
    \  Different criteria are used in order to build a classification e.g.,\n   the
    ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the\n   participatory
    model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a\n   community, a company or
    a local stakeholder (public or private), etc.\n\n   According to the developed
    taxonomy, a characterization of each kind\n   of network is presented in terms
    of specific network characteristics\n   related to architecture, organization,
    etc.\n\n\t "

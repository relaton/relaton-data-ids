  script: Latn
  content: "The internet consists of many hosts and many implementations of each protocol
    suite.  There are no formal tests or approval mechanisms associated with membership
    of the internet, and therefore there are very varied levels of conformance to
    the various standards. This document intends to describe some of the common problems,
    mistakes and errors that are made in electronic mail. Most of them are easily
    avoidable, and some guidance on what to do in each case is given here.  Some of
    these guidelines are pragmatic, some are mandated by other standards, and others
    are religious.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) represents a paradigm\n
    \  shift in wireless networks, where sensing and communication functions\n   are
    jointly designed and optimized.  By leveraging the same spectral\n   and hardware
    resources, ISAC enables advanced capabilities such as\n   environment perception,
    object tracking, and situational awareness,\n   while maintaining efficient and
    reliable data transmission.  This\n   integration holds great potential for applications
    in areas such as\n   autonomous systems, smart cities, and industrial automation,
    where\n   precise sensing and low-latency communication are critical.  This\n
    \  document presents the ISAC as a typical CATS scenario to facilitate\n   discussions
    on the potential challenges and requirements.\n\n\t "

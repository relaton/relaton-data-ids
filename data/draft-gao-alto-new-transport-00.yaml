  content: "   The current ALTO transport is based on HTTP/1.x connections between\n
    \  ALTO servers and ALTO clients.  On the other hand, recent extensions\n   to
    HTTP/1.x such as HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and HTTP/3 [I-D.ietf-quic-http]\n   introduce
    capabilities such as server push and stream multiplexing,\n   which can potentially
    be integrated into ALTO to improve ALTO\n   capabilities such as incremental updates.
    \ This document identifies\n   use cases of ALTO and its extensions that may benefit
    from the\n   advanced features of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and proposes ALTO extensions\n
    \  to fully leverage the benefits.\n\n\t "

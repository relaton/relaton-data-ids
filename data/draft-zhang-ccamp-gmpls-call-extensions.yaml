  content: "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource
    \nReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are \nused to
    support Calls. Although it is stated that these mechanisms \nare applicable to
    any environment (including multi-area), the \"Call \nPath\" is determined hop-by-hop
    by each \"Call Manager\" in sequence \nalong the path of the Call. \n\n \n \n
    However, it is desirable to allow the Call-initiator to identify the \nCall Path
    explicitly in some cases (especially in the multi-domain \ncase). \n\nThis document
    describes RSVP-TE signaling extensions to allow the \nCall-initiator to identify
    the Call Path explicitly when transit \nnodes (besides the Call-initiator and
    Call-terminator) are involved \nin these Calls. \n\nConventions used in this document
    \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",
    \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this
    \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].\n\t "

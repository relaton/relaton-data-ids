  content: "The NetLMM WG is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based \nlocalized
    mobility management (NetLMM), taking basic support for \nregistration, de-registration
    and handover into account in the first \nprotocol release. When a mobile node
    connects to the access networks \nthrough a sole interface or multiple interfaces,
    the condition of the \naccess networks should be considered to improve the performance
    of \nthe ongoing applications. According to the normal operation, Local \nMobility
    Anchor (LMA) can not get enough information to do the \nnecessary scheduling with
    Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and Mobile Node \n(MN), such as flow distribution.
    This document defines a PMIPv6 extension that carries network condition in the
    form of simple class \nindication which is calculated and sent from MAG to LMA
    in the Access \nTechnology Type option. \n\n      \n      \n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes a method for describing the changes made to an\n
    \  email during common email modifications, for example those caused by\n   mailing
    lists and forwarders.\n\n   While this is general enough to be used for any changes,
    it is\n   anticipated that this method will normally be used for removing added\n
    \  data rather than large complex changes.\n\n   This method also captures hashes
    of important features of the\n   message, allowing validation that the changes
    were described\n   correctly, and allowing a signature which covers the Mail-Version\n
    \  header to, by extention, ensure that the important content of the\n   message
    is unchanged.\n\n\t "

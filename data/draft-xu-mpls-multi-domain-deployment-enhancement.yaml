  content: "   MPLS as a mature technology is increasingly deployed in large-scale\n
    \  networks which consists of multiple domains (e.g., IGP areas/levels\n   and
    even Autonomous Systems). To scale such multi-domain MPLS\n   deployment, the
    concept of hierarchical LSPs is usually resorted.\n   This document describes
    an enhancement to such hierarchical multi-\n   domain MPLS deployment architecture
    that could further improve the\n   scalability of multi-domain MPLS deployment.\n\n\t "

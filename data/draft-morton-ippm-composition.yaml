  content: "This memo utilizes IPPM metrics that are applicable to both complete \n
    \  paths and sub-paths, and defines relationships to compose a complete \n   path
    metric from the sub-path metrics with some accuracy w.r.t. the \n   actual metrics.
    \ This is called Spatial Composition in RFC 2330. The \n   current version of
    the memo gives some background and proposes \n   wording for a Scope and Application
    section to define this new work. \n   The description of several example metrics
    and statistics follow.\n\t "

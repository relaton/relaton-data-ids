- language: en

  content: "The NetLMM WG has specified the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for network-based
    localized mobility management, taking basic support for registration, de-registration
    and handover of Mobile Node (MN) into \naccount in the RFC 5213 [1]. However,
    when a MN configures with \nmultiple interfaces, the corresponding supporting
    scheme is needed. \nThis document proposes an easy extension of the basic PMIPv6
    protocol \nwith the address option. Then the MN can communicate with CN using
    \nanyone interface but always maintain the upper layer application with \na fixed
    home address (HoA). Besides, the operation and extension is \ntransparent to the
    MAG and compatible with the other specifications. \n\t "

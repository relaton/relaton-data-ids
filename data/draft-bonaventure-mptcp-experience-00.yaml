abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses operational experiences of using Multipath
    TCP in real world networks. It lists several prominent use cases for which Multipath
    TCP has been considered and is being used. It also gives insight in some heuristics
    and decisions that have helped to realize these use cases. Further, it presents
    several open issues that are yet unclear on how they can be solved.</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "Mobile IP provides a mobile node, that visits a foreign subnet, the ability
    to continue to use an address from its home subnet (the home address) as a source
    address. This is achieved through the allocation of a Care of Address on the foreign
    subnet that is used as the end-point of a redirection tunnel from a home agent
    on the home subnet. Mobile IP in RFC 3220 states that when the mobile node originates
    multicast traffic intended for the foreign multicast system, it can only do so
    by first obtaining an IP address from the foreign subnet (a Collocated Care of
    Address) and then using this address as the multicast source address. This is
    to ensure that the source address will pass multicast routing reverse path forwarding
    checks.\nThis foreign multicast model is however extremely restrictive, and still
    very problematic to multicast routing and applications when the mobile node regularly
    changes foreign subnets, as is common in wireless systems. This is because the
    source address continues to evolve which must be tracked by source specific multicast
    application and routing signalling. Using the home multicast system, again described
    above, is also non-optimal because the mobile node receiver is then serviced by
    packets that must be tunnelled from its home agent which, removes any multicast
    routing benefits (ie network based tree building). This draft therefore describes
    modifications to the foreign multicast interface between mobile IP and multicast
    routing that enable the mobile node to use its persistent home address as a multicast
    source address.\n\n\t "

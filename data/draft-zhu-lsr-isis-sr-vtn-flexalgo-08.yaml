  content: "   Enhanced VPNs aim to deliver VPN services with enhanced\n   characteristics,
    such as guaranteed resources, latency, jitter, etc.,\n   so as to support customers
    requirements for connectivity services\n   with these enhanced characteristics.
    \ Enhanced VPN requires\n   integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and
    the\n   characteristics provided by the underlay network.  A Network Resource\n
    \  Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources and associated\n   policies
    on each of a connected set of links in the underlay network.\n   An NRP could
    be used as the underlay to support one or a group of\n   enhanced VPN services.\n\n
    \  In some network scenarios, each NRP can be associated with a unique\n   Flexible
    Algorithm (Flex-Algo), which can provide constraint-path\n   computation based
    on the customized topological constraints.  This\n   document specifies a mechanism
    to build Segment Routing (SR) based\n   NRPs by combining SR Flex-Algo and IGP
    L2 bundles with minor\n   extensions.\n\n\t "

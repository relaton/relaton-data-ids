- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft introduces a mechanism to support detached Additional\n
    \  Authenticated Data (AAD) in JWE (JSON Web Encryption), allowing the\n   AAD
    to be derived from context-specific information, such as session\n   identifiers,
    algorithm identifiers, and identifiers of communication\n   endpoints, rather
    than being transmitted in-band.  This mechanism\n   strengthens security by mitigating
    risk against unknown-key-share\n   attacks and/or other exploitation techniques
    that depend on some type\n   of confusion over the role played by each party.\n\n
    \  The document explains how to integrate this functionality into JWE,\n   covering
    both JWE JSON Serialization and JWE Compact Serialization.\n\n\t "

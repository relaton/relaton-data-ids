  content: "This document describes a mechanism for scalable, tiered Internet\nrouting,
    called TRIP.  The goal of TRIP is to decrease the growth\nrate of the core Internet
    routing tables by increasing route\naggregation and constraining the propagation
    of multihoming and\ntraffic engineering routes.\n\nTRIP accomplishes this goal
    by defining separate routing domains for\nedge networks and transit networks.
    \ All current, non-TRIP-aware\nnetworks and nodes are considered part of the transit
    domain.  Edge\nnetwork domains may be created by deploying TRIP at a domain-boundary\nrouters
    or within IP (v4 or v6) endpoints.\n\nIn addition to defining the basic TRIP mechanism,
    this document\ndescribes an incremental deployment path that provides a means
    for\nendpoints in TRIP-enabled edge networks to talk directly to non-TRIP-\naware
    end-points in transit domain.  This is accomplished without the\nneed to advertise
    edge network prefixes in the global routing tables\nor to create a separate global
    routing domain for edge network\nprefixes.\n\t "

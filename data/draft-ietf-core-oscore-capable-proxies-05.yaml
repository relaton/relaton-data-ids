  content: "   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) can be\n
    \  used to protect CoAP messages end-to-end between two endpoints at the\n   application
    layer, also in the presence of intermediaries such as\n   proxies.  This document
    defines how to use OSCORE for protecting CoAP\n   messages also between an origin
    application endpoint and an\n   intermediary, or between two intermediaries.  Also,
    it defines rules\n   to escalate the protection of a CoAP option, in order to
    encrypt and\n   integrity-protect it whenever possible.  Finally, it defines how
    to\n   secure a CoAP message by applying multiple, nested OSCORE\n   protections,
    e.g., both end-to-end between origin application\n   endpoints; and between an
    application endpoint and an intermediary or\n   between two intermediaries.  Therefore,
    this document updates RFC\n   8613.  Furthermore, this document updates RFC 8768,
    by explicitly\n   defining the processing with OSCORE for the CoAP option Hop-Limit.\n
    \  The approach defined in this document can be seamlessly used with\n   Group
    OSCORE, for protecting CoAP messages when group communication\n   is used in the
    presence of intermediaries.\n\n\t "

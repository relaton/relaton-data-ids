  content: "The \"BTNS\" (Better Than Nothing Security) protocols specifies how to\n
    \  use IKEv1 and IKEv2 to do unauthenticated IPsec.  This document\n   explains
    in the abstract (no language bindings are provided) how an\n   application may
    learn that BTNS IPsec has been applied to a\n   conversation, such that the application
    can plan to do it's own\n   authentication using a channel binding.  In addition,
    applications\n   can use this API (Application Programming Interface) to request
    BTNS\n   treatment of the applications' connections.\n\t "

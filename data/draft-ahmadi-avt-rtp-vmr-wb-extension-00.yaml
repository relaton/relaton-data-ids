  content: "This document is an addendum to RFC xxxx, which specifies the \n   real-time
    transport protocol for the Variable-Rate Multimode \n   Wideband (VMR-WB) speech
    codec. This document contains the \n   information related to the new operating
    mode of VMR-WB. All \n   provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc. that
    are \n   specified in RFC xxxx are applicable to the new operating mode \n   without
    any exception.\n\n   No new media type registration is included in this document
    as the\n   new VMR-WB mode, defined in this document, will use the same media\n
    \  type specified in RFC xxxx (i.e., audio/VMR-WB). Note that the \n   RFC xxxx
    was developed with sufficient flexibility for future \n   extensions and thereby
    it allows the addition of new operating \n   modes without any impacts on the
    interoperability of terminals\n   supporting different versions of the VMR-WB
    standard.\n\t "

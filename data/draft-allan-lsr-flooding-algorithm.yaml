  content: "   This document describes a distributed algorithm that can be applied\n
    \  to the problem of constraining IGP flooding in dense mesh\n   topologies. The
    flooding topology utilizes two node-diverse spanning\n   trees in order to provide
    complete coverage in the presence of any\n   single failure while constraining
    the number of LSAs received by any\n   IGP speaker connected to the flooding topology.\n\n\n\t "

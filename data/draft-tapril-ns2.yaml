  content: "   Within the DNS, there is no mechanism for authoritative servers to\n
    \  advertise which transport methods they are capable of.  If secure\n   transport
    methods are adopted by authoritative operators, transport\n   signaling would
    be required to negotiate how authoritative servers\n   would be contacted by resolvers.
    \ This document provides two new\n   Resource Record Types, NS2 and NS2T, to facilitate
    this negotiation\n   by allowing zone owners to signal how the authoritative nameserver(s)\n
    \  for their zone(s) may accept queries.\n\n\t "

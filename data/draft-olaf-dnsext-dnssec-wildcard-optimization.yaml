  content: "Secure denial of the existence of wildcards may lead to a large\nnumber
    of NXT Resource Records and associated SIG Resource Records in\nDNS responses,
    even in the common case when wildcards are not present\nin the zone.  This optimization
    uses one bit from the NXT type array\nto signal that there is no closer wildcard
    in the zone for a given\nquery name.  This reduces the packet size and the need
    for executing\nslow, and complicated, code paths in the case when queries are
    made\nto zones which have the bit set at zone signing time.  In cases where\nthere
    are no wildcard RRs in the zone (e.g.  the root zone) only one\nNXT RR and corresponding
    SIG is needed for denial of existence of\nboth a full match and any possible wildcard
    matches.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes how service function chains (SFC) can be\n
    \  applied to traffic flows using routing in a virtual (overlay)\n   network to
    steer traffic between service nodes. Chains can include\n   services running in
    routers, on physical appliances or in virtual\n   machines. Service chains have
    applicability at the subscriber edge,\n   business edge and in multi-tenant datacenters.
    The routing function\n   into SFCs and between service functions within an SFC
    can be\n   performed by physical devices (routers), be virtualized inside\n   hypervisors,
    or run as part of a host OS.\n\n   A BGP control plane for route distribution
    is used to create virtual\n   networks implemented using IP MPLS, VXLAN or other
    suitable\n   encapsulation, where the routes within the virtual networks cause\n
    \  traffic to flow through a sequence of service nodes that apply\n   packet processing
    functions to the flows.\n\n   Two techniques are described: in one the service
    chain is\n   implemented as a sequence of distinct VPNs between sets of service\n
    \  nodes that apply each service function; in the other, the routes\n   within
    a VPN are modified through the use of special route targets\n   and modified next-hop
    resolution to achieve the desired result.\n\n   In both techniques, service chains
    can be created by manual\n   configuration of routes and route targets in routing
    systems, or\n   through the use of a controller which contains a topological model\n
    \  of the desired service chains.\n\n   This document also contains discussion
    of load balancing between\n   network functions, symmetric forward and reverse
    paths when stateful\n   services are involved, and use of classifiers to direct
    traffic into\n   a service chain.\n\n\t "

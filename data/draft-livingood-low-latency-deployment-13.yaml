abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's Transport and Services Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized
    experimental RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) and new
    Non-Queue-Building (NQB) per hop behavior. These documents describe a new architecture
    and protocol for deploying low latency networking. Since deployment decisions
    are left to implementers, this document explores some of the implications of those
    decisions and makes suggestions that can help drive adoption and acceptance of
    L4S and NQB based on observations from the world's first large scale deployment.</p>"

  content: "Strings of text appear in many fields in PKIX certificates. Some\napplications
    need to compare the values in these fields to strings\nfrom other certificates,
    or to values obtained in other manners.\nFor many string encodings, this can be
    done in an octet-by-octet\nfashion. Other encodings, however, require preparation
    before the\nstrings can be compared. This document describes that preparation\nand
    when it needs to be applied.\n\t "

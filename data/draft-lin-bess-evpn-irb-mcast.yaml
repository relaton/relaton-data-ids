  content: "   Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local\n
    \  Area Network (LAN), i.e., a single IP subnet, to be distributed over\n   multiple
    sites.  The sites are interconnected by an IP or MPLS\n   backbone.  Intra-subnet
    traffic (either unicast or multicast) always\n   appears to the endusers to be
    bridged, even when it is actually\n   carried over the IP backbone.  When a single
    \"tenant\" owns multiple\n   such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to
    be routed between\n   those LANs.  This document specifies new procedures that
    allow inter-\n   subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a
    given\n   tenant, while still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear\n
    \  to be bridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the\n   inter-subnet
    multicast traffic, and do not require any such traffic\n   to leave a given router
    and then reenter that same router.  These\n   procedures also accommodate IP multicast
    traffic that needs to travel\n   to or from systems that are outside the EVPN
    domain.\n\n\t "

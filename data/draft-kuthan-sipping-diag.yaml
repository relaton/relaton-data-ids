  content: "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides only limited space for \ncommunicating
    diagnostic information when errors occur. To facilitate \ntroubleshooting, automated
    error detection, and reporting we propose \nto create new protocol extensions.
    The extensions will be used for \nricher reporting on request processing status.
    Particularly, we \nsuggest that User Agent Servers (UAS) include additional information
    \nabout error reasons in negative replies, and proxy servers indicate \nin relayed
    requests the routing logic they used. \n\n\t "

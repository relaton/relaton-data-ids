  content: "This document enumerates the scheme of choosing subnets by most significant
    bit (msb) of the host portion of the address as described in RFC 1219.  Two tables
    provide the specific information for class B (/16) networks and class C (/24)
    networks.  It is intended to aid network planners in adopting an addressing allocation
    scheme which is 'renumbering friendly.'\n\t "

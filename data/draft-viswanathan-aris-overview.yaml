- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IP based networks use a number of routing protocols, including RIP, OSPF,
    IS-IS, and BGP, to determine how packets ought to be routed.  Among these protocols,
    OSPF and BGP are IETF-recommended standards that have been extensively deployed
    and exercised in many networks.  In this memo, we describe a mechanism which uses
    these protocols as the basis for switching IP datagrams, by the addition of a
    simple protocol ('ARIS') that establishes switched paths through a network.  The
    ARIS protocol allows us to leverage the advantages of switching technologies in
    an internet network.\n\t "

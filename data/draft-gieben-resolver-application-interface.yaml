  content: "   This document describes an interface between a DNSSEC aware resolver\n
    \  and an application. This interface will define which kind of\n   information
    a DNSSEC aware resolver is able to send back to an\n   application. The basic
    question we want to answer is: 'What does an\n   application want to know from
    a secure aware resolver?'.\n\n   In Section 4 we define an error bit array. The
    secure aware resolver\n   will set specific bits in the array. With the added
    information in\n   the error array, the application can have extra control on
    what to do\n   with bogus data.\n\n   When something goes wrong during the secure
    resolving process the\n   application may also want to know where in the DNS tree
    this\n   happened. With a simple error array one can not convey this\n   information.
    A possibility might be to give the application the owner\n   name of the DNS node
    where the validation failed.\n\n   This document is written in the hope that it
    will lead to a\n   discussion within the IETF on the resolver-application\n   interaction(s).\n\t "

  content: "Although the SIP History-Info header is the solution adopted in IETF,
    the non-standard Diversion header is nevertheless widely implemented and used
    for conveying call-diversion-related information in SIP signaling.\n\n This document
    describes a recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion header and
    the History-Info header to handle call diversion information. In addition, an
    interworking policy is proposed to manage the headers' coexistence. The History-Info
    header is described in RFC 4244 and the non-standard Diversion header is described,
    as Historic, in RFC 5806.\n\n Since the Diversion header is used in many existing
    network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking
    with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed. This work is intended
    to enable the migration from non- standard implementations and deployment toward
    IETF specification- based implementations and deployment. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

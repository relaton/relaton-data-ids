  content: "This draft describes the use of RSVP [RFC2205] with applications\n   that
    do not have resource requirements that may not be readily\n   quantifiable (qualitative
    applications). We introduce the\n   \\146qualitative\\106 service-type. This service-type
    can be used in\n   conjunction with RSVP signaling to manage the allocation of
    network\n   resources to traffic originating from qualitative applications. This\n
    \  mode of RSVP usage is particularly applicable to networks that\n   combine
    differentiated service (diff-serv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP\n   signaling [intdiff].\n\t "

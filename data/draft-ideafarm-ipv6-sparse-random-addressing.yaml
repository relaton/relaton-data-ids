abstract:
- content: <p>The IPv6 address space is huge. This document discusses how "sparse
    random addressing" can be used to defeat DDOS attacks, and also to create paid-access
    websites. The essential idea is to use the host ID portion of an IPv6 address
    as a time-based password that only paid subscribers know. (They know it by running
    a program on the device that they use to access the website. That program uses
    the current time and a secret shared with the web server to calculate the current
    host ID.) Each subscriber has a unique secret so, at any point in time, uses a
    unique IPv6 address to access the website. Sparseness prevents attack packets
    from reaching the web server. Uniqueness creates accountability. To protect routers
    from flood attacks, the globally routable /48 prefix is also randomized, in a
    way that exploits BGP route propagation delay to partially or completely quash
    the flooding at the source, thereby protecting all upstream routers. This early
    draft only contains a conceptual overview.</p>

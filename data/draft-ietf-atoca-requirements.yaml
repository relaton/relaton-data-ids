  content: "   Before, during and after emergency situations various agencies need\n
    \  to provide information to a group of persons or to the public within\n   a
    geographical area.  While many aspects of such systems are specific\n   to national
    or local jurisdictions, emergencies span such boundaries\n   and notifications
    need to reach visitors from other jurisdictions.\n\n   This document provides
    terminology, requirements and an architectural\n   description for protocols exchanging
    alerts between IP-based end\n   points.\n\n\t "

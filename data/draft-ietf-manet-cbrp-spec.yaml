  content: "Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) is a routing protocol designed\nfor
    use in mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol divides the nodes of\nthe ad hoc
    network into a number of overlapping or disjoint 2-hop-\ndiameter clusters in
    a distributed manner.  A cluster head is elected\nfor each cluster to maintain
    cluster membership information. Inter-\ncluster routes are discovered dynamically
    using the cluster\nmembership information kept at each cluster head.  By clustering\nnodes
    into groups, the protocol efficiently minimizes the flooding\ntraffic during route
    discovery and speeds up this process as well.\nFurthermore, the protocol takes
    into consideration the existence of\nuni-directional links and uses these links
    for both intra-cluster and\ninter-cluster routing.\n\n\n\t "

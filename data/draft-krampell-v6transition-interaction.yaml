  content: "This document discusses interaction of transition mechanisms that\ncan
    be involved in a communication between two end-points. Various\ntransition mechanisms
    are defined to solve single transition issues.\nThey are supposed to be used once
    along the path of a single\ncommunication. During the transition phase disparate
    network\narchitecture will introduce multiple transition mechanisms in\ndifferent
    ways. It will not be possible to predict the number and\nthe nature of the transition
    mechanisms that can be encountered\nalong the path of a communication. This memo
    aims to identify cases\nwhere multiple transition mechanisms can be involved,
    and what can\nbe the interaction effects between them. \n\n\t "

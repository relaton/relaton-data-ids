  content: "   One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP (MPTCP)\n
    \  is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is connected to\n   multiple
    networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the usage of\n   such resources, thereby
    providing better serviceability overall\n   (including whenever the CPE fails
    to connect to one of the access\n   networks).  This document specifies a MPTCP
    profile for such\n   deployments in network regions that are firewall- and NAT-free.\n\n\n\t "

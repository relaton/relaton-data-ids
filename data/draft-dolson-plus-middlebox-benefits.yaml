abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   At IETF97, at a meeting regarding the Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS)\n
    \  protocol, a request was made for documentation about the benefits\n   that
    might be provided by permitting middleboxes to have some\n   visibility to transport-layer
    information.\n\n   This document summarizes benefits provided to the Internet
    by\n   intermediary devices that provide functions apart from normal IP\n   forwarding.
    \ Such intermediary devices are often called\n   \"middleboxes\".\n\n   RFC3234
    defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the Internet.\n   Most of those
    middleboxes utilize or modify application-layer data.\n   This document primarily
    focuses on devices that observe and act on\n   information carried in the transport
    layer, and especially\n   information carried in TCP packets.\n\n   A primary
    goal of this document is to provide information to working\n   groups developing
    new transport protocols, in particular the PLUS and\n   QUIC working groups, to
    aid understanding of what might be gained or\n   lost by design decisions that
    may affect (or be affected by)\n   middlebox operation.\n\n\t "

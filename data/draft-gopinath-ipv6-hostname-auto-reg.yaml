  content: "This document describes a new method, which will automatically \nacquire
    the host name of active IPv6 nodes and register it to the \nlocal Domain Name
    System (DNS) server. Active IPv6 nodes are nodes \nthat are connected to a network.
    \nOur proposed new method [6] will automatically learn some useful \ninformation
    from all the IPv6 nodes, such as the host name and the \nIP address. The Agent
    using a new method will keep all the \ninformation that is send by the nodes.
    The Resolver will add the \nhost name together with the IPv6 address to the DNS.
    This will be \nimplemented without the need for any changes at the clients' site.
    \ \nThe objective of this document is to specify a new procedure and \nalso the
    algorithm used in the procedure.\n\t "

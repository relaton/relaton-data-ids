  content: "   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for\n
    \  the purpose of supporting validation of assertions of \"right-of-use\"\n   of
    Internet Number Resources (INRs).  The certificates issued under\n   this profile
    are used to convey the issuer's authorization of the\n   subject to be regarded
    as the current holder of a \"right-of-use\" of\n   the INRs that are described
    in the certificate.  This document\n   contains the normative specification of
    Certificate and Certificate\n   Revocation List (CRL) syntax in the Resource Public
    Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI).  This document also specifies profiles for the\n
    \  format of certificate requests and specifies the Relying Party RPKI\n   certificate
    path validation procedure.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 6487.\n\n\t "

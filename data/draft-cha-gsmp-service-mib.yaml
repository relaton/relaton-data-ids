  content: "General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface \nprotocol
    between a label switch and a controller, and it provides \nconnection, configuration,
    event, performance management and \nsynchronization. Traditionally, network management
    services are \nclassified into five categories: those are configuration, performance,
    \nfault, accounting, and security management. The companion draft \ndocument discussed
    the implementation complexity of a label switch \nand the efficiency of resource
    usage according to the location of \nnetwork management functions. This document
    defines managed objects \nto support network management services in the GSMP interface.

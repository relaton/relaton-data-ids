  content: "   This document presents a seamless integration solution for BGP-based\n
    \  Layer-2 VPN (L2VPN) and EVPN to provide point-to-point Virtual\n   Private
    Wire Service (VPWS).  In addition, this document also extends\n   the existing
    seamless integration for multipoint Ethernet VPN service\n   with all-active multihoming
    support.  The specified solution allows\n   the coexistence of EVPN and L2VPN
    services under the same point-to-\n   point or multipoint VPN instance.  By using
    this seamless integration\n   solution, a service provider can introduce EVPN
    into their existing\n   L2VPN network or migrate from an existing L2VPN based
    network to\n   EVPN.\n\n\n\t "

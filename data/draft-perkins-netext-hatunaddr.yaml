  content: "   Widely deployed mobility management systems for wireless\n   communications
    have isolated the path for forwarding data from the\n   control plane signaling
    for mobility management.  To realize this\n   requirement with Mobile IP requires
    that the control functions of the\n   home agent be addressable at a different
    IP address than the source\n   IP address of the tunnel between the home agent
    and mobile node.\n   Similar considerations hold for mobility anchors implementing\n
    \  Hierarchical Mobile IP or PMIP.\n\n\t "

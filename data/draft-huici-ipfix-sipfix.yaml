  content: "The deployment of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) telephony is increasing fast.\nVoIP's
    paradigm and the features it offers differ significantly from\nthat of regular
    telephony, and, as a result, its monitoring\nrequirements do so as well.  This
    draft employs use cases to derive\nthese requirements and introduces SIPFIX, an
    extension to IPFIX (IP\nFlow Information eXchange), that meets them.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the CPaceOQUAKE+ protocol, a hybrid\n   asymmetric
    password-authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports\n   mutual authentication
    in a client-server setting secure against\n   quantum-capable attackers.  CPaceOQUAKE+
    is the result of a KEM-based\n   transformation from the hybrid symmetric PAKE
    protocol called\n   CPaceOQUAKE that is also described in this document.  This
    document\n   recommends configurations for CPaceOQUAKE+.\n\n\t "

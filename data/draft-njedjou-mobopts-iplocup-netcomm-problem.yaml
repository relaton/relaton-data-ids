  content: "Mobile IP is good at addressing IP session continuity (hide of the IP
    \naddress change from transport layer perspective, as well as from the \ncorrespondent
    perspective) but certainly not optimal for mobility \nmanagement as would perform
    3GPP systems providers that want to \nextend their services to IP access systems.
    This document only \ndescribes the problem and is not meant to provide any solution
    nor \nany requirement thereof. \n\t "

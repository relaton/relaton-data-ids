  content: "   This draft discusses the handover problem of dual stack mobile nodes\n
    \  when the mobile nodes roam over IPv4 and IPv6 NETLMM domains.\n   Current NETLMM
    architecture supports IPv6 only.  However, as the\n   NETLMM architecture being
    more widely used, it will be likely to\n   introduce the NETLMM architecture to
    IPv4 networks.  In this\n   environment, a dual stack mobile node may move to
    both IPv6 and IPv4\n   NETLMM domains.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Domain name system (DNS)is a key Internet infrastructure service\n
    \  connecting the IP layer and the identifier layer of Internet.  This\n   memo
    describe the behavior and inherent limitation of DNS in IPv4 and\n   dual-stack
    environment.  To ease the problem as well as bringing some\n   incentive to turn
    off IPv4 as soon as possible, this memo is intended\n   to introduce potential
    solutions to make some changes on DNS protocol\n   and operation practice in the
    IPv6 only network.\n\n\t "

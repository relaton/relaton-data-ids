  content: "   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model\n
    \  for environments in which communications may be subject to long\n   delays
    and/or intermittent connectivity.  A Bundle Protocol (BP) has\n   been designed
    to accommodate data communications in such challenging\n   environments through
    multi-hop store-and-forward message propagation,\n   where each hop may be required
    to store bundles of data for long\n   periods of time.  It is therefore essential
    that bundles with\n   corrupted headers (e.g., the primary bundle block) be detected
    as\n   soon as possible in order to avoid resource exhaustion due to\n   accidental
    or malicious factors, and to permit timely retransmission.\n   In this document,
    we discuss the need for a hop-by-hop integrity\n   assurance as a means for encouraging
    suitable solutions.\n\n\t "

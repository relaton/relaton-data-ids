  content: "There is debate on the topic of \"Commit/Rollback of Offer/Answer on\nUnsuccessful
    re-INVITE\".  The reason of the confusion is some\napplication/session usages
    of offer/answer imply the nest\ntransaction(mean transaction theory, not mean
    sip transaction)\nconcept, but whitout unambiguous definition.  This paper reveal

    usages.  And then clarify that there is no\nambiguous state of session modification
    using current RFC definition.\n\t "

  content: "   RIFT is a new specialized dynamic routing protocol originally\n   designed
    for Clos and Fat Tree Data Center networks.  It is designed\n   to work on multilevel
    network topologies in which nodes in certain\n   level will only connect to nodes
    in one upper or lower level with\n   optional and non-contiguous intra-level connectivity.\n\n
    \  While the protocol was originally designed to meet the needs of\n   Massively
    Scalable Data Centers, its ability to automatically prune\n   the information
    distribution from higher levels to lower levels, as\n   well as provide optimal
    routing for intra and inter-level traffic\n   makes it a good match for user access
    networks, or any network that\n   combines end user access and various compute
    enabling various network\n   service for these end users.  Current directions
    in distributed\n   computing seek to blur even that distinction.  Large distributed\n
    \  networks can be created, where virtual compute units can be in all\n   tiers,
    combining and crossing many requirements for DC or User Access\n   design.  This
    draft seeks to analyze these requirements.\n\n\t "

  content: "Mobile SCTP (mSCTP) is defined as SCTP with the ADDIP extension. The \n
    \   mSCTP can be used for providing seamless handover by exploiting its \n    multi-homing
    feature. On the other hand, the Mobile IP basically \n    provides the location
    management. In this document, we discuss the \n    use of mSCTP along with Mobile
    IP for Internet mobility support in \n    the transport layer. The use of SCTP
    with Mobile IP is focused on the \n    mobile sessions that are initiated by CN
    to MN.\n\t "

  content: "This draft documents the Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP) v1.0\n  for
    dividing URL-space among an array of loosely coupled proxy\n  servers.\n \n  An
    HTTP client agent (either a proxy server or a client browser)\n  which implements
    CARP v1.0 can allocate and intelligently route\n  requests for the correct URLs
    to any member of the Proxy\n  Array.  Due to the resulting sorting of requests
    through these\n  proxies, duplication of cache contents is eliminated and global\n
    \ cache hit rates are improved.\n\t "

  content: "Facsimile (Fax) has a long tradition of being a telephony application\nfrom
    one terminal device to another, where the terminal device\nconsists of a paper
    input device (scanner), a paper output device\n(printer), and a limited amount
    of processing power. The transmission\nof data end-to-end is accompanied by negotiation
    (to ensure that the\nscanned data can be rendered at the recipient) and confirmation
    of\ndelivery (to give the sender assurance that the final data has been\nreceived
    and processed.)  Over time, facsimile has been extended to\nallow for PCs connected
    running software to send and receive fax, to\nsend data other than paper images,
    as well as many extensions to the\nbasic image model, e.g., recent ITU fax standards
    for color fax.\nOther delivery extensions have included sub-addressing (additional\nsignals
    after the call is established to facilitate automated routing\nof faxes to desktops
    or mailboxes), and enhanced features such as\nfax-back, polling, and even the
    transfer of binary files.\n \nMany mechanisms for sending fax documents over the
    Internet have been\ndemonstrated and deployed and are currently in use.\n \nThis
    document summarizes the requirements for Internet Fax as\ndiscussed in the IETF
    Internet Fax working group. It is an attempt to\nestablish a baseline of agreed-to
    requirements against which any\nproposal for Internet Fax can be judged.  This
    document encompasses the\nrequirements for both 'real-time' fax as well as 'store
    and forward'\nfax (both terms defined in Section 2).\n\n\n\t "

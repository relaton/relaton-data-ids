  content: "   Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) authenticates and authorizes\n   organizations
    and individuals making and/or receiving telephone\n   calls.  This eliminates
    trust gaps that malicious parties exploit.\n   Like related technologies such
    as SHAKEN, RCD, and BCID, VVP uses\n   STIR to bind cryptographic evidence to
    a SIP INVITE, and verify this\n   evidence downstream.  VVP can also let evidence
    flow the other way,\n   proving things about the callee.  VVP builds from different
    technical\n   and governance assumptions than alternatives, and uses richer,\n
    \  stronger evidence.  This allows VVP to cross jurisdictional\n   boundaries
    easily and robustly.  It also makes VVP simpler, more\n   decentralized, cheaper
    to deploy and maintain, more private, more\n   scalable, and higher assurance.
    \ Because it is easier to adopt, VVP\n   can plug gaps or build bridges between
    other approaches, functioning\n   as glue in hybrid ecosystems.  For example,
    it may justify an A\n   attestation in SHAKEN, or an RCD passport for branded
    calling, when a\n   call originates outside SHAKEN or RCD ecosystems.  VVP also
    works\n   well as a standalone mechanism, independent of other solutions.  An\n
    \  extra benefit is that VVP enables two-way evidence sharing with\n   verifiable
    text and chat (e.g., RCS and vCon), as well as with other\n   industry verticals
    that need verifiability in non-telco contexts.\n\n\t "

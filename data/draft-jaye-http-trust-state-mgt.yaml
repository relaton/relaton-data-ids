abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an extension to the HTTP/1.1 state management\nmechanism
    described in [Kristol].  This mechanism, 'trust-labels',\nassociates digitally
    signed labels with Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2\nheaders.  The labels allow additional
    semantics to attach to cookies\nand cookie processing, and the digital signatures
    allow trust models\nto be associated with processing rules for labeled cookies.\nThe
    intent is to provide a mechanism that allows user agent\nimplementors to implement
    evaluation of the authenticity and content\nof cookie-associated labels, and to
    implement additional processing\nrules for cookie handling.  The intended use
    is browser determination\nof server privacy practices and acceptance, rejection,
    modification\nor redirection of cookies based on those practices.  The more general\nuse
    of trust model scoped, label semantic scoped processing of HTTP\nstate artifacts
    is not precluded by this intended use.\n\t "

  content: "The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) specification describes several
    modes of key distribution solution that address multimedia scenarios (e.g., SIP
    calls and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) sessions) using pre-shared keys,
    public keys, and optionally a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  In the public-key
    mode, the Initiator encrypts a random key with the Responder's public key and
    sends it to the Responder.  In many communication scenarios, the Initiator may
    not know the Responder's public key, or in some cases the Responder's ID (e.g.,
    call forwarding) in advance.  We propose a new MIKEY mode that works well in such
    scenarios.  This mode also enhances the group key management support in MIKEY;
    it supports member-initiated group key download (in contrast to group manager
    pushing the group keys to all members).  This document updates RFC 3830 with the
    RSA-R mode. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   There are a number of situations in TCP where middleboxes are known\n
    \  to change TCP-layer data; and it would be helpful for endpoints to\n   detect
    such changes.  TCP-Checksum is a TCP option to pass checksums\n   over particular
    fields from sender to receiver, which can detect such\n   changes by legacy middleboxes.
    \ This document also sets a rule for\n   future middleboxes which insist upon
    modifying these checksums.\n\n\n\t "

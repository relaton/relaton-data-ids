  content: "   Operators are facing the challenges of providing better network\n   services
    for users.  As the ever-developing 5G and industrial\n   verticals evolve, more
    and more services that have diverse network\n   requirements such as ultra-low
    latency and high reliability are\n   emerging and accessing the network, differentiated
    service treatments\n   are desired by users.  However, operators are still not
    aware of\n   applications, which cause that only coarse-grained services can be\n
    \  provided to users.  As a result, operators are only evolving to be\n   large
    but dumb pipes without corresponding revenue increase.  As the\n   network technologies
    evolve including deployments of IPv6 and SRv6,\n   the programmability provided
    by IPv6 and SRv6 encapsulations can be\n   augmented by conveying the application
    related information into the\n   network.  Adding application knowledge to the
    network layer, allow\n   applications to specify finer granularity requirements,
    which\n   eventually bridges network and applications.\n\n   This document analyzes
    the existing problems of the current operators\n   in the application awareness,
    and outlines various use cases that\n   could benefit from the Application-aware
    IPv6 Networking (APN6).\n\n\n\t "

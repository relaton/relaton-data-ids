  content: "This document describes procedures that enable a router to populate\nits
    Traffic Engineering Database (TED), with local addresses of other\nrouters, that
    are not advertised in IS-IS TE extensions. The only\naddresses belonging to a
    router that are advertised in IS-IS TE LSAs\nare the router's local addresses
    on links enabled for TE and the\nRouter ID. The described procedures enable a
    router to compute\ntraffic engineered MPLS LSPs to a given router's loopback and
    non-TE\ncapable interface addresses.\n\t "

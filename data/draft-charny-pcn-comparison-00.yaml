abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Several, sometimes conflicting proposals have been offered for the\n
    \  consideration of the PCN WG regarding PCN internal node and PCN edge\n   node
    behaviors.  Based on the WG charter, the WG needs to make a\n   decision on which
    of the proposed PCN-interior-node and PCN-boundary-\n   nodes behaviors to endorse.
    \ The primary goal of this draft is\n   twofold.  First, we attempt to summarize
    the functional differences\n   between the proposed alternatives.  Second, we
    provide a brief\n   summary of performance evaluation results.  Finally we propose
    a view\n   on how a (parameterized) specification of the PCN-interior-node\n   metering
    and marking function can be described to enable several of\n   the proposed behaviors.
    \ We argue that if this parameterized\n   specification is used for specifying
    the PCN-interior-node behavior,\n   then it can support a range of behaviors at
    the PCN-boundary-node.\n   The decision on which of the PCN-boundary-node behaviors
    to choose\n   can then be considered separately.  We also discuss complexities\n
    \  associated with choosing such uniform approach.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a cryptographically secure mechanism for Root\n
    \  Certificate Authorities to perform emergency self-termination upon\n   compromise
    detection.  Current PKI architecture creates a\n   mathematical impossibility:
    Root CAs cannot be cryptographically\n   revoked because revocation requires validation
    from a higher\n   authority, but Root CAs are self-signed with no higher authority.\n
    \  This specification addresses this architectural limitation through\n   game-theoretic
    analysis where attacker key usage patterns result in\n   compromise detection
    and bounded attack duration.  The mechanism\n   enables Root CA operators to terminate
    CA validity within hours\n   instead of months while maintaining strict dual-person
    control.\n   Analysis of historical incidents shows average response times of\n
    \  180-540 days.  This protocol reduces maximum exposure time to 8-72\n   hours
    through cryptographic self-termination, providing 74-85%\n   reduction in attack
    exposure duration based on empirical analysis.\n\n\t "

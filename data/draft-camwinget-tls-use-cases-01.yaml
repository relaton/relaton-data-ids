  content: "   Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, public\n
    \  sector, and cloud service providers today in order to both complement\n   and
    augment host-based security solutions.  TLS 1.3 introduces\n   several changes
    to TLS 1.2 with a goal to improve the overall\n   security and privacy provided
    by TLS.  However some of these changes\n   have a negative impact on network-based
    security solutions.  While\n   this may be viewed as a feature, there are several
    real-life use case\n   scenarios that are not easily solved without such network-based\n
    \  security solutions.  In this document, we identify the TLS 1.3\n   changes
    that may impact network-based security solutions and provide\n   a set of use
    case scenarios that are not easily solved without such\n   solutions.\n\n\t "

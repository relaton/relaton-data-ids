  content: "   This document defines an abstract model for high assurance\n   cryptographic
    modules.  It defines the relevant terminology and high-\n   level descriptions
    of the types of services and operations offered by\n   such modules.  The goal
    is to provide a common vocabulary for\n   discussing the programming of high assurance
    modules.\n\n   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list
    at\n   cicm@ietf.org.\n\n\t "

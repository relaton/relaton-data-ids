  content: "   With the boom of Multi-CDN services, more enterprises tend to apply\n
    \  Multi-CDN service to deliver better end user experience to online\n   global
    audiences.  However, the current Multi-CDN strategy has some\n   defects.  Different
    Multi-CDN providers have various implementations\n   of CDN balancing, yet there
    is no such unified DNS protocol because\n   that multiple CNAMEs violates DNS
    standards.  Some Multi-CDN\n   implementations MAY have extra lookups for CDN
    redirection which\n   causes longer query latency.  This document aims to provide
    an\n   exclusive DNS RR type CDNNAME(CDN name) for Multi-CDN implementation.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "A case against IP layer fragmentation has been made, and various methods
    for avoiding it proposed.  This memo revisits the effect of  fragmentation  on
    network performance, and recounts the present methods of avoidance. A protocol
    is presented which adapts to the varying circumstances encountered, sending large
    datagrams whenever possible, and reducing fragmentation when necessary to avoid
    retransmission problems.  A hybrid approach to MTU discovery, it utilizes one
    new IP header option and four new ICMP messages. It is a simple mechanism that
    discovers path MTUs without wasting resources and that works well before all hosts
    and routers are modified.\n\t "

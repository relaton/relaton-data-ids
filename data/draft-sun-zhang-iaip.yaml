  content: "   This document specifies the Intent-based Agent Interconnection\n   Protocol
    (IAIP) operating at the Agent Gateways (AG), which defines\n   the interaction
    mechanisms between AI Agents (at the Agent Domain)\n   and the AG (at the Interconnection
    Services Domain).  This\n   specification focuses on dynamic interconnection among
    agents based\n   on semantic intent, rather than static network addressing alone.\n
    \  This protocols defines the mechanisms for agent registration via\n   capability
    advertisement, Gateway Validation, Intent Resolution and\n   Matching, Routing
    Decisions and Forwarding, enabling the discovery,\n   selection and dispatching
    of intent queries based on agent\n   capabilities and task requirements at AG.\n\n\t "

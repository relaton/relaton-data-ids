abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Intent-based Agent Interconnection Protocol
    (IAIP) operating at the Agent Gateways (AG), which defines the interaction mechanisms
    between AI Agents (at the Agent Domain) and the AG (at the Interconnection Services
    Domain). This specification focuses on dynamic interconnection among agents based
    on semantic intent, rather than static network addressing alone. This protocols
    defines the mechanisms for agent registration via capability advertisement, Gateway
    Validation, Intent Resolution and Matching, Routing Decisions and Forwarding,
    enabling the discovery, selection and dispatching of intent queries based on agent
    capabilities and task requirements at AG.</p>"

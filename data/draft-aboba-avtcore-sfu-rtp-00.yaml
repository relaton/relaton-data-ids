  content: "   Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) supporting Scalable Video Coding\n
    \  (SVC) typically parse the RTP payload in the forwarding plane, and\n   often
    utilize codec-specific control messages within the control\n   plane.  As a result,
    the control and/or forwarding planes of these\n   implementations need to be modified
    (sometimes substantially) in\n   order to support additional video codecs.  With
    SFUs now supporting\n   VP8 in addition to H.264/SVC, and with additional video
    codecs\n   expected to become popular, the inflexibility of SFU designs that\n
    \  depend on RTP payload parsing has become increasingly apparent.  In\n   addition,
    these designs cannot function where the RTP payload is\n   inaccessible, such
    as when it is encrypted with a key not available\n   to the SFU.  Based on a summary
    of SFU implementation practice, this\n   document develops requirements for codec-independent
    SFUs.\n\n\t "

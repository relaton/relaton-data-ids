  content: "   RTP has always been a protocol that supports multiple participants\n
    \  each sending their own media streams in an RTP session.\n   Unfortunately,
    many implementations are designed only for point to\n   point voice over IP with
    a single source in each end-point.  Even\n   client implementations aimed at video
    conferences have often been\n   built with the assumption around central mixers
    that only deliver a\n   single media stream per media type.  Thus any application
    that wants\n   to allow for more advanced usage, where multiple media streams
    are\n   sent and received by an end-point, has an issue with legacy\n   implementations.
    \ This document describes the problem and proposes a\n   signalling solution for
    how to use multiple SSRCs within one RTP\n   session and at the same time handle
    the legacy issues.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "This draft attempts to address the problem of how an IP address should\nbe
    properly mapped to a set of internationalized domain names(iDNs).\nIt is currently
    unspecified how a PTR record can be used for this\npurpose.  In addition, the
    syntax of the PTR resource record may be\ntoo restrictive for such a mapping in
    a more culturally meaningful\ncontext.  This document suggests a new TYPE called
    IPTR using EDNS0\nand a mechanism to combind language information with such a
    mapping.\n\t "

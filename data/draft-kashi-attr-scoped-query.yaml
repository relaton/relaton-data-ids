  script: Latn
  content: "There are times when an LDAP search would return a DN-valued \nattribute
    with multiple values.  As the number of values in a multi-\nvalue attribute increases,
    it becomes apparent that a way to query \nthe multi-valued attribute is increasingly
    valuable.  This document \ndescribes an LDAP extended search control that returns
    DN-valued \nattributes as objects and their respective attributes in the \nsearchResultEntry
    and also allows filters to be applied to the \nvalues in a large multi-valued
    attribute.  Using this control to \nsearch multi-valued attributes reduces the
    number of client round \ntrips.\n\t "

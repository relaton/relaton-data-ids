  content: "   This draft specifies composite ML-DSA authentication in the Internet\n
    \  Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296].  Namely, the\n   authenticaiton
    in the IKEv2 is completed by using a compiste\n   signature of ML-DSA [FIPS203],
    the newly post-quantum digital\n   singature standard, and one of the following
    traditional singature\n   algorithms, SA-PKCS#1v1.5, RSA-PSS, ECDSA, Ed25519,
    and Ed448.  These\n   concrete composite algorithm specifications follow [OGPKF24].\n
    \  Composite ML-DSA authenticatio is achieved by asking to add a new\n   value
    in the \"IKEv2 Authentication Method\" registry [IANA-IKEv2],\n   mantained by
    IANA.  After that, two peers MUST send the\n   SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS Notify,
    defined in [RFC9593], to negotiate the\n   specific composite ML-DSA algoithms.\n\n
    \  [EDNOTE: Code points for composite ML-DSA authentication may need to\n   be
    assigned in the \"IKEv2 Authentication Method\" registry, maintained\n   by IANA]\n\n\t "

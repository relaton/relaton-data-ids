  content: "     As an extension to the address allocation process for DSTM, this\n
    \    document defines the ports option for DSTM.  A DSTM server may also\n     provide
    a range of port numbers to be used by the client. This\n     would allow the use
    of the same IPv4 address by several DSTM nodes\n     at the same time, reducing
    the size of the required IPv4 address\n     pool.\n\t "

  content: "Re-establishment of the QoS after a Mobile Node handover must be done
    \nas quickly as possible in order to reduce degradation or interruption \nof the
    QoS and it is especially useful when realtime applications are \nused. \nWe propose
    a Semi-Proactive procedure for a fast QoS re-establishment \nin environments where
    there are Mobile Nodes. The basic idea of this \nprocedure is to perform as many
    operation as possible before the \nhandover (in a proactive way). Resources are
    reserved only after \nthe handover on the effective new data path, in order to
    avoid their\nwaste.\nMoreover, we propose to buffer at the Candidate CRossover
    Node - \nCCRN (an intermediate node on end-to-end data path) the packets \ndirected
    to the Mobile Node during the handover. In this way the \ntotal QoS re-establishment
    time is reduced. This buffering also \nguarantees, for the buffered packets, the
    same QoS treatment of the \nother packets (the no-buffered ones).\n\t "

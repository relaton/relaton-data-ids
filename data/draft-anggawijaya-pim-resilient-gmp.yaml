abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   Host devices send IGMP or MLD group membership report messages to\n
    \  tell the designated router (DR) which multicast groups they want to\n   receive.\n
    \  These messages are sent repeatedly up to maximum number of times\n   determined
    by the 'Robustness Variable' setting. However, in certain\n   situations, those
    messages could get lost.\n   This draft proposes a mechanism whereby host devices
    attached to a\n   local area network where the querier and the DR are the same
    device,\n   can request the querier to acknowledge each report message it\n   receives,
    ensuring report messages reception by the DR.\n\n\t "

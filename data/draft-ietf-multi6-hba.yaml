  content: "   This memo describes a mechanism to provide a secure binding between\n
    \  the multiple addresses with different prefixes available to a host\n   within
    a multihomed site.  The main idea is that information about\n   the multiple prefixes
    is included within the addresses themselves.\n   This is achieved by generating
    the interface identifiers of the\n   addresses of a host as hashes of the available
    prefixes and a random\n   number.  Then, the multiple addresses are generated
    by prepending the\n   different prefixes to the generated interface identifiers.
    \ The\n   result is a set of addresses, called Hash Based Addresses (HBAs),\n
    \  that are inherently bound.\n\t "

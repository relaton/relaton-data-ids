  content: "   This document describes an approach to how Domain Name Protocol (DNS)\n
    \  should be carried over IPv6.  There have been some operational issues\n   identified
    in carrying DNS packets over IPv6 and this draft proposes\n   solutions to address
    them.  A summary of what is proposed is to limit\n   IPv6 DNS responses over UDP
    to be 1280 octets and use TCP or QUIC for\n   anything larger.\n\n\t "

  content: "IPsec is specified as the means of securing signaling messages between
    the Mobile Node and Home Agent for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6).  MIPv6 signaling messages
    that are secured include the Binding Updates and Acknowledgement messages used
    for managing the bindings between a Mobile Node and its Home Agent.  This document
    proposes an alternate method for securing MIPv6 signaling messages between Mobile
    Nodes and Home Agents.  The alternate method defined here consists of a MIPv6-specific
    mobility message authentication option that can be added to MIPv6 signaling messages.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

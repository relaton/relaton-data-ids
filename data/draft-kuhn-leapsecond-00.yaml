  script: Latn
  content: "   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the international standard\n   timescale
    used in many Internet protocols.  UTC features occasional\n   single-second adjustments,
    known as \"leap seconds\".  These happen at\n   the end of announced UTC days,
    in the form of either an extra second\n   23:59:60 or a missing second 23:59:59.
    \ Both events need special\n   consideration in UTC-synchronized systems that
    represent time as a\n   scalar value.  This specification defines UTC-SLS, a minor
    variation\n   of UTC that lacks leap seconds.  Instead, UTC-SLS performs an\n
    \  equivalent \"smooth\" adjustment, during which the rate of the clock\n   temporarily
    changes by 0.1% for 1000 seconds.  UTC-SLS is a drop-in\n   replacement for UTC.
    \ UTC-SLS can be generated from the same\n   information as UTC.  It can be used
    with any specification that\n   refers to UTC but lacks provisions for leap seconds.
    \ UTC-SLS\n   provides a robust and interoperable way for networked UTC-\n   synchronized
    clocks to handle leap seconds.  By providing UTC-SLS\n   instead of UTC to applications,
    operating systems can free most\n   application and protocol designers from any
    need to even know about\n   UTC leap seconds.\n\t "

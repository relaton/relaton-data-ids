  content: "There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systems\nwithin
    the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway\nProtocol [BGP],
    which is used to provide routing information between\nautonomous systems. This
    draft addresses various deployment scenarios\nand options using the extensions
    to BGP outlined in [SOBGP-BGP] in\nconjunction with [SOBGP-KEY] (which is not
    yet completed or\npublished) and [SOBGP-RADIUS]. Each section of this draft discusses
    a\ndifferent deployment situation or deployment option. The final\nsection discusses
    how private key rollovers can be accomplished with\nno loss of routing information
    within soBGP deployments.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a framework for the PSAMP (Packet SAMPling) protocol.
    \ The functions of this protocol are to select packets from a stream according
    to a set of standardized Selectors, to form a stream of reports on the selected
    packets, and to export the reports to a Collector.  This framework details the
    components of this architecture, then describes some generic requirements, motivated
    by the dual aims of ubiquitous deployment and utility of the reports for applications.
    \ Detailed requirements for selection, reporting, and exporting are described,
    along with configuration requirements of the PSAMP functions.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   This use case document provides requirements for moving Content\n   Distribution
    Networks (CDNs) from physical servers to a virtualized\n   environment. This new
    kind of CDN, known as virtualized CDN (vCDN),\n   allows for new constructs that
    simplify the CDN architecture. The\n   main elements of the CDN are analyzed with
    regards to the degree of\n   elasticity demanded from them in terms of computation,
    storage and\n   network resources.\n\n   This use case document provides resiliency
    requirements for\n   virtualization of the Content Distribution Network, known
    as\n   virtualized CDN (vCDN).\n\n\t "

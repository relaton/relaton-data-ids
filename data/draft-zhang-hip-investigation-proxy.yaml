  content: "HIP proxies play an important role in the transition from the \ncurrent
    Internet architecture to the HIP architecture. A core \nobjective of a HIP proxy
    is to facilitate the communications between \nlegacy (or Non-HIP) hosts and HIP
    hosts while not modifying their \nprotocol stacks. In this document, the legacy
    hosts served by \nproxies are referred to as the Made-up Legacy (ML) hosts. Currently,
    \nvarious designing solutions of HIP proxies have been proposed. These \nsolutions
    may be applicable in different working circumstances. In \nthis document, we attempt
    to investigate these solutions in detail \nand compare their performances in different
    scenarios.\n\t "

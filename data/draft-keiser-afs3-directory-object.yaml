  content: "   Directory lookups in the AFS-3 distributed file system are supported\n
    \  by defining a canonical encoding for a directory object, and\n   transmitting
    all--or part--of that object from a file server to its\n   clients so that clients
    may resolve paths into AFS file IDs (FIDs).\n   This memo describes the AFS-3
    directory object wire encoding.\n\nInternet Draft Comments\n\n   Comments regarding
    this draft are solicited.  Please include the\n   AFS-3 protocol standardization
    mailing list\n   (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.\n\n\t "

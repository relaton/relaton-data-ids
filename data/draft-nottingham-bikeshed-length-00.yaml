abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The HTTP Content-Length header field is overloaded with (at least)\n
    \  two duties: message delimitation in HTTP/1, and metadata about the\n   length
    of an incoming request body to the software handling it.\n\n   This causes confusion,
    and sometimes problems.  This document\n   proposes a new header to untangle these
    semantics (at least\n   partially).\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by\n
    \  Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text\n   passwords
    over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n   There are some
    significant security concerns with that mechanism,\n   which could be addressed
    by the use of a challenge response\n   authentication mechanism protected by TLS.
    \ Unfortunately, the HTTP\n   Digest challenge response mechanism presently on
    the standards track\n   failed widespread deployment, and have had success only
    in limited\n   use.\n\n   This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication\n
    \  mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication\n   Mechanism
    (SCRAM), which addresses the security concerns and meets\n   the deployability
    requirements.  When used in combination with TLS or\n   an equivalent security
    layer, a mechanism from this family could\n   improve the status-quo for application
    protocol authentication.\n\n\t "

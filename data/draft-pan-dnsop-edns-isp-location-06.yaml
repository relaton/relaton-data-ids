  content: "   Nowadays, many authoritative servers support GeoIP feature, they\n
    \  guess the client's geolocation by the client subnet of EDNS Client\n   Subnet
    (ECS) or by the source IP address of DNS query, return tailor\n   DNS response
    based on the client's geolocation.  However, ECS raises\n   some privacy concerns
    because it leaks client subnet information on\n   the resolution path to the authoritative
    server.\n\n   This document describes an improved GeoIP solution, defines an EDNS\n
    \  ISP Location (EIL) extension to address the privacy problem of ECS,\n   tries
    to find the right balance between privacy improvement and user\n   experience
    optimization.\n\n   EIL is defined to convey isp location < COUNTRY, AREA, ISP
    >\n   information that is relevant to the DNS message.  It will directly\n   provide
    sufficient information for the GeoIP-enabled authoritative\n   server as ECS,
    decide the response without guessing client's\n   geolocation.\n\n\t "

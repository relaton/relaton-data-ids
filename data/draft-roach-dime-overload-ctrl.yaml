- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be\n
    \  able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to\n   reduce
    or stop sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise,\n   it must continue
    to expend resources parsing and responding to\n   Diameter messages.\n\n   This
    document proposes a concrete, application-independent mechanism\n   to address
    the challenge of communicating load and overload state\n   among Diameter peers,
    and specifies an algorithm for load abatement\n   to address such overload conditions
    as they occur.  The load\n   abatement algorithm is extensible, allowing for future
    documents to\n   define additional load abatement approaches.\n\n\t "

  content: "Priority telecommunication capabilities are required to \nsupport critical
    emergency communications through the public \ntelecommunications infrastructure
    to support disaster recovery \noperations for saving lives and restoring community
    infrastructure. \nMany important issues are identified that are essential to ensuring
    \neffective emergency telecommunications capabilities are established in \nInternet-based
    infrastructures. The term 'communication session' is used \ninstead of 'call'
    so that all modes of communication can be considered \ncollectively; emergency
    telecommunication capabilities are not just \nlimited to telephony traffic. No
    solutions are suggested, but the \nbasic requirements are clearly identified for
    consideration by the \nieprep Working Group of the IETF.\n\n\t "

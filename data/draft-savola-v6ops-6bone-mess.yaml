  content: "Currently, IPv6 Internet is, globally considered, inseparable from\nthe
    6bone network.  The 6bone has been built as a tighly meshed\ntunneled topology.
    \ As the number of participants has grown, it has\nbecome an untangible mess,
    hindering the real deployment of IPv6 due\nto low quality of connections.  This
    memo discusses the nature and\nthe state of 6bone/IPv6 Internet, points out problems
    and outlines a\nfew ways to start fixing them; also, some rough operational\nguidelines
    for different-sized organizations are presented.  The most\nimportant issues are:
    not offering transit to everyone and real\ntransit operators being needed to take
    a more active role.\n\t "

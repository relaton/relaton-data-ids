  content: "   Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKEv2 for securing the signaling\n
    \  and user traffic.  A single security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 does\n   not
    adequately address various deployment scenarios.  The one-size-\n   fits-all security
    approach is ill suited for Mobile IPv6, as\n   different deployments have different
    security requirements.  Multiple\n   alternatives to securing signaling and user
    traffic have been\n   proposed and are being considered for standardization.  When
    multiple\n   security protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6\n
    \  nodes, there is a need to negotiate the choice of security protocol\n   between
    a mobile node and home agent a priori.  This document\n   proposes a method for
    negotiating the security protocol to be used\n   between mobile IPv6 nodes.\n\n\t "

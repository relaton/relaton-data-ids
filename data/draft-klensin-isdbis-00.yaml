- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The current IETF standard-track maturity level definitions, including\nthe
    assumption that most specification of successful protocols would\nadvance rapidly
    to Internet Standard, the never-used automatic\nexpiration mechanism, and the
    STD nnnn designation, have not worked\nwell.  Users of IETF Standards have found
    it difficult to determine\nwhat standards were associated with others in groups,
    the actual\nstatus of specifications within a related group, and the level of\ninteroperability
    testing and deployment and use for any given\nstandard or set of features.  The
    community has rarely used the\n\"requirement level\" mechanism in recent years.
    \ There is now an\nerrata mechanism for published RFCs, but the errata lists do
    not\nprovide authoritative, consensus-based, corrections to standards-\ntrack
    documents.  This document suggests that all of those issues are\nsymptoms of a
    single system of interrelated issues and problems and\nproposes an integrated
    solution.\n\t "

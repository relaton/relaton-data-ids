  content: "   Virtual dial-up allows many separate and autonomous protocol domains\n
    \  to share common access infrastructure including modems, Access\n   Servers,
    and ISDN routers.  Previous RFCs have specified protocols\n   for supporting IP
    dial-up via SLIP [1] and multiprotocol dial-up via\n   PPP [2].  This document
    describes the Layer Two Forwarding protocol\n   (L2F) which permits the tunneling
    of the link layer (i.e., HDLC,\n   async HDLC, or SLIP frames) of higher level
    protocols.  Using such\n   tunnels, it is possible to divorce the location of
    the initial dial-\n   up server from the location at which the dial-up protocol
    connection\n   is terminated and access to the network provided.\n\t "

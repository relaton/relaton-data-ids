  content: "   The authors are developing COAP and IPv6-based sensor networks for\n
    \  environments where lightweight implementations, long battery\n   lifetimes,
    and minimal management burden are important.  The memo\n   shows how different
    communication models supported by COAP affect\n   implementation complexity and
    energy consumption, far more so than\n   mere changes in message syntax.  Our
    prototype implements a\n   multicast-based IPv6, UDP, COAP, and XML protocol stack
    in less than\n   50 assembler instructions.  While this extremely minimal\n   implementation
    is suitable only for limited applications and makes a\n   number of assumptions,
    the general conclusions point to need for\n   further work in developing the COAP
    multicast and observation\n   frameworks.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft describes how a Virtual Private LAN (VPL) can be realized\nby
    setting up point-to-point tunnels from CE (Customer Edge) or CLE\n(Customer Located
    Equipment) to CE/CLE over a PSN, and bridging\nEthernet traffic at the CE/CLE.
    Regardless of the access technology\nused (e.g. DSL or Ethernet) or the geographic
    distribution of\nCEs/CLEs, an end customer may use an emulated LAN service via
    an\nEthernet interface, as long as the CEs/CLEs of the emulated LAN are\nreachable
    over the PSN.  When used in conjunction with IPSec, the\nproposal allows secure
    transmission of Ethernet traffic, from one\nsite to another site of a VPL, over
    the PSN.\n\n\t "

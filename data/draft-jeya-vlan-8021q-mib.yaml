  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular
    it describes objects used for managing bridges based on the IEEE 802.1q draft
    standard between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.      This memo uses SNMPv2
    as the basis for defining VLAN MIB, and refers to other MIBs whose published definitions
    use SNMPv2 convention\n\t "

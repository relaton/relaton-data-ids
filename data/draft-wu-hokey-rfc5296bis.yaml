  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework\nsupporting
    multiple types of authentication methods.  In systems\nwhere EAP is used for authentication,
    it is desirable to not repeat\nthe entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.
    \ This document\nspecifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support\nan
    EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication\nbetween the peer
    and an EAP re-authentication server through any\nauthenticator.  The re-authentication
    server may be in the home\nnetwork or in the local network to which the peer is
    connecting.\n\t "

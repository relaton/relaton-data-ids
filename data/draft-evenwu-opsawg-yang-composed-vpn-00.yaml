  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used by a network\n
    \  operator to configure a VPN service at one layer interconnecting VPN\n   service
    at another layer and manage how a hybrid VPN service is\n   engineered in the
    network [RFC8309].  This model is intended to be\n   instantiated at the management
    system to deliver the overall service.\n   It is not a configuration model to
    be used directly on network\n   elements.  This model provides an abstracted view
    of VPN service\n   configuration components at different layer.  It is up to a\n
    \  management system to take this as an input and generate specific\n   configurations
    models to configure the different network elements to\n   deliver the service.
    \ How configuration of network elements is done\n   is out of scope of the document.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In order to reduce unwanted traffic and make efficient use of limited\n
    \  access link capacity or other network resources, it is advantageous\n   to
    filter traffic upstream of the end-networks that the packets are\n   destined
    to.  This document describes filtering within access\n   Internet Service Provider
    (ISP) networks.  The ISP's end-network\n   customers are given control over ISP
    filtering of traffic destined to\n   their own prefixes, since each customer's
    definition of desirable\n   versus undesirable traffic may change over time (e.g.
    as new network\n   services and protocols are introduced).  In this document,
    we\n   describe an SDN-based means for customers to express flow definitions\n
    \  to their ISPs in order to distinguish between desirable and\n   undesirable
    inbound traffic.  These rules can be dynamically and\n   securely updated within
    the running ISP network, with full automation\n   One use case for this capability
    is in mitigating denial of service\n   attacks.  Even if such filtering is only
    implemented in an ISP's\n   access network, it preserves capacity on the customer
    access links\n   for desirable traffic.  If implemented at the ISP's edge connections\n
    \  to other providers, or prior to ingress to their core, it can also\n   preserve
    the ISP's own network capacity and other resources that may\n   be threatened
    by attacks.\n\n\t "

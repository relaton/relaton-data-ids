  content: "From a viewpoint of a layer architecture, a network layer should \nfeature
    a mobility support. Then the users can enjoy their mobility \nwhatever data-link
    devices and user applications they use. \nMobile IP has been proposed for a solution
    to provide IP-layer \nhandoffs between subnets served by different Foreign Agents.
    However, \nit still suffers an interruption of the communications for real-time
    \napplications.\n\t "

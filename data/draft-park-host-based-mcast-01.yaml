  content: "This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing\narchitecture
    of the IPv6 protocol.  The extension allows for sing\ninterface-ID to allocate
    multicast addresses.  When the link-local\nunicast address is configured at each
    interface of host, interface\nID is uniquely determined.  By delegating multicast
    addresses at\nthe same time as interface ID, each host can identify their\nmulticast
    addresses automatically at Layer 1 without needing to run\nan intra- or inter-domain
    allocation protocol in the serverless\nenvironments.\n\t "

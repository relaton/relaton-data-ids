  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver
    a\n   Layer 3 Provider Provisioned VPN service.  The document is limited to\n
    \  the BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFC4110 and RFC4364.  This\n   model
    is intended to be instantiated at management system to deliver\n   the overall
    service.  This model is not a configuration model to be\n   used directly on network
    elements.  This model provides an abstracted\n   view of the Layer 3 IPVPN service
    configuration components.  It will\n   be up to a management system to take this
    as an input and use\n   specific configurations models to configure the different
    network\n   elements to deliver the service.  How configuration of network\n   elements
    is done is out of scope of the document.\n\n\n\t "

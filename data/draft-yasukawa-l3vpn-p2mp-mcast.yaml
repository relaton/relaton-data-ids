  content: "This document describes a solution framework for IP Multicast\n   VPNs.
    It describes procedures for establishing optimal virtual\n   private IP multicast
    networks over a provider network. The simple\n   multicast tunnel operation mechanism
    within a core network provides\n   easy and flexible IP multicast VPN service
    operation for the\n   service provider. And because the solution can minimize
    PIM\n   neighbor maintenance over remote PEs, the solution enhances the\n   scalability
    performance of the multicast VPN service network. This\n   document also describes
    a P2MP TE LSP based multicast tunnel\n   mechanism which could enhance TE capability
    and reliability of IP\n   multicast VPNs.\n\t "

  content: "   Future communication networks will be based more and more on a\n   dynamically
    changing network topology.  Therefore it is advantageous,\n   to have routing
    mechanisms, which will dynamically adapt their\n   routing decisions to these
    topology changes.  This document describes\n   a set of network protocols, which
    realize such a dynamical routing of\n   unicast and multicast packets within communication
    networks based on\n   IPv6.  All used routing algorithms will be immediately executed
    at\n   the occurrence of any topology changes and will therefore have\n   already
    complete routing information at the receipt of data packets.\n \n   For the unicasting
    the Shortest Path First (SPF) routing algorithm\n   has be chosen.  This algorithm
    calculates the shortest, and therefore\n   the optimal routing paths within the
    routing area, by which it is\n   sufficient for a router, to compute a single
    routing tree for the\n   whole area.\n \n   For the multicasting the Minimum Spanning
    Tree (MST) routing\n   algorithm has been chosen.  This distributed algorithm
    prevents the\n   occurrence of endless routing loops, offers for distributed Address\n
    \  Groups nearly optimal results in saving network bandwidth, and needs\n   also
    only a single routing tree for the whole area. This version 02\n   of the draft
    mainly corrects some minor errors of version 01.\n\t "

  content: "   This document formalizes a profile and a framework for the use of\n
    \  delegate certificates and authority tokens to strengthen the\n   association
    between telephone number assignments and the entities\n   that have the authoritative
    right to use them on the telephone\n   network.  It defines a model in which the
    TNAuthList Authority Token\n   serves as a trusted representation of telephone
    number assignment and\n   right-to-use (RTU), anchored by a Notary Agent that
    logs these\n   associations through verifiable transparency mechanisms.  The\n
    \  framework also extends the use of authority tokens to support other\n   PASSporT
    claims like Rich Call Data (RCD) by defining a role for\n   JWTClaimConstraints
    Authority Tokens.  These tokens are issued by\n   authoritative or recognized
    and vetted claim agents within the\n   ecosystem to assert information associated
    with the entity assigned a\n   telephone number.  The Notary Agent plays a critical
    role in\n   recording these claims and their provenance, enhancing transparency\n
    \  and accountability.  Delegate certificates encapsulate and\n   incorporate
    both the telephone number and associated information\n   validated via authority
    tokens to the certification authority issuing\n   them, binding them to the authenticated
    telephone number of the\n   calling party.  These certificates are published to
    a certificate\n   transparency log, enabling relying parties to independently
    verify\n   the integrity and legitimacy of number use and related claims.  The\n
    \  VESPER (Verifiable STI PERsona) approach utilizes STIR protocols and\n   the
    ACME authority token to formalizing a verifiable, auditable, and\n   privacy-conscious
    foundation for associating telephone numbers with\n   identifiable entities and
    assertion of associated metadata.\n\n\t "

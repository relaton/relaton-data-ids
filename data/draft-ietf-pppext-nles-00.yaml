  script: Latn
  content: "With the introduction of xDSL services into public  telecommunications
    networks, direct access (in contrast to dial-up access) will start to be used
    as an access method for data  as  well  as  other services.   PPP  has been very
    successful in providing connections for IP as well as other protocols in the dial-up
    \ access  network. With  the advent of direct access, changes will be need to
    be made for identifying the target hosts, as it will no longer be possible to
    rely on the telephone number that is dialed prior to initiating the PPP session.
    \ This proposal indicates one method for  adapting PPP to the new requirements.\n\t "

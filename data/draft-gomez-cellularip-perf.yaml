  content: "Cellular IP specifies a protocol that allows routing IP datagrams to\na
    mobile host. The protocol is intended to provide local mobility and\nhandoff support.
    It can interwork with Mobile IP [1] to provide wide\narea mobility support. This
    I-D provides performance results based on\nthe implementation and analysis of
    Cellular IP as defined by draft\ndraft-valko-cellularip-01.txt [2]. The evaluation
    is focused on\nhandoff performance, optimum active-state-timeout choice and\nscalability
    issues. The Cellular IP source code used for the\nexperimental results presented
    in this Internet-Draft is freely\navailable from comet.columbia.edu/cellularip.\n\t "

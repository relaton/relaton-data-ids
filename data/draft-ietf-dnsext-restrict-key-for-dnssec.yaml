  content: "This document limits the Domain Name System (DNS) KEY Resource Record
    (RR) to only keys used by the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).
    \ The original KEY RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC keys and arbitrary
    application keys.  Storing both DNSSEC and application keys with the same record
    type is a mistake.  This document removes application keys from the KEY record
    by redefining the Protocol Octet field in the KEY RR Data.  As a result of removing
    application keys, all but one of the flags in the KEY record become unnecessary
    and are redefined.  Three existing application key sub-types are changed to reserved,
    but the format of the KEY record is not changed.  This document updates RFC 2535.

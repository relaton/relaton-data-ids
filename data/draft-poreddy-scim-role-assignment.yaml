  content: "   SCIM 2.0 defines \"roles\" and \"entitlements\" attributes on the User\n
    \  resource, but it lacks a standardized way to bind roles to specific\n   scopes
    such as projects, tenants, or groups.  This gap forces\n   organizations to rely
    on group sprawl or non-standard encodings,\n   preventing true interoperability.
    \ This document introduces a new\n   SCIM resource type, RoleAssignment, which
    models scoped role bindings\n   as first-class records, enabling portable provisioning,
    lifecycle\n   governance, and compliance visibility.\n\n\t "

  content: "We propose an extension to RSVP-TE for setting up and maintaining \nBi-directional
    Optical Switched Paths (BOSPs) in optical networks \nwith symmetric traffic patterns.
    The requirement for wavelength \ncontinuity for some types of optical networks
    with no (or partial) \nwavelength conversion is also supported. It follows the
    framework \nof MPLS and extends the RSVP-TE to support the signaling for the \nprovisioning
    of BOSPs. We introduce a new c-types for bi-directional\nLSPs in both Label Request
    object and Label object. Each LSR (OXC), \nupon receiving an RESV message for
    a BOSP, will allocate a pair of \nlabels. One label is for the incoming port from
    the next hop and \nthe other is for the incoming port from the previous hop. The
    labels\nhere include fiber ID, wavelength ID and sub-channel ID (if \napplicable).
    This extension requires a minimum change to the \nexisting RSVP-TE protocol. It
    avoids the problem of contention where\ntwo OXCs assign the same wavelength on
    a uni-directional link for \ntwo different sessions. This contention arises in
    both [4] and [5].\nAs a result, no additional mechanism  for contention resolution
    is \nneeded.\n\t "

  content: "   The Magic Mathematical Mesh 'the Mesh' is a security infrastructure\n
    \  for the Internet that puts individual users in control of their\n   security.
    Through large scale redundancy and replication techniques,\n   mesh users have
    a high level of assurance that data stored in the\n   mesh through a mesh gateway
    node will be available at a later date.\n\n   The mesh does not offer confidentiality
    guarantees. All data in the\n   mesh is assumed to be public. Confidential data
    stored in the mesh\n   must be protected using strong encryption. The mesh provides
    a medium\n   that enables the exchange of private key data but never passes\n
    \  private data of any form in plaintext form.\n\n   The mesh enables use of end-to-end
    and transport security with mutual\n   authentication in a wide range of client
    server and peer-peer\n   applications. These include email, remote access and
    the Web. Unlike\n   previous attempts to establish such infrastructures, the password\n
    \  management application supported by the mesh delivers users with an\n   immediate
    benefit that does not rely on adoption by others.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document, while sharing a similar concept, is an overhaul of \nTRACE-00
    and describes a strategy for domain name server operators to \nprepare and transition
    their services for multilingual domain names \n(IDN – Internationalized Domain
    Names). \nThe TRACE-01 or IDNX (IDN Transition) approach accepts that users \nwith
    non-IDN aware applications will be attempting to access \nmultilingual domain
    names.  Hence it is the registry or domain \noperator's responsibility to provide
    an IDN solution that resolves \nthese issues to make it a seamless transition
    experience for \ntechnically unsophisticated users. \nIn essence, the IDNX approach
    embraces a complementary server-side \nimplementation to smooth the transition.
    \ IDNX ready domain servers \nshould be backward compatible, and successfully
    resolve IDN requests \nsent via non-IDN aware applications, whether they are formatted
    in \nlocal encoding, UTF-8 or an identifiable variant; as well as forward \ncompatible,
    and be able to resolve ACE requests.\n\t "

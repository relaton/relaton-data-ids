  content: "The purpose of this draft is to provide a method to detect \nexploitation
    of inherent vulnerabilities in the Neighbor Discovery \nprocesses.\n\nThere are
    two well documented vulnerabilities in the basic IPv6 \narchitecture: Neighbor
    Discover spoofing and Host Redirection.  \nThere already exists the SeND RFC [send]
    that addresses \nauthenticating these interactions. Certain networks may choose
    not \nto uses (or cannot use) SeND, for instance, networks that use DHCP \nor
    statically assigned addresses.\n\nThere is an underlying security principle that
    says, \"If you can \nblock a attack do it. If you cannot block it, detect it.
    \ Even if \nyou can block it, detect it.\" This proposal outlines simple \nmodifications
    to the basic protocols to allow for easily detecting \nthese attacks. Through
    proactive systems, once an attack is \ndetected it could easily provide blocking
    by isolating the \nattacking host via Access Control Lists (ACLs) or disabling
    ports.\n\nThe basic method proposed is to force packets used in these attacks
    \nto be multicast to the attacked nodes Solicited Node Multicast \ngroup, thus
    allowing a security device to detect when it is \noccurring.\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses some of the issues posed by firewalls and \n   other
    intermediaries to deployment of some basic IETF technologies.   \n    \n   The
    intent of this document is to track such issues, explore possible \n   approaches
    elegant or not that have been proposed so far to address \n   them and initiate
    discussion on how such issues should be \n   appropriately addressed by IETF.
    \n    \n   This first version 00 is provided to initiate discussion. Most of the
    \n   content should be considered as initial place holders.\n\t "

  content: "The forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) working group is
    \ndefining a protocol by which control elements (CEs) can communicate with \nforwarding
    elements (FEs) and control the behaviors of FEs. It is well \nknown that ForCES
    based solutions have good scalability. Therefore, it \nmakes sense to adopt ForCES
    to better integrate existing physical \nrouters with ForCES routers. Plus, someone
    may want going forward to be \nable to use the developed hardware and software
    from existing routers as \na part of ForCES based solutions.  \n\nThis draft presents
    a framework in which some possible migration \nsolutions are discussed in details
    and some security implications are \nconsidered.     \n\t "

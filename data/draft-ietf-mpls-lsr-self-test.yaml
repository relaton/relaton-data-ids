  content: "This document defines a means for a Label-Switching Router (LSR)\n      to
    verify that its data plane is functioning for certain key\n      Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) applications, including\n      unicast forwarding and traffic
    engineering tunnels.  A new\n      Loopback FEC type is defined to allow an upstream
    neighbor to\n      assist in the testing at very low cost.  MPLS Verification
    Request\n      and MPLS Verification Reply messages are defined to do the actual\n
    \     probing.\n\t "

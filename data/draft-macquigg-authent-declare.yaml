  content: "A key item that must be standardized to allow interoperation of \n   different
    email authentication methods is the ID declaration.  \n   Current authentication
    methods assume that one or another of the \n   existing fields in a mail transfer
    can be used as the Identity to be \n   verified.  Since there is no way to tell
    which field, if any, the \n   sender is prepared to authenticate, extra DNS queries
    must be made, \n   in the worst-case, testing all possibilities just to find no
    \n   authentication is offered at all.  This draft proposes a neutral \n   syntax
    that can be used by all methods.\n\t "

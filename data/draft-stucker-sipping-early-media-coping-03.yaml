  content: "   Several mechanisms for early media have been proposed in the past,\n
    \  each attacking a different aspect of the problem.  A good example of\n   this
    is RFC-3960 which talks about two models of early media: the\n   gateway model,
    and the application model.  The gateway model uses a\n   series of offer/answer
    exchanges to control the rendering of early\n   media, but breaks down in the
    presence of forking (as mentioned in\n   section 3 of RFC-3960).  The application
    model relies on the UAS to\n   know when it is generating early media and use
    RFC-3959 to keep early\n\n   media and regular media streams separate to avoid
    clipping.  Even in\n   the presence of the recommendations in RFC-3960 some problems
    exist\n   within SIP in the area of early media.  Although some of these\n   challenges
    are likely to never be overcome, for example when\n   interworking with a PSTN
    gateway that does not take into account CPG\n   or ACM messages (in the case of
    ISUP).  However, the potential to\n   improve on what is already there does exist.
    \ This document attempts\n   to go into more detail around early media where RFC-3960
    left off,\n   what sorts of mechanisms are in use today in existing implementations\n
    \  to deal with the challenges at hand, derives requirements and a\n   possible
    mechanism to improve upon the current model.  In addition,\n   the document goes
    into other areas that can complicate or be\n   complicated by the presence of
    early media (especially with forking)\n   such as SRTP keying and media flow authorization.\n\n\t "

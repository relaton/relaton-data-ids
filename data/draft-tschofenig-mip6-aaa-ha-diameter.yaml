  content: "   Both Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solutions require use of a AAA\n   interface.
    \ In the split scenario, this interface is between the Home\n   Agent and the
    AAA infrastructure of the Mobile Service Provider (MSP)\n   and the Mobility Service
    Authorizer (MSA).  The first interface\n   should meet a list of requirements.
    \ This document provides an\n   overview of the capabilities and design of the
    Diameter protocol that\n   could meet the specified goals.  In the integrated
    scenario, in\n   addition to this interface, the impact of the MIPv6 bootstrapping
    on\n   the AAA interface for network access authentication must be\n   considered.
    \ Basically, this interface is also used to carry Home\n   Agent information.
    \ This document defines the necessary AVP and how\n   Diameter can be used in
    the integrated scenario.\n\t "

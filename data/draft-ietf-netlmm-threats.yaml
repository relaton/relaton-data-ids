  content: "This document discusses security threats to network-based localized mobility
    management.  Threats may occur on two interfaces: the interface between a localized
    mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway, as well as the interface between
    a mobile access gateway and a mobile node.  Threats to the former interface impact
    the localized mobility management protocol itself.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

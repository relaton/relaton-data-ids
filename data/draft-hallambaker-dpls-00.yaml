abstract:
- content: "<p>A mechanism for encrypting and authenticating communication between
    a DNS Client and server is presented. The mechanism is designed to compliment
    use of DNSSEC in the case where DNSSEC validation is performed at the resolver
    and it is not desirable to repeat validation at the server.</p>"

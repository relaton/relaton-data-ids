  content: "A common problem for sensitive web services is informing the client,\nin
    a reliable fashion, when a password protected resource is no\nlonger valid because
    the user is logged out of the service.  This is,\nin particular, considered a
    potential security problem by some\nsensitive services, such as online banking,
    when the user navigates\nthe client's history list, which is supposed to display
    the resource\nas it was when it was loaded, not as it is at some later point in\ntime.\n\nThis
    document presents a method for collecting such sensitive\nresources into a group,
    called a \"Cache Context\", which permits the\nserver to invalidate all the resources
    belonging in the group either\nby direct action, or according to some expiration
    policy.  The\ncontext can be configured to invalidate not just the resources,
    but\nalso specific cookies, HTTP authentication credentials and HTTP over\nTLS
    session information.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the use of end-to-end (inner) and hop-by-hop\n
    \  (outer) cryptographic transforms within the Secure Real-time\n   Transport
    Protocol (SRTP).  The motivation is to support use cases\n   when two or more
    end-points communicate via one (or more) cloud\n   service (e.g. virtualized cloud-based
    conferencing) that are not\n   trusted to access the media content.  One of the
    main aspects of the\n   transform is to make the confidentiality and message authentication\n
    \  independent of the RTP header.  Another central aspect is to enable\n   identification
    of the cryptographic context (keys etc.).  Besides the\n   security of the end-points,
    also trust assumptions regarding the\n   cloud services are addressed.\n\n\t "

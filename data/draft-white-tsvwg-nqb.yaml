  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft proposes the definition of a standardized DiffServ code\n
    \  point (DSCP) to identify Non-Queue-Building flows (for example:\n   interactive
    voice and video, gaming, machine to machine\n   applications), along with a Per-Hop-Behavior
    (PHB) that provides a\n   separate queue for such flows.\n\n   The purpose of
    such a marking scheme is to enable networks to provide\n   and utilize queues
    that are optimized to provide low latency and low\n   loss for such Non-Queue-Building
    flows (e.g. shallow buffers,\n   optimized media access parameters, etc.).\n\n
    \  This marking scheme and PHB has been developed primarily for use by\n   access
    network segments, where queuing delays and queuing loss caused\n   by Queue-Building
    protocols are manifested.  In particular,\n   applications to cable broadband
    links and mobile network radio and\n   core segments are discussed.\n\n\t "

  content: " Label-distribution protocol (LDP) is defined in [1] for the distribution
    of labels inside one MPLS domain. CR-LDP is defined in [2] to work in conjunction
    with the LDP for establishing label switched paths with prescribed QoS requirements.
    The establishment of those paths is called constraint-based routing (CR) and it
    offers the opportunity to extend the information used to setup paths beyond what
    is available for the routing protocol.\n\n\n     To facilitate the establishment
    of CR paths, the CR-LDP specification\n     include the essential entries (TLVs)
    to allow the characterization of the\n     traffic requirements and service expectations.
    The objectives of this\n     draft are to establish a general framework for service
    definition using\n     the mechanisms specified in [2] and to illustrate how service
    interworking\n     could be achieved between an MPLS domain using CR-LDP and other
    domains\n     that might employ similar or different networking technologies.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Mobile IP Working Group has been working on defining its AAA\nrequirements,
    which currently supports a Key Distribution Center\n(KDC) model that issues temporary
    session keys for use between the\nmobility nodes. In order to support real-time
    traffic, the Mobile IP\narchitecture also requires that hand-off be done in a
    quick and\nefficient manner, and has provisions to allow new foreign agents to\nretrieve
    the session keys from the AAA infrastructure.\n\t "

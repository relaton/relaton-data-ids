  content: "   Auto-derived identifiers are used by applications to enable zero\n
    \  configuration features.  Such identifiers are often a combination of\n   primitive
    identifiers and are thus longer.  In addition, existing\n   identifiers have grown
    longer.  IP addresses have grown from 4 octets\n   to 16.  AS numbers have grown
    from 2 octets to 4.  In order to\n   accommodate such longer identifiers in BGP
    extended communities, this\n   document defines a new BGP path attribute, the
    Extra Extended\n   Communities attribute.  It is similar to the Extended Community,
    but\n   is 24 octets long.  Communities are mostly used within ASes under a\n
    \  single administration or between neighboring ASes.  Limiting the\n   spread
    of communities beyond their intended reach and polluting the\n   internet at large
    is complex and error prone.  To simplify this,\n   enhanced transitivity options
    are provided.\n\n\n\t "

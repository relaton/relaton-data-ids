- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 9370 specifies a framework that supports mulitple key\n   encapsulation
    mechanisms (KEMs) in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol\n   Version 2 (IKEv2)
    by allowing up to 7 layers of additiona KEMs\n   employed with the oringal ECDH
    to derive the final shared secret keys\n   for IPsec protocols.  The primitive
    goal is to mitigate the security\n   threat against quantum computers by hybriding
    additional post-quantum\n   (PQ) KEMs with the orinigal ECDH key exchange.  This
    draft specifies\n   how one QP KEMs, FrodoKEM, is instantiated in the IKEv2 as
    the\n   additional KEMs with the main ECDH to achieve hybrid key agreement.\n\n
    \  [EDNOTE: IANA KE code points for FrodoKEM may need to be assigned, as\n   the
    code points for ML-KEM has been considered in [I-D.D24]. ]\n\n\t "

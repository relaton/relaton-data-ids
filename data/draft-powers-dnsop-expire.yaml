  content: "   This document defines a new DNS message opcode, EXPIRE, which enables\n
    \  an authenticated authoritative operator to request immediate deletion\n   of
    a specific RRset from a resolver's cache.  EXPIRE messages may be\n   authenticated
    either through DNSSEC signatures or through resolver\n   control-channel authentication
    (for example TSIG, mutually\n   authenticated TLS, IPsec, or local trust policy).
    \ EXPIRE applies\n   only to resolver cache and MUST NOT modify authoritative
    data.\n\n   Resolvers validate authority, apply mandatory replay protection using\n
    \  SOA serials when available or equivalent replay-mitigation\n   mechanisms,
    and flush the targeted RRset upon successful validation.\n   EXPIRE provides a
    deterministic, authenticated mechanism for cache\n   rollback and correction across
    both signed (DNSSEC) and unsigned\n   (internal) DNS deployments.\n\n\t "

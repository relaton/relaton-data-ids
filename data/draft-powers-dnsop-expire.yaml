abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new DNS message opcode, EXPIRE, which enables
    an authenticated authoritative operator to request immediate deletion of a specific
    RRset from a resolver's cache. EXPIRE messages may be authenticated either through
    DNSSEC signatures or through resolver control-channel authentication (for example
    TSIG, mutually authenticated TLS, IPsec, or local trust policy). EXPIRE applies
    only to resolver cache and MUST NOT modify authoritative data. Resolvers validate
    authority, apply mandatory replay protection using SOA serials when available
    or equivalent replay-mitigation mechanisms, and flush the targeted RRset upon
    successful validation. EXPIRE provides a deterministic, authenticated mechanism
    for cache rollback and correction across both signed (DNSSEC) and unsigned (internal)
    DNS deployments.</p>"

  content: "   In the networks where multihomed hosts can have ULA and GUA addresses\n
    \  from different ISPs, multiple SIP signaling and media connectivity\n   issues
    might arise due to inappropriate address selections. Some of\n   the problems
    are described in [RFC5220]. Since SIP and SDP allow IP\n   addresses to be embedded
    into their headers and lines, even if proper\n   addresses are selected initially,
    SIP is not equipped with the\n   mechanisms to respond to network events, and
    transition transport to\n   reachable addresses. As a result, SIP messages and
    media might be\n   filtered by routers, or discarded as unreachable destinations.\n\n
    \  SIP protocol (RFC 3261) defines signaling messages and their headers.\n   This
    document describes how a multihomed host should select addresses\n   for SIP headers,
    like Contact and Via, to be reachable destinations.\n   Host SHOULD change a default
    router for uplink failures, remove\n   prefixes and addresses for unreachable
    ISP, and update contact\n   address list.\n\n   SDP protocol (RFC 3264) defines
    how participants in a session select\n   their parameters. This document describes
    how an offerer and answerer\n   on multihomed hosts should select their addresses.
    If one of the\n   selected addresses becomes unreachable, the document describes
    the\n   mechanism how a new one should be selected and renegotiated.\n\n\n\t "

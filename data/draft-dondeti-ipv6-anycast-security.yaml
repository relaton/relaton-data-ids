  content: "This document discusses the security issues within network-layer any-\ncast
    protocols. In particular, it focuses on anycast server registra-\ntion with routers
    in an IPv6 network. Servers need to be authenti-\ncated and authorized to provide
    a particular anycast service. Clients\nneed to be able to verify that an anycast
    server is authentic. While\ninfrastructure security is the main focus of this
    document, we also\nidentify the need for secure communication between anycast
    clients\nand servers.\n\n\t "

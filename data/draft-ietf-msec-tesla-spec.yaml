  content: "Data authentication is an important component for many applications,\nfor
    example audio and video Internet broadcasts, or data distribution\nby satellite.
    This document specifies TESLA, a secure source authen­\ntication mechanism for
    multicast or broadcast data streams. The com­\npanion draft draft-msec-tesla-intro-01.txt
    [1] introduces and\ndescribes TESLA in detail, this document specifies the format
    of the\nTESLA authentication field as it is used within the MESP header [2].\nThe
    main deterrents so far for a data authentication mechanism for\nmulticast were
    seemingly conflicting requirements: tolerance to\npacket loss, low per-packet
    overhead, low computation overhead, scal­\nability, no per-receiver state at the
    sender. The problem is particu­\nlarly hard in settings with high packet loss
    rates and where lost\npackets are not retransmitted, and where the receiver wants
    to\nauthenticate each packet it receives.\nTESLA provides multicast source authentication
    of individual data\npackets, regardless of the packet loss rate. In addition,
    TESLA\nfeatures low overhead for both sender and receiver, and does not\nrequire
    per-receiver state at the sender. TESLA is secure as long as\nthe sender and receiver
    are loosely time synchronized.\n\n\t "

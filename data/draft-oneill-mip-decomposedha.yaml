  content: "   RFC 3344 [1] describes the current version of Mobile IP version 4    \n
    \  signaling and forwarding. The signaling and forwarding is conducted \n   between
    a Mobile Node and a Home Agent, via an optional intermediate \n   Foreign Agent,
    for a Home Address of the Mobile Node. The Home Agent \n   acts as the Mobile
    IP signaling endpoint, as well as the forwarding \n   endpoint for packet tunneling
    between the Home Agent and the MN Care \n   of Address. This document describes
    an alternative architecture in \n   which the Home Agent is the signaling endpoint
    whilst a new Tunnel \n   Agent acts as the forwarding endpoint.\n  \n\t "

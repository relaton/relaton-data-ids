  content: "   The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)\n
    \  within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance\n   Entity
    Group Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within\n   network nodes at the
    incoming and outgoing interfaces.\n\n   This document describes a way of forming
    OAM messages so that they\n   can be targeted at MIPs on incoming or MIPs on outgoing
    interfaces,\n   forwarded correctly through the \"switch fabric\", and handled\n
    \  efficiently in node implementations where there is no distinction\n   between
    the incoming and outgoing MIP.\n\n   The material in this document is provided
    for discussion within the\n   MPLS-TP community in the expectation that this idea
    or some similar\n   mechanism will be subsumed into a more general MPLS-TP OAM
    document.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
    Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network.\n\n\t "

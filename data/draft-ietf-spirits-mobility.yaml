  content: "This document describes the management of the mobility events\n\nconsidered
    in SPIRITS protocol and the definition of their related\n\nparameters.\n\nThe
    mobility events management will allow a SPIRITS server to\n\nsubscribe to and
    to be notified of location changes of a mobile\n\nuser. The events would only
    be applicable to mobile users reachable\n\nthrough a CS network. The sending of
    these events must be allowed by\n\nsetting the related marks in the HLR. Besides,
    the SPIRITS protocol\n\nmust be able to translate the CAMEL operations involving
    mobility\n\ninformation into events that can be transferred to the SPIRITS\n\nclient.\n\t "

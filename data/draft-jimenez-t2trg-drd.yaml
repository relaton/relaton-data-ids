  content: "   NB: This document was submitted in 2013 and then discontinued.  It
    is\n   now submitted to T2TRG for discussion on the replication of the\n   Resource
    Directory.  References and many operations would need\n   updating.  Architecture
    and functions should remain the same.\n\n   In some M2M scenarios, it is convenient
    to offer non-centralized\n   alternatives for discovery and rendezvous.  This
    document defines a\n   Distributed Resource Directory (DRD) for Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP).  Distribution is achieved by means of a structured\n   Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) overlay.  The DHT-based P2P overlay provides\n   discovery, rendezvous and
    caching services for CoAP End-points as\n   well as HTTP proxy service for Web
    clients.\n\n\t "

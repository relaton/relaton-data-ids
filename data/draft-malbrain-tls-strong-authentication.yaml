  content: "   The security provided by authenticated TLS connection between\n   clients
    and servers should protect both parties from \"Man-in-\n   the-Middle\" (MITM)
    attacks.  Clients should be authenticating\n   that their server connection is
    to the server they requested.\n\n   Servers that act as client agents need to
    authenticate that\n   the connection is directly to their client secure against\n
    \  eavesdropping or account/password hacking.\n\n   An extension to the Domain
    Name System (DNS), The DNS-Based\n   Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) (RFC
    6698), allows TLS\n   servers to publish their public certificates for use by
    TLS\n   clients to authenticate the server connection.\n\n\t "

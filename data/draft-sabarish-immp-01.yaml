  content: "The Internet Message Mapping Protocol (IMMP) is designed to support \n
    \   the provision of mail in a medium to large scale operation. It is \n    intended
    to be used as a companion to the SMTP protocol and mail \n    receiving protocols
    (POP, IMAP, web mail also), providing services \n    which are outside the scope
    of mail access. The services that IMMP \n    provides are mapping mails into appropriate
    subinbox (inside the \n    inbox) when the messages are received through SMTP,
    Extended inbox \n    management and Spam guard management.\n\t "

  content: "Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) and \n
    \  Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities required for are MPLS-\n   TP
    OAM.  \n    \n   Continuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of
    the path \n   for any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors
    \n   the integrity of the routing of the path between sink and source for \n   any
    connectivity issues. RDI enables an End Point to report, to its \n   associated
    End Point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on \n   a PW, LSP or Section.
    \n    \n   This document specifies methods for proactive CV, CC, and RDI for \n
    \  MPLS-TP Label Switched Path (LSP), PWs and Sections using \n   Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection (BFD).\n\t "

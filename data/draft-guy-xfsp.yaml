  content: "   This document presents a binary IP-based protocol to facilitate\n   interoperable
    communications between electronic equipment on a\n   platform.  The protocol is
    UDP-based, stateless, and multicast.\n   Messages consist of a common header followed
    by a series of\n   parameters and related attributes.  The parameters are always\n
    \  informational, e.g., indicating airspeed is 150 kts, but parameter\n   attributes
    can be set to indicate intent, e.g., this parameter\n   contains a new user selected
    value such as an instruction that\n   deploys the landing gear.  Although initially
    designed for avionics,\n   it can be applied to other platform domains as well.
    \ This document\n   defines the core protocol and a method to extend it to meet
    any\n   domain specific needs.\n\n\t "

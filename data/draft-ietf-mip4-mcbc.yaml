  content: "This document specifies a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is used to\nnegotiate
    the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style in the\ncase of Mobile IPv4
    Foreign Agent Care-of Address mode registration.\nWith this extension the mobile
    node is able to negotiate the type of\ntraffic that needs to be encapsulated for
    delivery to the foreign\nagent while other types of traffic use the direct delivery
    style.\nThis mechanism eliminates the tunnel overhead between the mobile node\nand
    the foreign agent.  Multicast and broadcast applications on a\nmobile IPv4 mobile
    node are better served with this extension.\n\t "

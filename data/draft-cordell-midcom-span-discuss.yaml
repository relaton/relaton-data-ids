  content: "This document collects points of discussion surrounding the\npre-midcom
    SPAN deliverable (SPAN = Simple Protocol for Augmenting\nNATs).  As far as possible
    it is intended to act as a collation point\nfor facts surrounding the SPAN deliverable.
    \ Where a discussion item\nis not black and white it attempts to collate opinion
    from all angles\nas far as the author is able to without bias.  It does not draw\nconclusions
    of any sort.  \n\t "

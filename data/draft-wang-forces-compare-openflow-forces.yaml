  content: "   While both ForCES and OpenFlow follow the basic idea of separations\n
    \  of forwarding plane and control plane in network elements, they have\n   some
    technical differences. This document analyzes the differences\n   between OpenFlow
    and ForCES technically from the aspects of goals,\n   architecture, forwarding
    model and protocol interface. The two\n   techniques can learn much from each
    other in their standardization\n   process.\n\n\t "

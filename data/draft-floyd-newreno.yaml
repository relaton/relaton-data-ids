  content: "RFC 2581 [RFC2581] documents the following four intertwined TCP\ncongestion
    control algorithms: Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast\nRetransmit, and Fast
    Recovery.  RFC 2581 [RFC2581] explicitly allows\ncertain modifications of these
    algorithms, including modifications\nthat use the TCP Selective Acknowledgement
    (SACK) option [RFC2018],\nand modifications that respond to 'partial acknowledgments'
    (ACKs\nwhich cover new data, but not all the data outstanding when loss was\ndetected)
    in the absence of SACK.  The NewReno mechanism described in\nthis document describes
    a specific algorithm for responding to\npartial acknowledgments, referred to as
    NewReno.  This response to\npartial acknowledgments was first proposed by Janey
    Hoe in [Hoe95].\n\t "

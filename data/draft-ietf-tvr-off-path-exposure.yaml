abstract:
- content: "<p>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) involves predictable, scheduled changes
    to network topology elements such as nodes, links, and adjacencies that impact
    routing behavior over time. All those changes can alter the connectivity in the
    network in a predictable manner, which is known as Time-Variant Routing (TVR).
    This document proposes mechanisms for exposing TVR information to both internal
    and external applications, focusing on off-path solutions that decouple the advertisement
    of scheduled changes from the routing control plane signaling.</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) [RFC6824] adopts\n       Selective
    Acknowledgements (SACKs) at the subflow level to allow an\n       MPTCP receiver
    to acknowledge the receipt of out-of-order data. In\n       MPTCP, SACK information
    is expected (but not mandated)--though SACKs\n       notify a data sender the
    reception of specific out-of-order data, the\n       out-of-order data cannot
    be delivered to application layer until it\n       has been cumulatively acknowledged
    at the connection-level. The MPTCP\n       data receiver is permitted to later
    abandon the out-of-order data\n       cached in the receive buffer. The out-of-order
    data is called\n       renegable. Since the delivery of a SACKed out-of-order
    data is\n       renegable, the sender has to maintain copies of SACKed data in
    the\n       send buffer until it is cumulatively acked. As a result, the send\n
    \      buffer is inevitably wasted and the transmission rate is restricted\n       even
    though the network is not congested.\n\n\t "

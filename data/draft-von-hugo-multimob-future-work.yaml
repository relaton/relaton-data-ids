  content: "The WG MultiMob aims at defining a basic mobile multicast solution\nleveraging
    on network localized mobility management, i.e.  Proxy\nMobile IPv6 protocol.  The
    solution would be basically based on\nmulticast group management, i.e.  IGMP/MLD,
    proxying at the access\ngateway.  If such a basic solution is essential from an
    operational\npoint of view, challenges with efficient resource utilization and\nuser
    perceived service quality still persist.  These issues may\nprevent large scale
    deployments of mobile multicast applications.\n\nThis document attempts to identify
    topics for near future extension\nof work such as modifying multimob base solution,
    PMIPv6 and MLD/\nIGMP for optimal multicast support, and adaptation of Handover\noptimization.
    \ Far future items such as extending to and modifying\nof MIPv4/v6 and DSMIP,
    sender (source) mobility, consideration of\nmultiple flows and multihoming will
    be dealt with in a future\nversion.\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses a framework of supporting multicast traffic,\n
    \  , in a network that uses Network Virtualization using Overlays over\n   Layer
    3 (NVO3). Both infrastructure multicast and application-\n   specific multicast
    are discussed. It describes the various\n   mechanisms and considerations that
    can be used for delivering such\n   traffic as well as the data plane and control
    plane considerations\n   for each of the mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   There needs to be a solution for locating and capturing data in a\n
    \  standardized way.  Data may be cached, copied and/or stored at\n   multiple
    locations in the network on route to its final destination.\n   With an increasingly
    high volume of devices connecting to the\n   Internet, support for network caching
    and replication is critical for\n   continuous data availability.  There are data
    repositories throughout\n   a modern network and there needs to be a standardized
    way to locating\n   the repositories and discovering the desired data within.\n\n
    \  There are several use cases which illustrate a need for a data\n   discovery
    solution.  An application might need to query the network\n   to discover resources
    (program, service, resource) that can help the\n   local application perform a
    particular task.  Additionally, there\n   could be volumes of data which needs
    to be searched and discovered in\n   order to provide a result to be acted upon
    by the application.  These\n   are a couple of the use cases being addressed in
    this document.\n\n\t "

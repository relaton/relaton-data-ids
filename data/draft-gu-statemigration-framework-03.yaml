abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document presents an initial framework and discussion of the\n
    \  problem of transferring middlebox (for example, firewall or NAT)\n   flow-coupled
    state from one middlebox to another while the flow is\n   still active.  This
    has most recently come up in the context of\n   virtual machine (VM) migration
    between hypervisors, but it is a\n   problem that has appeared in other situations,
    as well.  We present\n   some of the parameters of the problem, define some language
    for\n   discussing the problem, and begin to identify a path forward for\n   addressing
    it.\n\n\t "

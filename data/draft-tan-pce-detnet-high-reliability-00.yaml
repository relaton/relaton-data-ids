  script: Latn
  content: "   Real-time network performance information, like latency, delay\n   variation,
    packet loss and in order delivery, is becoming critical in\n   the path computation
    in some networks.\n\n   This document propose metric extensions to PCEP messages,
    to better\n   describe the path computation constraints and QoS requirements of\n
    \  Deterministic Networking (DetNet) flows, especially the high\n   reliability
    requirements on packet loss and in order delivery.\n\n   PCEP Extensions defined
    in this document could be used not only for\n   DetNet, but also for other PCEP
    scenarios.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes mapping the RTP payload type to the port \nnumber
    of transport layer.  The purpose of this mapping is to let UDP \nheader information
    distinguish the payload type of a RTP packet.  \nPacket classification using the
    UDP header information is a widely \naccepted method of applying QoS to the Internet
    traffic.  The \nproposed method in this document does not require any changes
    of UDP \npacket format.  Any method of classifying packets is outside the \nscope
    of this specification.\n\t "

  content: "   DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) defines the common framework for\n   applications
    to announce and discover services.  This includes\n   service names, service instance
    names, common parameters for\n   selecting a service instance (weight, priority)
    as well as service\n   specific parameters.\n\n   GRASP is intended to also be
    used for service discovery.  Reinventing\n   service discovery for GRASP with
    a similar set of fetures would\n   result in duplication of work.  Therefore,
    this document defines how\n   to use GRASP to announce and discover services in
    a way that inherits\n   DNS-SD features and also tries to be compatible in spirit
    as much as\n   possibel while still maintaining the intended simplicity of GRASP.\n\n
    \  The goal of this document is to permit defining service and their\n   parameters
    once and then use that in GRASP, mDNS and (unicast) DNS.\n   Future work can also
    define DNS-SD <-> GRASP gateway functions.\n\n   In support of service discovery,
    this document also defines name\n   discovery and schemes for reuseable elements
    in GRASP objectives\n   which are designed to be extensible so that future work
    that\n   identifies elements required across multiple objectives do not need\n
    \  to define a scheme how to do this.\n\n\t "

  content: "STD-19/RFC-1001/RFC-1002 defines a 'Protocol Standard for a NetBIOS Service
    on a TCP/UDP Transport,' or 'NetBIOS-over-TCP' for short.  STD-19 defines NetBIOS
    end-nodes as stations which 'support NetBIOS service interfaces and contain applications.'
    That standard describes three types of end-nodes: Broadcast nodes (B nodes), Point-to-point
    nodes (P nodes), and Mixed mode nodes (M nodes).  This memo describes a fourth
    note type, an H node, which is basically a P node which can transmit UDP broadcasts
    when NetBIOS servers cannot be reached.\n\t "

  content: "   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) is used
    to\n   convey path computation requests and responses both between Path\n   Computation
    Clients (PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs) and\n   between cooperating
    PCEs.  In PCEP, the path computation requests\n   carry details of the constraints
    and objective functions that the PCC\n   wishes the PCE to apply in its computation.\n\n
    \  This document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information\n   in
    PCEP using a dedicated object and a new Type-Length-Variable that\n   can be carried
    in any existing PCEP object.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 7150.  The only
    change from that document\n   is the allocation of a different code point for
    the\n   VENDOR-INFORMATION object.\n\n\t "

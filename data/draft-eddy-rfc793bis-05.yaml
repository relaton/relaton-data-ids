abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies the Internet''s Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP). TCP is an important transport layer protocol in the Internet stack, and
    has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over
    this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC
    793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document
    collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from
    RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793 and several other RFCs (TODO: list all
    actual RFCs when finished). RFC EDITOR NOTE: If approved for publication as an
    RFC, this should be marked additionally as "STD: 7" and replace RFC 793 in that
    role.</p>'

  content: "   This draft provides an example of how to extend the ACE framework\n
    \  [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], to use client and server certificates\n   (x509),
    for mutual authentication.  Certificate are used to establish\n   the security
    context between the client and resource server.  This\n   draft is limited to
    transport layer security based on DTLS and it\n   does not consider the mixed
    case where e.g. only the server is\n   authenticated with a certificate.\n\n\t "

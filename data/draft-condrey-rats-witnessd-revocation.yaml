  content: "   This document specifies mechanisms for revoking and updating Evidence\n
    \  status in the witnessd Proof of Process framework.  It defines how\n   authors
    can mark Evidence as superseded or revoked, how device key\n   compromise is handled,
    and how Verifiers can efficiently check\n   Evidence validity.\n\n   The specification
    also defines an External Verifier Registry protocol\n   that enables Relying Parties
    to discover trusted Verifiers and obtain\n   federated verification services.\n\n\t "

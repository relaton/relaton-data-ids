  content: "   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread\n   deployment.
    \ However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet\n   as mature and reliable
    as those for non-DNSSEC-related domain\n   administration tools and processes.
    \ Negative Trust Anchors\n   (described in this document) can be used to mitigate
    DNSSEC\n   validation failures.\n\n   [ Editor note: This document was originally
    draft-livingood-negative-\n   trust-anchors-07 - renamved at the request of the
    DNSOP chairs ]\n\n\t "

  content: "   The MPLS label format and encoding method are specified in\n   [RFC3032],
    the label value is represented using the 20-bit space and\n   supports up to 1
    million of instances. As exponential Internet growth\n   continues there are specific
    network deployment scenarios where a\n   clear need to represent more than one
    million entities is required.\n\n   This document describes the MPLS deployment
    scenarios, use\n   cases, and requirements, where the current 20-bit label will
    no\n   longer be sufficient.\n\n\n\t "

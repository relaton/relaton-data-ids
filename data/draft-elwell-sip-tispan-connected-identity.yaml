  content: "ETSI TISPAN has presented Next Generation Network (NGN) requirements\n
    \  for the delivery of two identities for the caller and two identities\n   for
    the callee in a SIP INVITE-initiated dialog.  Although the\n   solution for this
    in SIP is relatively straightforward for caller\n   identity, the delivery of
    callee identity presents some additional\n   problems.  This document discusses
    the issues and suggests some\n   candidate solutions.\n\n   This work is being
    discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.\n\t "

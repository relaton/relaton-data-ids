  content: "\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows for sessions to be\n
    \  redirected by the use of the 3xx response code.  This response code\n   allows
    redirect servers and proxies to redirect the session or for\n   the message to
    be sent all the way back to the initiating client to\n   recurse.  There is no
    way to direct the domain responsible for the\n   Request-URI to perform the redirection.
    \ This document defines a new\n   response code that clients and redirect servers
    could use to ensure\n   that recursion take place within the domain responsible
    for the\n   Request-URI rather than allowing the initiating client do perform
    the\n   redirect.\n\n\t "

  content: "     In order to generate a unique address, IPv6 nodes perform the      \n
    \    Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure.  Payload packets can \n     not
    be sent or received before this procedure is complete.  In an      \n     environment
    where frequent movements are expected, this delay can be      \n     problematic.
    \ As the reduction or removal of the delay would be      \n     useful, an optimized
    version of DAD has been proposed. \n      \n     This document suggests the requirements
    for such \"Optimized DAD\" \n     protocol as well as considerable solutions.

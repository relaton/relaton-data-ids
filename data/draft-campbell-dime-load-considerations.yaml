  content: "   RFC 7068 describes requirements for Overload Control in Diameter.\n
    \  This includes a requirement to allow Diameter nodes to send \"load\"\n   information,
    even when the node is not overloaded.  The Diameter\n   Overload Information Conveyance
    (DOIC) solution describes a mechanism\n   meeting most of the requirements, but
    does not currently include the\n   ability to send load information.  This document
    explores some\n   architectural considerations for a mechanism to send Diameter
    load\n   information.\n\n\t "

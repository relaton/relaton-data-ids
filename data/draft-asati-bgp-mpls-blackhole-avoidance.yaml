abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In any BGP based MPLS network such as MPLS VPN [RFC4364], an ingress
    \n   PE router would continue to attract traffic from the CE router by \n   advertising
    the prefix reachability, even though the Label Switched \n   Path (LSP) from the
    ingress PE router to the egress PE router may be \n   broken. This causes the
    VPN traffic to be dropped inside the MPLS VPN \n   network.  \n\n   This document
    proposes a framework to make BGP consider the MPLS path \n   availability to the
    \"NEXT_HOP\" (i.e. egress PE router) during the BGP \n   bestpath candidate selection
    process. This document also defines a \n   local database for storing the MPLS
    path health information for one \n   or more IP prefixes and its interaction with
    BGP. \n\n\t "

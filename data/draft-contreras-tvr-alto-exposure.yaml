abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operations can require time-based, scheduled changes in nodes,
    links, adjacencies, etc. All those changes can alter the connectivity in the network
    in a predictable manner, which is known as Time-Variant Routing (TVR). Existing
    IETF solutions like ALTO can assist on the exposure of such predicted changes
    to both internal and external applications then anticipating the occurence of
    routing changes. This document describes how ALTO helps in that purpose.</p>"

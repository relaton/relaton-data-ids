  content: "   Global IPv6 deployment is inevitable. There are many solutions have
    \n   been specified in order to provide IPv6 connectivity services. In \n   order
    to provide IPv6 connectivity services to all kinds of \n   host/client devices,
    ISP networks need to support as many as possible \n   IPv6 connectivity solutions.
    This document proposes a hybrid ISP \n   platform that supports the coexistence
    of variable IPv6 connectivity \n   solutions and analyses the configuration requirements
    raised by this \n   platform. Additionally, the applicability of different configuration
    \n   mechanisms for performing this configuration is discussed. \n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies how a server can send an HTTP exchange--a\n
    \  request URL, content negotiation information, and a response--with\n   signatures
    that vouch for that exchange's authenticity.  These\n   signatures can be verified
    against an origin's certificate to\n   establish that the exchange is authoritative
    for an origin even if it\n   was transferred over a connection that isn't.  The
    signatures can\n   also be used in other ways described in the appendices.\n\n
    \  These signatures contain countermeasures against downgrade and\n   protocol-confusion
    attacks.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document presents Localized Mobility Management for Mobile\nIPv6
    in Distributed Manner (LMMDv6). Localized Mobility Management,\nin general introduces
    Local Mobility Agent functionality for\nproxying a Regional care of address that
    remains the same while the\nmobile node moves within a Local Mobility Domain,
    which reduces the\nbinding update signaling latency and the signaling load outside
    the\nLocal Mobility Domain. We present a new way of forming Local\nMobility Domains
    and Local Mobility Agents. In this protocol, Local\nMobility Agent functionality
    is distributed across all access\nrouters and a Local Mobility Domain is formed
    dynamically according\nto the mobile node's movement.\n\t "

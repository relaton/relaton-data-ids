  content: "   This document specifies a set of objects extending the Content\n   Delivery
    Network Interconnection (CDNI) metadata model to allow for\n   metadata to be
    applied conditionally and at various points in a dCDNs\n   processing of requests.
    \ The concept of Processing Stages are\n   introduced, where each stage in a CDN's
    processing pipeline presents\n   an opportunity to examine requests and responses
    and make alterations\n   as needed.  Metadata, such as caching rules, can be applied\n
    \  conditionally (based on aspects of an HTTP request header), and HTTP\n   responses
    from a source can be altered dynamically (such as adding or\n   dropping an HTTP
    header).  This standard leverages the expression\n   language documented in the
    Metadata Expression Language (MEL)\n   Specification.\n\n\t "

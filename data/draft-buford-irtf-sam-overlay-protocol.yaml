  content: "The previously proposed Hybrid Overlay Multicast Framework uses a \n   structured
    peer-to-peer overlay to connect peers in different types \n   of multicast regions
    of the Internet. We use AMT (Automatic IP \n Multicast Without Explicit Tunnels)
    to connect peers in ALM \n   (Application Layer Multicast) regions with peers
    in native multicast \n   regions. Here we define the overlay messaging needed
    to support the \n   multicast tree operations. One goal of this approach is to
    ensure \n   that the SAM framework is compatible with the P2P-SIP overlay, which
    \n   is still being defined. Another goal is to be overlay agnostic so \n   that
    different overlay algorithms can interoperate in a single SAM \n   (Scalable Adaptive
    Multicast) session. \n\n\t "

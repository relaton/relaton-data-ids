  content: "   In addition to its use as a subnetwork layer for IP (e.g., via\n   RFC
    7668), in various IoT web applications Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)\n   can serve
    as a \"local interconnect\", connecting devices locally\n   (i.e., not over IP)
    for use as a source of information and a target\n   for actuation.  In order to
    fully use these capabilities in\n   applications using web technologies, there
    is a need for a method for\n   addressing the resources, i.e., a URI scheme, and
    definition of the\n   representation of the data exchanged between the application
    and\n   devices, i.e., media types.  This document is a straw man proposal\n   for
    such a URI scheme and media types for interacting with the\n   Bluetooth GAP and
    GATT protocols.\n\n\t "

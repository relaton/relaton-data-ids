  content: "This memo describes a protocol to support mobility in IPv6.  The mobile
    node has an identifier (home address) and a temporary address (care-of address).
    \ The IPv6 base header includes the temporary addresses so that the source and
    destination addresses are always topologically significant, while the identifiers
    are included in the Destination Options Header.  End nodes may have authentic
    cache information between identifiers and addresses for routing optimization.
    \ This protocol introduces two new destination options: `Source Identifier' and
    `Destination Identifier', and also introduces two control packets using UDP.\n\t "

  content: "   BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets route\n
    \  stability.  It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing\n   CPU
    load on the routers.\n\n   But it has side-effects.  Thus, in 2006, RIPE recommended
    not to use\n   Route Flap Damping (see [RIPE-378]).\n\n   Now, some researchers
    propose to turn RFD, with less aggressive\n   parameters, back on [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable].\n\n
    \  This document describes results of a survey conducted among service\n   provider
    on their use of BGP Route Flap Damping.\n\n\t "

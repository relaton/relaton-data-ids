- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 6222 describes a number of mechanisms for generating a unique\n
    \  CNAME Unfortunately, these algorithms are rather complicated and also\n   produce
    CNAMEs which in some cases are potentially linkable over\n   multiple RTCP sessions
    even if a new CNAME is generated for each\n   session.  This document specifies
    a replacement algorithm for the\n   algorithm in Section 5 which does not have
    this limitation and is\n   also simpler to implement.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes how a Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) performs a planned rollover of its key pair.
    \ This document also notes the implications of this key rollover procedure for
    relying parties (RPs).  In general, RPs are expected to maintain a local cache
    of the objects that have been published in the RPKI repository, and thus the way
    in which a CA performs key rollover impacts RPs.  This memo documents an Internet
    Best Current Practice.\n\t "

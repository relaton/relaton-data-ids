  content: "Some Relay Agents extract lease information from the DHCP message\n   exchanged
    between the client and DHCP server.  This lease information\n   is used by relay
    agents for various purposes like antispoofing,\n   prevention of flooding.  RFC
    4388 defines a mechanism for relay\n   agents to retrieve the lease information
    from the DHCP server as and\n   when this information is lost.  Existing leasequery
    mechanism is data\n   driven which means that a relay agent can initiate the leasequery
    only when it starts receiving data from/to the clients.  In certain\n   scenarios,
    this model is not scalable.  This document first looks at\n   issues in existing
    mechanism and then proposes a new query type,\n   query by remote ID, to address
    these issues.\n\t "

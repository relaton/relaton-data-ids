  content: "   Fast congestion control is discussed in academic papers as well as
    in\n   the different standard bodies.  There is no one proposal for\n   providing
    a solution that will work for all use cases leading to\n   multiple approaches.
    \ By congestion control we refer to an end to end\n   solution and not only to
    the congestion control algorithm on the\n   sender side.  This document describes
    the current state of flow\n   control and congestion for Data Centers and proposes
    future\n   directions.\n\n\t "

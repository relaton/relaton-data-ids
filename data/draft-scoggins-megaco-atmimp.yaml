  content: "This document proposes mechanisms needed to address issues associated
    \nwith connection oriented packet networks such as an ATM network or an IP\nnetwork
    which use some form of network path reservation. These issues \nare to:\n- allow
    for determination of which Media Gateway (MG) should initiate \nthe creation of
    the network connection path and correlation of the \nnetwork connection path between
    MGs,\n- allow for a wait state while an end-to-end network path between MGs is
    \nbeing established to effect the ADD of an connection oriented \nephemeral termination,
    for example, UNI/PNNI setup of an ATM SVC,\n- allow for recognition and generation
    of events and signals to support \naccess/use of a connection oriented packet
    based network. \nFirst, this document contains a proposal for use of a unique
    identifier \nto be passed between the two MGs that allows for correlation of a
    \nnetwork path with a specific request or call attempt.\n\t "

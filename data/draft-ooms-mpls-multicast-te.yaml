  content: "There are several reasons for operators to construct multicast trees\nby
    another means than multicast routing protocols.  This document\nlists these reasons
    and describes 2 ways of building a multicast\ntraffic-engineered tree: root-initiated
    tree and leaf-initiated tree.\nFinally it defines extensions to CR-LDP to support
    MPLS multicast\ntraffic engineering.\n\t "

  content: "   Extending TRILL to multiple levels has challenges that are not\n   addressed
    by the already-existing capability of IS-IS to have\n   multiple levels.  One
    issue is with the handling of multi-destination\n   packet distribution trees.
    Another issue is with TRILL switch\n   nicknames.  There have been two proposed
    approaches.  One approach,\n   which we refer to as the \"unique nickname\" approach,
    gives unique\n   nicknames to all the TRILL switches in the multilevel campus,
    either\n   by having the level-1/level-2 border TRILL switches advertise which\n
    \  nicknames are not available for assignment in the area, or by\n   partitioning
    the 16-bit nickname into an \"area\" field and a \"nickname\n   inside the area\"
    field.  The other approach, which we refer to as the\n   \"aggregated nickname\"
    approach, involves hiding the nicknames within\n   areas, allowing nicknames to
    be reused in different areas, by having\n   the border TRILL switches rewrite
    the nickname fields when entering\n   or leaving an area. Each of those approaches
    has advantages and\n   disadvantages. This informational document suggests allowing
    a choice\n   of approach in each area. This allows the simplicity of the unique\n
    \  nickname approach in installations in which there is no danger of\n   running
    out of nicknames and allows the complexity of hiding the\n   nicknames in an area
    to be phased into larger installations on a per-\n   area basis.\n\n\n\n\t "

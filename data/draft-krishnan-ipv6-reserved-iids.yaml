  content: "Interface Identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify\ninterfaces
    on a link.  They are required to be unique within a\nsubnet.  Several RFCs have
    specified interface identifiers or\nidentifier ranges that have a special meaning
    attached to them.  An\nIPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier in these
    ranges\nwill encounter unexpected consequences.  Since there is no\ncentralized
    repository for such reserved identifiers, this document\naims to create one.\n\t "

  content: "   An IP device requires basic host configuration to be able to\n   communicate.
    \ For example, the IP address on the interface and the\n   DNS server for a hostname
    to IP address lookup.  This information is\n   configured statically or obtained
    dynamically using Dynamic Host\n   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or Point-to-
    Point Protocol/IP Control\n   Protocol (PPP/IPCP).  However, both DHCP and PPP/IPCP
    provides host\n   configuration based on the access network.  In Mobile IPv4,
    the\n   registration process boots up a Mobile Node at an access network,\n   also
    known as foreign network.  The information to configure the host\n   needs to
    be based on the home network.  This document describes the\n   extensions used
    to provide the base host configuration in the\n   Registration Request and Reply
    messages.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new BMP message type: the Generic Event Notification
    (GEN). The BMP GEN message provides a flexible mechanism for reporting a wide
    variety of events related to BGP at different levels of hierarchy, such as routing
    instance, AFI/SAFI, or peer level. The BMP GEN message enables operators and automated
    systems to receive detailed context for operational events, such as policy triggers,
    administrative interventions, and state management notifications (e.g., RIB view
    unmonitor events).</p>"

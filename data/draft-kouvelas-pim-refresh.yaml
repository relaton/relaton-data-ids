  content: "   This proposal extends the PIM-DM [1] protocol specification by intro-\n
    \  ducing the PIM State-Refresh control message.\n \n   When an (S,G) entry is
    created in a router for a directly connected\n   source, if the interface directly
    connected to the source is the\n   incoming interface for the entry, a new timer
    is started: the State-\n   Refresh-Timer [SRT(S,G)]. The State-Refresh-Timer controls
    periodic\n   transmission of the PIM State-Refresh message, which is propagated\n
    \  hop-by-hop down the (S,G) RPF tree. When received by a router on the\n   RPF
    interface, the State-Refresh message causes existing prune state\n   to be refreshed.\n
    \n   Addition of this heartbeat message solves many of the current\n   problems
    with PIM-DM. It prevents the periodic timeout of prune state\n   in routers, greatly
    reducing the re-flooding of multicast traffic\n   down the pruned branches that
    expire periodically. It also causes\n   topology changes to be realised quicker
    than the traditional 3 minute\n   timeout.\n\n\t "

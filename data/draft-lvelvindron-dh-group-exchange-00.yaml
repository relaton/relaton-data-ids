  content: "   The Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH)\n   Transport
    layer Protocol specifies that servers and clients should\n   support groups with
    a modulus length of k bits, where the recommended\n   minumum value is 1024 bits.
    \ Recent security research has shown that\n   a minimum value of 1024 bits is
    insufficient against state-sponsored\n   actors.  As such, this document formally
    updates RFC 4419 [RFC4419]\n   such that the minimum recommended value for k is
    2048 bits and the\n   group size is 2048 bits at minimum.\n\n\t "

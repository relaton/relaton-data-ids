  content: "A natural architectural split exists in Mobile IP between the \nmechanisms
    involved in global routing change and the mechanisms \ninvolved in local link
    routing change. The global mechanisms modify \nthe mapping between a Mobile Node's
    routing identifier (care of \naddress) and its global node identifier (home address).
    The local \nmechanisms allow the Mobile Node to obtain IP connectivity on the
    \nsubnet and provide measures to locally mitigate routing failure \nwhile the
    global routing change is occurring. This draft makes a \ncase for keeping the
    mechanisms involved in these two architectural \ncomponents distinct and separate
    in Mobile IPv6, and suggests that \nthe Mobile IP group might want to think about
    a separate working \ngroup specifically focused on local link routing changes
    for \nmobility in Mobile IPv6.    \n\t "

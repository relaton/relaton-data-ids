  content: "   This document specify how to compute the 'tls-unique-prf' data that\n
    \  is cryptographically bound to a specific Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS)
    session.  The intention is to use this data as a name of the\n   secure channel
    for the purpose of a channel binding.  The channel\n   bindings can be used by
    authentication protocols to avoid tunneling\n   attacks and security layer re-use.
    \ The data is derived using the TLS\n   Pseudo-Random Function (PRF).  Applications
    of this include SASL-\n   based protocols like IMAP, SMTP and XMPP.  The channel
    binding 'tls-\n   unique-prf' defined in this document is an alternative to 'tls-\n
    \  unique' as described by RFC 5929 and used by SCRAM and GS2.\n\n\t "

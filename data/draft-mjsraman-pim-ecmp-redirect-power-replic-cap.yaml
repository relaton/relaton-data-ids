  content: "   This work derives itself from [1] which proposes a ECMP redirect from\n
    \  a PIM upstream neighbor that instructs or advices the PIM downstream\n   neighbor
    to choose another of its own ECMP links between the former\n   and the latter.
    What we propose in this document is a criterion based\n   on power consumed in
    the linecards that comprise the ECMP links\n   between the former and the latter.
    Also the multicast replication\n   capacity available within the said linecards
    which form the ECMP\n   links between the two is taken into consideration while
    making a ECMP\n   redirect.\n\n   A PIM router uses RPF procedure to select an
    upstream interface and\n   router to build forwarding state.  When there are equal
    cost multiple\n   paths (ECMP), existing implementations often use hash algorithms
    to\n   select a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic\n   among
    the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually\n   leads to inefficient
    or ineffective use of network resources.  This\n   document introduces the ECMP
    Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF\n   procedure over ECMPs.  It allows
    ECMP path selection to be based on\n   administratively selected metrics, such
    as data transmission delays,\n   path preferences and routing metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t "

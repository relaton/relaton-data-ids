  content: "   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection\n   protocol
    that can quickly determine a communication failure between\n   devices and notify
    upper-layer applications [RFC5880].  BFD has\n   asynchronous detecting mode and
    demand detection mode to satisfy\n   different scenarios, also supports echo function
    to reduce the device\n   requirement for BFD.  One-Arm BFD this draft descripted
    supports\n   another BFD detecting function rather than the echo as described
    in\n   [RFC5880] [RFC5881], it needs nothing BFD capability to one of the\n   devices
    deployed BFD detecting.  Using One-Arm BFD function, the one\n   device works
    on BFD detecting normally and the other device just\n   loopback the BFD packets
    like echo function.  One-Arm BFD is suitable\n   for the cloud virtualization
    network, the One-Arm BFD is deploy on\n   NFV gateways, and NFV virtual machine
    vNICs just enable the echo/\n   loopback process.\n\n\t "

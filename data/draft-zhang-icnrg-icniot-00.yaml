  script: Latn
  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects\n
    \  to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n   different
    domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\" of protocols
    forming a horizontal unified, defragmented IoT\n   platform.  Such a platform
    will make objects accessible to\n   applications across organizations and domains.
    \ Towards this goal,\n   quite a few proposals have been made to build an application-layer\n
    \  based unified IoT platform on top of today's host-centric Internet.\n   However,
    there is a fundamental mismatch between the host-centric\n   nature of todays
    Internet and the information-centric nature of the\n   IoT system.  To address
    this mismatch, we propose to build a common\n   set of protocols and services,
    which form an IoT platform, based on\n   the Information Centric Network (ICN)
    architecture, which we call\n   ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages the salient features
    of ICN, and thus\n   provides naming, security, seamless mobility support, scalability,\n
    \  and efficient content and service delivery.\n\n   This draft describes representative
    IoT requirements, ICN challenges\n   and design considerations to realize a unified
    ICN-IoT framework.\n   Towards this, we first motivate ICN for IoT using specific
    use case\n   scenarios.  Then taking a general IoT perspective, we discuss the
    IoT\n   requirements generally applicable to many well known scenarios.  We\n
    \  then discuss how the current application layer unified IoT\n   architecture
    fails to meet these requirements, followed by discussion\n   on suitability of
    ICN for IoT.  Though we see most of the IoT\n   requirements can be met by ICN,
    we discuss specific design challenges\n   ICN has to address to satisfy them.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes basic ideas and data components of\n   'Capability
    Card,' which is a kind of attribute certificates designed\n   from the standpoint
    of a secure communication framework on the\n   Internet. Similar to the SPKI certificates,
    a capability card can be\n   used to grant a person particular access privileges
    to resources like\n   WWW pages, IRC channels, and message boxes.  In addition,
    it can\n   carry a variety of descriptive information about the issuer, the\n
    \  resources, and the privileges specified in it.  A capability card is\n   written
    in XML, which is becoming a standard format rapidly for the\n   internet data
    exchange. Consequently, users can handle various\n   information in capability
    cards visually with an XML viewer.  This is\n   a fairly desirable feature for
    the existing internet services.\n \n   In this document, following the motivation
    and the basic concepts,\n   the elements of XML DTD of capability cards are described.\n\n\t "

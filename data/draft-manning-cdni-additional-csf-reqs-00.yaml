  content: "   The purpose of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) is to deliver\n   content
    to end users in an efficient manner from the perspective of\n   the network providers
    and with consistently good performance from\n   the perspective of the end user.
    Due to footprint limitations of a\n   single network provider, it may be necessary
    to interconnect CDNs\n   between different providers. The Content Distribution
    Network\n   Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been chartered to develop\n
    \  an interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection.\n\n   The
    requirements for CDN interconnection are being discussed and\n   developed in
    various industry forums. One example is the Alliance\n   for Telecommunications
    Industry Solutions (ATIS) Cloud Services\n   Forum (CSF) which is looking at CDN
    interconnection requirements\n   from the perspective of telecom providers. This
    document introduces\n   some additional requirements to be included in the CDNI
    working\n   group based on conclusions reached by ATIS CSF. The goal is for\n
    \  specifications developed by CDNI to successfully support some of the\n   needs
    expressed by ATIS CSF as interpreted by the authors of this\n   document.\n\n\t "

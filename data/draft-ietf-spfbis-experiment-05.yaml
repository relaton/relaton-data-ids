  content: "   In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising\n
    \  SPF and Sender-ID, two proposed email authentication protocols.\n   Because
    of possible interoperability issues, particularly but not\n   only those created
    by simultaneous use of the two protocols by a\n   receiver, the IESG was unable
    to determine technical consensus and\n   decided it was best to publish all of
    RFC4405, RFC4406, RFC4407 and\n   RFC4408 as Experimental documents.  The IESG
    invited the community to\n   observe their deployments for a period of time, and
    expressed hope\n   for later convergence of opinion.\n\n   After six years, sufficient
    experience and evidence have been\n   collected that the experiment thus created
    can be considered\n   concluded, and a single protocol can be advanced.  This
    document\n   presents those findings.\n\n\t "

  content: "Satellite hops, the region between a basestation and a set of mobile   nodes,
    and a number of other similar scenarios represent a challenge to providing IP
    connectivity at various levels due to the 1-many broadcast nature of the link.
    The UDLR group has addressed these problems in some limited situations. The general
    case, where multiple, possibly partially intersecting set of such hops are part
    of a general set of Internet Paths (or need to be considered in the route computation
    that will buld such paths) is complex. This note is an attempt to outline a framework
    for the general case. We include certain recent approaches to managing connectivity
    that also include quality of service, multiple alternate paths, and traffic engineering
    considerations.\n \nIn this version of this note, we are discussing techniques
    for connectivity, so mechanisms and techniques described are applicable to routers.
    We would need a seperate (and hopefully much simpler) set of mechanisms to incorporate
    hosts that exist on a unidirectional link or path that includes such links.\n\t "

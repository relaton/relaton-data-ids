    \  into Dynamic Multi-agents Secured Collaboration for better\n   scalability,
    communication efficiency, and security etc.  This\n   document also discusses
    the gaps of current hardware/software\n   gateways that could not fulfil the task,
    so that a new kind of\n   entity, e.g. DMSC Gateway, is needed.\n\n\t "

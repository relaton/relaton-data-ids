  content: "   The SCONE protocol provides a scheme for network elements (NEs) to\n
    \  signal the maximally possible throughput limits to end devices, i.e.,\n   the
    flow senders with the assistance from the corresponding flow\n   receivers, for
    UDP flows transitting thru the NEs.  This kind of\n   'throughput advice' is applied
    on the per-(UDP)-flow basis.  While\n   the advice signaling scheme from NEs inside
    the traditional public IP\n   network might be challenging, the applicability
    of the SCONE scheme\n   to the 5G scenario can be more streamlined and practical.
    \ This draft\n   discusses from many perspectives how the SCONE can be applied
    to and\n   realized in the 5G scenario, along with additional advantages that
    a\n   5G system might provide to the SCONE.\n\n\t "

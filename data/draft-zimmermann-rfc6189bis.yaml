  content: "   This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman\n
    \  exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing\n   unicast
    Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice\n   over IP (VoIP)
    applications.  The ZRTP protocol is media path keying\n   because it is multiplexed
    on the same port as RTP and does not\n   require support in the signaling protocol.
    \ ZRTP does not assume a\n   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity
    of\n   certificates in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides\n   confidentiality,
    protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks,\n   and, in cases where the
    signaling protocol provides end-to-end\n   integrity protection, authentication.
    \ ZRTP can utilize a Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide
    discovery and\n   authentication through the signaling channel.  To provide best
    effort\n   SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.\n
    \  ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice media stream and can\n   also
    secure media sessions that do not include voice by using an\n   optional digital
    signature.\n\n\t "

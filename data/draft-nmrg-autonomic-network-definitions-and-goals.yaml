  content: "   Autonomic systems were first described in 2001.  The fundamental goal\n
    \  is self-management, including self-configuration, self-optimization,\n   self-healing
    and self-protection.\n\n   This document applies the concepts of autonomic systems
    to a network,\n   and describes the definitions and design goals of Autonomic\n
    \  Networking.  The goal is a network where nodes have minimal\n   dependencies
    on human administrators or centralized management\n   systems.\n\n\t "

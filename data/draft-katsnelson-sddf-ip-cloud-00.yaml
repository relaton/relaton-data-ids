  content: "This memo describes Source Driven Default Forwarding (SDDF) procedures.
    These procedures are intended for establishing proper routing in an autonomous
    system (AS) that consists of a number of interconnected routers, and provides
    filtered IP transport between its border networks. Such an AS is called 'IP cloud'
    further within this document.              The SDDF method is an alternative to
    IP tunneling, which is used in such a networks nowadays.                                                         This
    memo also defines an algorithm used by a router in the cloud, structure of tables
    used by the algorithm, and a protocol used to distribute these tables across the
    cloud.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the inter-working of a SIP (Session \nInitiation
    Protocol) User Agent, SUA, located into a  software \ninstance of a IP phone (Softphone),
    and a SIP Proxy located in the \naccess network where the user connects to Internet.
    The model \naddressed is the one of a customer using a service offered by a \nservice
    provider, and the operation described only applies to the \nnegotiation and management
    of such kind of services. The network \narchitecture is supposed to be private,
    and the service provider is \nin charge to negotiate network resources with network
    provider(s) on \nbehalf of the customer, if necessary. \nAim of this draft is
    to highlight the need of inter-working functions \nthat allows service providers
    to use network-driven SIP messages to \nestablish and manage multimedia over IP
    connections.\n\t "

  content: "This contribution describes a generalized interworking mechanism\nbetween
    SIP and H.323 for third party call control where the\ncontroller function can
    reside anywhere within the IP Telephony\nnetwork. The proposed generalized interworking
    mechanism offers\ntransparent IP Telephony services between the SIP and H.323\nendpoints
    considering the third party call control function resides\nin a separate application
    server. The implementation of the third\nparty call control function on a SIP
    proxy, SIP endpoint, H.323 GK,\nH.323 endpoint, MCU, or IWF is a special case
    of the generalized\nmechanism proposed in this document\n\t "

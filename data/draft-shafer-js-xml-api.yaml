  content: "JUNOScript is an XML-based API for managing devices.  It allows\naccess
    to both operational and configuration data using a simple RPC\nmechanism.  Sessions
    can be established using a variety of\nconnection-oriented access methods.  This
    document describes the\nframing protocol, message content, and capabilities of
    this API.\nDesign decisions and motivations are also discussed.  No attempt is\nmade
    to formally define a protocol, but rather to document the\ncapabilities of JUNOScript
    as part of the discussion of XML-based\nnetwork management.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents the problem of authentication and\n   authorization
    in wireless mesh networks constituted by several users\n   communicating with
    application servers and communicating with each\n   other in a single or multi-hop
    fashion.  Each user in this\n   environment can also play the role of an application
    provider.\n\n   Imagine a large music event where the provided network infrastructure\n
    \  is enhanced with network storage equipment to allow visitors to\n   access
    content relating to the bands playing at the events, such as\n   recorded video
    of previous performances, supplementary audio and\n   video material relevant
    to the bands playing, etc.  Certain content\n   is, however, not necessarily available
    to everyone under the same\n   conditions.  Instead access control is applied
    before the full range\n   of audio, and video material can be accessed.  Other
    content, such as\n   previews, might be offered for free.  How can such authentication,\n
    \  and authorization infrastructure be made available with minimal\n   configuration
    complexity for a temporary event like a music festival?\n\n   This document lists
    the requirements for a potentially needed\n   Kerberos extension and presents
    a solution proposal based on the\n   attempt to use a Kerberos extension for mutual
    authentication in\n   wireless mesh networks.\n\n\t "

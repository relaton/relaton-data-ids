  content: "   This memo specifies a forwarding method for bounded latency and\n   bounded
    jitter for Deterministic Networks and is a variant of the\n   IEEE TSN Cyclic
    Queuing and Forwarding (CQF) method.  Tagged CQF\n   (TCQF) supports more than
    2 cycles and indicates the cycle number via\n   an existing or new packet header
    field called the tag to replace the\n   cycle mapping in CQF which is based purely
    on synchronized reception\n   clock.\n\n   This memo standardizes TCQF as a mechanism
    independent of the tagging\n   method used.  It also specifies tagging via the
    (1) the existing MPLS\n   packet Traffic Class (TC) field for MPLS packets, (2)
    the IP/IPv6\n   DSCP field for IP/IPv6 packets, and (3) a new TCQF Option header
    for\n   IPv6 packets.\n\n   Target benefits of TCQF include low end-to-end jitter,
    ease of high-\n   speed hardware implementation, optional ability to support large\n
    \  number of flow in large networks via DiffServ style aggregation by\n   applying
    TCQF to the DetNet aggregate instead of each DetNet flow\n   individually, and
    support of wide-area DetNet networks with arbitrary\n   link latencies and latency
    variations as well as low accuracy clock\n   synchronization.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses problem statement and use cases on IP-based\n
    \  vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of\n   Intelligent
    Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main topics of\n   vehicular networking are
    vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-\n   infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X) networking.\n   First, this document surveys use cases using V2V, V2I, and
    V2X\n   networking.  Second, this document analyzes current protocols for\n   vehicular
    networking and general problems on those current protocols.\n   Third, this document
    does problem exploration for key aspects in IP-\n   based vehicular networking,
    such as IPv6 over IEEE 802.11-OCB, IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management,
    Vehicle Identities\n   Management, Multihop V2X Communications, Multicast, DNS
    Naming\n   Services, Service Discovery, IPv6 over Cellular Networks, Security\n
    \  and Privacy.  For each key aspect, this document discusses problem\n   statement
    to analyze the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques\n   and requirements
    in IP-based vehicular networking.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Privacy is an important issue which concerns many governments and\n
    \  users, with its importance becoming more evident every day. Nodes\n   change
    their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked\n   by attackers.
    The act of frequently changing IP addresses also helps\n   to prevent the leakage
    of information by nodes. In IPv6 networks\n   there is currently one solution
    for maintaining the privacy of nodes\n   when IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration
    (SLAAC) (RFC 4862) is\n   used. Unfortunately there are some problems associated
    with this\n   solution which entails the use of the Privacy Extension (RFC 4941).\n
    \  One of the issues with this RFC concerns the wording that is used\n   which
    allows the implementation to make the choice as to what\n   approach to use and
    in so doing, in some cases, the choice made is\n   not the most prudent or best
    approach and this is not ideal and can\n   cause some problems. Some of these
    problems are concerned with not\n   generating a new Interface ID (IID) after
    changing the router prefix.\n   Another concern would be the fact that nodes may
    use an IID that was\n   generated based on a MAC address as a public address,
    and then use\n   this in their response. The act of cutting the current connections
    to\n   other nodes, if the max lifetime of the old IID has elapsed, is also\n
    \  not clearly explained nor is whether or not the already used IID\n   should
    be kept in stable storage, There is also a concern about the\n   need to have
    stable storage available for the generation of a\n   randomized IID. The RFC gives
    no explanation as to how to make use of\n   CGA in its randomizing solution when
    stable storage is not available\n   or how to use the same approach for random
    value generation in all\n   implementations where there is a lack of stable storage.
    The purpose\n   of this document is to address these issues and to update the
    current\n   RFC.\n\n\n\n\t "

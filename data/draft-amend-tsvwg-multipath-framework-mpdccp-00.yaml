  script: Latn
  content: "   More and more of today's devices are multi-homing capable, in\n   particular
    3GPP user equipment like smartphones.  In the current\n   standardization of the
    next upcoming mobile network generation 5G\n   Rel. 16, this is especially targeted
    in the study group Access\n   Traffic Steering Switching Splitting [3GPP, TR 23.793].
    \ ATSSS\n   describes the flexible selection or combination of 3GPP untrusted\n
    \  access like Wi-Fi and cellular access, overcoming the single-access\n   limitation
    of today's devices and services.  Another multi-\n   connectivity scenario is
    the Hybrid Access [draft-lhwxz-hybrid-\n   access-network-architecture, draft-muley-network-based-bonding-\n
    \  hybrid-access], providing multiple access for CPEs, which extends the\n   traditional
    way of single access connectivity at home to dual-\n   connectivity over 3GPP
    and fixed access.  A missing piece in the\n   ATSSS and Hybrid Access is the access
    and path measurement for\n   efficient and beneficial traffic steering decisions.
    \ This becomes\n   particularly important in heterogeneous access networks with
    a\n   multitude of volatile access paths.  MP-TCP can be employed in such\n   scenarios
    and concerning the ATSSS, it is the agreed protocol for the\n   traffic splitting
    mode.  A decision for MP-TCP though leaves the\n   increasing share of UDP in
    today's traffic mix (https://arxiv.org/\n   abs/1801.05168) unconsidered.  In
    this document, a network\n   architecture leveraging the MP-DCCP network protocol
    is proposed,\n   which enables above scenarios and address the formulated issues\n
    \  either independent or complementary to MP-TCP.\n\n\t "

  content: "  This draft introduces an interworking function between shared backbone\nmulticast
    domain and VPN multicast domain. The architecture that \nfollows is similar to
    Multicast Border Router functionality, however the\nmapping is defined not as
    a mapping between two different multicast \nprotocols, but two different multicast
    topologies the under assumption \nthat the shared backbone multicast topology
    will be shared between VPNs \nfor carrying the traffic. The main assumption made
    in this draft is that \nmulticast packets are replicated on PE device (router)
    for scalability \nand performance reasons.  However, it is possible to extend
    the solution\nand replicate packets on CE devices. The proposed mapping of addresses
    \nto topology solves the issue of scalability of multicast addresses to \nstate
    knowledge in the core.  This draft also identifies three types of\nmulticast capabilities
    for the core. \n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is\n
    \  an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol.\n\n   The primary function of
    a BGP-speaking system is to exchange network\n   reachability information with
    other BGP systems.  This network\n   reachability information includes information
    on the list of\n   Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses.\n
    \  This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS\n   connectivity
    for this reachability from which routing loops may be\n   pruned, and, at the
    AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced.\n\n   BGP-4 provides a set of
    mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-\n   Domain Routing (CIDR).  These mechanisms
    include support for\n   advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and
    eliminating\n   the concept of network \"class\" within BGP.  BGP-4 also introduces\n
    \  mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of\n   AS
    paths.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 4271.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Connecting an enterprise site to multiple ISPs over IPv6 using\n   provider-assigned
    addresses is difficult without the use of some form\n   of Network Address Translation
    (NAT).  Much has been written on this\n   topic over the last 10 to 15 years,
    but it still remains a problem\n   without a clearly defined or widely implemented
    solution.  Any\n   multihoming solution without NAT requires hosts at the site
    to have\n   addresses from each ISP and to select the egress ISP by selecting
    a\n   source address for outgoing packets.  It also requires routers at the\n
    \  site to take into account those source addresses when forwarding\n   packets
    out towards the ISPs.\n\n   This document examines currently available mechanisms
    for providing a\n   solution to this problem for a broad range of enterprise topologies.\n
    \  It covers the behavior of routers to forward traffic taking into\n   account
    source address, and it covers the behavior of hosts to select\n   appropriate
    source addresses.  It also covers any possible role that\n   routers might play
    in providing information to hosts to help them\n   select appropriate source addresses.
    \ In the process of exploring\n   potential solutions, this document also makes
    explicit requirements\n   for how the solution would be expected to behave from
    the perspective\n   of an enterprise site network administrator.\n\n\t "

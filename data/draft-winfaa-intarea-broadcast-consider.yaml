  script: Latn
  content: "   A number of application-layer protocols make use of IP broadcasts or\n
    \  multicast messages for functions such as local service discovery or\n   name
    resolution.  Some of these functions can only be implemented\n   efficiently using
    such mechanisms.  When using broadcasts or\n   multicast messages, a passive observer
    in the same broadcast domain\n   can trivially record these messages and analyze
    their content.\n   Therefore, broadcast/multicast protocol designers need to take\n
    \  special care when designing their protocols.\n\n\t "

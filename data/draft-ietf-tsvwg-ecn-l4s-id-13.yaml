  content: "   This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP packets\n
    \  for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable\n   throughput
    (L4S).  L4S uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)\n   scheme that is
    similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach.\n   'Classic' ECN marking
    was required to be equivalent to a drop, both\n   when applied in the network
    and when responded to by a transport.\n   Unlike 'Classic' ECN marking, for packets
    carrying the L4S\n   identifier, the network applies marking more immediately
    and more\n   aggressively than drop, and the transport response to each mark is\n
    \  reduced and smoothed relative to that for drop.  The two changes\n   counterbalance
    each other so that the throughput of an L4S flow will\n   be roughly the same
    as a non-L4S flow under the same conditions.\n   Nonetheless, the much more frequent
    control signals and the finer\n   responses to them result in much more fine-grained
    adjustments, so\n   that ultra-low and consistently low queuing delay (typically
    sub-\n   millisecond on average) becomes possible for L4S traffic without\n   compromising
    link utilization.  Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like)\n   traffic can have
    high bandwidth and very low delay at the same time,\n   even during periods of
    high traffic load.\n\n   The L4S identifier defined in this document distinguishes
    L4S from\n   'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic.  It gives an incremental\n
    \  migration path so that suitably modified network bottlenecks can\n   distinguish
    and isolate existing traffic that still follows the\n   Classic behaviour, to
    prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and\n   low loss of L4S traffic.  This
    specification defines the rules that\n   L4S transports and network elements need
    to follow to ensure they\n   neither harm each other's performance nor that of
    Classic traffic.\n   Examples of new active queue management (AQM) marking algorithms
    and\n   examples of new transports (whether TCP-like or real-time) are\n   specified
    separately.\n\n\t "

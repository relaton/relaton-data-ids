  content: "This Internet draft describes a number of applications that require\naccurate
    time and/or frequency, and elucidates difficulties related\nto the transfer of
    high quality time and frequency across an IP or\nMPLS Packet Switched Network.
    \ This issue is not addressed by any\ncurrently chartered IETF working group,
    and we therefore propose the\nformation of a new working group to be called Transmitting
    Timing\nover IP Connections and Transfer of Clock (TICTOC).\n\t "

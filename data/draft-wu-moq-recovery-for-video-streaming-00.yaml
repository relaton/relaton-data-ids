  content: "   The current loss recovery in QUIC provides reliable delivery but is\n
    \  not optimized for latency, potentially hindering time-sensitive\n   applications.
    \ The document analyzes the issues caused by the current\n   QUIC recovery scheme
    during live video streaming and then proposes an\n   enhanced QUIC recovery mechanism
    that leverages additional loss\n   retransmissions for optimizing client-side
    QoE.  At a high level, the\n   QUIC sender performs additional recovery logic
    when transport runs\n   into application limited state, which is for the lost
    data that has\n   been retransmitted before but has not been acknowledged yet.
    \ This\n   mechanism can act as a supplement to the existing recovery scheme\n
    \  that performs immediate loss retransmissions once a packet is\n   detected
    lost.\n\n\t "

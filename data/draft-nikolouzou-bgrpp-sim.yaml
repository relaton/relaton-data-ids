  content: "End-to-end provisioning of quality of service guarantees is nowadays one\nof
    the most basic and crucial issues. Towards this end, the inter-domain \nresource
    control architecture for DiffServ networks described in [1],\ntries to address
    this issue by applying a scalable and efficient \nsignaling approach. Based on
    this architecture, this paper tries to \nprovide an analysis and a performance
    study of the introduced quiet \ngrafting mechanisms.\n\t "

  content: "The Mobile IP Working Group is considering proposals to provide fast\nhand-off
    capabilities to the Mobile IP protocol. It is important that\nsuch proposals do
    not require usage additional bandwidth, such as\nrequired by frequent mobility
    agent advertisements. This\nspecification allows a mobility agent to provide its
    coverage area,\nand the location of neighboring cells, allowing the Mobile Node
    to\ndetermine when it must initiate a hand-off.\n\t "

  content: "  This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may \n
    \ deploy IPv6 multicast service in BGP/MPLS IPv6 VPNs. Multicast in \n  IPv4 BGP/MPLS
    VPN has been in operation for several years and related \n  drafts are on RFC
    standard track . IPv6 infrastructure is under    \n  construction and new application
    based on IPv6 is being developing \n  now. Multicast will act an important role
    in the future IPv6 \n  environment. This document reuses and extends the method
    defined in \n  draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast-01 to support multicast traffic
    in \n  IPv6 VPNs. Specially, both IPv6 core and IPv4 core are considered in \n
    \ this document. \n\n  The inter-working between an IPv4 site and an IPv6 sited
    is \n  outside the scope of this document. \n\t "

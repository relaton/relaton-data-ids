  content: "   [6PE] specifies a mechanism to interconnect IPv6 islands over an \n
    \  MPLS-enabled IPv4 cloud using the IPv6 Provider Edge routers (6PE)\n   approach.
    The present document reports the results of an \n   implementation survey for
    this mechanism.  \n    \n   After a brief summary of the results, each survey
    response is listed. \n   The document contains responses from the five implementers
    that \n   completed the survey (Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, Ixia, Agilent,
    \n   Spirent). \n    \n   The document also reports some basic interoperability
    testing of 6PE \n   implementations carried out by ISOCORE. \n    \n   No ambiguities
    or errors in the [6PE] specification which could \n   compromise interoperability
    have been reported. \n\t "

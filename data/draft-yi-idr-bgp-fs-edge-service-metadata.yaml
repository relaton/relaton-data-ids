abstract:
- content: "<p>In edge computing and distributed cloud environments, a service may
    be deployed on multiple instances across one or more sites, referred to as edge
    service. The edge service is typically associated with an ANYCAST IP address.
    With the emergence of Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) requirements, there
    is a growing need to consider both network and computing metrics when making traffic
    steering decisions. Traditional routing protocols lack the capability to convey
    compute-related information, necessitating extensions to existing protocols. This
    draft defines a mechanism to distribute service routes along with computing-related
    metadata using BGP FlowSpec. The service metadata, including compute resource
    status and performance metrics, can be collected by a central controller, processed,
    and then distributed to ingress routers using BGP FlowSpec extensions. This enables
    ingress routers to make path selections based not only on routing cost but also
    on the running environment and resource availability of edge services, thereby
    optimizing Quality of Experience (QoE).</p>"

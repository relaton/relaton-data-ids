  content: "   Network Mobility Basic Support Protocol (NEMO BS) is the protocol\n
    \  proposed for the mobility management of mobile networks.  However,\n   NEMO
    BS cannot deal with the problem of pinball routing in the nested\n   mobile network.
    \ And the related solutions are not yet considered and\n   discussed in the IETF.
    \ MANEMO (MANET for NEMO) is designed to solve\n   this problem.  This article
    puts forward a novel MANEMO route\n   optimization solution to solve the pinball
    routing in nested NEMO.\n\n\t "

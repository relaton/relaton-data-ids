  content: "   The future networks not only need to offer the Service Level\n   Agreements
    (SLA) guarantees such as low lantency and jitter, low\n   packet loss and high
    reliability, but also need to support the\n   precise services such as flexible
    resource allocation and service\n   isolation.  This document proposes a set of
    performance requirements\n   and precise properties for Precise Transport Networking
    in various\n   industries such as 5G networks.\n\n\t "

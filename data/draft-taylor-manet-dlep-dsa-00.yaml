  content: "   When using the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)\n   [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep]
    to bootstrap neighbour discovery for routing\n   protocols there is no indication
    in the core DLEP protocol of the\n   services of the router announced at a destination.
    \ This forces an\n   implementation to either rely on a priori configuration or
    use\n   heuristic probing of well-known ports to discover potential routing\n
    \  peers.\n\n   This document defines an extension to DLEP to enable a router
    to\n   advertise its active services to its peer modem, allowing a connected\n
    \  remote modem to announce the services of a router in a DLEP\n   destination
    message to its peer, removing the need for service\n   discovery between routing
    peers.  The mechanism is designed to be\n   sufficiently generic to allow the
    advertisement of network services\n   beyond routing protocols, enabling the fast
    bootstrapping of other\n   protocols such as messaging protocols or header compression.\n\n\t "

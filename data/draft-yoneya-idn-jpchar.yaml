  content: "Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) makes expression of domain name\nrich.
    \ The demand for such enrichment is to use native language\ncharacters in a domain
    name.  IDN itself has no locale dependency as a\nprotocol, but to utilize IDN
    in the real world, language and/or\nregional aspects should be taken into account.\nThis
    document explains a guideline to any IDN zone administrator who\naccepts Japanese
    as an IDN label.\n\t "

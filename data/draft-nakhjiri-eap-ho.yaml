- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The current EAP documentation set, such as [EAP3748], [EAPKEY6], and
    \n   [RADEAP3579] provide a powerful framework for performing combined \n   authentication
    and key management using an EAP server and an AAA \n   infrastructure. The framework
    competently deals with many issues \n   related to network-access control and
    link security setup. However, \n   when it comes to deploying these specifications
    for mobile wireless \n   environments, where a peer is required to perform fast
    and/or \n   heterogeneous handovers, the current framework can be extended with
    \n   more clear guidelines and possibly specifications in ways that \n   prevent
    interoperability or security issues. This draft intends to \n   explore some of
    the complications in deploying the EAP framework for \n   handovers and analyze
    a few solution alternatives.  \n    \n   Further threat analysis of each alternative
    or providing trade-off \n   guidelines for support of handover may be part of
    the future \n   revisions of this document.  \n\t "

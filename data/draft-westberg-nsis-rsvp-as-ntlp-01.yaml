  content: "The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards\ntrack
    within the IETF for a number of years.  During that time, the\nlevel of vendor
    support and deployment has been relatively slow,\ndespite the desire of many to
    deploy technology to deliver services\nwith different levels of quality of service
    (QoS) to their customers.\nThe reasons for this are arguably well-understood and
    documented and\nare not the focus of this memo.  This memo is proposing a (NSIS\nTransport
    Layer Protocol) NTLP, that is a modified version of RSVPv1\nspecified in RFC2205.
    Furthermore, it provides design guidelines and\nspecifications for the development
    of the NLTP that is based on a\nmodified version of RSVPv1.\n\t "

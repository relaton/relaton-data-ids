  content: "Various applications need to exchange structured information, such as
    business-card contact information, bibliographic citations, and structured forms
    and replies.  ASN.1 [ISO87] is a commonly accepted framework for producing binary
    encoding of information.  However, Internet data exchanges often take place in
    a textual environment, such as electronic mail.  In these cases, it would be helpful
    to have conventions for encoding structured information so that it is entirely
    legible as text, but sufficiently structured to allow machine processing.  This
    document specifies Structured Text Interchange Format (STIF), a syntax for encoding
    attribute/value pairs.  The pairs can be collected into multi-part sequences and
    nested sub-lists.  The syntax provides for user-defined extensions and for references
    to data from within sequences and sub-lists.  While STIF can be generally compared
    with ASN.1/BER, it attempts much simpler encoding.  In particular, it is strictly
    text-based and it does not provide for specification of a value's data type.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the need for QoS and media authorization and \ndefines
    a SIP extension that can be used to integrate QoS admission \ncontrol with call
    signaling and help guard against denial of service \nattacks. The use of this
    extension is only applicable in \nadministrative domains, or among federations
    of administrative \ndomains with previously agreed-upon policies, where both the
    SIP \nproxy authorizing the QoS, and the policy control of the underlying \nnetwork
    providing the QoS belong to that administrative domain or \nfederation of domains.\n\t "

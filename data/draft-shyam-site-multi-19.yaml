  content: "   This document provides a solution for Site Multihoming of stub\n   networks
    in a real IP environment. Each user interface in a customer\n   network may have
    as many global unicast addresses as many service\n   providers it will be connected
    with. Users can establish multiple\n   connections through different service providers
    simultaneously.\n   Customer networks can maintain private address space to communicate\n
    \  within its users. Customer networks can provide IP mobility services\n   as
    well.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the\n
    \  Internet, in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion\n   collapse.
    \ The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real time\n   multimedia, which
    needs by low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery,\n   are different from the requirements
    for bulk transfer like FTP or\n   bursty transfers like Web pages, and the TCP
    algorithms are not\n   suitable for this traffic.\n\n   This document attempts
    to describe a set of requirements that can be\n   used to evaluate other congestion
    control mechanisms in order to\n   figure out their fitness for this purpose,
    and in particular to\n   provide a set of possible requirements for proposals
    coming out of\n   the RMCAT Working Group.\n\n   This document is derived from
    draft-jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs\n   [I-D.jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs].\n\t "

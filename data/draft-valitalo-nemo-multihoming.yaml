- language: en

  content: "  This draft describes, how NEMO support works with multiple care-of\n
    \ addresses, in a multihomed mobile network, when there exists one\n  home agent,
    one mobile router, and one or more mobile network\n  prefixes. Solution to the
    problem, how to register multiple care-of\n  addresses bound to a single home
    address in a NEMO support, is\n  proposed.\n\t "

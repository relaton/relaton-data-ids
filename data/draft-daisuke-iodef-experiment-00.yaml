  content: "   This document explains our observation on the usability of IODEF\n
    \  [RFC5070], based on our experiments.  We aim at developing an IODEF-\n   capable
    incident response management systems in order to facilitate\n   incident response
    activities.  We started to design and implement the\n   system for our university
    CERT, however, there are several technical\n   issues while implementing and operating
    the system.  This document\n   shares the observation from our proto-type implementation
    and\n   provides new sight from operational aspects.\n\n\t "

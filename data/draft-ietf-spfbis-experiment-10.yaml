  content: "   In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising\n
    \  SPF and Sender ID, two proposed email authentication protocols.  Both\n   of
    these protocols enable one to publish via the Domain Name System a\n   policy
    declaring which mail servers were authorized to send email on\n   behalf of the
    domain name being queried.  There was concern that the\n   two would conflict
    in some significant operational situations,\n   interfering with message delivery.\n\n
    \  The IESG required the publication of all of these documents (RFC4405,\n   RFC4406,
    RFC4407, and RFC4408) with Experimental status, and\n   requested that the community
    observe deployment and operation of the\n   protocols over a period of two years
    from the date of publication to\n   determine a reasonable path forward.\n\n   After
    six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been\n   collected that the
    experiments thus created can be considered\n   concluded.  This document presents
    those findings.\n\n\t "

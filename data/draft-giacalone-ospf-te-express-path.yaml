  content: "   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial\n   information
    networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network\n   performance criteria
    (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data\n   path selection as other metrics.\n\n
    \  This document describes extensions to OSPF TE [RFC3630] such that\n   network
    performance information can be distributed and collected in a\n   scalable fashion.
    The information distributed using OSPF TE Express\n   Path can then be used to
    make path selection decisions based on\n   network performance.\n\n   Note that
    this document only covers the mechanisms with which network\n   performance information
    is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring\n   network performance or acting
    on that information, once distributed,\n   are outside the scope of this document.\n\n\n\n\t "

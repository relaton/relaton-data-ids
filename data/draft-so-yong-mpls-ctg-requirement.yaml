  content: "This document presents motivation, a problem statement and\noperational
    requirements for a traffic distribution problem in\ntoday's IP/MPLS network when
    multiple links are configured between\ntwo routers. It defines a composite link
    as a group of parallel links\nthat can be considered as a single traffic engineering
    link or as an\nIP link, and used for MPLS.  The framework described in a companion\ndocument
    is used to organize the requirements.\n\t "

  content: "The time required to detect movement between networks and to obtain (or
    to continue to use) an IPv4 configuration may be significant as a fraction of
    the total handover latency in moving between points of attachment.  This document
    synthesizes, from experience in the deployment of hosts supporting ARP, DHCP,
    and IPv4 Link-Local addresses, a set of steps known as Detecting Network Attachment
    for IPv4 (DNAv4), in order to decrease the handover latency in moving between
    points of attachment. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently\ndeployed
    IETF documented standards.  In order to successfully transition\nfrom an all IPv4
    Internet to an all IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken. One of these
    steps is the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  It is
    hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be redesigned to be
    network address independent, but failing that will at least dually support IPv4
    and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental
    RFCs will be surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.\n\t "

  content: "   Future networks that support advanced services, such as those enabled\n
    \  by 5G mobile networks, envisions a set of overlay networks each with\n   different
    performance and scaling properties.  These overlays are\n   known as network slices
    and are realized over a common underlay\n   network.\n\n   In order to support
    network slicing, as well as to offer enhanced VPN\n   services in general, it
    is necessary to define a mechanism by which\n   specific resources (links and/or
    nodes) of an underlay network can be\n   used by a specific network slice, VPN,
    or set of VPNs.  This document\n   sets out such a mechanism for use in Segment
    Routing networks.\n\n\t "

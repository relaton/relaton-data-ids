  content: "   This document describes SPAKE2 which is a protocol for two parties\n
    \  that share a password to derive a strong shared key without\n   disclosing
    the password.  This method is compatible with any group,\n   is computationally
    efficient, and SPAKE2 has a security proof.  This\n   document predated the CFRG
    PAKE competition and it was not selected,\n   however, given existing use of variants
    in Kerberos and other\n   applications it was felt publication was beneficial.
    \ Applications\n   that need a symmetric PAKE (password authenticated key exchange)
    and\n   where hashing onto an elliptic curve at execution time is not\n   possible
    can use SPAKE2.  This document is a product of the Crypto\n   Forum Research Group
    (CFRG) in the IRTF.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document aims to make protocol designers aware of privacy-\nrelated
    design choices and offers guidance for developing privacy\nconsiderations for
    IETF documents.  While specifications cannot\npolice the implementation community,
    nonetheless protocol architects\nmust play in the improvement of privacy, both
    by making a conscious\ndecision to design for privacy, and by documenting privacy
    risks in\nprotocol designs.\n\nThis document is discussed on the Internet Privacy
    Discussion mailing\nlist (see https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy).\n\t "

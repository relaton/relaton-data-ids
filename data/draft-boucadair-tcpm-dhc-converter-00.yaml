abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Because of the lack of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support at the server\n
    \  side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model\n   that
    relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called\n   Converters.  Network-assisted
    MPTCP deployment models are designed to\n   facilitate the adoption of MPTCP for
    the establishment of multi-path\n   communications without making any assumption
    about the support of\n   MPTCP by the communicating peers.  Converters located
    in the network\n   are responsible for establishing multi-path communications
    on behalf\n   of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities to\n
    \  achieve different goals that include (but are not limited to)\n   optimization
    of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of\n   resiliency (e.g., primary/backup
    communication paths), and traffic\n   offload management.\n\n   This document
    focuses on the explicit deployment scheme where the\n   identity of the Converters
    is explicitly configured on connected\n   hosts.  This document specifies DHCP
    (IPv4 and IPv6) options to\n   configure hosts with Converters parameters.\n\n\n\t "

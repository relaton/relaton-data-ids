  content: "   A relying party verifying a JSON Web Token (JWT) needs to verify that\n
    \  the public key used to verify the signature legitimately represents\n   the
    issuer represented in the \"iss\" claim of the JWT.  Today, relying\n   parties
    commonly use the \"iss\" claim to fetch a set of authorized\n   signing keys over
    HTTPS, relying on the security of HTTPS to\n   establish the authority of the
    downloaded keys for that issuer.  The\n   ephemerality of this proof of authority
    makes it unsuitable for use\n   cases where a JWT might need to be verified for
    some time.  In this\n   document, we define a format for Proofs of Issuer Key
    Authority,\n   which establish the authority of a key using a signed object instead\n
    \  of an HTTPS connection.\n\n\t "

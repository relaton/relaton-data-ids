  content: "The IETF brings together a technical community that shares a\ncommon dedication
    to making the best possible engineering choices\nand protocol standards for the
    Internet as whole.  The community\nshares a number of common beliefs, which create
    the basis of a\ncommon work style and inform many of the decisions made within
    the\nIETF.  As in many communities of believers, some of these beliefs\nhave been
    elevated to the status of dogma.  In the process of\nconsidering reform, the treatment
    of these as unquestionable may\nbe hindering progress.  This document challenges
    some of the\nbeliefs which the author believes have become dogmatic.  It also\npresents
    two visions for the evolution of the IETF and articulates\na single belief.\n\t "

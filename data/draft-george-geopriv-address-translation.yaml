  content: "This document explains how to map a geodetic datum to a civic address\nand
    vice versa.  Server accepts an HTTP POST with one form of user\nspecified location
    addresses and return whatever other form it has.\n\n[Open Issue : re-frame this
    draft as more about the inclusion of a\n<presence> element in a HELD request,
    rather than about geocoding\nspecifically, since there are other applications.
    \ E.g., we might\nprovide a rough location in our request to help the server provide
    us\nwith GPS assistance data.]\n\t "

  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER extension as defined in RFC
    3515 automatically establishes a typically short-lived event subscription used
    to notify the party sending a REFER request about the receiver's status in executing
    the transaction requested by the REFER.  These notifications are not needed in
    all cases.  This specification provides a way to prevent the automatic establishment
    of an event subscription and subsequent notifications using a new SIP extension
    header field that may be included in a REFER request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

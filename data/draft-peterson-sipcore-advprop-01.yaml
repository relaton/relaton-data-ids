  content: "In common SIP practice, a two-phase \"offer/answer\" exchange of\nsession
    description documents negotiates preferences, capabilities\nand requested sessions.
    \ However, the structure of the session\ndescription greatly confuses the disambiguation
    of these elements and\nthus the clear characterization of sessions.  The current
    work\nproposes an alternative to the offer/answer model which leverages\npre-association
    between user agents to recast those two phases into a\nless ambiguous form: an
    Advertisement of capabilities and preferences\nwhich occurs in non-real-time before
    a session is ever requested,\nwhich is followed during session establishment by
    a unidirectional\nand complete Proposal of a session.\n\t "

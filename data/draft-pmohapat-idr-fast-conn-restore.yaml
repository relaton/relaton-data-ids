  content: "   A BGP route defines an association of an address prefix with an \"exit\n
    \  point\" from the current Autonomous System (AS).  If the exit point\n   becomes
    unreachable due to a failure, the route becomes invalid.\n   This usually triggers
    an exchange of BGP control messages after which\n   a new BGP route for the given
    prefix is installed.  However,\n   connectivity can be restored more quickly if
    the router maintains\n   precomputed BGP backup routes.  It can then switch to
    a backup route\n   immediately upon learning that an exit point is unreachable,
    without\n   needing to wait for the BGP control messages exchange.  This document\n
    \  specifies the procedures to be used by BGP to maintain and distribute\n   the
    precomputed backup routes.  Maintaining these additional routes\n   is also useful
    in promoting load balancing, performing maintenance\n   without causing traffic
    loss, and in reducing churn in the BGP\n   control plane.\n\n\t "

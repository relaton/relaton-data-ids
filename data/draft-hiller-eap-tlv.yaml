  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 2284,\nprovides
    for support of multiple authentication methods. While EAP was\noriginally created
    for use with PPP, it has since been adopted for use\nwith IEEE 802.1X 'Network
    Port Authentication'.\n\nSince its deployment, a number of weaknesses in EAP have
    become\napparent.  These include the lack of protection for, and acknowledgement\nof
    Success and Failure messages.\n\t "

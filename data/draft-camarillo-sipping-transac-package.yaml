  content: "   SIP provides a SIP Events notification framework that is extensible\n
    \  throught the addition of event packages. This document defines a\n   transaction
    event package for the SIP Events notification, along with\n   a data format used
    in notifications for this package. The transaction\n   package allows users to
    subscribe to a resource in an application\n   server and receive notifications
    about the changes in state of\n   transactions the application server initiates
    as part of a service.\n   Additionally, we define a new SIP Associated-Transactions-State\n
    \  header field that allows a server to return a subscrible URI that\n   provides
    transactions notification information.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a process intended to organize the future development
    of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related work in the Real-time Applications
    and Infrastructure (RAI) Area. As the environments in which SIP is deployed grow
    more numerous and diverse, modifying or extending SIP in certain ways may threaten
    the interoperability and security of the protocol; however, the IETF process must
    also cater to the realities of existing deployments and serve the needs of the
    implementers working with SIP. This document therefore defines the functions of
    two long-lived working groups in the RAI Area that are, respectively, responsible
    for the maintenance of the core SIP specifications and the development of new
    efforts to extend and apply work in this space. This document obsoletes RFC 3427.
    This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"

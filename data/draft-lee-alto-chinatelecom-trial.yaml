  content: "      This document reports the experience of China Telecom in a recent\n
    \  experiment with the ALTO service and P2P caches deployment. It is\n   found
    that the deployment of the ALTO service significantly improves\n   the capability
    of a Service Provider to affect the distribution of\n   P2P traffic. It is also
    found that a traffic localized ALTO policy\n   may decrease the download speed
    of a P2P user. However, the\n   deployment of some P2P caches can compensate such
    influence.\n\n\t "

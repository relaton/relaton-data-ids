  content: "   End devices are implementing Randomized and Changing MAC addresses\n
    \  (RCM), with the advertised goal of improving the user privacy, by\n   making
    the continued association between a MAC address and a personal\n   device more
    difficult.  RCM may be disruptive to some network\n   services.  This document
    is a collection of best practices for the\n   general implementation of network
    services within an RCM context.\n\n\t "

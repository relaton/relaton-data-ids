  content: "Cryptographically generated addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses \nwhere
    the interface identifier is generated by hashing the address \nowner's public
    key. The address owner can then use the \ncorresponding private key to assert
    address ownership and to sign \nmessages sent from the address without any additional
    security \ninfrastructure. This document describes a generic CGA format that \ncan
    be used in multiple applications.  \n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "Many home user networks or enterprise networks are using the address\ntranslation
    technology (NAT[1]) at the boundary of their end-networks\nfor various reasons.\nOne
    disadvantage of the use of the address translation technology is\nthat it might
    disable two-way transparent communication.\nThis document specifies the enhancement
    of the address translation\ntechnology, which it adds 'sub-address' to current
    IP address space to\nenable NAT inside/outside hosts to setup transparent communication
    in\nboth direction through enhanced NAT routers.\nThis enhancement is called  'C-NATS'
    (Capsulated Network Address\nTranslation with Sub-Address) and the word 'NATS'
    used in this\ndocument implies 'C-NATS'.\n\t "

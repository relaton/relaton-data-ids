- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Currently, constraint routing (CR) and traffic engineering (TE)\nmodels
    do not take into consideration the big picture view of IP\ntraffic traversing
    multiple autonomous systems (AS). Most of the\ntraffic and constraint routing
    is based on IGP protocols such as\nOSPF/ISIS, etc. The resulting view of the Internet
    is limited to \none autonomous system and areas or systems within it. Hence, the
    \nrouting/forwarding functions do not select the optimum path for \npackets that
    need to traverse several autonomous systems. \nThe proposal in this draft is that
    the BGP protocol can be utilized \nto choose the best BGP routes based on traffic
    engineered (TE) \nconstraint weights. This information can be propagated between
    all \nBGP peers and calculated by the BGP AS border routers before it is \ndeployed
    to their forwarding tables.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of this document is to define a framework for an Access\n
    \  Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an\n   Access
    Node (e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer\n   (DSLAM)) in a multi-service
    reference architecture in order to\n   perform QoS-related, service-related and
    Subscriber-related\n   operations.  The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure
    that the\n   transmission of the information does not need to go through distinct\n
    \  element managers but rather using a direct device-device\n   communication.
    \ This allows for performing access link related\n   operations within those network
    elements, while avoiding impact on\n   the existing OSS systems.\n\t "

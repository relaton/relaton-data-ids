    status of Web resources. Specifically it employs the Platform for Internet Content
    Selection (PICS) [2] label format to associate web resources with their copyright
    and usage information. This in turn can be used by search engines, proxy servers,
    agents, clients, and users for content selection or to aid in rights compliance.
    This document employs the copy control system described in [1].\n\t "

  content: "   The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport\n
    \  protocol (ROUTE protocol) is specified for robust delivery of\n   Application
    Objects, including Application Objects with real-time\n   delivery constraints,
    to receivers over a unidirectional transport.\n   Application Objects consist
    of data that has meaning to applications\n   that use the ROUTE protocol for delivery
    of data to receivers, for\n   example, it can be a file, or a DASH or HLS segment,
    a WAV audio\n   clip, etc. The ROUTE protocol also supports low-latency streaming\n
    \  applications.\n\n   The ROUTE protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast,
    and multicast\n   transport. Therefore, it can be run over IP/UDP including multicast\n
    \  IP. The ROUTE protocol can leverage the features of the underlying\n   protocol
    layer, e.g. to provide security it can leverage IP security\n   protocols such
    as IPSec.\n\n   This document specifies the ROUTE protocol such that it could
    be used\n   by a variety of applications for delivery of Application Objects by\n
    \  specifying their own profiles of this protocol (e.g. by adding or\n   constraining
    some features).\n\n\t "

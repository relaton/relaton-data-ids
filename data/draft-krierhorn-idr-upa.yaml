  content: "   Summarization is often used in multi-domain networks to improve\n   network
    efficiency and scalability.  With summarization in place,\n   there is a need
    to signal loss of reachability to an individual\n   prefix covered by the summary.
    \ This enables fast convergence by\n   steering traffic away from the node which
    owns the prefix and is no\n   longer reachable.\n\n   This mechanism, referred
    to as Unreachable Prefix Announcement (UPA),\n   has been specified for IGPs.
    \ This document specifies an and\n   equivalent BGP mechanism for multi-AS networks
    where BGP is used to\n   carry summary routes.\n\n\t "

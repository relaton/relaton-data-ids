  content: "   With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber security and data\n
    \  protection are of increasing importance.  This is especially the case\n   regarding
    cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with\n   the physical world.
    \ Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to\n   financial and physical damage
    and endanger human lives and well-\n   being.  Thus, hard security and privacy
    requirements are necessary to\n   be met.  Furthermore, a thorough investigation
    of incidents is\n   essential for ultimate protection.  Computing in the Network
    (COIN)\n   allows the processing of traffic and data directly in the network and\n
    \  at line-rate.  Thus, COIN presents a promising solution for\n   efficiently
    providing security and privacy mechanisms as well as\n   network monitoring.  This
    document discusses select mechanisms to\n   demonstrate how COIN concepts can
    be applied to counter existing\n   shortcomings of cyber security and data privacy.\n\n\t "

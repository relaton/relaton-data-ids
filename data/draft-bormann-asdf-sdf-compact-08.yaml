  script: Latn
  content: "   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts\n
    \  to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models\n   that
    describe Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for\n   interaction
    over a network.  It was created as a common language for\n   use in the development
    of the One Data Model liaison organization\n   (OneDM) definitions.  Tools convert
    this format to database formats\n   and other serializations as needed.\n\n   The
    SDF format is mainly intended for interchange between machine\n   generation and
    machine processing.  However, there is often a need\n   for humans to look at
    and edit SDF models.\n\n   Similar to the way Relax-NG as defined in ISO/IEC 19757-2
    has an XML-\n   based format and a compact format (its Annex C), this specification\n
    \  defines a compact format to go along SDF's JSON-based format.\n\n   The present
    version of this document is mostly a proof of concept,\n   but was deemed useful
    to obtain initial feedback on the approach\n   taken.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This paper extends Shannon's concept of a 'work factor' as applied
    to\n   evaluation of cryptographic algorithms to provide an objective\n   measure
    of the practical security offered by a protocol or\n   infrastructure design.
    \ Considering the hypothetical work factor\n   based on an informed estimate of
    the probable capabilities of an\n   attacker with unknown resources provides a
    better indication of the\n   relative strength of protocol designs than the computational
    work\n   factor of the best-known attack.\n\n   The social work factor is a measure
    of the trustworthiness of a\n   credential issued in a PKI based on the cost of
    having obtained the\n   credential through fraud at a certain point in time.  Use
    of the\n   social work factor allows evaluation of Certificate Authority based\n
    \  trust models and peer to peer (Web of Trust) models to be evaluated\n   in
    the same framework.  The analysis demonstrates that both\n   approaches have limitations
    and that in certain applications, a\n   blended model is superior to either by
    itself.\n\n   The final section of the paper describes a proposal to realize this\n
    \  blended model using the Mathematical Mesh.\n\n   [Note to Readers]\n\n   Discussion
    of this draft takes place on the MATHMESH mailing list\n   (mathmesh@ietf.org),
    which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.\n\n

  content: "   This document reviews the history of IPv6 address delegation and\n
    \  examines some of the technical implications of various allocation\n   policies
    in terms of their impact on long-term address space\n   utilization and aggregation.
    The purpose of this document is to\n   stimulate discussion and foster improved
    understanding of the\n   implications of various policies, so that appropriate
    policies are\n   adopted that preserve the long-term scalability of IPv6.\n\t "

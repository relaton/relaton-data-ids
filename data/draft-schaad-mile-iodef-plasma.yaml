  content: "   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a XML\n
    \  representation for information about computer security incidents.\n   The driver
    for the standardization effort for IODEF is the desire to\n   share the information
    as part of the cybersecurity response.  As the\n   security considerations of
    RFC5070 notes, the data can be sensitive\n   and should only be disclosed to appropriate
    parties.  This document\n   describes how to use the Plasma policy enforcement
    model to ensure\n   access to the IODEF data follows the appropriate policies
    in a\n   distributed environment and independent of the transports used to\n   share
    the information.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The purpose of this draft is to extend RFC 1958 and RFC 3439\n   analysing
    the design principles that govern the Internet\n   Architecture, evaluate how
    then have evolved since they were\n   initially introduced and how we expect to
    evolve in the near future.\n   We describe a number of design principle, discuss
    their implications\n   on the Internet architecture, design and engineering.\n\n
    \  The work has been based on the outcome of the ad-hoc European\n   Commission
    Future Internet Architecture (FIArch) group.\n\n\n\t "

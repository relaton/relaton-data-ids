  content: "Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is a reliable multicast transport protocol
    for applications that require ordered or unordered, duplicate- free, multicast
    data delivery from multiple sources to multiple receivers.  PGM guarantees that
    a receiver in the group either receives all data packets from transmissions and
    repairs, or is able to detect unrecoverable data packet loss.  PGM is specifically
    intended as a workable solution for multicast applications with basic reliability
    requirements.  Its central design goal is simplicity of operation with due regard
    for scalability and network efficiency.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

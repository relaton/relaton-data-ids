  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or\n
    \  green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-\n   BGP)now
    plays an important role in the transition of the core as well\n   as edge from
    IPv4 to IPv6.  Operators can now continue to support\n   legacy IPv4, VPN-IPv4,
    and Multicast VPN-IPv4 customers.\n\n   This document describes the critical use
    case and OPEX savings of\n   being able to leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange
    usage as a pure\n   transport, allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over
    the same\n   BGP TCP session.  By doing so, allows for the elimination of Dual\n
    \  Stacking on the PE-CE connections.  Thus making the eBGP peering\n   IPv6-ONLY
    to now carry both IPv4 and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability\n   Information (NLRI).\n\n
    \  This document now provides a solution for IXPs (Internet Exchange\n   points)
    that are facing IPv4 address depletion at these peering\n   points to use BGP-MP
    capability exchange defined in [RFC8950] to\n   carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability
    Information) NLRI in an IPv6\n   next hop using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This\n
    \  openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but\n   it
    can allow communications that may be viewed as either desirable or\n   undesirable
    by different parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown,\n   so have mechanisms
    to limit the extent and impact of abusive or\n   allegedly illegal communications.
    \ Recently, there has been an\n   increasing emphasis on \"blocking\", the active
    prevention of abusive\n   or allegedly illegal communications.  This document
    examines several\n   technical approaches to Internet content blocking in terms
    of their\n   alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  In general, the\n
    \  approach to content blocking that is most coherent with the Internet\n   architecture
    is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable\n   services, so that the
    communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or\n   illegal communications.\n\n\t "

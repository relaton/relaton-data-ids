  content: "The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be carried out
    by various persons or entities.  The RFC Editor model presented in this document
    divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into four functions: The RFC Series
    Editor, the Independent Submission Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the
    RFC Publisher.  It also introduces the RFC Series Advisory Group and an (optional)
    Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board.  The model outlined here is intended
    to increase flexibility and operational support options, provide for the orderly
    succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the RFC series, while
    maintaining RFC quality and timely processing, ensuring document accessibility,
    reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "The SELECT protocol allows Internet users to supply their ratings of\nInternet
    documents, and to use ratings provided by other users to\nfilter and select what
    to read In particular, SELECT supports so-called\ncollaborative filtering. By
    this is meant that the filtering and\nselection for a particular user is made
    based on ratings provided by\nspecial groups of raters, such as peer groups, people
    with similar\nvalues, interests and expertise as the person for whom the selecting\nand
    filtering is done.\n\nThe SELECT functionality is downwards compatible with PICS
    [PICS 1,\nPICS 2], but a major difference is that while PICS is mainly oriented\ntowards
    keeping out unsuitable information from children\n(blackballing), SELECT is mainly
    oriented towards helping people find\nthe best and most valuable information for
    them on the Internet\n(goldballing). A syntactical difference from PICS is that
    the encodings\nin SELECT are using the XML encoding format.\n\t "

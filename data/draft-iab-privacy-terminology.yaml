  content: "   Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout the\n
    \  last few millennia.  Its most striking feature is the difficulty that\n   disparate
    parties encounter when they attempt to precisely define it.\n   In order to discuss
    privacy in a meaningful way, a tightly defined\n   context is necessary.  The
    specific context of privacy used within\n   this document is that of personal
    data in Internet protocols.\n   Personal data is any information relating to a
    data subject, where a\n   data subject is an identified natural person or a natural
    person who\n   can be identified, directly or indirectly.\n\n   A lot of work
    within the IETF involves defining protocols that can\n   potentially transport
    (either explicitly or implicitly) personal\n   data.  This document aims to establish
    a consistent lexicon around\n   privacy for IETF contributors to use when discussing
    privacy\n   considerations within their work.\n\n   Note: This document is discussed
    at\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a few scenarios where PW redundancy is needed.
    A set of redundant PWs is configured between PE nodes in SS- PW applications,
    or between T-PE nodes in MS-PW applications. In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to
    indicate the preferred PW path to forward to one another, a new status bit is
    needed to indicate the preferential forwarding status of active or standby for
    each PW in the redundancy set as defined in [7]. Conventions used in this document
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].</p>

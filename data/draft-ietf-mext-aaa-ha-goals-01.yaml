abstract:
- content: "<p>In commercial and enterprise deployments, Mobile IPv6 can be a service
    offered by a Mobility Services Provider (MSP). In this case, all protocol operations
    may need to be explicitly authorized and traced, requiring the interaction between
    Mobile IPv6 and the AAA infrastructure. Integrating the Authentication, Authorization,
    and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure (e.g., Network Access Server and AAA server)
    also offers a solution component for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping. This document
    describes various scenarios where a AAA interface for Mobile IPv6 is required.
    Additionally, it lists design goals and requirements for such an interface. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"

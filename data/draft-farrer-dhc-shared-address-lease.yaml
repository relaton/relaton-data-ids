  content: "   This memo describes an update to [RFC2131], which enables the dynamic\n
    \  leasing of shared IPv4 addresses and layer 4 source ports to DHCPv4\n   over
    DHCPv6 clients [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].  Shared\n   addressing allows
    a single IPv4 address to be allocated to multiple,\n   active clients simulataneously.
    \ Clients sharing the same address are\n   then differentiated by unique L4 source
    ports.\n\n\n\t "

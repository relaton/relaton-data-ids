  script: Latn
  content: "        This draft describes network time synchronization mechanisms that\n
    \       may enable increased accuracy, beyond that possible with the current\n
    \       Network Time Protocol version 4 standard, to the time of computer\n        clocks.
    The mechanisms considered are those that will provide\n        improved estimates
    as to when a packet is put on the network,\n        transferred across a network,
    or taken from the network. Potential\n        standardization actions will be
    considered for the mechanisms\n        considered, though no such actions are
    recommended at this time.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes network time synchronization mechanisms that may
    enable increased accuracy, beyond that possible with the current Network Time
    Protocol version 4 standard, to the time of computer clocks. The mechanisms considered
    are those that will provide improved estimates as to when a packet is put on the
    network, transferred across a network, or taken from the network. Potential standardization
    actions will be considered for the mechanisms considered, though no such actions
    are recommended at this time.</p>"

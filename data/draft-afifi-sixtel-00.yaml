  script: Latn
  content: "We propose an architecture for the support of IPv6 over cellular mobile\nnetworks.
    The architecture is adapted to the characteristics of global\ncellular systems
    offering connectivity to very large numbers of subscribers (e.g. 3GPP). We are
    also concerned with particularities of the cellular air interfaces. The architecture
    takes in consideration   mobile IPv6 terminals. Finally, it gives a way of protection
    of the available network resources and of the subscribers confidentialities with
    an on demand security mechanism.\n\n\t "

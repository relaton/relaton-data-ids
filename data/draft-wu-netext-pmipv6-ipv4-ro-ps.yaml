  script: Latn
  content: "[ID-PMIP6-RO-PS] describes the problem space of localized routing\nwhich
    allows end-to-end user traffic forwarding between MN and CN\ndirectly without
    involving Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a single\nProxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213]
    domain. However, localized routing with\nIPv4 support which allows IPv4 transport
    between MAG and LMA and/or\nIPv4 enabled user traffic between MN and CN is not
    considered. This\ndocument details the scenarios and problem statement for localized\nrouting
    with IPv4 support.\n\t "

  content: "   Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can\n
    \  occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is\n   especially
    true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns\n   can vary greatly
    between receivers.  One technique that can be used\n   to recover from packet
    loss without incurring unbounded delay for all\n   the receivers is to duplicate
    the packets and send them in separate\n   redundant streams.  This document explains
    how Real-time Transport\n   Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without breaking
    RTP media\n   streams, or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.\n\n\t "

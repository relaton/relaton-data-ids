  content: "   This document describes a mechanism to transfer digital credentials\n
    \  securely between two devices.  Secure credentials may represent a\n   digital
    key to a hotel room, a digital key to a door lock in a house\n   or a digital
    key to a car.  Devices that share credentials may belong\n   to the same or two
    different platforms (e.g. iOS and Android).\n   Secure transfer may include one
    or more write and read operations.\n   Credential transfer needs to be performed
    securely due to the\n   sensitive nature of the information.\n\n\t "

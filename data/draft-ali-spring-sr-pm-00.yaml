abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
    accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related
    metrics such as delay variation and channel throughput in MPLS networks. This
    document describes how these mechanisms can be used for performance measurements
    in Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) networks. The document also
    specifies how similar mechanisms can be used for performance measurement in Segment
    Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) networks.</p>"

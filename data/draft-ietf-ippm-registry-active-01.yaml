  content: "   This memo defines the Active Performance Metrics sub-registry of the\n
    \  Performance Metric Registry.  This sub-registry will contain Active\n   Performance
    Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the\n   IP Performance Metrics
    (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and possibly\n   applicable to other IETF metrics.
    \ Three aspects make IPPM metric\n   registration difficult: (1) Use of the Type-P
    notion to allow users\n   to specify their own packet types. (2) Use of flexible
    input\n   variables, called Parameters in IPPM definitions, some of which\n   determine
    the quantity measured and others of which should not be\n   specified until execution
    of the measurement. (3) Allowing\n   flexibility in choice of statistics to summarize
    the results on a\n   stream of measurement packets.\n\n   This memo proposes a
    way to organize registry entries into columns\n   that are well-defined, permitting
    consistent development of entries\n   over time (a column may marked NA if it
    is not applicable for that\n   metric).  The design is intended to foster development
    of registry\n   entries based on existing reference RFCs, whilst each column serves\n
    \  as a check-list item to avoid omissions during the registration\n   process.
    \ Every entry in the registry, before IANA action, requires\n   Expert review
    as defined by concurrent IETF work in progress\n   \"Registry for Performance
    Metrics\" (draft-ietf-ippm-metric-registry).\n\n   The document contains two examples:
    a registry entry for an active\n   Performance Metric entry based on RFC3393 and
    RFC5481, and a registry\n   entry for an end-point Performance Metric based on
    RFC 7003.  The\n   examples are for Informational purposes and do not create any
    entry\n   in the IANA registry.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   BIER provides stateless multicast in BIER domains using bitstrings
    to\n   indicate receivers.  BIER-TE extends BIER with tree engineering\n   capabilities.
    \ Both suffer from scalability problems in large\n   networks as bitstrings are
    of limited size so the BIER domains need\n   to be subdivided using set identifiers
    so that possibly many packets\n   need to be sent to reach all receivers of a
    multicast group within a\n   subdomain.\n\n   This problem can be mitigated by
    encoding explicit multicast trees in\n   packet headers with bitstrings that have
    only node-local\n   significance.  A drawback of this method is that any hop on
    the path\n   needs to be encoded so that long paths consume lots of header space.\n\n
    \  This document presents the idea of Segment Routed Recursive Tree\n   Structures
    (RTS), a unifying approach in which a packet header\n   representing a multicast
    distribution tree is constructed from a tree\n   structure of vertices (\"so called
    Recursive Units\") that support\n   replication to their next-hop neighbors either
    via local bitstrings\n   or via sequence of next-hop neighbor identifiers called
    SIDs.\n\n   RTS, like RBS is intended to expand the applicability of deployment\n
    \  for stateless multicast replication beyond what BIER and BIER-TE\n   support
    and expect: larger networks, less operational complexity, and\n   utilization
    of more modern forwarding planes as those expected to be\n   possible when BIER
    was designed (ca. 2010).\n\n   This document only specifies the forwarding plane
    but discusses\n   possible architectural options, which are primarily determined\n
    \  through the future definition/mapping to encapsulation headers and\n   controller-plane
    functions.\n\n\t "

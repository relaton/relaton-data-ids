  content: "To improve scalability of MPLS TE it may be useful to aggregate TE\nLSPs.
    \ The aggregation is accomplished by (a) an LSR creating a TE\nLSP, (b) the LSR
    forming a forwarding adjacency out of that LSP\n(advertising this LSP as a link
    into ISIS/OSPF), (c) allowing other\nLSRs to use forwarding adjacencies for their
    path computation, and\n(d) nesting of LSPs originated by other LSRs into that
    LSP (by using\nthe label stack construct).\nThis document describes the mechanisms
    to accomplish this.\n\n\t "

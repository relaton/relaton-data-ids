  content: "This document proposes a simple revision to Route Reflection that\nallows
    a Route Reflector to send a route advertisement (instead of a\nroute withdraw)
    in certain cases. The route advertisement helps\nnarrow the gap between Route
    Reflection and IBGP full-mesh in terms\nof routing information. It has been shown
    that the proposed mechanism\nhelps achieve stable route selection and eliminate
    a number of\npersistent route oscillations involving Route Reflection.\n\t "

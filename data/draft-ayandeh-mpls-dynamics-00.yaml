  script: Latn
  content: "   This Internet draft outlines how transients in protocols such as\n
    \  OSPF [7] (intra-domain routing) and MPLS LDP [2] can lead to periods\n   of
    time with loops and other undesirable routing phenomenon. It\n   defines a set
    of metrics to quantify this dynamic behavior.\n   Quantification of these metrics,
    using a simulation model, for\n   various local vs. egress label allocation schemes
    is used as the\n   basis of a comparative analysis. This includes quantifying
    any\n   incremental impact that MPLS may have once it is introduced into an\n
    \  autonomous IP routing area. The resulting insights would help\n   develop a
    better understanding of routing dynamics. This includes\n   identifying key nodal
    and network variables which impact routing\n   dynamics hence guiding MPLS feature
    selection and IP network design.\n\n\t "

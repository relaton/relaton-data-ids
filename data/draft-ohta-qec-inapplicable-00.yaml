- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Though quantum error correction assumes localized error model of Shor\n
    \  that errors on a qubit are caused by interaction with its local\n   environment,
    enabling essentially classical error correction for\n   unentangled states, the
    model is applied to entangled states\n   improperly without involving local environment
    states in the\n   entanglement.\n\n   That is, when an entangled state (Q) is
    represented as superposition\n   of unentangled terms (Qi) as Q=Q1+Q2+...+Qn,
    local environment states\n   around qubits are, in general, different term by
    term. Q will be,\n   with term-specific error operators (Ei), E1*Q1+E2*Q2+...+En*Qn,
    not,\n   with a common error operator (E) assumed by Shor, E*(Q1+Q2+...+Qn).\n\n
    \  A complication is that Shor's error model is a little quantum,\n   allowing
    for two different local environment states around a qubit.\n   As such, quantum
    error correction is applicable to some trivially\n   entangled states including
    states used by Shor code but not to really\n   entangled states.\n\n\t "

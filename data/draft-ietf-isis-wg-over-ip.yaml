  content: "This draft describes an optional implementation technique within\nIS-IS
    [ISO90, Cal90a, Cal90b] used today by several ISPs for routing\nwithin their clouds.
    \ IS-IS is an interior gateway routing protocol\ndeveloped originally by OSI and
    used with IP extensions as IGP. This\ndraft describes how to encapsulate IS-IS
    packets in IPv4 [Pos81]\nformat.  Such an encapsulation has many advantages, one
    of those\nbeing the possibility to run integrated IS-IS on anything that\nunderstands
    IPv4, including avian carriers [Wai90].  Encapsulation of\nIS-IS PDUs in IPv6
    is outside the scope of this document.\n\t "

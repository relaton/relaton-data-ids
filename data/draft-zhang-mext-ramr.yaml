  content: "The Router Advertisement message in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol \n[2]
    contains an 8-bit field reserved for single-bit flags. Several \nprotocols have
    reserved flags in this field and others are preparing \nto reserve a sufficient
    number of flags to exhaust the field. This \ndocument defines a flag to the Router
    Advertisement message that \nextends the available number of flag bits available.
    The extended \nflag defined in this document is mainly used by Mobile Router to
    \nidentify its location. \n\n\t "

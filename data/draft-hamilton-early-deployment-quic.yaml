abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and secure\n
    \  transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for\n   HTTP/2
    semantics.  While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application\n   protocol, QUIC
    builds on decades of transport and security\n   experience, and implements mechanisms
    that make it attractive as a\n   modern general-purpose transport.  QUIC provides
    multiplexing and\n   flow control equivalent to HTTP/2, security equivalent to
    TLS, and\n   connection semantics, reliability, and congestion control equivalent\n
    \  to TCP.  This draft documents the early deployment of the QUIC\n   protocol
    prior to standardization.\n\n\t "

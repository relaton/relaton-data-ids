  content: "There are situations following LDP session establishment where it\n   would
    be useful for an LDP speaker to know when its peer has\n   advertised all of its
    labels.  These include session establishment\n   when LDP-IGP sync is in use and
    session re-establishment following\n   loss of an LDP session when LDP graceful
    restart is in use.  The LDP\n   specification provides no mechanism for an LDP
    speaker to notify a\n   peer when it has completed its initial label advertisements
    to that\n   peer.  This document specifies means for an LDP speaker to signal\n
    \  completion of its initial label advertisements following session\n   establishment.\n\t "

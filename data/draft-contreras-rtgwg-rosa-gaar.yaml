  content: "   The term 'service-based routing' (SBR) captures the set of mechanisms\n
    \  for the steering of traffic in an application-level service scenario.\n   We
    position this steering as an anycast problem, requiring the\n   selection of one
    of the possibly many choices for service execution\n   at the very start of a
    service transaction.\n\n   This document builds on the issues and pain points
    identified across\n   a range of use cases, reported in [I-D.mendes-rtgwg-rosa-use-cases].\n
    \  We summarize the key insights and provide a gap analysis with key\n   technologies
    related to the problem of SBR, developed by the IETF\n   over many years.  We
    further outline the requirements to a system\n   that would adequately close those
    gaps and thus address the pain\n   points of our use cases.  Those requirements
    will be used for\n   outlining a suitable architecture framework in a separate
    document.\n\n\t "

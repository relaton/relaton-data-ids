    \  criteria for the evaluation of forwarding plane mechanisms intended\n   to
    be used within the DetNet WG as well as by implementers, operators\n   and vendors
    that need to compare and select such mechanisms.\n\n   This document is not intended
    to become an RFC but does at this point\n   in time soslely intend to help the
    process of documentation,\n   assessment and comparison.  The goals of this memo
    may change in\n   later revisions.\n\n\t "

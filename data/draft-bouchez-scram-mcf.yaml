  content: "   This document specifies SCRAM-MCF, an extension to the Salted\n   Challenge
    Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) family of SASL\n   mechanisms ([RFC5802])
    and HTTP Digest extensions ([RFC7616],\n   [RFC7677]).\n\n   The extension replaces
    the PBKDF2-specific iteration count attributes\n   i= and s= in the server-first-message
    with a generic Modular Crypt\n   Format (MCF) descriptor f=. This allows servers
    to use modern memory-\n   hard key derivation functions such as Argon2, SCrypt,
    or bcrypt while\n   preserving the full security properties and message flow of
    SCRAM.\n\n   The change is fully backward compatible: servers can continue sending\n
    \  i= and s= for legacy clients and only send f= (or both) when the\n   client
    advertises support.\n\n   This document is intended to be discussed and potentially
    adopted by\n   the KITTEN working group.  Feedback from the KITTEN WG is welcome
    on\n   the kitten@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t "

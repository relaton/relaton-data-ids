abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies SCRAM-MCF, an extension to the Salted Challenge
    Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) family of SASL mechanisms ([RFC5802])
    and HTTP Digest extensions ([RFC7616], [RFC7677]). The extension replaces the
    PBKDF2-specific iteration count attributes i= and s= in the server-first-message
    with a generic Modular Crypt Format (MCF) descriptor f=. This allows servers to
    use modern memory- hard key derivation functions such as Argon2, SCrypt, or bcrypt
    while preserving the full security properties and message flow of SCRAM. The change
    is fully backward compatible: servers can continue sending i= and s= for legacy
    clients and only send f= (or both) when the client advertises support. This document
    is intended to be discussed and potentially adopted by the KITTEN working group.
    Feedback from the KITTEN WG is welcome on the kitten@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"

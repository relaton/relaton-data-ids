  content: "This document addresses the support of IPv6 QoS aware real-time\nservices
    over IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] networks.  In particular, it\nprovides a novel solution
    to overcome the limitations of the IEEE\n802.16-2004 [2] system to support real-time
    and dynamic environments.\nSpecifically, this solution supports dynamic and fast
    access from the\nMobile Nodes to the network services and dynamic reservations
    and\nmodifications of services.  These fast and dynamic reservations are\ncrucial
    to the support of fast mobility approaches.  Moreover, the\nproposed solution
    is also able to provide IPv6 support and efficient\ntraffic differentiation for
    services running on the same MN.\n\n\t "

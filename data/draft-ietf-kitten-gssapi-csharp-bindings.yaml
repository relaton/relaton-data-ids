  content: "   The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API)\n
    \  offers application programmers uniform access to security services\n   atop
    a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms.  This document\n   specifies
    the C# language bindings for GSS-API which is described at\n   a language independent
    conceptual level in RFC 2743 [RFC2743].\n\n   The GSS-API C# bindings were designed
    to emulate the Java bindings as\n   defined in RFC 2853 [RFC2853].\n\t "

  content: "   The BGP (RFC4271) Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute (TEA) is defined in\n
    \  RFC9012.  Currently proposed BGP specifications in the IDR and BESS\n   Working
    groups have defined new tunnels and new parameters for these\n   tunnels in Sub-TLV.
    \ The Segment Routing usage of the TEA has\n   suggested a number of new Sub-TLVs.
    \ This document provides\n   guidelines to help authors quickly write correct
    text for new tunnels\n   (defined in tunnel TLVs) and new Sub-TLVs.  These guidelines
    are\n   given as \"templates\" to aid new authors.  More experience authors\n
    \  should view these templates as a list of expected content.\n\n   One additional
    challenge for tunnels using the PMSI tunnels is to\n   carefully define the interaction
    between PMSI tunnels and TEA\n   tunnels.\n\n\t "

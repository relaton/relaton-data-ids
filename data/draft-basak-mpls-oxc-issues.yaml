  content: "This document describes the domain specific enhancements required to\nadapt
    MPLS traffic engineering control plane constructs to control\noptical cross-connects
    in emerging automatically switched optical\ntransport networks. These enhancements
    are within the framework of\nMultiprotocol LAMBDA switching proposed in [1]. Specifically,
    this\nmemo investigates the behavior of the MPLS based control plane\ntechnique
    for OXCs, and identifies required enhancements to both OXCs\nand to existing MPLS
    traffic engineering control plane objects\n(routing and signaling protocols) to
    support the application to OXCs.\n\t "

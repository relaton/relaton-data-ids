  content: "   This document proposes a new Request Header that must be initiated\n
    \  every time a user-agent sends XMLHttpRequest.  The aim of this header\n   is
    to limit the possibilities of XSS to RCE and preventing Javascript\n   from stealing
    CSRF tokens on other URLs of same domain.  This will\n   allow developers to block
    request if it wasn't supposed to be sent\n   via XMLHttpRequest.\n\n\t "

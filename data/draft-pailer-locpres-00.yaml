  content: "   This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol\n
    \  (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of location presence.\n   Presence
    is defined as the willingness and ability of a user to\n   communicate with other
    users on the network.  Presence data is\n   general information about the state
    of a user like \"on-line\" and\n   \"off-line\".  Location presence extends conventional
    presence by\n   taking the physical location of a user into account.  Location\n
    \  presence is information about the geographical position of a user.\n   Subscriptions
    and notifications of location presence are supported by\n   defining an event
    package within the general SIP event notification\n   framework.  This protocol
    is also compliant with the Common Presence\n   Profile (CPP) framework.\n\t "

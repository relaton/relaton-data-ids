  content: "This document reports the outcome of the Routing and Addressing Workshop
    that was held by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on October 18-19, 2006,
    in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The primary goal of the workshop was to develop a shared
    understanding of the problems that the large backbone operators are facing regarding
    the scalability of today's Internet routing system. The key workshop findings
    include an analysis of the major factors that are driving routing table growth,
    constraints in router technology, and the limitations of today's Internet addressing
    architecture. It is hoped that these findings will serve as input to the IETF
    community and help identify next steps towards effective solutions.\n\n Note that
    this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions
    documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and not of the
    IAB. Furthermore, note that work on issues related to this workshop report is
    continuing, and this document does not intend to reflect the increased understanding
    of issues nor to discuss the range of potential solutions that may be the outcome
    of this ongoing work. This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

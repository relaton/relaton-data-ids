  content: "   Ethernet Virtual Private Network Virtual Private Wire Services (EVPN\n
    \  VPWS) need to be deployed in high scale multi-domain networks, where\n   each
    domain can use a different transport technology, such as MPLS,\n   VXLAN or Segment
    Routing with MPLS or IPv6 Segment Identifiers\n   (SIDs).  While transport interworking
    solutions on border routers\n   spare the border routers from having to process
    service routes, they\n   do not always meet the multi-homing, redundancy, and
    operational\n   requirements, or provide the isolation that each domain requires.\n
    \  This document analyzes the scenarios in which an interconnect\n   solution
    for EVPN VPWS using EVPN Domain Gateways is needed, and adds\n   the required
    extensions to support it.\n\n\t "

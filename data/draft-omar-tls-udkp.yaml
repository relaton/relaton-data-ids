  content: "   In this document, I provide a high-level design for a new protocol
    in\n   the application layer of the TCP/IP suite that will build a secure\n   tunnel
    between the user's browser and the server without the\n   involvement of any third
    party. My proposed protocol is called User-\n   Defined Key Pair (UDKP), and its
    objective is to build a secure\n   tunnel between the user's browser and the server
    using a\n   public/private key pair generated for the user on the fly inside the\n
    \  user's browser based on the user credential information. This key\n   pair
    will be used by the protocol instead of the server certificate\n   as the starting
    point for creating the secure tunnel.\n\n\n\t "

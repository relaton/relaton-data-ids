  content: "A standard protocol is needed to integrate work providers, asynchronous\nservices,
    across the intranet/internet and provide for their interaction.\nThe integration
    and interactions consist of control and monitoring of the\nwork.  Control means
    creating the work, setting up the work, starting the\nwork, stopping the work,
    being informed of exceptions, being informed of\nthe completion of the work and
    getting the results of the work  Monitoring\nmeans checking on the current status
    of the work and getting a history of\nthe execution of the work. The protocol
    should be light weight and easy to\nimplement, so that a variety of devices and
    situations can be covered.\n \nThe Simple Workflow Access Protocol is a proposed
    way to solve this problem\nthrough use of HTTP protocol, and by transferring structured
    information\nencoded in XML.  A new set of HTTP methods is defined, as well as
    the\ninformation to be supplied and the information returned in XML, that\naccomplish
    the control of generic asynchronous services.  This has\napplicability to workflow
    because a workflow is itself an asynchronous\nservice, and it also has the need
    to be able to call asynchronous services\naoutside of itself.\n\t "

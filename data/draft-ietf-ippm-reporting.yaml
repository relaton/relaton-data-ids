  content: "The aim of this document is to define a small set of metrics that are\nrobust,
    easy to understand, orthogonal, relevant, and easy to\ncompute.  The IPPM WG has
    defined a large number of richly\nparameterized metrics because network measurement
    has many purposes.\nOften, the ultimate purpose is to report a concise set of
    metrics\ndescribing a network's current state to an end user.  It is for this\npurpose
    that the present set of metrics is defined, and the document\nis principally concerned
    with \"short-term\" reporting considerations\n(a few seconds or minutes as opposed
    to days, months or years.)\n\t "

  content: "[RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses  \nthat
    have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster  \nconvergence on
    topology change. The procedure also removes the MAC\n \naddresses in the VPLS
    that does not require relearning due to such  \ntopology change. This document
    defines an extension to MAC Address  \nWithdrawal procedure with empty MAC List
    [RFC4762], which enables a  \nProvider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC
    addresses that needs \n \n \n to be relearned.  \n  \n\nConventions used in this
    document \n\nIn examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client
    and \nserver respectively. \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\t "

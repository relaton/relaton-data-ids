  content: "This document is written to aid the process of selecting and \ncompleting
    the definition of the MIDCOM protocol, which will operate \nbetween MIDCOM agents
    and middleboxes such as firewalls and NATs.  It \ndescribes the semantics which
    the protocol must support.  These \nsemantics are derived from the MIDCOM requirements
    and the MIDCOM \nusage scenarios which helped to inspire the requirements.  \nThis
    document was derived from draft-taylor-midcom-semantics-00.txt.  \nThe present
    version incorporates tentative conclusions reached in \ndiscussion at the IETF
    54 meeting of the MIDCOM WG.  It removes the \nconcrete expression of the MIDCOM
    requests, responses, and \nnotifications in favour of those presented in draft-stiemerling-\nmidcom-semantics-xx.txt.

  content: "   This protocol enables an Authorization Server (AS) to issue access\n
    \  tokens to permit an end-user using a client software to perform\n   operations
    on a protected resource hosted by a Resource Server (RS).\n   These access tokens
    allow to support capabilities and/or user\n   attributes.\n\n   The protocol includes
    means of specifying how the end-user can\n   potentially be involved in an interactive
    fashion during the\n   process.  The client and/or the RS will use these interaction\n
    \  mechanisms to involve the end-user, as necessary, to take decisions.\n\n   The
    protocol uses HTTPS for all communications between the client\n   and the AS,
    as well as between the client and the RS.\n\n\n\t "

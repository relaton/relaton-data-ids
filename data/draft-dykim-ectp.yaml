  content: "       This document is a part of the ITU-T Recommendation and ISO/IEC
    \n       International Standard, named the Enhanced Communications Transport \n
    \      Protocol (ECTP), which is a multicast transport protocol designed to \n
    \      support Internet multicast applications. This third part of ECTP \n       (ECTP-3)
    describes the protocol specification for the duplex \n       multicast transport.
    In a duplex connection, a single multicast \n       sender, named TC-Owner (TO),
    transmits multicast data to the other \n       group members, while some of the
    participating TS-users may send \n       unicast data to the TO over the reverse
    data channel. \n\n\t "

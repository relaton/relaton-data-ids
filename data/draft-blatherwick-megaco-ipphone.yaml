  content: "This document is a proposal to add new event/signal packages and termi-\nnation
    classes to the Megaco protocol [3], to support an IP telephone\nMG.  The proposal
    covers the requirements (section 3), design approach\n(section 4) and resource/termination
    model (section 5) to be used for IP\ntelephones. The new event/signal packages
    and termination classes are\ndefined in sections 6 and 7 respectively.  Megaco
    protocol issues\naffecting effective implementation of IP telephones, including\ncomplexity,
    reliable transport, message encoding, security and others\nare presented in section
    8.  The proposal represents a current view from\nthe TIA working group on IP telephone
    specification, TIA TR-41.3.4, with\nthe intent of using this as part of its 'whole
    device' specification as\na method of device control.\n\n\t "

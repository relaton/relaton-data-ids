abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document is intended as clarification of LDP behaviour in link-\n
    \  down scenarios.  Base LDP RFC5036 lacks sufficient clarity on what an\n   LDP
    enabled node should be doing when a link down event is received,\n   and the only
    LDP adjacency for an LDP peer is over this link.\n   Different vendors have handled
    this scenario differently, with some\n   immediately resetting tcp session with
    neighbor and some waiting for\n   igp recovergence instead of reacting directly
    to link events.  With\n   this document we intend to clarify the expected behaviour
    explicitly\n   so that any interop issues can be avoided.\n\n\t "

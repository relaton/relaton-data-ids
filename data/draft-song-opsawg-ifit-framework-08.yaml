  content: "   For efficient network operation, most network operators rely on\n   traditional
    Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods,\n   which include proactive
    and reactive techniques, running in active\n   and passive modes.  As networks
    increase in scale, they become more\n   susceptible to measurement accuracy and
    misconfiguration errors.\n\n   With the advent of programmable data-plane, emerging
    on-path\n   telemetry techniques provide unprecedented flow insight and fast\n
    \  notification of network issues (e.g., jitter, increased latency,\n   packet
    loss, significant bit error variations, and unequal load-\n   balancing).\n\n
    \  This document outlines a reference architectural framework, In-situ\n   Flow
    Information Telemetry (iFIT), which enumerates several high\n   level components
    and describes how these components can be assembled\n   to achieve a complete
    and closed-loop working solution for on-path\n   telemetry.\n\n   iFIT addresses
    several deployment challenges for on-path telemetry\n   techniques, especially
    in carrier networks.  As an open framework, it\n   does not detail the implementation
    of the components as well as the\n   interface between the components.  Rather,
    the document summarizes\n   the current status and analyzes the gaps on related
    standard\n   developments.\n\n\n\t "

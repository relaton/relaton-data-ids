  content: "   [draft-liu-spring-sr-policy-energy-efficiency-00] describes how\n   energy
    consumption information is utilized for path selection in\n   Segment Routing
    (SR) networks. This document elaborates on extending\n   IGP protocols to carry
    energy consumption information, enabling its\n   dissemination within the IGP
    domain and ultimately transmitting it\n   to the controller. This allows the controller
    to perform routing\n   calculations based on energy consumption metrics.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses the creation of reliable multicast protocols that
    utilize negative-acknowledgment (NACK) feedback.  The rationale for protocol design
    goals and assumptions are presented.  Technical challenges for NACK-based (and
    in some cases general) reliable multicast protocol operation are identified.  These
    goals and challenges are resolved into a set of functional \"building blocks\"
    that address different aspects of reliable multicast protocol operation.  It is
    anticipated that these building blocks will be useful in generating different
    instantiations of reliable multicast protocols.  This document obsoletes RFC 3941.

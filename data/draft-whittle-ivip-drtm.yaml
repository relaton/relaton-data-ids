- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM) is intended for Ivip, but may be\nuseful
    for other Core-Edge Separation solutions to the routing\nscaling problem, such
    as LISP.  End-user networks - or other\norganizations they appoint - control the
    mapping of each or their one\nor more micronets (ranges of \"edge\" space with
    a single mapping) via\nsending commands to the organizations from whom they lease
    this\nspace.  This is conveyed to all ITRs which need it in \"real-time\"\nsuch
    as a second or two, globally.  There is no need for any single\nset of servers
    to handle all the mapping updates, or to store all the\nmapping databases for
    all the MABs (Mapped Address Block) of \"edge\"\nspace.  Networks with ITRs use
    purely caching Resolving query servers\n(QSRs), in contrast to previous Ivip arrangements
    which required them\nto run a query server which contained the real-time updated
    full\nmapping database for all MABs.\n\t "

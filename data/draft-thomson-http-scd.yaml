abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   An architecture is described for content distribution using a\n   secondary
    server that might be operated with reduced privileges.\n   This architecture allows
    a primary server to delegate the\n   responsibility for delivery of the payload
    of an HTTP response to a\n   secondary server.  The secondary server is unable
    to modify this\n   content.  The content is encrypted, which in some cases will
    prevent\n   the secondary server from learning about the content.\n\n\t "

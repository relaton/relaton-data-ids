abstract:
- content: "<p>Messaging Layer Security (MLS) provides strong end-to-end security
    guarantees for group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise
    Security (PCS). To facilitate agreement between group members, MLS requires a
    Delivery Service (DS) component that orders of the handshake messages (Commits)
    that allow changes to the group state. In decentralized settings without a central
    authoritative entity to enforce ordering, group members will likely have to retain
    key material so they can process Commits out-of-order. Retaining key material,
    however, significantly reduces the FS of the protocol. This draft specifies Decentralized
    MLS (DMLS), based on the Fork-Resilient Continuous Group Key Agreement protocol
    FREEK proposed by Alwen et al. [FRCGKA]. In essence, DMLS extends MLS such that
    key material can be retained to process Commits out-of- order with recuded impact
    to FS, thus allowing safer deployment in decentralized environments.</p>"

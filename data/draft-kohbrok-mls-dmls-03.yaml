  content: "   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) provides strong end-to-end security\n
    \  guarantees for group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and\n   Post-Compromise
    Security (PCS).  To facilitate agreement between\n   group members, MLS requires
    a Delivery Service (DS) component that\n   orders of the handshake messages (Commits)
    that allow changes to the\n   group state.  In decentralized settings without
    a central\n   authoritative entity to enforce ordering, group members will likely\n
    \  have to retain key material so they can process Commits out-of-order.\n\n   Retaining
    key material, however, significantly reduces the FS of the\n   protocol.  This
    draft specifies Decentralized MLS (DMLS), based on\n   the Fork-Resilient Continuous
    Group Key Agreement protocol FREEK\n   proposed by Alwen et al.  [FRCGKA].  In
    essence, DMLS extends MLS\n   such that key material can be retained to process
    Commits out-of-\n   order with recuded impact to FS, thus allowing safer deployment
    in\n   decentralized environments.\n\n\t "

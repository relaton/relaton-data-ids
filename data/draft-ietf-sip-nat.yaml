  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP. When\nused
    with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the source\naddress the request
    came from, but from the port written into the\ntopmost Via header of the request.
    This behavior is not desirable in\nmany cases, most notably, when the client is
    behind a NAT. This\nextension defines a new parameter for the Via header, called
    rport,\nthat allows a client to request that the server send the response\nback
    to the source IP address and port where the request came from.\n\n\t "

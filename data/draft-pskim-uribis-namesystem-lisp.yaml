  content: "   This draft suggests a name space and system for the locator/\n   identifier
    split Internet architecture. The suggested name system\n   considers a host-centric
    for the current stage as well as an\n   object-centric for the next stage. Firstly,
    a name space for various\n   communication objects is defined. To consider scalability
    and\n   distributed architecture, the format of the name space consists of\n   object
    category, local name, domain name, and parameters. Secondly,\n   registries and
    servers are introduced to manage mapping between\n   identifier and object names
    with one-to-many relationship. Then,\n   name registration and resolution using
    these registries and servers\n   are described.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Authentication Received Chain (ARC) provides a means to preserve\n
    \  email authentication results and verify the identity of email message\n   handlers,
    each of which participates by inserting certain header\n   fields before passing
    the message on.  But the specification does not\n   indicate how intermediaries
    and receivers should interpret or utilize\n   ARC.  This document will provide
    guidance in these areas.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes an extension to the Resource Reservation \n
    \  Protocol (RSVP) that allows an aggregated reservation to be \n   partially
    preempted. Currently, when a higher priority reservation \n   request arrives
    and sufficient bandwidth is unavailable to meet \n   that request, a lower priority
    aggregated reservation may be \n   preempted in whole, whether or not the entire
    bandwidth is \n   required. This document describes a method where the lower priority\n
    \  aggregated reservation is preempted only to the extent to which its\n   bandwidth
    is required for the higher priority request. This allows \n   the aggregator to
    fail only a portion of the individual sessions \n   that is aggregated and allow
    the rest of the sessions to continue \n   unaffected.\n\t "

  content: "   Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane by leveraging
    a\n   new type of Routing Extension Header, called Segment Routing Header\n   (SRH).
    \ However, the overhead introduced by SRH may be a challenge\n   for existing
    hardware, which may influence on the forwarding\n   performance and the payload
    efficiency.\n\n   This document defines a compressed SRv6 network programming
    mechanism\n   in order to reduce the overhead of SRv6 by introducing the Compressed\n
    \  Segment Identifier (C-SID) and the Compressed SRH (C-SRH).  The C-SRH\n   can
    be a new Routing Header or an enhancement of SRH.\n\n\t "

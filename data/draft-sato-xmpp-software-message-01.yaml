  content: "In RFC2779 [RFC2779] and RFC2778 [RFC2778], XMPP [RFC3920] client\nis
    defined as \"PRINCIPALS are the people, groups, and/or software\nin the \"real
    world\" outside the system that use the system as a\nmeans of coordination and
    communication.  Considering this\ndescription, it does not matter whether the
    user of end node is\nhuman or software. However, current specification of XMPP
    is\nexpected that there will be a human in front of the client. So,\nthere is
    no consideration for looping the message between softwares\nand processing message
    that human will not be able to react.\nRecently system and software are replying
    in return of\nhuman. Moreover, by making client act like a human, new network\nservice
    can be made.  There are many of these called \"bots\"\nalready, but there is a
    possibility which can aggregate or control\nremote resources.By clarifying models
    of usage and problem, this\ndocument aims to use XMPP in software-to-software
    and\nhuman-to-software models not only human-to-human model.\n\t "

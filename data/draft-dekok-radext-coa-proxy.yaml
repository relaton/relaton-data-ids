  content: "   RFC 5176 defines Change of Authorization (CoA) and Disconnect Message\n
    \  (DM) behavior for RADIUS.  Section 3.1 of that document suggests that\n   proxying
    these messages is possible, but gives no guidance as to how\n   that is done.
    \ This specification corrects that ommission.\n\n\t "

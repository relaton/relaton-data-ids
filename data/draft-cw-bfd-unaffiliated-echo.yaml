  content: "   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection\n   protocol
    that can quickly determine a communication failure between\n   two forwarding
    engines.  This document proposes a use of BFD echo\n   where the local system
    supports BFD but the neighboring system does\n   not support BFD.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Industrial Internet is a new infrastructure, application mode and\n
    \  industrial ecology with the deep integration among the new\n   information
    technology, communication technology and the industrial\n   economy.Industrial
    production tasks are time-sensitive, which put\n   forward high requirements on
    networks and applications, and need to\n   meet the deterministic requirements
    in terms of delay, jitter,\n   reliability, etc.  Industrial deterministic service
    refers to a\n   closed loop composed of communication paths and control processes
    in\n   which two or more applications participate.Industrial management\n   platforms
    need to unify network forwarding and computing tasks for\n   each deterministic
    service.  This draft illustrates use cases of\n   traffic steering for deterministic
    service in terms of dynamic\n   computing and networking resource status,together
    with the\n   requirements and solutions for CATS(Computing-Aware Traffic\n   Steering).\n\n\t "

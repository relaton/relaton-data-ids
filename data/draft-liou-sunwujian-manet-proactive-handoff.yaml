  content: "Driven by government policy and advanced radio technologies\n, opportunistic
    spectrum usage plays an\n  ever-increasing role in\nthe next generation communication
    system. Due to the random \ncharacteristics of primary users, it is impossible
    to fully describe\nthe activity feature in terms of time and space, rendering
    \nopportunity usage unsafe.  In order to minimize interference to \nprimary users,
    a history knowledge based algorithm is proposed in \nthis work, which compound
    historical statistics with current \ninformation. Random early detection (RED)
    algorithm, which proves to \nbe efficient in active queue management (AQM) for
    switching fabrics,\nis introduced to help select the desirable channel. In order
    to \nfurther suppress the collision probability, all the channels are \nsorted
    according to availability. Simulation results show that, \ncompared with completely
    random spectrum selection method, the \nproposed RED-based channel access method
    gives better \nperformance in terms of channel selection delay.\n\t "

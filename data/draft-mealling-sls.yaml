  content: "Developing technology to allow for truly internationalized Internet\nidentifiers
    is proving a hard nut to crack within the framework of\nthe existing DNS.  At
    the same time, the DNS continues to do an\nexcellent job at serving its original
    mandate for providing efficient\nmappings between machine-readable labels and
    network resources.  What\nis not clear is whether the existing DNS can be transformed
    into a\nservice that can handle the more human oriented identification\nservices
    it is now being asked to provide.  This document embraces,\nextends and complements
    a proposal by John Klensin to address the\nrequirements for a directory layer
    above the existing DNS that can\nbetter solve these problems.  The discussion
    concludes by proposing a\nstrawman called the Service Lookup System (SLS).\n\n\n\n\t "

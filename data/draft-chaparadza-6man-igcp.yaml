  content: "   This document presents a proposal for a multi-purpose Generic Control\n
    \  Protocol (IGCP) for IPv6 based networks. There is a growing need for\n   a
    generic control protocol framework that can be further customized\n   to specific
    usage contexts in which certain types of control\n   information exchange messages
    and behavior among some functional\n   entities hosted by different nodes is desired.
    For example, the\n   growing area of self-management, self-organization and autonomic\n
    \  networking introduces functional entities into the node and network\n   architectures
    that need to exchange control information in order to\n   implement self-adaptive
    behavior and dynamic network configuration\n   and optimization. In this document,
    we capture a number of control\n   message exchange types of contexts for which
    a generic control\n   protocol would be desired. The extensibility of ICMPv6 offers
    the\n   room for designing such a generic control protocol. In this document,\n
    \  we present our proposal for such a generic control protocol that is\n   based
    on extending ICMPv6, whose message format is divided into two\n   parts: a Common
    Part and a Generic Data Part that can be further\n   structured according to some
    usage context of control messages\n   further encapsulated by the Data Part that
    need to be parsed and used\n   by entities meant to interpret the Data Part.  We
    also give an\n   example use case, where functional entities residing in different\n
    \  nodes exchange information using the IGCP generic messages.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "There is a noticeable trend towards network behaviors and semantics that
    are specific to a particular set of requirements applied within a limited region
    of the Internet. Policies, default parameters, the options supported, the style
    of network management, and security requirements may vary between such limited
    regions. This document reviews examples of such limited domains (also known as
    controlled environments), notes emerging solutions, and includes a related taxonomy.
    It then briefly discusses the standardization of protocols for limited domains.
    Finally, it shows the need for a precise definition of \"limited domain membership\"
    and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely and to find other
    members, including boundary nodes.\n\n This document is the product of the research
    of the authors. It has been produced through discussions and consultation within
    the IETF but is not the product of IETF consensus.\n\t "

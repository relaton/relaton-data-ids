  content: "The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861] specifies the\noperation
    of routers, including the process of sending and receiving\nRouter Advertisement
    (RA) messages.  However, the specification makes\nno distinction between different
    classes of routers that may occur on\na link.  In particular, the specification
    is written from the\nperspective of routers that are \"authoritative for the link\",
    i.e.,\nrouters that connect the link to provider networks.  This document\ndiscusses
    considerations for a different class of routers known as\n\"stub routers\".\n\nStatus

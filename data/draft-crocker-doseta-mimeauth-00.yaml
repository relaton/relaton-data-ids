  content: "MIME is a method of packaging and labeling aggregations of data; it\nis
    used both for email and the Web. Many usage scenarios would\nbenefit by having
    an objective method of assessing the validity of\nMIME data, based on an authenticated
    identity.  MIMEAUTH leverages\ntechnology developed for DKIM to provide such a
    method.  Its use can\nbe extended to cover specific header-fields of a containing
    email\nmessage or World Wide Web HTTP content.  Existing authentication\nmechanisms
    have achieved only limited success due to challenges with\nadministration and
    use.  MIMEAUTH has very low administration and use\noverhead, through self-certifying
    keys in the DNS and a labeling\nmethod that can be transparent to end-users.  For
    relayed and\nmediated sequences, MIMEAUTH can be implemented within a service
    and\ntherefore can be transparent to end-system software.\n\t "

  content: "This memo presents an integrated, server-based mechanism for the\n   efficient
    support of the IP Integrated Services (IIS) model in ATM\n   networks, namely
    the Multicast Integration Server (MIS) architecture.\n   Instead of viewing IP-ATM
    multicast address resolution and QoS\n   support separately, the approach in this
    memo is to consider such\n   issues in an integrated manner.  In particular, the
    MIS architecture\n   defines how a layer-3 setup protocol as RSVP can be mapped
    to and\n   integrated with a layer-2 multicast address resolution protocol as\n
    \  EARTH - EAsy Multicast Routing THrough ATM clouds.  With the use of\n   EARTH,
    several ATM point-to-multipoint connections with different QoS\n   parameters
    can be associated to a single IP multicast address.  An\n   RSVP server (RSVP-S)
    within the MIS is used to distribute RSVP\n   messages inside the ATM cloud and
    to set the corresponding QoS state\n   in the address resolution table of EARTH
    (setup protocol mapping).\n   In addition, this memo defines a quantized heterogeneity
    model which\n   supports, together with the MIS, advanced IIS features as QoS\n
    \  heterogeneity and dynamic QoS changes in IP-ATM networks.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes to extend the Differentiated Services\n   (DiffServ)
    Quality of Service (QoS) model to support energy-efficient\n   networking.  As
    a first draft, it discusses how such extensions could\n   be done, bringing first
    examples of energy-efficiency metrics that\n   could be applied to mark traffic,
    and providing routing applicability\n   examples by interpreting existing or experimental
    DSCP codepoints to\n   represent not only traditional QoS parameters (e.g., latency,\n
    \  jitter), but also application-level energy sensitivity.  By\n   incorporating
    energy metrics into traffic classification, network\n   devices and orchestrators
    can make routing and resource allocation\n   decisions that optimize both service
    performance and energy\n   consumption.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a method of providing scope-limited Source-\nSpecific
    Multicast (SSM) channels by filtering at boundary routers.  The filtering prevents
    SSM traffic from being forwarded through a scope\nboundary.  Each administrative
    domain that wishes to enforce scoping can choose the sub-range of SSM channels
    that it wishes to scope -- no\nglobally-scoped address range is defined.  The
    method described here\ndoes not require extending the current SSM range allocation
    to include a new 'scoped SSM' range.  The method described is primarily intended
    to provide scoping for IPv4 SSM channels, since IPv6 integrates multicast scoping
    into the basic addressing architecture.\n\n\n\t "

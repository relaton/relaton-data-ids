  content: "Classic Internet transport protocols use a single source IP\naddress and
    a single destination IP address, as part of the\nidentification for an individual
    data flow.  TCP includes these\nin its definition of a connection and its calculation
    of the\nheader checksum.  Hence the transport service is tied to a\nparticular
    IP address pair. This is problematic for multihomed\nhosts and for mobile hosts.
    They cannot use more than one, for\nany single transport association (context).
    \ Multiple Address\nService for Transport (MAST) defines a mechanism that supports\nassociation
    of multiple IP addresses with any transport\nassociation.  It requires no change
    to the Internet\ninfrastructure, no change to IP modules or transport modules
    in\nthe end-systems, and no new administrative effort. Instead, it\ndefines a
    layer between classic IP and transport that operates\nonly in the end systems
    and affects only participating hosts.\nAdditional functionality is obtained by
    use of a DNS and\n'presence' rendezvous service.\n\t "

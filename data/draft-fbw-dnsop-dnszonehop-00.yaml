  content: "   DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) as defined by [RFC9364] was developed\n
    \  to address significant security integrity flaws in DNS.  Within\n   certain
    circumstances, information leakage may be possible stemming\n   from a known DNSSEC
    vulnerability that facilitates a process known as\n   zone walking, which enables
    the efficient collection of all FQDNs\n   from a given environment.  This document
    describes the problem space\n   as outlined in [IEEE-ZoneHopping] and offers a
    potential solution,\n   called Zone-Hopping, to aid in addressing the domain information\n
    \  leakage capable via Zone-walking while preserving the integrity of\n   the
    records for which DNSSEC was originally introduced.\n\n\t "

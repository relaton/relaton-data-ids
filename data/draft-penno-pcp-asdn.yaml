- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   To allow traversal of firewalls or provide additional network\n   services
    such as QoS or supplemental bandwidth, it is necessary to\n   deploy application-aware
    network elements.  Such network elements are\n   costly to create, deploy, and
    are unable to adequately cope with\n   changes to the application itself, stifling
    innovation.\n\n   This document describes a different approach, where the application\n
    \  explicitly signals its needs to the network.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This I-D presents all known attack vectors into or using BGP. The\n   data
    is presented in \"Attack Tree\" format as published by Schneier\n   [ATTACKTREE]
    and detailed by the CERT in \"Attack Modeling for\n   Information Security and
    Survivability\" [MODELING]. Future security\n   improvements to BGP (whether best
    practices or enhancements to the\n   protocol) should consider the attacks outlined
    here when determining\n   the relative security improvements such changes provide.\n\t "

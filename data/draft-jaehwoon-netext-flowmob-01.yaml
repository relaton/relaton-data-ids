  content: "IN Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), a multi-homed MN can connect to the \nPMIPv6
    domain by using only one interface even though it has multiple \ninterfaces. It
    would be efficient when such a multi-homed MN connect \nto the PMIPv6 domain by
    using all of its interfaces. If such a \nmulti-homed MN utilizes all of its interfaces,
    flow mobility can \nbe provided that the MN handovers one or more flows from one
    \ninterface to another without re-establishing sessions. This document \nspecifies
    the layer-3 based flow mobility mechanism by considering \nthe intention of the
    MN. Here, a MN chooses the interface for sending \nthe service traffic and transmits
    the traffic by using the chosen \ninterface. The PMIPv6 domain can know the intention
    of the MN when a \nMAG receives a service flow via a specific network.\n\t "

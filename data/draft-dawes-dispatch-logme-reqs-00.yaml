  script: Latn
  content: "   SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user\n   reported
    problem and for regression testing if network or client\n   software is upgraded.
    \ As networks grow and become interconnected,\n   including connection via transit
    networks, it becomes impractical to\n   predict the path that SIP signalling will
    take between clients, and\n   therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling
    end-to-end.\n\n   This draft describes requirements for adding an indicator to
    the SIP\n   protocol which can be used to mark signalling as subject to logging.\n
    \  Such marking will typically be applied as part of network testing\n   controlled
    by the network operator and not used in regular client\n   signalling.  However,
    such marking can be carried end-to-end\n   including the SIP terminals, even if
    a session originates and\n   terminates in different networks.\n\n\t "

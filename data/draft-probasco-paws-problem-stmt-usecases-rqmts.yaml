  content: "   Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to a licensed,\n
    \  primary user but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and\n   times
    are defined as \"white space\".  The concept of allowing\n   secondary transmissions
    (licensed or unlicensed) in white space is a\n   technique to \"unlock\" existing
    spectrum for new use.  An obvious\n   requirement is that these secondary transmissions
    do not interfere\n   with the primary use of the spectrum.  One approach to using
    the\n   white space spectrum at a given time and location is to verify with a\n
    \  database available channels.\n\n   This document describes the concept of TV
    White Spaces.  It also\n   describes the problems that need to be addressed for
    enabling the use\n   of the primary user owned white space spectrum for secondary
    users,\n   without causing interference, by querying a database which knows the\n
    \  channel availability at any given location and time.  A number of\n   possible
    use cases of this spectrum and derived requirements are also\n   described.\n\n\t "

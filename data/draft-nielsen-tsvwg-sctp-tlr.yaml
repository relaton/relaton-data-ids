  content: "   Loss Recovery by means of T3-Retransmission has significant\n   detrimental
    impact on the delays experienced through an SCTP\n   association.  The throughput
    achievable over an SCTP association also\n   is negatively impacted by the occurrence
    of T3-Retransmissions.  The\n   present SCTP Fast Recovery algorithms as specified
    by [RFC4960] are\n   not able to adequately or timely recover losses in certain\n
    \  situations, thus resorting to loss recovery by lengthy\n   T3-Retransimissions
    or by non-timely activation of Fast Recovery.  In\n   this document we specify
    a number of enhancements to the SCTP Loss\n   Recovery algorithms which amends
    some of these deficiencies with a\n   particular focus on Loss Recovery for drops
    in Traffic Tails.  The\n   enhancements supplement the existing algorithms of
    [RFC4960] with\n   proactive probing and timer driven activation of the Fast\n
    \  Retransmission algorithm as well as a number of enhancements of the\n   Fast
    Retransmission algorithm in itself are specified.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes a method of detecting a dead IKE peer.  The \nmethod,
    called Dead Peer Detection (DPD) uses IPSec traffic patterns \nto limit the number
    of IKE messages sent.  DPD, like other keepalive \nmechanisms, is often necessary
    to perform IKE peer failover, or to \nreclaim lost resources. \n\n\t "

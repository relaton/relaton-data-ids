  content: "   Neighbor Discovery (ND) is the key protocol of IPv6 first-hop. ND\n
    \  uses multicast extensively and trusts all hosts. In some scenarios\n   like
    wireless networks, multicast can be inefficient. In other\n   scenarios like public
    access networks, hosts may not be trustable.\n   Consequently, ND issues may happen
    in various scenarios. The issues\n   and solutions are documented in more than
    30 RFCs. It is difficult\n   to keep track of all these issues and solutions,
    and how the various\n   solutions fit together. Therefore, deployment guidelines
    are needed.\n\n   This document firstly summarizes the known ND issues and\n   optimization
    solutions into a one-stop reference. Analyzing these\n   solutions reveals an
    insight: isolating hosts is effective in\n   solving ND issues. Four isolation
    methods are proposed and their\n   applicability is discussed. Guidelines are
    then described for\n   selecting a suitable isolation method based on the deployment\n
    \  scenario.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides efficient\n   asynchronous
    group key establishment for large groups with up to\n   thousands of clients.
    \ In MLS, any member can commit a change to the\n   group, and consequently, all
    members must download, validate, and\n   maintain the full group state, which
    can incur a significant\n   communication and computational costs, especially
    when joining a\n   group.  This document defines an MLS extension to support \"partial\n
    \  MLS clients\" that don't undertake these costs.  A partial client\n   cannot
    commit changes to the group, and only has partial\n   authentication information
    for the other members of the group, but is\n   otherwise able to participate in
    the group.  In exchange for these\n   limitations, a partial MLS client can participate
    in an MLS group\n   with significantly lower requirements in terms of download,
    memory,\n   and processing.\n\n\t "

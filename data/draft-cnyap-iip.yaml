  content: "This document specifies a protocol that allows any IP node to\ncommunicate
    with other IP nodes in the mobile environment without any\nfundamental changes
    to TCP/IP. Any mobile aware nodes are able to\ncommunicate with one another with
    standard IP routing. Mobile\nawareness is achieved by means of address updates
    through a query\nmechanism. Backward compatibility capability is supported via
    the\nmeans of one or more anchoring points that are put in place.\n\t "

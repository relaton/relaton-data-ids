  content: "This document defines a Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol (L7 LCP)
    and describes the use of HTTP and HTTP/TLS as transports for the L7 LCP.  The
    L7 LCP is used for retrieving location information from a server within an access
    network.  It includes options for retrieving location information in two forms:
    by value and by reference.  The protocol is an extensible application-layer protocol
    that is independent of the session layer. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "The Domain Name System (DNS) makes use of a hierarchical naming\nscheme.
    \ The validity of a particular name in the DNS is governed by\nprotocol, operational
    and policy considerations.\n\nThe IETF has identified particular domain names
    to have special\nconsiderations associated with their use.  These domain names
    have\nbeen identified in various documents in the RFC series.  This\ndocument
    describes the creation of an IANA registry to catalogue such\ndomain names and
    provides direction about how this registry should be\nmaintained.\n\nThis document
    does not identify any new domain name as having special\nconsiderations associated
    with its use.\n\t "

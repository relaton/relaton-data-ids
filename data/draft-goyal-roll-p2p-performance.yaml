abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In this draft, we analyze the point-to-point (P2P) routing\n   performance
    of RPL by comparing the shortest P2P route costs in a\n   sample network topology
    with the corresponding costs when routing\n   along a tree built to minimize the
    routing costs to the tree's root.\n\t "

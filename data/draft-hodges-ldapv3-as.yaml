  content: "The specification for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version\n3
    (LDAPv3) nominally comprises eight separte RFCs which were issued in\ntwo distinct
    subsets at separate times (RFCs 2251..2256 first, then RFCs\n2229 and 2830 following
    later), but this has never been formally stated.\nAdditionally, RFCs 2251..2256
    each are embellished with an 'IESG Note'\nwarning implementors and deployers of
    potential interoperability prob-\nlems due to the lack of a specification of mandatory-to-implement\nauthentication
    mechanism(s). This document corrects both situations by\nexplicitly specifying
    the set of RFCs comprising LDAPv3 and rescinding\nthe 'IESG Note' due to the specification
    of mandatory-to-implement\nauthentication mechanisms in RFC 2829.\n\t "

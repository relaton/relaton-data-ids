  content: "   This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries,\n   primarily
    those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance\n   Metrics (IPPM) Working
    Group of the IETF.  Three aspects make IPPM\n   metric registration difficult:
    (1) Use of the Type-P notion to allow\n   users to specify their own packet types.
    (2) Use of Flexible input\n   variables, called Parameters in IPPM definitions,
    some which\n   determine the quantity measured and others which should not be\n
    \  specified until execution of the measurement. (3) Allowing\n   flexibility
    in choice of statistics to summarize the results on a\n   stream of measurement
    packets.  Specifically, this memo investigates\n   registry entries that would
    follow from RFC 3393, the specification\n   IP Packet Delay Variation that allows
    for many different forms of\n   unique metrics, as a difficult and important test
    of the registry\n   structure.\n\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There are a number of contexts in which telephone numbers are employed
    by Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) applications, many of which can be addressed
    by ENUM.  Although SIP was one of the primary applications for which ENUM was
    created, there is nevertheless a need to define procedures for integrating ENUM
    with SIP implementations.  This document illustrates how the two protocols might
    work in concert, and clarifies the authoring and processing of ENUM records for
    SIP applications.  It also provides guidelines for instances in which ENUM, for
    whatever reason, cannot be used to resolve a telephone number.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

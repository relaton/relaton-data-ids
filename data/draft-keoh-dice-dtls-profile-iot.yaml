  content: "   This document collects various implementation challenges of DTLS on\n
    \  embedded systems, and proposes a profile of DTLS for CoAP-based\n   Internet
    of Things (IoT) applications. Specially, this document\n   investigate the application
    features and functionality of DTLS\n   protocol, the fragmentation issue of DTLS
    Handshake protocol, and the\n   complexity of the DTLS Handshake state machine.
    A RESTful DTLS\n   Handshake which relies on CoAP Block-wise Transfer is proposed
    to\n   address the fragmentation issue. The next step is to define a DTLS\n   profile
    for embedded systems.\n\n\t "

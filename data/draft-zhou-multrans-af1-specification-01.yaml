  script: Latn
  content: "   Discussion of the problem of multicast transition has brought out a\n
    \  number of scenarios that are the most likely to be encountered in\n   practice.
    \ In some of these scenarios the IP version supported by the\n   multicast receiver
    differs from that supported by the provider\n   network to which it is attached.
    \ In such cases an adaptation\n   function is required between the receiver and
    the network, to mediate\n   the signalling and data flows between them.  This
    memo uses the term\n   \"Type 1 Adaptation Function\" (AF1) for such a function.
    \ It is\n   written for the purpose of specifying the functions performed by an\n
    \  AF1.\n\n   The scope of this memo is limited to the case where flows are\n
    \  unidirectional, from a designated set of sources to a designated (and\n   normally
    much more numerous) set of receivers.  The IP television\n   (IPTV) case falls
    within this scope.\n\n\t "

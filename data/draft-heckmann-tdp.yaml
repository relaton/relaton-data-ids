abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft describes a very flexible and efficient protocol for \ndistributing
    price information (tariffs) inside an Internet \nService Provider's management
    system and to its customers. It is \ndesigned to work with multiple QoS architectures,
    for example \nIntserv [2] and Diffserv [4]. It can also be used for dynamic \npricing.
    It can use a number of different transport mechanisms, \ne.g. embedding tariff
    messages as policy objects in RSVP [9] \nmessages. As tariffs can get very complex,
    it is possible but not \nnecessary to send tariffs as code (e.g. Java).  \nThe
    draft also contains clear definitions of tariff and related \nterms.\n\t "

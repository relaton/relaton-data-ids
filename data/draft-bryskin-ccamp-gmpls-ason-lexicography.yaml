  content: "   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has been developed\n
    \  by the IETF to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs)
    in a variety of physical technologies and across several\n   architectural models.
    The ITU-T has specified an architecture for\n   the management of Automatically
    Switched Optical Networks (ASON).\n\n   This document provides a lexicography
    for the interpretation of GMPLS\n   terminology within the context of the ASON
    architecture.\n\n   It is important to note that GMPLS is applicable in a far
    wider set\n   of contexts than just ASON. Thus the definitions presented in this\n
    \  document do not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of the\n   GMPLS
    concepts. The intention of this document is simply to allow the\n   GMPLS terms
    to be applied within the ASON context.\n\t "

  content: "The goal of this document is to identify and propose a new work item\nfor
    the IETF. This document describes the PSTN Intelligent Network (IN) \nArchitecture
    support of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks. \nThe concept of the 'Soft-SSF'
    is introduced which acts as an overlay \nbetween the IP telephony call control
    and the Intelligent Network \nlayer provided by the IN Service Switching Function
    (SSF) and the IN Service Control Function (SCF). This 'Soft-SSF' provides the
    necessary mapping between the SIP protocol state machine and the IN Basic Call
    State Model (BCSM). Also introduced is the Call Manager Function (CMF) which acts
    as a Mediation Node. \nThe CMF entity is responsible for passing service related
    information to and from IN service layer, namely the SCF, and managing the service
    control relationship. As such, the CMF may contain a SSF-like functionality or
    subset thereof, to model the pre and post conditions that are required to interact
    with an SCF. The document specifically deals with the proposed standardized interfaces
    between the functional entities identified in the IN Network with associated functional
    entities represented in the SIP network. A mapping of parameters of the SIP protocol
    to the Intelligent Network Application Part Protocol(INAP) may be required for
    the support of the SIP Proxy Server call control protocol, states and events.
    Thereby enabling the Mediation Node (CMF) \nto model a SIP Proxy server. It is
    the proposal of this document to define the Mediation Node(CMF)to Soft SSF interface
    as a work item in the IETF as it is presently not a subject for standardization.\n\t "

  content: "    This memo documents the MOSPF protocol. MOSPF, which stands for the\n
    \   Multicast extensions to OSPF, is an enhancement to the OSPF protocol\n    enabling
    the routing of IP multicast datagrams. The extensions have\n    been implemented
    so that a multicast routing capability can be\n    introduced piecemeal into an
    OSPF Version 2 routing domain. Some of\n    the OSPF Version 2 routers may run
    the multicast extensions, while\n    others may continue to be restricted to the
    forwarding of regular IP\n    traffic (unicasts).\n \n    An implementation of
    this memo will interoperate with\n    implementations of the previous MOSPF specification,
    RFC 1584.\n    Differences between this memo and RFC 1584 include bug fixes,\n
    \   modifications which track changes to the base OSPF specification,\n    and
    an assumption that IGMPv2 (instead of IGMPv1) will now be used\n    to communicate
    group membership from IP hosts to MOSPF routers. See\n    Appendix D for details.\n\n\t "

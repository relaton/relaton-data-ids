- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "When a host establishes a new link-layer connection, it may or may not
    have a valid IP configuration for Internet connectivity.  The host may check for
    link change (i.e., determine whether a link change has occurred), and then, based
    on the result, it can automatically decide whether its IP configuration is still
    valid.  During link identity detection, the host may also collect necessary information
    to initiate a new IP configuration if the IP subnet has changed.  In this memo,
    this procedure is called Detecting Network Attachment (DNA).  DNA schemes should
    be precise, sufficiently fast, secure, and of limited signaling.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   A key presumption of the Internet architecture has been that devices\n
    \  are general purpose computers.  By constraining the set of devices\n   that
    connect to the Internet to non-general purpose devices, we can\n   introduce a
    set of network capabilities that provides an additional\n   layer of protection
    to those devices.  One such capability is the\n   Manufacturer Usage Description
    (MUD).  This work builds on many\n   existing network capabilities so as to be
    easily deployable by all\n   involved.  The focus of this work is primarily, but
    not exclusively,\n   in the realm of security; and again primarily, but not exclusively,\n
    \  relating to smart objects.\n\n\t "

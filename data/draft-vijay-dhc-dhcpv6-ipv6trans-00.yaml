  content: "For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly\ndeployed
    IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been\nproposed.  One such mechanism
    is configured tunnels.  This document\nprovides a mechanism by which the DHCPv6
    servers can provide\ninformation about the various configured tunnel end points
    to reach\nthe IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.\n\n\t "

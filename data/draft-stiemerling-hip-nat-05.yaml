  content: "   The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) fundamentally changes the way in\n
    \  which two Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other\n   schemes
    is that HIP does not require modifications to the traditional\n   network-layer
    functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In\n   the current Internet,
    however, many devices other than routers modify\n   the traditional network-layer
    behavior of the Internet.  These\n   \"middleboxes\" are intermediary devices
    that perform functions other\n   than the standard functions of an IP router on
    the datagram path\n   between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types
    of\n   middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some\n
    \  aspects of HIP communication and others can render HIP communication\n   impossible.
    \ This document discusses the problems associated with HIP\n   communication across
    network paths that include specific types of\n   middleboxes, namely, network
    address translators and firewalls.  It\n   identifies and discusses issues in
    the current HIP specifications\n   that affect communication across these types
    of middleboxes.\n\t "

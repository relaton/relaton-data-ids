abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a declarative policy model to describe the
    user's declarative on network policy. The declarative policy model is a specific
    data model specifies the desired state of the network system. It helps the service
    management to model the policy (a set of states described by constraints) that
    defines the final results of a VPN service without specifying how it is monitored
    and managed during its lifecycle. One application for Distributed Data Center
    (DDC) scenarios with policy enforcement is provided with details of how to convert
    high level declarative policy into lower level configurations.</p>"

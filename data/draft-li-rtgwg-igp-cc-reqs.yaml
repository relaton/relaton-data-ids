  content: "   Interior Gateway Protocol(IGP) such as IS-IS or OSPF is a fundamental\n
    \  building block for traditional routing system which is based on\n   distributed
    computation model.  Routing in networks based on\n   centralized computation model
    such as Software Defined Network(SDN)\n   may require special IGP extension to
    facilitate its operation in\n   multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks.\n\n
    \  This document introduces an architecture of deploying IGP for\n   central-controlled
    network, but it does not aim to provide a detailed\n   description of all the
    architectural components.  It also specifies a\n   set of functional requirements
    which can be fulfilled by IGP with\n   proper extension for the central-controlled
    network.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Distributed mobility management aims to distribute the mobility\n   anchor
    to the access network level to avoid the centralized mobility\n   anchor problem.
    \ By distributing the mobility anchor, the traffic can\n   be distributed in an
    optimal way.  There are many different proposals\n   for DMM solution, one of
    those types of solution is called \"dynamic\n   anchor\".  This document analyses
    the limitations of current dynamic\n   anchor solution and discusses the possible
    solution to overcome those\n   limitations.\n\n\n\t "

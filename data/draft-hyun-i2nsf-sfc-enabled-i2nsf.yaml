  content: "   This document describes an architecture of the I2NSF framework which\n
    \  enables traffic steering between NSFs for security policy\n   enforcement.
    \ Such traffic steering enables composite inspection of\n   network traffic by
    steering the traffic through multiple types of\n   security functions according
    to the information model for the NSF\n   facing interface in the I2NSF framework.
    \ This document explains the\n   additional components integrated into the I2NSF
    framework and their\n   functionalities to achieve NSF-triggered traffic steering.
    \ It also\n   describes representative use cases to address major benefits from
    the\n   proposed architecture.\n\n\t "

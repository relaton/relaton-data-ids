  content: "   The ever-emerging new services are imposing more and more highly\n
    \  demanding requirements on the network.  In order to meet these\n   requirements,
    some new technology trends of network emerge as the\n   times require.  On the
    one hand, for the selection of service node\n   and forwarding path, in addition
    to considering the network topology\n   and link state, more factors are also
    considered, such as the\n   computing properties of service node; On the other
    hand, network and\n   application present the trend of mutual perception, including\n
    \  application to perceive the state of network path, or network to\n   perceive
    the demand of application.\n\n   This draft describes a new network scenario and
    architecture\n   considering computational properties, and assumes that Alto could
    be\n   used as an important node to realize the deployment of services, and\n
    \  to assist in the selection of service nodes.\n\n\n\t "

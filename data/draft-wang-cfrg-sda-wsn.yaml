- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a secure data aggregation scheme based on key\n
    \  vector sharing.  New key set is negotiated among sink and sensor\n   nodes,
    and then each sensor node uses one key in the set to encrypt\n   and decrypt sensory
    data.  A key vector structure is constructed and\n   shared among them.  Since
    the size of the shared key vector structure\n   is constant, the transmission
    overhead is saved in the proposed\n   scheme while security is ensured.  Moreover,
    MAC integrity mechanism\n   is also included in the proposed scheme.  The recommended
    scheme\n   reduces the transmitted overhead so as to save the energy consumption\n
    \  of each sensor node.Meanwhile, the scheme is data-loss resilient.\n   Distribution
    of this memo is unlimited.\n\n\t "

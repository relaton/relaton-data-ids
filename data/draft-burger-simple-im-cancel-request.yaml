  content: "   This document describes a mechanism for a user agent client to\n   request
    the marking of a previously sent Instant Message as\n   cancelled.  From a user's
    perspective, the user agent server, or\n   other proxies or relay points in the
    network, can effectively remove\n   the first message, giving the impression the
    first message was\n   cancelled.  This document describes the utility of such
    a function,\n   as well as the futility of attempting to create a true message\n
    \  cancellation feature.\n\n\t "

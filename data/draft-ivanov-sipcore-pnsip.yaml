  script: Latn
  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows User Agents to register\n
    \  for inbound requests.  However, the existence of firewalls and\n   Network
    Address Translators (NATs) prevent servers from reaching the\n   User Agents unless
    the User Agents keep connections to the server\n   alive.\n\n   To keep such connections
    alive User Agents employ various methods,\n   most of which require constant uptime
    resulting in high energy cost.\n   This is especially a problem on mobile platforms
    that operate\n   entirely on battery power.  To resolve these issues many mobile\n
    \  manufacturers have provided a cost effective way of pushing messages\n   to
    their devices.\n\n   This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars
    and\n   proxy servers that allow a User Agent to provide a Push Notification\n
    \  Configuration to its Registrar.\n\n\t "

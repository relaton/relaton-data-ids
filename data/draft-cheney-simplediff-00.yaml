abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simplified algorithm for performing computational
    comparisons. The design goal is to achieve an approach that uses the smallest
    amount of logic. Necessary secondary goals include an approach that is language
    agnostic, fast, extensible, and more predictable than other similar algorithms.</p>"

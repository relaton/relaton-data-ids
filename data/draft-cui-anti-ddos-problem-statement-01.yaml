  content: "   This document presents a problem statement on collaborative\n   mitigation
    of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.  DDoS\n   attacks have become
    increasingly prevalent and sophisticated, causing\n   significant disruptions
    in network services.  The evolving trends of\n   DDoS attacks, including their
    types, intensities, and attack methods,\n   pose formidable challenges to existing
    defense systems.  This problem\n   statement examines the current defense landscape,
    highlighting the\n   distributed deployment of defense systems across various
    network\n   positions and the imbalances in defense capabilities.  Collaboration\n
    \  is crucial for effective DDoS attack mitigation, considering the\n   global
    nature of attacks and the need to protect critical network\n   links.  The existing
    collaborative framework, DOTS, shows promise but\n   requires addressing these
    challenges to enhance its efficacy.  The\n   existing collaborative framework
    DOTS demonstrates potential, but\n   there are still numerous challenges in its
    practical application.\n   This document aims to address these key issues that
    impact the\n   implementation of collaborative technologies.\n\n\t "

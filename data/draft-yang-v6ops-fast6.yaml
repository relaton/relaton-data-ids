  content: "   The IANA free pool of IPv4 addresses was depleted, IPv6 migration has\n
    \  become the most imperative task.  There are many transition\n   mechanisms
    designed for different scenarios, however, some problems\n   arosed in the practice.
    \ FAST6, specified in this draft, is based on\n   the ideas of native dual stack
    and address sharing.  It can solves\n   the mixed route problem and simplify the
    planning of private IPv4\n   address space by using tunnel technology.  FAST6
    is an economical and\n   stable technology for smooth network transition.\n\n\t "

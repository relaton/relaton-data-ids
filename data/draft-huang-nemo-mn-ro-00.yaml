  content: "   This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes in IPv6\n
    \  mobile network to perform route optimization.  The route optimization\n   is
    possible because mobile router provides a care-of address for\n   mobile nodes
    in mobile network which we call Virtual Care-of Address\n   (VCoA).  The VCoA
    uses the network prefix of the access network.\n   Mobile nodes register VCoA
    as its own care-of address with home agent\n   and correspondent nodes.  With
    little modification to mobile nodes\n   and correspondent nodes, mobile router
    deals with the packets\n   forwarding between them.\n\n\t "

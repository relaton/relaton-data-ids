  content: "To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers originate
    BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN (\"MCAST-VPN\") BGP routes; they
    also originate unicast VPN routes that carry MVPN-specific attributes.  These
    routes encode addresses from the customer's address space, as well as addresses
    from the provider's address space.  These two address spaces are independent,
    and the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the
    same.  These routes always contain an \"address family\" field that specifies
    whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.
    \ However, there is no field that explicitly specifies the address family of the
    provider addresses.  To ensure interoperability, this document specifies that
    provider IPv4 addresses are always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet
    addresses, and that the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled solely by
    the length of the address field.  Specific cases are explained in detail.  This
    document updates RFC 6514. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

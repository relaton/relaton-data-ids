- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies requirements for new functionality to be added
    to the IETF Datatracker tool to make it possible for Working Group (WG) Chairs
    and their Delegates to input and update the status of the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds)
    associated with their WGs.  After these requirements are implemented, WG Chairs
    will be able to use the Datatracker to provide everyone with more information
    about the status and progression of WG I-Ds than is currently possible.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.\n\t "

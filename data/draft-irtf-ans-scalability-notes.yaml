  content: "This document provides a working definition of 'absolute scalability'
    and 'weak scalability' of a method of an ad hoc network, and also a way of comparing
    the scalability of two different methods.  A method may be a protocol, an algorithm,
    or a scheme whose scalability needs to be evaluated.  For example, it may be a
    routing protocol or a MAC protocol.  'Absolute scalability' emphasizes the asymptotic
    behavior of a set of metrics, which define the efficiency of the network as a
    network parameter tends to infinity.  'Weak scalability' refers \nto the comparison
    of the metrics over a given range.  Finally, fairness in the comparison of these
    metrics is discussed.\n\t "

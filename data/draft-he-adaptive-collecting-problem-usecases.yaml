  content: "   IP carrier network needs to provide real-time traffic visibility to\n
    \  help network operators quickly and accurately locate network\n   congestion
    and packet loss, and make timely path adjustment for\n   deterministic services
    in order to avoid congestion.  It is essential\n   to explore the adaptive traffic
    data collection mechanism so as to\n   capture real-time network state at minimum
    resource consumption.\n\n   This document summarizes the problems currently faced
    by network\n   operators when attempting to provide timely traffic data collection\n
    \  to satisfy the various scenarios that require real-time network state\n   and
    traffic visibility, and aggregates the requirements for adaptive\n   traffic collecting
    mechanism from a variety of deployment scenarios.\n\n\t "

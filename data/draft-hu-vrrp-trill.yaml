  script: Latn
  content: "   TRILL can be implemented in data center, which is request high\n   reliability
    and stable, but if RBridge breaks down, the switch time\n   is up to IS-IS topology
    convergence time.  This is not satisfied to\n   the data center service.  VRRP
    provides a redundancy mechanism to\n   avoid single point of failure and fast
    switching over.  This draft\n   proposes to extend VRRP protocol to TRILL in data
    center.\n\n\t "

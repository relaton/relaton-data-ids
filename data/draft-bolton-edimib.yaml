  content: "This memo defines a MIB for use with managing EDI systems.  The term EDI
    systems includes large scale systems providing translator functions such as the
    US federal government's Electronic Commerce Processing Node (ECPN) for which this
    MIB was specifically designed, as well as smaller Value Added Network (VAN) systems.
    \ Because of the desire for scalability variable names are deliberately vague,
    so that a channel may represent a single user, a group of users that use the same
    network entry point or that are defined by the implementor as functionally similar,
    or (as in the case of the ECPN) a connection to a third party network.  This MIB
    does not address management of client systems which connect to the various EDI
    systems.\n\t "

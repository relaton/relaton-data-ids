  content: "In order for SIP applications to work, they will frequently need to\ncollect
    user input and provide feedback to users. Traditionally, user\ninput has been
    done in the PSTN through DTMF. Much work has occurred\non extending these DTMF
    models into the domain of SIP, typically by\ntransporting DTMF digits or user
    input through some SIP message to an\napplication server. We propose a broader
    framework for stimulus using\nmarkup. The approach can support traditional DTMF
    user input, but\nalso a rich variety of devices, user interfaces and stimulus
    that\ngoes well beyond DTMF.\n\t "

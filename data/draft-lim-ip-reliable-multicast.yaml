  content: "This memo presents IP extension for recovering multicast packets from\ncongestion.
    Dropped packets can be recovered far faster by IP routers\nwith extension of this
    memo than by group member end-hosts. Because\nnecessary interactions are limited
    among adjacent routers, this scheme\nsubstantially reduces overall signaling overhead
    among group members\nfor packet recovery.\n\n\t "

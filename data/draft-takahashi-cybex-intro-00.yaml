  content: "   The cybersecurity information exchange framework, known as CYBEX, is\n
    \  currently undergoing its first iteration of standardization efforts\n   within
    ITU-T.  The framework describes how cybersecurity information\n   is exchanged
    between cybersecurity entities on a global scale and how\n   the exchange is assured.
    \ This framework is intended to facilitate\n   cybersecurity entities to work
    together beyond national and/or\n   organizational boundaries.\n\n   Currently,
    ITU-T Draft Recommendation X.1500 defines the framework.\n   The editors designated
    for the progress of the Draft Recommendation\n   are (in alphabetical order):
    Inette Furey (DHS), Youki Kadobayashi\n   (NICT), Bob Martin (MITRE), Angela Mckay
    (Microsoft), Stephen\n   Adegbite (FIRST), Damir Rajnovic (FIRST), Gavin Reid
    (Cisco), Tony\n   Rutkowski (Yaana), Gregg Schudel (Cisco).\n\n   On behalf of
    ITU-T Q.4/17, this draft introduces the overview of\n   CYBEX in the IETF.\n\t "

  content: "   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol defined in [RFC9420] is\n
    \  an asynchronous secure group messaging protocol, which allows group\n   members
    to propose their own removal from a group.\n\n   However, in some cases MLS clients
    can't reliably use regular Remove\n   or SelfRemove proposals to leave a group
    because they don't have an\n   up-to-date group state.\n\n   This document specifies
    a LeafOperationIntent, which does not need an\n   up-to-date group state but which
    retains sufficient binding to the\n   client's current state to avoid replay attacks.\n\n\t "

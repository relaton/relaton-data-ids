  content: "   The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251] is widely used for purposes\n
    \  including secure remote administration, file transfer using SFTP and\n   SCP,
    and encrypted tunneling of TCP connections.  Because it is based\n   on TCP, SSH
    suffers similar problems as motivate the HTTP protocol to\n   transition to UDP-based
    QUIC [QUIC].  These include: unauthenticated\n   network intermediaries can trivially
    disconnect SSH sessions; SSH\n   connections are lost when mobile clients change
    IP addresses;\n   performance limitations in OS-based TCP stacks; many round-trips
    to\n   establish a connection; duplicate flow control on the level of the\n   connection
    as well as channels.  This memo specifies SSH key exchange\n   over UDP and leverages
    QUIC to provide a UDP-based transport.\n\n\t "

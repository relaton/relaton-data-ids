  content: "   This document describes Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Private Set\n
    \  Intersection (ECDH-PSI) for 2 participants.  It instantiates the\n   classical
    Meadows match-making protocol with standard elliptic curves\n   and hash-to-curve
    methods, enabling the participants to find common\n   records in a privacy-respecting
    way.  In ECDH-PSI, records are\n   encoded to points on an elliptic curve, and
    masked by the private\n   keys of both participants.  To compute the intersection,
    a\n   participant only uses the jointly masked datasets and its original\n   dataset
    locally, which prevents its partner from learning the private\n   records not
    in the intersection.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "\n   In this draft, we present what P2PSIP should achieve - a distributed\n
    \  location service.  Then we compare the differences between C/S SIP\n   and
    P2P SIP and point out that some features which are not\n   standardized in C/S
    SIP should be addressed in the P2P SIP case.\n   After analyzing some problems,
    some requirements of Peer protocol are\n   proposed.\n\n\t "

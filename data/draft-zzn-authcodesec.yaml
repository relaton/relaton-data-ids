  content: "   This document specifies a mechanism to enhance domain transfer\n   security
    by transitioning from a shared-secret authorization model to\n   a asymmetric
    cryptographic signature-based validation system.  Using\n   asymmetric cryptographic
    signatures enables many benefits over a\n   shared secret, such as non-repudiation,
    improved auditability through\n   clear identification of the authorizing entity,
    elimination of the\n   need for registries to store and secure shared secrets,
    replay\n   protection through timestamp validation, and reduced risk of\n   interception
    since only the private key needs to remain secret.\n\n   This document establishes
    the following AuthCodeSEC extension of EPP\n   with the following protocol elements:\n\n\t "

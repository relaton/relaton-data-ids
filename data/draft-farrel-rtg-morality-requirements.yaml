  script: Latn
  content: "It has often been the case that morality has not been given proper consideration
    in the design and specification of protocols produced within the Routing Area.
    This has led to a decline in the moral values within the Internet and attempts
    to retrofit a suitable moral code to implemented and deployed protocols has been
    shown to be sub-optimal.\n\n This document specifies a requirement for all new
    Routing Area Internet-Drafts to include a \"Morality Considerations\" section,
    and gives guidance on what that section should contain. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

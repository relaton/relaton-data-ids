  content: "Future networks will consist of photonic switches, optical \ncrossconnects,
    and routers that may be configured with bundled links \nconsisting of a number
    of user component links and an associated \ncontrol channel.  This draft specifies
    a link management protocol \n(LMP) that runs between neighboring nodes and will
    be used for both \nlink provisioning and fault isolation.  A unique feature of
    LMP is \nthat it is able to isolate faults in both opaque and transparent \nnetworks,
    independent of the encoding scheme used for the component \nlinks. LMP will be
    used to maintain control channel connectivity, \nverify component link connectivity,
    and isolate link, fiber, or \nchannel failures within the network.\n\t "

  content: "This document establishes a set of extended SMTP policy codes for\nanti-spam.
    \ It seeks to provide additional codes for error texts that\ncurrently use the
    extended SMTP error code 5.7.1.  The anti-spam\ncodes were determined by looking
    at error texts produced by major\nISPs and finding commonalities.  The result
    is a new set of error\ntexts with associated extended SMTP error codes.\n\t "

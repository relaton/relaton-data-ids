  content: "   Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse and\n   integrate
    Layer 2 and Layer 3.  They can be applied to various\n   datalinks including intermittent
    links such as ATM SVC.\n \n   Intermittent links require signaling to establish
    VCs before\n   employing them and to release VCs after utilizing them.  Because\n
    \  signaling often introduces delays and costs, some kind of\n   optimization
    is necessary.\n \n   This document proposes to introduce a VC pool to reduce the
    delays\n   and the costs of signaling.\n\t "

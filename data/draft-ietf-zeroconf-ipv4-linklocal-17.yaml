  script: Latn
  content: "To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured
    with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically
    from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    server. Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be
    available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful
    subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available.
    This document describes how a host may automatically configure an interface with
    an IPv4 address within the 169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with
    other devices connected to the same physical (or logical) link.\n\n IPv4 Link-Local
    addresses are not suitable for communication with devices not directly connected
    to the same physical (or logical) link, and are only used where stable, routable
    addresses are not available (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks). This document
    does not recommend that IPv4 Link-Local addresses and routable addresses be configured
    simultaneously on the same interface. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

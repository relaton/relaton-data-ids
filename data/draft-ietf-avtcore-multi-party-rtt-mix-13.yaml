  content: "   Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify the\n
    \  source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be\n   presented
    by endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the\n   same source, while
    new text from other sources is also presented in\n   readable grouping as received
    interleaved in real-time.\n\n   Use of RTT is increasing, and specifically, use
    in emergency calls is\n   increasing.  Emergency call use requires multi-party
    mixing.  RFC\n   4103 \"RTP Payload for Text Conversation\" mixer implementations
    can\n   use traditional RTP functions for source identification, but the\n   performance
    of the mixer when giving turns for the different sources\n   to transmit is limited
    when using the default transmission\n   characteristics with redundancy.\n\n   Enhancements
    for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing are provided in this\n   document, suitable
    for a centralized conference model that enables\n   source identification and
    rapidly interleaved transmission of text\n   from different sources.  The intended
    use is for real-time text\n   mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing
    an efficient\n   presentation or other treatment of a multi-party real-time text\n
    \  session.  The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the\n   CSRC
    list in the RTP packet for source identification.  The method\n   makes use of
    the same \"text/t140\" and \"text/red\" formats as for two-\n   party sessions.\n\n
    \  Solutions using multiple RTP streams in the same RTP session are\n   briefly
    mentioned, as they could have some benefits over the RTP-\n   mixer model.  The
    possibility to implement the solution in a wide\n   range of existing RTP implementations
    made the RTP-mixer model be\n   selected to be fully specified in this document.\n\n
    \  A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a\n   mixer
    and a participant can handle the multi-party coded real-time\n   text stream using
    the RTP-mixer method.  The capability is indicated\n   by use of an SDP media
    attribute \"rtt-mixer\".\n\n   The document updates RFC 4103 \"RTP Payload for
    Text Conversation\".\n\n   A specification of how a mixer can format text for
    the case when the\n   endpoint is not multi-party aware is also provided.\n\n\t "

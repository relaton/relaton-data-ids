  content: "   This document updates the TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH)\n   specification
    [ECH-DRAFT] to support an implicit mode in ECH signaled\n   by a new implicit_ech
    extension in ECHConfigContents.  Clients that\n   detect this extension override
    certain base ECH rules:\n\n   *  They MAY choose any outer SNI instead of public_name.\n\n
    \  *  They MAY choose any value for the config_id without an application\n      profile
    or being externally configured.\n\n   *  They MAY use another value than ECHConfig.contents.public_name
    in\n      the \"server_name\" extension (rather than they SHOULD use it)\n\n   Client-facing
    servers that include implicit_ech in the ECHConfig MUST\n   accommodate flexible
    config_id usage as defined in Section 10.4. of\n   [ECH-DRAFT].  This approach
    enables the removal of stable identifiers\n   (fixed config ID and known public_name)
    that on-path adversaries can\n   use to fingerprint a connection.\n\n   This improves
    upon the \"Do Not Stick Out\" design goal from\n   Section 10.10.4 of [ECH-DRAFT]
    by allowing clients to choose\n   unpredictable identifiers on the wire in the
    scenario where the set\n   of ECH configurations the client encounters is small
    and therefore\n   popular public_name or config_id values \"stick out\".\n\n   Note
    that this increases CPU usage in multi-key deployments because\n   client-facing
    servers must perform uniform trial decryption to handle\n   arbitrary config_id
    values.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed before publishing
    as an RFC.\n\n   Discussion of this document takes place on the Transport Layer\n
    \  Security mailing list (tls@ietf.org), which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/tls/.\n\n

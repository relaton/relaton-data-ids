  content: "This document defines the problem statement, scope, and protocol requirements
    between the components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) reference model.
    \ NEA provides owners of networks (e.g., an enterprise offering remote access)
    a mechanism to evaluate the posture of a system.  This may take place during the
    request for network access and/or subsequently at any time while connected to
    the network.  The learned posture information can then be applied to a variety
    of compliance-oriented decisions.  The posture information is frequently useful
    for detecting systems that are lacking or have out-of-date security protection
    mechanisms such as: anti-virus and host-based firewall software.  In order to
    provide context for the requirements, a reference model and terminology are introduced.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

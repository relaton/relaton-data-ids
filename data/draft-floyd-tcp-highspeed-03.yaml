  content: "This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's\ncongestion
    control mechanism for use with TCP connections with\nlarge congestion windows.
    \ The congestion control mechanisms\nof the current Standard TCP constrains the
    congestion windows\nthat can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments.  For\nexample,
    for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets\nand a 100 ms round-trip
    time, achieving a steady-state\nthroughput of 10 Gbps would require an average
    congestion\nwindow of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most\none
    congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets (or\nequivalently, at most one congestion
    event every 1 2/3 hours).\nThis is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint.
    \ To\naddress this limitation of TCP, this document proposes\nHighSpeed TCP, and
    solicits experimentation and feedback from\nthe wider community.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   On IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA is deployed using RoCEv2\n   protocol.
    RoCEv2 specification does not define the congestion\n   management and load balancing
    methods. RoCEv2 relies on the existing\n   Link-Layer Flow-Control IEEE 802.1Qbb(Priority-based
    Flow Control,\n   PFC)to provide a lossless network. RoCEv2 Congestion Management(RCM)\n
    \  use ECN(Explicit Congestion Notification, defined in RFC3168) to\n   signal
    the congestion to the destination and use the congestion\n   notification to reduce
    the rate of injection and increase the\n   injection rate when the extent of congestion
    decreases. More and more\n   practice of congestion management for RoCEv2 appear
    in the industry,\n   such as DCQCN(Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification).
    There\n   is a demanding for the new RoCE protocol(temporary alias RoCEv3) to\n
    \  provide stronger congestion management and load balancing mechanisms\n   for
    RDMA deployment in modern datacenter.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines an architecture and selection process for\n   providing
    local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in the\n   event of a single
    link or node failure until the router has\n   converged.  When computing the primary
    next-hop for a prefix, a\n   router S also determines an alternate next-hop which
    can be used if\n   the primary next-hop fails.  The alternate next-hop is said
    to be a\n   loop-free alternate, which goes to a neighbor whose shortest path
    to\n   the prefix does not go back through the router S.\n\t "

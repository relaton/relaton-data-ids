  content: "   While DNS highly depends on cache, its cache usage of non-existence\n
    \  information has been limited to exact matching.  This draft proposes\n   the
    aggressive use of a NSEC/NSEC3 resource record, which is able to\n   express non-existence
    of a range of names authoritatively.  With this\n   proposal, it is expected that
    shorter latency to many of negative\n   responses as well as some level of mitigation
    of random sub-domain\n   attacks (referred to as \"Water Torture\" attacks).  It
    is also\n   expected that non-existent TLD queries to Root DNS servers will\n
    \  decrease.\n\n\t "

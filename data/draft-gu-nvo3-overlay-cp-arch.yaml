  content: "   Draft [overlay-cp] has introduced some control plan requirements and\n
    \  characteristics.  From NVE's perspective, this draft describes what\n   assistance
    is needed to make NVE satisfy the requirements and\n   characteristics introduce
    in [overlay-cp].  Not all of these\n   assistance is necessarily achieved by an
    external controller.  Some\n   of the assistance requirements can be regarded
    as a complementarity\n   requirements to [overlay-cp] . while others are requirements
    to an\n   assistance Database.  This draft also provide considerations on how\n
    \  the network virtualization architecture should be like and how these\n   assistance
    can be fulfilled.  The target is to help the working group\n   to figure out the
    architecture of overlay control plane, instead of\n   providing solutions.\n\n\t "

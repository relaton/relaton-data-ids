  content: "   SPICE provides a selective disclosure mechanism of credentials from\n
    \  issuer.  However, future network services may be built on the trust\n   between
    multiple entities.  Obtaining the public key of multiple\n   issuers for a verifer
    from potential multiple sources can be complex.\n   In this contribution, an optional
    public key service is proposed in\n   SPICE architecture for the issue of obtaining
    the public keys of the\n   issuers from multiple trusted entities.  The basic
    function of public\n   key service is proposed including public key registration,
    token\n   verification, and a potential implementation such as the distributed\n
    \  ledger.  We hope that the proposed contribution can be used as\n   infomative
    for SPICE regarding to the token validation procedure.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes JSON and CBOR serializations for Falcon, a
    Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) signature suite. This document does not define
    any new cryptography, only seralizations of existing cryptographic systems. This
    document registers key types for JOSE and COSE, specifically NTRU. Key types in
    this document are specified by the cryptographic algorithm family in use by a
    particular algorithm as discussed in RFC7517. This document registers signature
    algorithms types for JOSE and COSE, specifically FALCON1024 and others as required
    for use of various parameterizations of the Falcon post-quantum signature scheme.</p>"

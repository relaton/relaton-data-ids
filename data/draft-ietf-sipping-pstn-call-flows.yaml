  content: "This document contains best current practice examples of Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) call flows showing interworking with the Public Switched Telephone
    Network (PSTN).  Elements in these call flows include SIP User Agents, SIP Proxy
    Servers, and PSTN Gateways.  Scenarios include SIP to PSTN, PSTN to SIP, and PSTN
    to PSTN via SIP.  PSTN telephony protocols are illustrated using ISDN (Integrated
    Services Digital Network), ISUP (ISDN User Part), and FGB (Feature Group B) circuit
    associated signaling.  PSTN calls are illustrated using global telephone numbers
    from the PSTN and private extensions served on by a PBX (Private Branch Exchange).
    \ Call flow diagrams and message details are shown.\n\t "

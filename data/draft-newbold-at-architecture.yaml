  content: "   Authenticated Transfer (AT) is a collection of protocol components\n
    \  that together provide a generic framework for interoperable social\n   web
    applications, using global aggregations of interlinked, self-\n   certifying data
    records.\n\n   This informational document provides an overview of the entire\n
    \  system, as implemented in late 2025.  Some of those components may be\n   in
    scope as work for the IETF, while other components may not.  Many\n   components
    are general-purpose and may find use outside of the\n   context of AT.  The intent
    of this document is to provide context for\n   how all the components can fit
    together for certain use cases.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo expands on the Selective Acknowledgement Protocol described\n
    \  in RFC2018 to improve its performance and efficiency while reducing\n   the
    delay involved in recovering lost segments.  This leads to very\n   reliable and
    efficient communications regardless of transit delay or\n   high levels of lost
    segments due to noise or congestion.  It\n   introduces a fundamentally new way
    of looking at Selective\n   Acknowledgement and uses this concept to improve the
    performance of\n   the RFC2018 protocol.  This memo proposes an implementation
    of the\n   improved SACK and discusses its performance and related issues.\n\n\t "

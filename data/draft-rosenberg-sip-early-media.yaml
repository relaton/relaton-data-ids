  content: "Early Media is the ability of two SIP user agents to communicate\nbefore
    a SIP call is actually established. Support for early media is\nimportant largely
    for interoperability with the PSTN. Unfortunately,\nmany SIP devices are providing
    this capability today without a well-\ndocumented, consistent, and complete solution.
    We define the problem\nof early media, document and describe the difficulties
    with the\ncurrent approach used in SIP UAs, and present a more formal protocol\nmechanism
    that resolves these difficulties\n\t "

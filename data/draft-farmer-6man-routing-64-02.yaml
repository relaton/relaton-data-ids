  content: "   There is a common misconception that the IPv6 Addressing Architecture\n
    \  requires the use of only /64 subnet prefixes for subnet routing.\n   This document
    clarifies the characterization of the relationship\n   between IPv6 routing and
    the 64 bit boundary, which is that of a\n   recommendation for the use of /64
    subnet prefixes for subnet routing\n   in most circumstances, not a requirement
    for such.  To further\n   clarify this relationship, the document also provides
    operational\n   guidance for the configuration of subnet prefixes and updates\n
    \  RFC 4291 accordingly.\n\n\t "

  content: "Distributed calendaring is gradually becoming more demanding than\n   standalone
    calendaring and scheduling. The use of calendaring and\n   scheduling has grown
    exponentially  and enterprise and inter-\n   enterprise business has become so
    dependent on group scheudling\n   applications. But there is no Internet standard
    to provide\n   interoperability among various calendaring applications.\n   Consequently,
    user need to install different conduit programs to\n   access these calendaring
    stores. This memo proposes a HTTP based\n   simple calendaring access protocol
    which allows web, email and any\n   HTTP compliant clients to access and manipulate
    calendar store.\n \n   The motivation for this proposal is the expanded scope
    and diversity\n   of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web provides a simple
    and\n   effective means for users to search, browse, retrieve, and publish\n   information
    of their own available for others. Now that Web browsers\n   and servers are ubiquitous
    on the Internet, it is worthwhile to use\n   HTTP as transport protocol and XML
    to encode calendar objects. The\n   power and extensibility of XML allows us to
    represent calendar data\n   objects as well-formed XML documents.\n \n   Simple
    Calendar Access Protocol(SCAP) allows exchanging calendaring\n   information between
    scheduling systems using the Hypertext Transfer\n   Protocol (HTTP). This allows
    users to schedule meetings with anyone\n   else, no matter what scheduling software
    they use.\n \n   This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and content-types\n
    \  ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of calender properties,\n   creation
    and management of calendar objects, and namespace\n   manipulation.\n\t "

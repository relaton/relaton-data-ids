    based IP communications between Internet domains in support of \nQoS and AAA.
    Detailed message flows and message contents are \ndiscussed and specified. AAA
    requirements including inter-domain and \nuser authorization in mobile and non-mobile
    environments are \naddressed. A solution is proposed where session setup and teardown
    \nare linked with QoS and AAA signaling using AAA policy servers and \nclearinghouses.\n\t "

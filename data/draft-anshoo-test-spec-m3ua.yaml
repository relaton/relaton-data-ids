  content: "This document presents the test specification for M3UA (MTP3 User\nAdaptation)
    protocol (RFC 3332), which can be used to test M3UA\nimplementations for conformance
    to the protocol definition. The list\nof test is exhaustive and covers almost
    all the categories of test.\nThis draft can also be used in conjunction with M3UA
    specification by\nimplementers of protocol as implementers guide, as the pictorial\nrepresentation
    of various scenarios help easy understanding of the\nprotocol.\nNext revision
    of the draft will cover the additions done to the\nprotocol revision and any subsequent
    RFC published by IETF.\n\t "

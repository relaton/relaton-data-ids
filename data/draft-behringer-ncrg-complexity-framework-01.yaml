  content: "   Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there
    is\n   no generally accepted definition of the term.  Complexity metrics\n   exist
    in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address\n   only a particular
    aspect of a network, for example the complexity of\n   a graph or software.  While
    it may be impossible to define a metric\n   for overall network complexity, there
    is a desire to better\n   understand the complexity of a network as a whole, as
    deployed today\n   to provide Internet services.  This document provides a framework
    to\n   guide research on the topic of network complexity, as well as some\n   practical
    examples for trade-offs in networking.\n\n   This document summarizes the work
    of the IRTF's Network Complexity\n   Research Group (NCRG) at the time of its
    closure.  It does not\n   present final results, but a snapshot of an ongoing
    activity, as a\n   basis for future work.\n\n\t "

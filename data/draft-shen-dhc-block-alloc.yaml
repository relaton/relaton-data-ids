  content: "   A new DHCP address allocation mechanism called Micro-blocking\n   is
    proposed in this document. It is used for DHCP proxy servers or\n   routers working
    with DHCP servers to maximize the IP address\n   allocation efficiency while improve
    dynamic routing scalability\n   in provider's networks. A DHCP sub-option within
    the relay agent\n   information option 82 is defined in this document. This simple\n
    \  DHCP extension can be applied as a simple IP address-pool management\n   among
    multiple IP devices.\n\n\t "

  content: "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are designed to detect \nintrusions
    and protect the relative network or hosts. Now the \nnetwork scale is becoming
    larger and larger, Large-scale \nDistributed Intrusion Detection Systems, which
    are IDSs that work\nin such environments, are the trends of IDSs evolution.  \nThis
    document describes a hierarchy framework for Large-scale \nDistributed Intrusion
    Detection Systems, with which a Large-scale\nDistributed IDS can be flexibly deployed.
    \ Each node in this \nframework can be seen as a simple IDS.  This document gives
    a \nfour-layer structure for the simple IDS. This four-layer structure\ncan also
    be the structure of an independent IDS. \n\t "

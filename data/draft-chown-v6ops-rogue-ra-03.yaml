  script: Latn
  content: "When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are\nconfigured
    to send IPv6 Router Advertisements to convey information\nto nodes that enable
    them to autoconfigure on the network.  This\ninformation includes the implied
    default router address taken from\nthe observed source address of the Router Advertisement
    (RA) message,\nas well as on-link prefix information.  However, unintended\nmisconfigurations
    by users or administrators, or possibly malicious\nattacks on the network, may
    lead to bogus RAs being present, which in\nturn can cause operational problems
    for hosts on the network.  In\nthis draft we summarise the scenarios in which
    rogue RAs may be\nobserved and present a list of possible solutions to the problem.
    \ We\nfocus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text.  The goal of\nthis
    text is to be Informational, and as such to present a framework\naround which
    solutions can be proposed and discussed.\n\t "

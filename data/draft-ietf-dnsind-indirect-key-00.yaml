- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "[RFC 2535] defines a means for storing cryptographic public keys in\nthe
    Domain Name System.  An additional code point is defined for the\nalgorithm field
    of the KEY resource record (RR) to indicate that the\nkey is not stored in the
    KEY RR but is pointed to by the KEY RR.\nEncodings to indicate different types
    of key and pointer formats are\nspecified.\n\n[This draft is moved from the DNSSEC
    WG as part of that WG's merger\ninto me DNSIND WG.  It would have been draft-ietf-dnssec-indirect-\nkey-02.txt
    in the DNSSEC WG.]\n\t "

  content: "Consider an ATM network and a set of IP routers connected to it. The set
    of routers is under control of different organizations, so that some of the routers
    participate in intra-domain routing protocol(s) of each organization, and some
    routers exchange routing information across organizational boundaries (by participating
    in inter-domain routing).  We refer to to latter as 'exterior' routers.  Moreover,
    we assume that the inter-domain routing protocols supported by these routers are
    either BGP-4 [BGP-4] or IDRP (for IP or IPv6) [IDRP].\n\t "

  content: "   Network function appliances such as subscriber termination,\n   firewalls,
    tunnel switching, intrusion detection, and routing are\n   currently provided
    using dedicated network function hardware.  As\n   network function is migrated
    from dedicated hardware platforms into\n   a virtualized environment, a set of
    use cases with application\n   specific resilience requirements begin to emerge.\n\n
    \  These use cases and requirements cover a broad range of capabilities\n   and
    objectives, which will require detailed investigation and\n   documentation in
    order to identify relevant architecture, protocol\n   and procedure solutions
    to ensure reliance of user services using\n   virtualized functions.\n\n   This
    document provides an analysis of the key reliability\n   requirements for applications
    and functions that may be hosted within\n   a virtualized environment.  These
    NFV engineering requirements are\n   based on a variety of uses cases and goals
    , which include\n   reliability scalability, performance, operation and automation.\n\n
    \  Note that this document is not intended to provide or recommend\n   protocol
    solutions.\n\n\t "

  content: "The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IPID for fragmentation and\nreassembly.
    \ This field was commonly used by network diagnosticians for\ntracking packets
    on multi-tier networks. In IPv6, the IPID has been\nmoved to the Fragment header.
    \ A new Diagnostic header for IPv6 which\ncan be sent with every packet as a part
    of the Destination Options\nheader with a 64-bit IPID is defined in this document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp) is used for compressing the\n
    \  IP payload in transmission to increase the communication performance.\n   The
    IPComp is applied to payload of the IP datagram, starting with\n   the first octet
    immediately after the IP header in IPv4, and starting\n   with the first octet
    after the excluded IPv6 Extension headers.\n   However, Transport layer information
    such as source port and\n   destination port are useful in many network functions
    in\n   transmission.\n\n   This document defines extensions of IP payload compression
    protocol\n   (IPComp) to support compressing the payload excluding the transport\n
    \  layer information, to enable network functions using transport layer\n   information
    (e.g., ECMP) working together with the payload\n   compression.  This document
    also defines an extension of IPComp to\n   indicate the payload is not compressed
    to solve the out-of-order\n   problems between the compressed and uncompressed
    packets.\n\n\t "

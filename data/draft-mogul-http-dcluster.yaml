  content: "HTTP 'Delta encoding,' the transmission of a compact\nencoding of the
    change between instances of a Web resource\ninstead of retransmitting the entire
    new value, has been\nshown to be of potential value.  Research has shown\nadditional
    benefits if deltas can be computed between\ninstances of different resources.
    \ This document describes\na compatible extension to HTTP delta encoding to support\n'clustering',
    where multiple resources (URLs) are treated\nas a pool, and the use of 'templates',
    where a large set of\nresource instances are most naturally described as deltas\nfrom
    a chosen template resource.\n\t "

  content: "   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a special capability that\n
    \  defines an ordered list of network services as a virtual chain and\n   makes
    a network more flexible and manageable.  However, SFC is\n   vulnerable to various
    attacks caused by compromised switches,\n   especially the middlebox-bypass attack.
    \ In this document, we propose\n   a security architecture that can detect not
    only middlebox-bypass\n   attacks but also other incorrect forwarding actions
    by compromised\n   switches.  The existing solutions to protect SFC against compromised\n
    \  switches and middlebox-bypass attacks can only solve individual\n   problems.
    \ The proposed architecture uses both probe-based and\n   statistics-based methods
    to check the probe packets with random pre-\n   assigned keys and collect statistics
    from middleboxes for detecting\n   any abnormal actions in SFC.\n\n\t "

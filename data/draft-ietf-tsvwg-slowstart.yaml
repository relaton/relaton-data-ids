  content: "This document describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start
    for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  For TCP connections
    that are able to use congestion windows of thousands (or tens of thousands) of
    MSS-sized segments (for MSS the sender's MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start
    procedure can result in increasing the congestion window by thousands of segments
    in a single round-trip time.  Such an increase can easily result in thousands
    of packets being dropped in one round-trip time.  This is often counter-productive
    for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard on the rest of the traffic sharing the
    congested link.  This note describes Limited Slow-Start as an optional mechanism
    for limiting the number of segments by which the congestion window is increased
    for one window of data during slow-start, in order to improve performance for
    TCP connections with large congestion windows.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

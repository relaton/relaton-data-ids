  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes a traffic engineering framework for multi-layer path\nnetworks
    using dynamic virtual topology configuration capability of\nGMPLS protocols.  The
    electrical label switched path is routed over the\nvirtual topology built on a
    set of optical label switched path in multi-\nlayer path networks.  The virtual
    topology is dynamically altered by\nsetting up or tearing down optical label switched
    paths.  Virtual topol-\nogy is configured in response to traffic demand change
    so that conges-\ntion of the network is mitigated.  Utilization of label switched
    path is\nmeasured at ingress node and disseminated with routing protocol\nextensions
    for the individual node to decide whether the virtual topol-\nogy should be altered
    or not without centralized coordination.\n\t "

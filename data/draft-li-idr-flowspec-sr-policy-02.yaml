abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Flowspec, an extension of BGP, facilitates the distribution of
    traffic flow specification rules and supports steering traffic into Segment Routing
    (SR) Policies. However, current approaches that leverage Flowspec to direct traffic
    toward a SR Policy exhibit certain limitations (for detailed analysis, refer to
    Section 1). Using the Community Container attribute, this document defines two
    new standard actions for the BGP Flowspec Version 2 (FSv2) protocol: the Redirect
    to SR Policy Action and the SRv6 SID Action. The former enables traffic to be
    directed to a designated SR Policy, while the latter supports encapsulating an
    additional SRv6 SID as required during redirection. The Redirect to SR Policy
    Action may be used either independently or in conjunction with the SRv6 SID Action,
    depending on the specific application scenario. Additionally, the SRv6 SID Action
    can be combined with other actions defined in FSv2, such as the Redirect to IPv6
    Action.</p>"

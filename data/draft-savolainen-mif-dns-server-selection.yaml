  content: "A multi-homed node can be connected to multiple networks that may\nutilize
    different DNS namespaces.  The node often receives DNS server\nconfiguration information
    from all connected networks.  Some of the\nDNS servers may have information about
    namespaces other servers do\nnot have.  When the multi-homed node needs to utilize
    DNS, it has to\nchoose which of the servers to contact to.  This document describes
    a\npolicy based method for helping on selection of DNS server for both\nforward
    and reverse DNS lookup procedures with help of DNS suffix and\nIPv6 prefix information
    received via DHCPv6.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes requirements for Localized Mobility\nManagement
    (LMM) for Mobile IP and Mobile Ipv6 protocols.  \nThese requirements are intended
    to guide the design of a protocol \nspecification for LMM.  Localized Mobility
    Management, in general,\nintroduces enhancements to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6
    to\nreduce the amount of latency in binding updates sent to the Home\nAgent and,
    for route-optimization, Correspondent Nodes, upon\nCare of Address change. In
    addition, LMM seeks to reduce the\namount of signaling over the global Internet
    when a mobile\nnode traverses within a defined local domain.  The identified \nrequirements
    are essential for localized mobility management \nfunctionality. They are intended
    to be used as a guide for \nanalysis on the observed benefits over the identified
    requirements \nfor architecting and deploying LMM schemes.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the problem statement, use cases, and requirements
    for a "Distributed Inference Network" (DIN) in the era of pervasive AI. As AI
    inference services become widely deployed and accessed by billions of users, applications
    and devices, traditional centralized cloud-based inference architectures face
    challenges in scalability, latency, security, and efficiency. DIN aims to address
    these challenges by leveraging distributed edge-cloud collaboration, intelligent
    scheduling, and enhanced network security to support low- latency, high-concurrency,
    and secure AI inference services.</p>

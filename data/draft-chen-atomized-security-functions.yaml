  content: "   At present, many security products are deployed in the network, and\n
    \  the security functions of security products overlap.  Atomized\n   security
    function refers to the smallest representation unit of\n   security function,
    which cannot be split again and can be implemented\n   by independent code.  Atomized
    security functions can quickly and\n   effectively assemble security capabilities
    and provide security\n   services.  It no longer takes security products as the
    unit, but\n   atomic security functions as the basic unit, by reorganize and define\n
    \  the security functions supported by existing network devices then\n   provide
    guidance for secure routing, finally, each security function\n   will be uniformly
    coded.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The LDAPv3 protocol (as specified in [1]) is designed to be a lightweight
    access protocol for directory services supporting X.500 models. In addition, in
    an Internet context, many of the names about which users seek information are
    Internet email addresses. A native LDAP based directory service for the Internet
    should make it convenient to process such names -- there is a huge social investment
    spanning two decades to get to the point where names like 'john.doe@somewhere.com'
    can appear in newspaper articles, TV commercials, and on billboards and millions
    of people understand what do with them.                                              This
    draft defines a very simple convention for  looking up information associated
    with people identified by Internet email addresses - really nothing more than
    identifying an existing capability of LDAP, in the hopes that the convention can
    become widespread.\n\t "

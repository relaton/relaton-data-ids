  script: Latn
  content: "RFC 3971 and 3972 (SEND) define a protocol for securing resolution of
    \na statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 address to a link address as \ndefined by
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. SEND does this by requiring the \nautoconfigured addresses
    to be cryptographically generated by the \nhost from an RSA public key. However,
    one drawback of SEND is that \nsuch addresses cannot be securely proxied. Proxy
    Neighbor Discovery \nis important for Mobile IPv6 and in certain other cases.
    In this \ndocument, we describe an extension of SEND to addresses that are \ncryptographically
    generated using multiple public keys, called multi-\nkey CGAs. Neighbor Discovery
    messages for multi-key CGAs are signed \nwith an RSA ring signature, a type of
    signature that can be generated \nusing the private key of any node from a group
    of nodes but which \nrequires the public keys of all group members to verify.
    Multi-key \nCGAs can be securely proxied by all nodes that contribute keys to
    the \naddress. The advantage of multi-key CGAs over other techniques of \nsecure
    address proxying, such as trusting the router or using an \nattribute certificate,
    is that it preserves location privacy. A \nreceiver cannot determine from the
    IPv6 address, ring signature, or \ncryptographic parameters whether the node or
    the proxy is defending \nthe address, and hence whether the node is on or off
    the link. \n\t "

    requirements of the small medium enterprise.  Where tape\nhas been deployed in
    the past, DIAP now offers an alternative\nsolution designed to be more robust

    disk storage alone.\nThe system provides a well defined structure for storing
    and managing\nlong term archives.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft

  content: "   This document describes an approach to addressing nodes in Mobile \n
    \  Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) which involves assigning a separate subnet \n   to
    each MANET router.  This approach avoids many of the problems \n   that arise
    in other approaches, and is intended to allow existing \n   protocols and applications
    to work unmodified. \n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The disable_1rtt_encryption transport parameter can be used to\n   negotiate
    the disablement of encryption on 1-RTT packets, allowing\n   for reduced CPU load
    and improved performance.  This extension is\n   only meant to be used in environments
    where both endpoints completely\n   trust the path between themselves; not, for
    instance, on the open\n   internet.\n\n\t "

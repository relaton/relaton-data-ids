abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification entails enabling power and performance management
    in Routers (multi-chassis and single chassis) with respect to TCAM and SRAM usage
    on intelligent router line cards that implement Virtual Aggregation of routes.
    The version 00 of this document had several errata that have been addressed in
    this version. This scheme relates to unicast alone since multicast entries are
    programmed only after consultation with the unicast entries in the software plane
    in the Route processor. Hence this scheme does not apply to multicast.</p>"

  content: "MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork) allows users to form a private wireless\n
    \  network, without existing centralized administrator that support\n   multi-hop
    communication and low network establishment cost.  Recently\n   some interesting
    work has been published to allow manet node access\n   to the Internet via internet
    gateway which is placed on the border of\n   manet and the Internet.  The Internet
    gateway has an important role\n   to support global connectivity.  This document
    introduces the\n   management of internet gateway, routing policy and load balancing
    for\n   the scenario where multiple mobile gateways exist for an ad hoc\n   network.\n\t "

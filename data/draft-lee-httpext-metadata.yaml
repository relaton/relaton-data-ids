  content: "This document provides a mechanism by which web servers can provide\n
    \  metadata of a web resource which is indicated by a URL.  The web\n   client
    like web browser can use this metadata to filter out unwanted\n   web resource
    or link to itself.  In addition, the web client can take\n   advantage of such
    metadata to provide high-level services like\n   displaying additional information
    about the web resource without\n   downloading it.  We expect this mechanism to
    enable quick access to\n   metadata of any web resource from any web client reduces
    overall web\n   traffic remarkably.\n\n\t "

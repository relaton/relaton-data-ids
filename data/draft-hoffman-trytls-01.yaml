  content: "   Many Internet servers offer content in two transports: unencrypted,\n
    \  and encrypted with TLS.  A user who accesses some content with a URL\n   that
    indicates unencrypted (such as \"http:\") might prefer to get the\n   content
    encrypted but doesn't bother to change the URL to indicate\n   this.  This proposal
    allows Internet clients, particularly web\n   clients and mail user agents, to
    do a DNS lookup to see whether they\n   might expect content for a particular
    host to also be available under\n   TLS.  Using the DNS for this is much faster
    than attempting a TLS\n   session that might time out or take many round trips
    in order to\n   discover that the content is not available.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Demand for Ultra high-Reliability and Low-latency Communication\n   (URLLC)
    and Broadband Assured IP Services (BAS) will grow as new\n   service scenarios
    like 5G, IoT, AR/VR, Cloud are deployed.  As these\n   new service scenarios will
    typically rely on shared packet\n   infrastructure like Internet, methods to ensure
    URLLC and BAS\n   performance across the underlying network resources will be
    required.\n   This document outlines the motivation and key requirements for URLLC\n
    \  or BAS connectivity across heterogeneous network domains.  It also\n   outlines
    the corresponding models and architecture required for\n   providing orchestrated
    URLLC or BAS communication.\n\n\t "

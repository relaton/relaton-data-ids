  content: "The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to deliver real-time\ncontent
    and, along with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), forms the\ncontrol channel between
    the sender and receiver.  However, RTP and\nRTCP assume a single delivery path
    between the sender and receiver\nand make decisions based on the measured characteristics
    of this\nsingle path.  Increasingly, endpoints are becoming multi-homed, which\nmeans
    that they are connected via multiple Internet paths.  Network\nutilization can
    be improved when endpoints use multiple parallel\npaths for communication.  The
    resulting increase in reliability and\nthroughput can also enhance the user experience.
    \ This document\nextends the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) so that a single\nsession
    can take advantage of the availability of multiple paths\nbetween two endpoints.\n\t "

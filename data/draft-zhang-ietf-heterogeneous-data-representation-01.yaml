  content: "   With the advent of 5G era, sensing devices and mobile Internet\n   devices
    in smart factories are everywhere, and a variety of\n   industrial data from different
    spatial devices becomes widely\n   available and interwoven. These data are usually
    generated by\n   streaming, with huge differences in data sources and structures,\n
    \  massive scale, strong correlation and complicated relationship. The\n   great
    richness of data makes the problem of how to quickly,\n   accurately and deeply
    dig the hidden value behind the data more\n   complicated than ever. The data
    generated in different fields are\n   distributed in a variety of business systems,
    and these data have\n   different structures and forms, so it is difficult to
    use an\n   efficient form of unified analysis. Based on the data characteristics\n
    \  of heterogeneous data, the multi-source heterogeneous data fusion\n   method
    is studied based on tensor.\n\n\t "

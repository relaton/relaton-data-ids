  content: "The proposed [I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header] defines a header\nfield
    used to capture email verification results obtained at border\nreceptions has
    been approved for publication.  However, serious\ndeficiencies remain in its secure
    use and has prompted an appeal of\nthe publication decision.  This new header
    field is to convey to Mail\nUser Agents (MUA) and downstream processes the verification
    results\nthat are intended to augment handling decisions and message\nannotations
    that might be made visible to recipients.  For such use,\nit is crucial to include
    within an \"authenticated-results\" header, a\ntruly authenticated identity.\n\nThe
    draft acknowledges that it confuses authorization with\nauthentication in section
    1.5.2.  This confusion has lead the draft\nto incorrectly elevate the authorization
    of an SMTP client into the\nauthentication of an email-address domain.  Elevating
    the\n*authorization* of the SMTP client into the *authentication* of an\nemail-address
    domain incorrectly assumes current email practices\nadequately restrict the use
    of an email-address domain based upon the\noriginating IP address of the SMTP
    client.  In an era of carrier\ngrade NATs, virtual servers, aggregated services,
    and other\ntechniques that overload the IP address, this assumption is neither\nsafe
    nor practical.\n\nAlthough the draft explicitly declares Sender-ID and SPF as
    the\nauthorization of the transmitting SMTP client, it fails to offer the\nauthenticated
    identity being trusted.  A truly authenticated identity\nis essential for reputation
    assessments which section 4.1 indicates\nshould be made prior to results being
    revealed.  A reputation check\nof a truly authenticated identifier is often a
    necessary step needed\nto mitigate fraud and abuse.  In addition, it is unfair
    to attribute\nfraud or abuse to the unauthenticated identifiers.  Even so, the\nheader
    offers no assurance that any reputation check has been made,\nnor does it ensure
    that an authenticated identity, the IP address of\nthe SMTP client, can be determined
    by the MUA or downstream process.\nThe goal of the appeal is to ensure adequate
    information is available\nwhen annotating email.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative\n
    \  Framework (ACE-GF), a cryptographic construction for deriving and\n   reconstructing
    stable cryptographic identities from user-held\n   credentials without requiring
    persistent storage of a master secret.\n\n   ACE-GF addresses a structural limitation
    of existing deterministic\n   key-derivation and identity systems, which rely
    on long-lived root\n   secrets and rigid derivation hierarchies.  By separating
    identity\n   reconstruction from long-term secret storage, ACE-GF enables\n   stateless
    identity recovery, credential rekeying, and context-\n   isolated derivation across
    multiple cryptographic algorithms.\n\n   The framework is designed to be application-agnostic
    and may be\n   applied to diverse environments such as authentication systems,\n
    \  distributed identities, secure key management, and cryptographic\n   wallets.
    \ This document defines the core construction, security\n   properties, and interoperability
    considerations of ACE-GF, while\n   application-specific profiles are defined
    separately.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative
    Framework (ACE-GF), a cryptographic construction for deriving and reconstructing
    stable cryptographic identities from user-held credentials without requiring persistent
    storage of a master secret. ACE-GF addresses a structural limitation of existing
    deterministic key-derivation and identity systems, which rely on long-lived root
    secrets and rigid derivation hierarchies. By separating identity reconstruction
    from long-term secret storage, ACE-GF enables stateless identity recovery, credential
    rekeying, and context- isolated derivation across multiple cryptographic algorithms.
    The framework is designed to be application-agnostic and may be applied to diverse
    environments such as authentication systems, distributed identities, secure key
    management, and cryptographic wallets. This document defines the core construction,
    security properties, and interoperability considerations of ACE-GF, while application-specific
    profiles are defined separately.</p>"

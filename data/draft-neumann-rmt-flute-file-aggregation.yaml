  content: "   This document introduces a logical and physical file aggregation\n
    \  scheme for File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE).  The\n   logical
    file aggregation mechanism is a generalized grouping\n   mechanism, allowing to
    logically group files.  The physical file\n   aggregation scheme allows, additionally
    to a logical grouping, to\n   more efficiently use Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    in the context of\n   FLUTE, in particular when dealing with a large number of
    \"small\"\n   files.  Unlike a solution based on the creation of an archive, the\n
    \  object aggregation scheme (1) avoids the need to perform preliminary\n   transformations
    on the content and (2) preserves the possibility to\n   extract a subset of the
    content, which may be critical aspect with\n   some partially reliable broadcasting
    test cases.\n\t "

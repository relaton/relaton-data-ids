  content: "This document defines a profile for the structure of the Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI) distributed repository.  Each individual repository
    publication point is a directory that contains files that correspond to X.509/PKIX
    Resource Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists and signed objects.  This
    profile defines the object (file) naming scheme, the contents of repository publication
    points (directories), and a suggested internal structure of a local repository
    cache that is intended to facilitate synchronization across a distributed collection
    of repository publication points and to facilitate certification path construction.

  content: "There are existing communities of LDAP, X.500 and Whois++ servers\non
    the Internet.  An LDAPv3 server can be a part of one of more of\nthese communities.
    \ LDAP directory services would benefit from\nreduced naming conflicts and increased
    ability to locate servers\nand information both within LDAP islands and between
    LDAP and\nother communities.  This document recommends guidelines for naming\nand
    interconnection of LDAP servers to enable the existence of\ncommunities of a loosely
    coupled LDAP-based directory service that\ncan leverage the X.500 knowledge model
    and the existing\ninfrastructure of names from the Domain Name System (DNS).  This\nwill
    facilitate the establishment of a global naming plan and the\ninterconnection
    of a global directory.\n\n\t "

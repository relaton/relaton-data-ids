  content: "   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a map-and-encap\n   mechanism
    to enable communications between hosts identified with\n   their Endpoint IDentifier
    (EID) over the Internet where EIDs are not\n   routable.  To do so, packets toward
    EIDs are encapsulated in packets\n   with routing locators (RLOCs) to form dynamic
    tunnels.  An Ingress\n   Tunnel Router (ITR) that encapsulates EID packets determines
    tunnel\n   endpoints via mappings that associate EIDs to RLOCs.  Before\n   encapsulating
    a packet, the ITR queries the mapping system to obtain\n   the mapping associated
    to the EID of the packet it must encapsulate.\n   Such mapping is cached by the
    ITR in its local EID-to-RLOC cache for\n   any subsequent encapsulation for the
    same EID.  LISP is scalable\n   because EID-to-RLOC mappings are cached on ITRs.
    \ Initially, the\n   cache is empty and is populated progressively according to
    the\n   traffic traversing the ITR.  However, after an ITR is restarted,\n   e.g.,
    for maintenance reason, its cache is empty which means that all\n   packets that
    are re-routed to the freshly restarted ITR will cause\n   cache misses and a potentially
    high loss rate.  In this draft, we\n   present mechanisms to reduce the negative
    impact on traffic caused by\n   the restart of an ITR in a LISP network.\n\n\t "

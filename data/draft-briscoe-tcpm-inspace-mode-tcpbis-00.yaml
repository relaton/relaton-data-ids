  content: "   This document describes an experimental redesign of TCP's\n   extensibility
    mechanism.  It aims to traverse most known middleboxes\n   including connection
    splitters, by making it possible to tunnel all\n   TCP options within the TCP
    Data.  It provides a choice between in-\n   order and out-of-order delivery for
    TCP options.  In-order delivery\n   is a useful new facility for options that
    control datastream\n   processing.  Out-of-order delivery has been the norm for
    TCP options\n   until now, and is necessary for options involved with acknowledging\n
    \  data, otherwise flow control can deadlock.  TCP's original design\n   limits
    TCP option space to 40B.  In the new design there is no such\n   arbitrary limit,
    other than the maximum size of a segment.  The TCP\n   client can immediately
    start to use the extra option space\n   optimistically from the very first SYN
    segment, by using a dual\n   handshake.  The dual handshake is designed to prevent
    a legacy server\n   from getting confused and sending the control options to the\n
    \  application as user-data.  The dual handshake is only one strategy -\n   a
    single handshake will usually suffice once deployment is underway.\n   In summary,
    the protocol should allow new TCP options to be\n   introduced i) with minimal
    middlebox traversal problems; ii) with\n   incremental deployment from legacy
    servers; iii) with zero\n   handshaking delay iv) with a choice of in-order and
    out-of-order\n   delivery v) without arbitrary limits on available space.\n\n\t "

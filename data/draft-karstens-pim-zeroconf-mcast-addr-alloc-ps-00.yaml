abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a network that requires unique multicast\n
    \  addresses to distribute data.  Various challenges are discussed, such\n   as
    the use of multicast snooping to ensure efficient use of\n   bandwidth, limitations
    of switch hardware, problems associated with\n   address collisions, and the need
    to avoid user configuration.  After\n   all limitations were considered it was
    determined that multicast\n   addresses need to be dynamically-assigned by a decentralized,
    zero-\n   configuration protocol.\n\n   Requirements and recommendations for suitable
    protocols are listed\n   and specific considerations for assigning IPv4 and IPv6
    addresses are\n   reviewed.  The document closes with several solutions that are\n
    \  precluded from consideration.\n\n\t "

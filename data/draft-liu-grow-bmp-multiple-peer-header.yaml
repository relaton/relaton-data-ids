abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a format of multiple peer header for aggregating
    BMP messages. It can be used to compress multiple BMP messages with per-peer header
    into one aggregated BMP message, which could reduce the amount of reported BMP
    messages and reduce network overhead.</p>"

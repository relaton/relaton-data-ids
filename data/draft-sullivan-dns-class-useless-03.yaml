  content: "   Domain Name System Resource Records are identified in part by their\n
    \  class.  The class field is not effective, and it is not used the way\n   it
    appears to have been intended.  This memo suspends additions to\n   the DNS class
    registry pending greater clarity on how classes might\n   be used, and until such
    clarification requires those defining new\n   RRTYPEs to define them for all classes.\n\n\t "

  content: "         Fax over IP is currently using SMTP, i.e. the fax is sent\n         as
    an e-mail.  It would be desireable to support a fax\n         delivery that can
    return status of the transmission in\n         real time, such as whether the
    phone number or address\n         was correct, whether the remote side was busy,
    etc. The\n         ITU is standardizing a protocol for transferring real\n         time
    fax over IP, T.38.  This standard is meant to be\n         used with the H.323
    standard, but it is also possible to\n         use it together with SIP, provided
    that SDP is extended\n         to support the necessary parameters. This document\n
    \        defines extensions to SDP to support the use of T.38 for\n         real-time
    fax.\n\n\t "

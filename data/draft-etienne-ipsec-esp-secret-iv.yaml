  content: "This memo presents a system of secret IV for ESP, based on the\nencryption
    of the sequence number.  It doesn't add any space overhead\nin the packet and
    its generation can be parallelized and precomputed.\nCompared to the common explicit
    random IV (current MUST for ESP\nRFC2405.3 [5], or AES-CBC.3 [7]), it is more
    secure, saves bandwidth\n(e.g.  8 bytes with DES/3DES and 16 bytes with AES) but
    requires\nslightly more computation.\n\t "

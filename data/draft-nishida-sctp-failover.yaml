  content: "One of the major advantages in SCTP is supporting multi-homing\ncommunication.
    \ If an multi-homed end-point has redundant network\nconnections, sctp sessions
    can have a good chance to survive from\nnetwork failures by migrating inactive
    network to active one.\nHowever, if we follow the SCTP standard, there can be
    significant\ndelay for the network migration.  During this migration period, SCTP\ncannot
    transmit much data to the destination.  This issue drastically\nimpairs the usability
    of SCTP in some situations.  This memo\ndescribes the issue of SCTP failover mechanism
    and discuss its\nsolutions which require minimal modification to the current standard.\n\nStatus
    of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with

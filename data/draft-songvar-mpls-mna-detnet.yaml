abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies formats and mechanisms for using MPLS Network
    Actions (MNA) to support Deterministic Networking (DetNet) services, including
    bounded latency, low loss and in-order delivery. It defines MPLS In-Stack and
    Post-Stack MNA for carrying DetNet-specific information, such as flow identification,
    sequence number, and latency information, which are forwarded over an MPLS technology-
    based network domain.</p>"

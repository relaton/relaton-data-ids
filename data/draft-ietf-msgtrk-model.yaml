  content: "Customers buying enterprise message systems often ask: Can I track the
    messages? Message tracking is the ability to find out the path that a particular
    message has taken through a messaging system and the current routing status of
    that message.  This document provides a model of message tracking that can be
    used for understanding the Internet-wide message infrastructure and to further
    enhance those capabilities to include message tracking, as well as requirements
    for proposed message tracking solutions.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   The operation of a prefix delegation procedure with the DHCPv6\n   protocol
    may need route setup and maintenance at the Delegating\n   Router, Requesting
    Router and on the entity on which the Relay agent\n   is implemented.  This document
    describes the problem of routing\n   during DHCPv6 prefix delegation, and is illustrated
    by ADSL-type and\n   cellular-type of topologies which may use Relays; we refer
    to section\n   14 of RFC 3633 which mentions the need of 'a protocol or other
    out of\n   band communication to add routing information for delegated\n   prefixes'.
    \ Based on this problem, a number of requirements from the\n   service providers
    are described.\n\n   A small set of documented solutions are separately mentioned\n
    \  (snooping, route injection, etc.), together with their pros and cons\n   according
    to a particular judgment.\n\n\t "

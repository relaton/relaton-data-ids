  content: "RIP v2 as described in RFC 2453 and RIPNG as described in RFC 2080,\ndo
    not support learning multiple equal cost routes to a destination \nthrough different
    neighbors.But in today’s internet it is very \ncommon to have topologies where
    there are more than one route to a \ndestination. This document describes the
    modifications to the \nRIP/RIPNG protocols to handle this scenario and describes
    how to \napply the split horizon and poison reverse for such routes. It is\nsimple,
    light and is compatible with the implementations which do not\nsupport this feature.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   IETF published Fast Handovers in Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) for efficient\n
    \  mobility management. FMIPv6 has no solutions to protect binding \n   update
    messages. Previous researches have mainly concentrated on \n   using AAA, public
    certificates or cryptographic algorithms for \n   authentication of FMIPv6. However
    the approaches need a particular\n   infrastructure or heavy processing cost to
    authenticate binding \n   updates in FMIPv6. Extended Return Routability provides
    \n   authentication for FMIPv6 without infrastructure and costly\n   cryptographic
    algorithms. Also it can be used for various existing\n   handover protocol in
    MIPv6 network.   \n\n\t "

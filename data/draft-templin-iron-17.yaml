  content: "Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth due to increasing
    demand, it is clear that current routing architectures and operational practices
    must be updated.  This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON)
    that supports sustainable growth while requiring no changes to end systems and
    no changes to the existing routing system.  IRON further addresses other important
    issues including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming, traffic engineering
    and NAT traversal.  While business considerations are an important determining
    factor for widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.  This
    document is a product of the IRTF Routing Research Group.  This document defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

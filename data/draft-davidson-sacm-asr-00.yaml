  content: "   This specification defines the Asset Summary Reporting (ASR), a data\n
    \  model for expressing the data exchange format of summary information\n   relative
    to one or more metrics. ASR reduces the bandwidth\n   requirement to report information
    about assets in the aggregate since\n   it allows for reporting aggregates relative
    to metrics, as opposed to\n   reporting data about each individual asset, which
    can lead to a\n   bloated data exchange. ASR is vendor neutral and leverages widely\n
    \  adopted, open specifications; it is flexible, and suited for a wide\n   variety
    of reporting applications.\n\n\n\t "

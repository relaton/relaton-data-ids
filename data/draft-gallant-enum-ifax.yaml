  content: "E.164 numbers are often used for fax addresses. Internet fax \nprovides
    store-and-forward (T.37) and real-time (T.38) modes. \nSubscribers could use ENUM
    to store Internet fax preferences in DNS \nunder their fax numbers. Network devices
    could then query DNS to \nretrieve that information. An example is subscriber
    preferences for \nreceiving faxes via Internet mail or SIP delivery. Further work
    on \nENUM for Internet Fax is indicated, one example being H.323 \ndelivery. Policy
    aspects are out of scope of this draft. This \ndocument is not associated with
    any working group. Comments may be \nsent to the author.\n\t "

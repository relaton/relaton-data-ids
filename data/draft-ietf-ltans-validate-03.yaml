  content: "Digitally signed documents and data in a LTANS service receive the\nsignature
    renwal procedures and non-repudiation services.  As\ndocuments can be stored for
    very long (theoretically inifinite)\ntimes, it is very important to understand
    which data is and will be\nnecessary for the verification of the contained digital
    signatures\nand the applied timestamps and the evidence records.  This document\nshall
    describe various pieces of information which SHOULD and MUST be\nprovided to effectively
    verify evidence records and their protected\ndata and signatures.\n\t "

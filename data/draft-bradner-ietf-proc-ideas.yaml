  content: "The problem working group has shown that a number of IETF\nparticipants
    feel that the current process by which the IETF approves\ndocuments for publication
    as RFCs needs to be changed.  There does\nnot seem to be consensus on specific
    reasons that change is needed\nbut there seems to be consensus that change is
    needed.  This document\nis designed to provide some ideas on different ways that
    the current\nprocesses could be revised.  My intent is to spur discussion on\npossibilities,
    not to say (at this time) what my preference is.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines the media and security architecture for Media\n
    \  Over QUIC, a protocol suite intended to run in browsers and other\n   non-browser
    endpoints and support unified architecture and protocol\n   for data delivery
    that enables a wide range of media applications\n   with different resiliency
    and latency needs without compromising the\n   scalability and cost effectiveness
    associated with content delivery\n   networks.\n\n   Note to readers: This document
    as it stands might not reflect\n   accurately all decisions that are in active
    discussions in the WG,\n   but it lays out a foundation for expected architectural
    requirements.\n   The specification will be updated based on the decision made
    in the\n   WG.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Entities responsible for distributing work across a group of systems traditionally
    do not know a great deal about the ability of the applications on those systems
    to complete the work in a satisfactory fashion.  Workload management systems traditionally
    know a great deal about the health of applications, but have little control over
    the rate in which these applications receive work.  The Server/Application State
    Protocol (SASP) provides a mechanism for load balancers and workload management
    systems to communicate better ways of distributing the existing workload to the
    group members.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The architecture described in this document aims at giving as many
    \n   unicast-only end-users access to IP multicast content, this without \n   the
    need for their ISPs to upgrade their network infrastructure to \n   IP multicast.
    It further does not require any change to the unicast \n   only infrastructure
    nor to the end-user operating systems. The \n   access that is provided, is from
    a user's perspective as good as a \n   real IP multicast connection. It can be
    used to send and receive ASM \n   content and allows the receptions of SSM content.
    It further allows \n   applying Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
    to IP \n   Multicast. \n\t "

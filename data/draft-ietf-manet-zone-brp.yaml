  content: "The Bordercast Resolution Protocol (BRP) provides the bordercasting\npacket
    delivery service used to support network querying applications.\nThe BRP uses
    a map of an extended routing zone, provided by the local \nproactive Intrazone
    Routing Protocol (IARP), to construct bordercast\n(multicast) trees, along which
    query packets are directed. Within the\ncontext of the hybrid ZRP, the BRP is
    used to guide the route requests\nof the global reactive Interzone Routing Protocol
    (IERP).  The BRP\nemploys special query control mechanisms to steer route requests
    away\nfrom areas of the network that have already been covered by the query.\nThe
    combination of multicasting and zone based query control makes\nbordercasting
    an efficient and tunable service that is more suitable\nthan flood searching for
    network probing applications like route \ndiscovery.\n\t "

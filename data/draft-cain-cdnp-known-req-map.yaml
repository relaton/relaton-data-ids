  content: "This memo presents a number of known mechanisms used to direct\nclient
    application requests to surrogate servers based on various\npolicies. In this
    memo we group mechanisms commonly called request\nrouting, content routing or
    content redirection under the term\nrequest mapping. There exist multiple request
    mapping mechanisms. At\na high-level, these may be classified under: DNS Request
    Mapping,\nTransport-layer Mapping, and Application-layer Mapping.\n\t "

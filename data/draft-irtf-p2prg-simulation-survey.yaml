- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols, like all distributed protocols, are\n
    \  complex, and therefore harder to debug and study in the wild.  This\n   is
    more true of existing p2p protocols, where changing the behaviour\n   of the protocol
    --- however minor the change may be --- may result in\n   unknown manifestations
    on the dynamics of the swarm using that\n   protocol.  In lieu of the unintended
    consequences of perturbing a\n   live swarm, researchers have resorted to simulation
    frameworks.\n   However, simulation results obtained from one simulator are often\n
    \  hard to reproduce when using another simulation framework.  This\n   document
    surveys existing simulator frameworks prevalent in\n   simulating p2p protocols
    today in order to quantify any assumptions\n   and characteristics inherent in
    the simulator.  This, we hope, will\n   aid future researchers in choosing the
    right simulation framework for\n   their abstraction.\n\n\t "

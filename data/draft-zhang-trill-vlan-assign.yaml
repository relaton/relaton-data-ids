- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   If RBridges are casually assigned as Appointed Forwarders for VLANs\n
    \  without considering the number of MAC addresses and traffic load of\n   these
    VLANs, it may overload some of the RBridges while leave other\n   RBridges lightly
    loaded, which reduces the scalability of a RBridge\n   network and undermines
    its performance.\n\n   A new mechanism is designed in this document to support
    the adaptive\n   VLAN assignment (or Appointed Forwarder selection) based on the\n
    \  forwarders' reporting of their usage of MAC tables and available\n   bandwidth.\n\n\t "

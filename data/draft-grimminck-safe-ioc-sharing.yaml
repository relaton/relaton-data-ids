abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a consistent and reversible method for sharing
    potentially malicious indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as URLs, IP addresses,
    email addresses, and domain names. It introduces a safe defanging format to prevent
    accidental execution or activation when IOCs are displayed or transmitted. These
    techniques aim to standardize the safe dissemination of threat intelligence data.
    This specification uses the URI syntax defined in RFC 3986 and follows the key
    word conventions from RFC 2119.</p>"

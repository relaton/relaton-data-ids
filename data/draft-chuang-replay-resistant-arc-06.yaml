  content: "   DKIM (RFC6376) is an IETF standard for the cryptographic protocol to\n
    \  authenticate email at the domain level and protect the integrity of\n   messages
    during transit.  Section 8.6 defines a vulnerability called\n   DKIM Replay as
    a spam message sent through a SMTP MTA DKIM signer,\n   that then is sent to many
    more recipients, leveraging the reputation\n   of the signer.  We propose two
    Replay Resistant cryptographic domain\n   based protocols that leverage ARC (RFC8617).
    \ The first technique\n   discloses all SMTP recipients as signed RFC822 headers
    by the sender\n   which allows a receiver to verify this.  The second technique
    defines\n   a SMTP extension that allows both the sender and receiver to\n   participate
    in signing the message signature.  It includes a path\n   building technique that
    accurately defines the SMTP forwarding path\n   of the message.  Both techniques
    permit a receiver to detect DKIM and\n   ARC replay attacks and other attacks.
    \ This specification also\n   defines a relay flow identifier to prevent spammers
    from using relay\n   forwarding.  We do this by having relays categorize their\n
    \  authenticated traffic flows and publish to receivers identifiers\n   associated
    with those flows.  Receivers can use this identifier to\n   help categorize traffic
    through the relay and use that identifier to\n   apply fine-grain anti-abuse policies
    instead of on the entire traffic\n   through the relay.\n\n\t "

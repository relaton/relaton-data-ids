  content: "   Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Security Layer\n
    \  (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application\n   protocols
    such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the\n   last few years, several
    serious attacks on TLS have emerged,\n   including attacks on its most commonly
    used cipher suites and modes\n   of operation.  This document provides recommendations
    for improving\n   the security of both software implementations and deployed services\n
    \  that use TLS and DTLS.\n\n\t "

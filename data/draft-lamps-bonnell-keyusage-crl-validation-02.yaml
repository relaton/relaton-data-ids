abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 5280 defines the profile of X.509 certificates and certificate\n
    \  revocation lists (CRLs) for use in the Internet.  This profile\n   requires
    that certificates which certify keys for signing CRLs\n   contain the key usage
    extension with the cRLSign bit asserted.\n   Additionally, RFC 5280 defines steps
    for the validation of CRLs.\n   While there is a requirement for CRL validators
    to verify that the\n   cRLSign bit is asserted in the keyUsage extension of the
    CRL issuer's\n   certificate, there is no requirement for validators to verify
    the\n   presence of the keyUsage extension itself.  The lack of this\n   requirement
    will cause verifiers that implement the RFC 5280 CRL\n   validation algorithm
    to accept a CRL which is signed by a certificate\n   with no keyUsage extension,
    and therefore does not explicitly have\n   the cRLSign bit asserted.\n\n   This
    document specifies an enhancement to the CRL validation process\n   to explicitly
    require the presence of the keyUsage extension in CRL\n   issuer certificates
    to resolve this issue.\n\n\t "

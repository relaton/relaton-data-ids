abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS-DPA is an experimental, identity-bound security protocol inspired
    by the design of TLS 1.3 ( [RFC8446] ). It is intended to operate consistently
    across environments where conventional IP address and port semantics are weak,
    unstable, or intentionally absent, including zero-port transports such as UZP
    ( [UZP] ). TLS-DPA generalises the handshake so it is not tied to server-side
    listeners, binds authentication to Service Identities rather than network coordinates,
    reduces metadata exposure to intermediaries (including rendezvous nodes in UZP
    fabrics), provides a unified hybrid-KEM post-quantum transition model ( [NIST-PQC]
    ), and supports session continuity across overlay path changes (e.g., QUIC Connection
    IDs; [RFC9000] ).</p>"

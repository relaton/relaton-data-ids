  script: Latn
  content: "   This document investigates the design space for resolution and\n   rendezvous
    mechanisms for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP.) It\n   identifies and describes
    specific issues that HIP resolution and\n   rendezvous mechanisms should address.
    \ These issues include\n   dependencies on the DNS, lack of support for direct
    communication\n   based on host identities, lack of a reverse lookup mechanism
    for host\n   identities, and DNS and node rendezvous.\n\n   This document does
    not propose specific resolution and rendezvous\n   mechanisms.  Different alternative
    solutions will be described and\n   discussed in companion documents.  These documents
    should analyze if\n   and to what degree the specific proposals they present address
    the\n   issues identified here.\n\t "

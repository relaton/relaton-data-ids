  content: "   This document defines a new certificate type and extension for the\n
    \  exchange of Verifiable Credentials in the handshake of the Transport\n   Layer
    Security (TLS) protocol.  The new certificate type is intended\n   to add the
    Verifiable Credentials as a new means of authentication.\n   The resulting authentication
    process leverages a distributed ledger\n   as the root of trust of the TLS endpoints'
    public keys.  The\n   endpoints can use different distributed ledger technologies
    to store\n   their public keys and to perform the TLS handshake.\n\n\t "

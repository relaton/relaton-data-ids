  content: "   This document describes network coding as a network function.  It\n
    \  also describes how a network coding function can be virtualized and\n   integrated
    with virtual network functions architectures.  The network\n   coding function
    is not a traditionally implemented network function\n   in dedicated hardware
    as those that have triggered network function\n   virtualization.  It refers to
    a novel network functionality that\n   generalizes classic packet-level end-to-end
    coding.  Classic packet-\n   level end-to-end coding helps in the provision of
    quality of service\n   by trading off delay and reliability.  Network coding goes
    beyond\n   that by enabling in-network optimized re-encoding, which can provide\n
    \  both throughput gains and diverse network-controlled degrees of\n   reliability.
    \ Consequently, a virtualized network coding function can\n   serve as a flow
    engineering tool over virtualized networks (e.g. over\n   network slices).\n\n\t "

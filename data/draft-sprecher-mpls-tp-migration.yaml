  content: "   MPLS-TP defines a packet-based network architecture and a\n   comprehensive
    set of tools that allow service providers to reliably\n   deliver next generation
    services and applications, in a simple,\n   scalable, and cost-effective way.
    \ Such services are BW-hungry based\n   and require strict guaranteed SLA.  Delivering
    next generation\n   services over an MPLS-TP based network in an economic way,
    enables\n   service providers to remain competitive while increasing their\n   revenues.\n\n
    \  This document presents the motivations for migrating from different\n   legacy
    transport networks and services to MPLS-TP, and discusses the\n   considerations
    and strategies for the migration.\n\n   The document also proposes specific activities
    and techniques needed\n   to ensure a smooth migration path from the different
    transport\n   networks and services to MPLS-TP.\n\n\t "

  content: "Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between\nusers
    in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not\nrequired to be, short.
    \ IMs are often used in a conversational mode,\nthat is, the transfer of messages
    back and forth is fast enough for\nparticipants to maintain an interactive conversation.
    \ Each message\ncan be sent independently using the SIP MESSAGE method, or messages\ncan
    be associated into sessions that are initiated using SIP.  The\nfirst approach
    is often referred to as pager-mode messaging, due to\nits similarity to the behavior
    of two way pager devices.  The second\napproach is often called session-mode messaging,
    or simply message\nsessions.  This document describes a message session mechanism
    based\non the Common Presence and Instant Messaging message format.\n\t "

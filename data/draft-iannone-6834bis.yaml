- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes the LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol)\n
    \  Map-Versioning mechanism, which provides in-packet information about\n   Endpoint
    ID to Routing Locator (EID-to-RLOC) mappings used to\n   encapsulate LISP data
    packets.  The proposed approach is based on\n   associating a version number to
    EID-to-RLOC mappings and the\n   transport of such a version number in the LISP-specific
    header of\n   LISP-encapsulated packets.  LISP Map-Versioning is particularly\n
    \  useful to inform communicating Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and\n   Egress
    Tunnel Routers (ETRs) about modifications of the mappings used\n   to encapsulate
    packets.  The mechanism is optional and transparent to\n   implementations not
    supporting this feature, since in the LISP-\n   specific header and in the Map
    Records, bits used for Map-Versioning\n   can be safely ignored by ITRs and ETRs
    that do not support or do not\n   want to use the mechanism.\n\n\t "

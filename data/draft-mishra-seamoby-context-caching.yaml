  content: "The use of neighbor graphs as a method for dynamically caching the\ncontext
    of mobile stations in front of the station's mobility path can\nreduce the latency
    of handoff's between base stations or access points.\nNeighbor graphs capture
    the set of all potential mobility paths for a\nwireless network. Given any base
    station or access point, the set of all\npossible hand-offs can easily be determined
    by examining the neighbor\ngraph in either a distributed fashion (at each base
    station) or\ncentralized at the AAA server. This draft describes how the neighbor\ngraph
    algorithm works at both the base station and the AAA server.\n\n\t "

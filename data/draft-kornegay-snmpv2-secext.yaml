  content: "One of the concerns with SNMPv2 is its lack of security model extensibility.
    \     It is the purpose of this memo, Security Model Extensibility for SNMPv2,
    to propose possible solutions providing security model extensibility for SNMPv2.
    \      It is hoped that these proposals are complementary to and can be integrated
    with proposals currently under consideration in the SNMPv2 working group.\n\t "

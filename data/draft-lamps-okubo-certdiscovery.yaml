- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a method to discover a secondary X.509\n   certificate
    associated with an X.509 certificate to enable efficient\n   multi-certificate
    handling in protocols.  The objective is threefold:\n   to enhance cryptographic
    agility, improve operational availability,\n   and accommodate multi-key/certificate
    usage.  The proposed method\n   aims to maximize compatibility with existing systems
    and is designed\n   to be legacy-friendly, making it suitable for environments
    with a mix\n   of legacy and new implementations.  It includes mechanisms to provide\n
    \  information about the target certificate's signature algorithm,\n   public
    key algorithm and the location of the secondary X.509\n   certificate, empowering
    relying parties to make informed decisions on\n   whether or not to fetch the
    secondary certificate.\n\n   The primary motivation for this method is to address
    the limitations\n   of traditional certificate management approaches, which often
    lack\n   flexibility, scalability, and seamless update capabilities.  By\n   leveraging
    this mechanism, subscribers can achieve cryptographic\n   agility by facilitating
    the transition between different algorithms\n   or X.509 certificate types.  Operational
    redundancy is enhanced by\n   enabling the use of backup certificates and minimizing
    the impact of\n   primary certificate expiration or CA infrastructure failures.\n\n
    \  The approach ensures backward compatibility with existing systems and\n   leverages
    established mechanisms, such as the subjectInfoAccess\n   extension, to enable
    seamless integration.  It does not focus on\n   identity assurance between the
    primary and secondary certificates,\n   deferring such considerations to complementary
    mechanisms.\n\n\t "

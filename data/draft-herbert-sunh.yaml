abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a network header that is a type of compressed
    IPv4 or IPv6 header. The use case is high performance networking in limited domains,
    in particular in scale-up networks for AI where even modest packet overhead packet
    may be materially detrimental to overall performance. The SUNH network header
    provides three primary benefits: 1) It reduces the amount of on-the-wire protocol
    overhead, 2) It simplifies route lookup to be more efficient with lower latency,
    3) It retains the properties and benefits of a Network Layer header including
    compatibility with deployed Ethernet switches and NICs.</p>"

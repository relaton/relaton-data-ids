  content: "   Efforts to design an internationalization model for electronic mail\n
    \  frequently encounter situations in which an internationalized message\n   --
    perhaps one containing some headers with characters coded in UTF-8\n   -- must
    be converted and transported over a traditional, 7-bit\n   infrastructure.  This
    document provides a specification, building on\n   the design of message/rfc822,
    for encapsulating messages with\n   internationalized headers and/or body part
    content types.\n\n   This specification is one of a group intended to provide
    a modified\n   and extended email environment for fully internationalized email.\n
    \  If approved, it is expected to update the discussion of 'message/'\n   content
    types in RFC 2046.\n\n\t "

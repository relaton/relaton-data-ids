  content: "This document consists of two primary components, a schema for agents
    that make use of the Lightweight Directory Access protocol (LDAP) and a proposed
    use case of that schema, for distributed configuration of similar directory user
    agents.  A set of attribute types and an object class are proposed.  In the proposed
    use case, directory user agents (DUAs) can use this schema to determine directory
    data location and access parameters for specific services they support.  In addition,
    in the proposed use case, attribute and object class mapping allows DUAs to reconfigure
    their expected (default) schema to match that of the end user's environment.  This
    document is intended to be a skeleton for future documents that describe configuration
    of specific DUA services.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

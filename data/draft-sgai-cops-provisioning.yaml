  content: "There is a clear need for a standard way to provision policies to\n        network
    devices. These policies may be related to QoS (Quality of\n        Service), Security,
    VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), etc.\n \n        The IETF RSVP Admission Policy
    (RAP) WG has defined the COPS (Common\n        Open Policy Service) protocol [COPS]
    and a scalable policy control\n        model for RSVP [RSVP].\n \n        This
    document describes a new client type ('Provisioning') for the\n        Common
    Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol to support policy\n        provisioning.  This
    new client type is independent of the type of\n        policy and it is based
    on the concept of PIBs (Policy Information\n        Bases [PIB].\n \n        The
    example of provisioning used in this document is QoS Policy\n        Provisioning
    in a Differentiated Services (DiffServ) environment.\n\t "

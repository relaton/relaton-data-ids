abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Both Nagle mode and delayed ACKs attempt to conserve network and host\nmachine
    resources by delaying transmissions in the expectation that\nthe current material
    can be piggybacked onto a future transmission.\nUnfortunately when both mechanisms
    are active at the same time on\neither end of a connection a deadlock can exist,
    which is broken by\narrival of new data for transmission or firing of the delayed
    ACK\ntimer. This produces classical timer based ACKing, which for the\ncommon
    200ms ACK delay yields five exchanges per second.\n\t "

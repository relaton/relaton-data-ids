  content: "       Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in RFC 5213 [1], is a network-\n
    \      based mobility management protocol. It uses a Mobile Access Gateway\n       (MAG)
    and a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to allow hosts to move around\n       within
    a domain while keeping their address or address prefix stable.\n       Although
    the issues of mobile multicast in the PMIPv6 network are\n       being discussed
    in the Multimob WG, how to provide the service\n       connectivity when the multicast
    source is moving is still a problem\n       for the PMIPv6. This document proposes
    and analyzes the potential\n       solutions of the multicast source mobility
    in PMIPv6.\n\n    \n\t "

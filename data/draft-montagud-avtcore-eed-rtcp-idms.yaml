- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 7272 defines two RTCP messages to enable Inter-Destination Media\n
    \  Synchronization (IDMS).  However, if such RTCP messages are exchanged\n   using
    the Regular RTCP reporting rules specified in RFC 3550,\n   unacceptable delays
    can be originated when exchanging the\n   synchronization information conveyed
    into RTCP packets.  Accordingly,\n   this document proposes Early Event-Driven
    (EED) RTCP reporting rules\n   and messages to enable higher interactivity, dynamism,
    flexibility\n   and accuracy when using RTP/RTCP for IDMS.  Such IDMS extensions
    are\n   targeted at providing faster reaction on dynamic situations, such as\n
    \  out-of-sync situations and channel change delays, as well as a finer\n   granularity
    for synchronizing media-related events, while still\n   adhering to the RTCP bandwidth
    bounds specified in RFC 3550.\n   Besides, a new RTP/AVPF transport layer feedback
    message is proposed\n   to allow the request of re-IDMS setting instructions (e.g.,
    in case\n   of RTCP packet loss) as well as rapid accommodation of latecomers
    in\n   on-going sessions.  Finally, this document also discusses various\n   situations
    in which the reporting of Reduced-Size RTCP packets (RFC\n   3556) can be applicable
    and beneficial for IDMS.\n\n\t "

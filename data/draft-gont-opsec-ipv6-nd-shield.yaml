  content: "   This document specifies a mechanism that can be implemented in\n   layer-2
    devices to mitigate attack vectors based on Neighbor\n   Discovery messages.  It
    is meant to complement other mechanisms\n   implemented in layer-2 devices such
    as Router Advertisement Guard\n   (RA-Guard) and DHCPv6-Shield, with the goal
    of achieving a\n   comprehensive IPv6 First Hop Security solution.  This document
    is\n   motivated by the desire to achieve feature parity with IPv4 with\n   respect
    to First Hop Security mechanisms.\n\n\t "

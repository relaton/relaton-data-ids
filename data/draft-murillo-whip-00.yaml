  content: "   While WebRTC has been very sucessfull in a wide range of scenarios,\n
    \  its adption in the broadcasting/streaming industry is lagging behind.\n   Currently
    there is no standard protocol (like SIP or RTSP) designed\n   for ingesting media
    in a streaming service, and content providers\n   still rely heavily on protocols
    like RTMP for it.\n\n   These protocols are much older than webrtc and lack by
    default some\n   important security and resilience features provided by webrtc
    with\n   minimal delay.\n\n   The media codecs used in older protocols do not
    always match those\n   being used in WebRTC, mandating transcoding on the ingest
    node,\n   introducing delay and degrading media quality.  This transcoding step\n
    \  is always present in traditionnal streaming to support e.g.  ABR, and\n   comes
    at no cost.  However webrtc implements client-side ABR, also\n   called Network-Aware
    Encoding by e.g.  Huavision, by means of\n   simulcast and SVC codecs, which otherwise
    alleviate the need for\n   server-side transcoding.  Content protection and Privacy
    Enhancement\n   can be achieve with End-to-End Encryption, which preclude any
    server-\n   side media processing.\n\n   This document proposes a simple HTTP
    based protocol that will allow\n   WebRTC endpoings to ingest content into streaming
    servics and/or CDNs\n   to fill this gap and facilitate deployment.\n\n\t "

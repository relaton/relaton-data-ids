  content: "   Although the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3) is secure,\n
    \  operators and administrators have found that deploying it can be\n   problematic
    in large distributions, due to a lack of integration\n   between its User-Based
    Security Model (USM) and other authentication\n   and user management infrastructure.
    \ This memo contains an evaluation\n   of three proposals for an integrated security
    model for SNMP, and,\n   based on these proposals, suggests how the ISMS (Integrated
    Security\n   Model for SNMP) working group might move forward.\n\t "

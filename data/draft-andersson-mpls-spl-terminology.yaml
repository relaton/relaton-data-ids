  content: "   This document discusses and recommends a terminology that may be used\n
    \  when MPLS Special Purpose Labels (SPL) are specified and documented.\n\n   Note:
    The rest of the text in this section is not really part of the\n   abstract even
    though the text is placed here.  It is working notes.\n\n   Note: At least at
    the moment it is not the intention to take this\n   document to an RFC, but it
    might be polled to become a wg document to\n   see if the MPLS working group agree
    on the proposed terminology.\n\n   Note: The changes we propose are minor, but
    we might have to progress\n   the document to RFC since there is a proposed change
    to the \"Special-\n   Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Values\"
    registry.\n\n\t "

  content: "   We present a second-factor authentication scheme that extends the\n
    \  Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) method to provide superior\n   protection
    against phishing attacks.\n\n   Unlike traditional one-time password flows that
    solely authenticate\n   the user with the service, our approach introduces an
    extended flow\n   that seamlessly authenticates both the user and the service
    to each\n   other.  This enhanced process ensures a secure submission of the\n
    \  user's second-factor authentication via a secondary and secure\n   communication
    channel.\n\n   By verifying the service's authenticity to the user, our scheme\n
    \  establishes a robust defence against potential phishing attempts,\n   enhancing
    the overall security of the authentication process.\n\n\t "

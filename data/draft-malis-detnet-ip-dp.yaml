  content: "   This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane operation\n
    \  over an IP network.  It is primarily aimed at IPv4, but would work\n   with
    IPv6 as well if a unified solution is desired.\n\n   This document is a derivative
    work from draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01,\n   to augment or replace the text currently
    contained in section 5.2.2.\n\n   Whether this is published as a stand-alone text,
    or serves as a focal\n   point to refine the IP design and subsequently remerged
    with draft-\n   ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01 is a matter for the DETNET WG.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes how to support Route Optimization for Mobile \nNodes
    in IPv6 Mobile Network. The support is provided by Prefix \nDelegation. Mobile
    Router gets a prefix from an access router using \nPrefix Delegation protocol
    and advertises the delegated prefix to its \nsubnet. Each Mobile Nodes makes its
    care-of address from the prefix \nand performs binding update. It allows the Mobile
    Nodes to \ncommunicate with Correspondent Nodes directly, avoiding ingress \nfiltering.\n\t "

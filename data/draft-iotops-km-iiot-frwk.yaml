  content: "   Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet\n   protocols
    supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections.\n   The integration between
    traditional information technology (IT) and\n   operational technology (OT) so
    far has centered around collection of\n   real-time data from devices in OT environment
    for consumption within\n   the enterprise IT networks.  However, improvements
    in process control\n   and automation require a far better interworking between
    the OT and\n   IT applications.  This document provides a reference framework
    for\n   integrated industry networks (IIN).  It highlights interfaces and\n   their
    characteristics required for interconnecting components of OT\n   and IT that
    maybe moved to the cloud or edges.  It suggests the use\n   of IIN to bridge the
    differences between OT and IETF technologies.\n\n\t "

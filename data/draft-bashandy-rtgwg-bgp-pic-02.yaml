  content: "In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millions\nof
    routes, many routes are reachable via more than one path. Given\nthe large scaling
    targets, it is desirable to restore traffic after\nfailure in a time period that
    does not depend on the number of BGP\nprefixes. In this document we proposed an
    architecture by which\ntraffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup
    paths in a\ntimeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. The\nobjective
    is achieved through organizing the forwarding chains in a\nhierarchical manner
    and sharing forwarding elements among the maximum\npossible number of routes.
    The proposed technique achieves prefix\nindependent convergence while ensuring
    incremental deployment,\ncomplete transparency and automation, and zero management
    and\nprovisioning effort. It is noteworthy to mention that the benefits of\nBGP-PIC
    are hinged on the existence of more than one path whether as\nECMP or primary-backup.\n\n\t "

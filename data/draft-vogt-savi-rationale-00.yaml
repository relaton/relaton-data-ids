  content: "The IETF working group on Source Address Validation Improvements,\n   SAVI,
    is chartered to design methods for IP source address validation\n   that complement
    ingress filtering with finer-grained protection.\n   This document summarizes
    the discussion in the SAVI working group and\n   design-related conclusions.  The
    purpose of this is two-fold:  First,\n   to guide the design process in the working
    group with written\n   documentation of decisions and their rationale.  Second,
    to provide a\n   measure for assessing the IP source address validation methods
    that\n   the working group will eventually deliver.\n\t "

  content: "   Currently, in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), there does not\n
    \  exist any means for a user agent client (UAC) to signal to the\n   destination
    user agent server (UAS) that an end-to-end secure channel\n   is to be established.
    \ Instead, what is prevalent today in the\n   protocol is a hop-by-hop security
    model, wherein intermediaries\n   forward a request towards the destination without
    the UAC knowing\n\n   whether or not the intermediary behaved in a trusted manner
    (i.e., it\n   did not, unknown to the UAC, downgrade the security of the downstream\n
    \  channel from the intermediary onwards).  This document discusses the\n   security
    properties of a hop-by-hop model; and in doing so,\n   formulates requirements
    an for an end-to-end security model and a\n   solution that satisfies these requirements.\n\n\t "

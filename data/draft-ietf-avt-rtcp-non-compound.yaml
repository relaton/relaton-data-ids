  content: "This memo discusses benefits and issues that arise when allowing Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTCP) packets to be transmitted with reduced size.  The size
    can be reduced if the rules on how to create compound packets outlined in RFC
    3550 are removed or changed.  Based on that analysis, this memo defines certain
    changes to the rules to allow feedback messages to be sent as Reduced-Size RTCP
    packets under certain conditions when using the RTP/AVPF (Real-time Transport
    Protocol / Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback) profile (RFC 4585).  This document
    updates RFC 3550, RFC 3711, and RFC 4585. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

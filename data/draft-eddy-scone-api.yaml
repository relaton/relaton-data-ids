  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes API considerations to provide applications\n
    \  with network-supplied information about acceptable network flow\n   rates.
    \ Since this information is expected to be signalled from the\n   network within
    the stack below the application using SCONE protocol\n   signalling, it needs
    to be made accessible to applications in order\n   for them to pick proper video
    rates, or to otherwise confine the\n   application behavior within network-defined
    limits.\n\n\t "

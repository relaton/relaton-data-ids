  content: "This document describes a strategy for domain name server operators \nto
    prepare and transition their services for multilingual domain \nnames (IDN – Internationalized
    Domain Names). \nThe IDNX approach accepts that users with non-IDN aware applications
    \nwill be attempting to access multilingual domain names.  Hence it is \nthe registry
    or domain operator's responsibility to provide an IDN \nsolution that resolves
    these issues to make it a seamless transition \nexperience for technically unsophisticated
    users. \nIn essence, the IDNX approach embraces a complementary server-side \nimplementation
    to smooth the transition.  IDNX compliant domain \nservers will successfully resolve
    IDN requests sent via non-IDN aware \napplications, whether they are formatted
    in local encoding, UTF-8 or \nan identifiable variant. \nThe IDNX approach also
    utilizes a dynamic CNAME mechanism to \nprovision for the sub-delegation of multilingual
    domain names to \nhosts running non-IDN aware DNS servers.\n\t "

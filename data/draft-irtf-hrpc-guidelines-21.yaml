  content: "   This document sets guidelines for human rights considerations for\n
    \  developers working on network protocols and architectures, similar to\n   the
    work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973].\n   This is
    an updated version of the guidelines for human rights\n   considerations in [RFC8280].\n\n
    \  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published
    for informational purposes.\n\n   This informational document has consensus for
    publication from the\n   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Human Right Protocol\n
    \  Considerations Research (HRPC) Group.  It has been reviewed, tried,\n   and
    tested by both by the research group as well as by researchers\n   and practitioners
    from outside the research group.  The research\n   group acknowledges that the
    understanding of the impact of Internet\n   protocols and architecture on society
    is a developing practice and is\n   a body of research that is still in development.\n\n\t "

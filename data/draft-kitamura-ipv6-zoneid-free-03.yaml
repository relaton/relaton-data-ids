  content: "   This document describes \"Zone-ID Free\" functions that make end\n
    \  users free from using zone identifiers (Zone-ID) for IPv6 link-\n   local addresses.\n\n
    \  When users deal with IPv6 link-local addresses, it is thought that\n   it is
    mandatory thing to specify accompanied Zone-IDs. For end\n   users, however, it
    is troublesome and nuisance thing to do it.\n   Because it is very hard for normal
    end users to find appropriate\n   Zone-IDs for this purpose.\n\n   From another
    viewpoint, the usage of IPv6 link-local addresses\n   accompanied with Zone-IDs
    is quite different from the traditional\n   usage of global addresses. Therefore
    many problems related with\n   Zone-ID are caused and new specifications are required
    to fix these\n   problems.\n\n   This document explores and describes how \"Zone-ID
    Free\" functions\n   work and how end users are released from using Zone-IDs when
    they\n   deal with IPv6 link-local addresses.\n\n   The \"Zone-ID Free\" functions
    are upper compatible with the current\n   usages of dealing with IPv6 link-local
    addresses and harmless to\n   the existing communications.\n\n   In order to obtain
    appropriate Zone-ID information, a new\n   technology \"Zone-ID Learning\" that
    issues multiple probes is\n   introduced.\n\n\t "

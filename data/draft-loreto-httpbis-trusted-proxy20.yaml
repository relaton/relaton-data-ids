  content: "   The purpose of this Internet Draft is to continue the discussion on\n
    \  explicit and trusted proxy as intermediary of HTTP2 traffic.\n\n   The httpbis
    wg has agreed on the HTTP2 usage with HTTP URIs, with or\n   without TLS, without
    any constraints from the standard (see: issue\n   314).\n\n   To distinguish between
    an HTTP2 connection meant to transport \"https\"\n   URIs resources and an HTTP2
    connection meant to transport \"http\" URIs\n   resource, the draft proposes to\n\n
    \     register a new value in the Application Layer Protocol negotiation\n      (ALPN)
    Protocol IDs registry specific to signal the usage of HTTP2\n      to transport
    \"http\" URIs resources: h2clr.\n\n   This document describes two alternative
    methods for an user-agent to\n   automatically discover and for an user to provide
    consent for a\n   Trusted Proxy to be securely involved when he or she is requesting
    an\n   HTTP URI resource over HTTP2 with TLS.  The consent is supposed to be\n
    \  per network access.  The draft also describes the role of the Trusted\n   Proxy
    in helping the user to fetch HTTP URIs resource when the user\n   has provided
    consent to the Trusted Proxy to be involved.\n\n\t "

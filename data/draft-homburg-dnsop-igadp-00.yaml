  content: "   In some situations it be can attractive to have an authoritative DNS\n
    \  server that does not have a local copy of the zone or zones that it\n   serves.
    \ In particular in anycast operations, it is sensible to have\n   a great geographical
    and topological diversity.  However, sometimes\n   the expected use of a particular
    site does not warrant the cost of\n   keeping local copies of the zones.  This
    can be the case if a zone is\n   very large or if the anycast cluster serves many
    zones from which\n   only a few are expected to receive significant traffic.  In
    these\n   cases it can be useful to have a proxy serve some or all of the\n   zones.
    \ The proxy would not have a local copy of the zones it serves,\n   instead it
    forwards request to another server that is authoritative\n   for the zone.  The
    proxy may have a cache.  This document describes\n   the details of such proxies.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chain (SFC) defines an ordered set of service functions
    (SFs) to be applied to packets and/or frames and/or flows selected due to classification.
    SFC Operation, Administration and Maintenance can monitor the continuity of the
    SFC, i.e., that all SFC elements are reachable to each other in the downstream
    direction. But SFC OAM must support verification that the order of traversing
    these SFs corresponds to the state defined by the SFC control plane or orchestrator,
    the metric referred to in this document as the path consistency of the SFC. This
    document defines a new SFC active OAM method to support SFC consistency check,
    i.e., verification that all elements of the given SFC are being traversed in the
    expected order.</p>"

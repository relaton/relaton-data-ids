abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication\n   mechanisms
    called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication\n   Mechanism (SCRAM), which
    provides a more robust authentication\n   mechanism than a plaintext password
    protected by Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) and avoids the deployment obstacles
    presented by\n   earlier TLS-protected challenge response authentication mechanisms.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the "Payment" HTTP authentication scheme, enabling
    HTTP resources to require a payment challenge to be fulfilled before access. The
    scheme uses the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code with the WWW-Authenticate
    and Authorization headers to negotiate payment between clients and servers. The
    protocol is payment-method agnostic; specific payment methods are defined in separate
    specifications.</p>

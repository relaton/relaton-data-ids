  content: "   [RFC7272] describes the use of RTCP for the purpose of Inter-\n   Destination
    Media Synchronization (IDMS) between Synchronization\n   Clients (SCs) and an
    Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS).\n    This document extends that
    work for application in the area of IPTV.\n    First, RTCP can be used according
    to the single source multicast\n   (SSM) principles from [RFC5760] in the IPTV
    application area.  This\n   document specifies the use of a feedback target for
    collecting and\n   possibly summarizing IDMS reports.  For this, the document
    defines 2\n   new sub-report blocks for the use of IDMS according to the SSM\n
    \  principles.  Alternatively, the MSAS can be co-located with the\n   Feedback
    Target, for synchronizing small groups of receivers.\n   Secondly, in an IPTV
    environment, different viewers may receive the\n   same content, but in non-identical
    streams.  The IDMS solution\n   presented in [RFC7272] will no longer work in
    such a case.  This\n   document provides a solution for this.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery is one of the core protocols of the IPv6 suite,
    and provides in IPv6 similar functions to those provided in the IPv4 protocol
    suite by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and the Internet Control Message
    Protocol (ICMP). Its increased flexibility implies a somewhat increased complexity,
    which has resulted in a number of bugs and vulnerabilities found in popular implementations.
    This document provides guidance in the implementation of Neighbor Discovery, and
    documents issues that have affected popular implementations, in the hopes that
    the same issues do not repeat in other implementations.</p>"

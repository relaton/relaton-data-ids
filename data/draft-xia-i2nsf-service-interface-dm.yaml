  content: "   This draft proposes a generic and intent-driven data model for NSF\n
    \  security policy configuration used by I2NSF clients to negotiate\n   their
    security requirements with various kinds of entities that each\n   provide one
    or more NSFs. The Role Based Access Control (RBAC)\n   reference model [INCITS359
    RBAC] is used to represent which\n   operations can be performed on what set of
    secured objects.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused on \n   environments
    covering Circuit oriented LSPs (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.). \n   There is minimal documentation
    on GMPLS support of Layer-2 Label \n   Switched Paths (L2 LSPs), e.g. native Ethernet
    LSPs, Asynchronous \n   Transfer Mode (ATM) LSPs and Frame Relay (FR) LSPs. \n
    \   \n   This document details GMPLS capabilities for supporting L2 LSPs in \n
    \  several network environments including overlays. As such, it \n   provides
    a reference detailing the applicability of GMPLS for Layer-\n   2 switching environments
    in support of various deployment scenarios,\n   including the integrated (e.g.
    multi LSP-region networks), the \n   augmented/peer and the overlay model (e.g.
    Generalized VPN (GVPN) \n   and user-network interfaces (GMPLS UNI)).\n\t "

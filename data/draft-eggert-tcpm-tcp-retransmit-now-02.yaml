  content: "   This document classifies connectivity disruptions along an end-to-end\n
    \  path into four types and describes how standard TCP mechanisms can\n   lead
    to inefficient or over-aggressive sending behavior when\n   connectivity resumes.
    \ The proposed techniques for TCP mobility\n   detection and response (LMDR) can
    improve behavior for some types of\n   disruptions.  This document describes another,
    complementary and\n   orthogonal modification to TCP's retransmission scheme that
    improves\n   performance for disruption types that TCP LMDR does not address.\n
    \  This extension is based on connectivity indicators, i.e., generic\n   network
    events that may indicate that end-to-end connectivity has\n   resumed.  This document
    focuses on TCP modifications that use\n   connectivity indicators to increase
    performance, but does not define\n   the specifics of such connectivity indicators
    itself.\n\t "

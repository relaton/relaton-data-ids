  content: "   This document updates RFC 8200 by specifying normative requirements\n
    \  on the number of occurrences of IPv6 Extension Headers.  Operational\n   experience
    has demonstrated that permitting multiple occurrences of\n   the same Extension
    Header can create parsing ambiguity, increase\n   attack surface, and complicate
    packet processing in general.  This is\n   especially true for both the Hop-by-Hop
    Options Header and the\n   Destination Options Header, which can contain a number
    of options.\n   This document restricts IPv6 packets to carry at most one instance
    of\n   each Extension Header, with the exception of the Destination Options\n
    \  Header, which is permitted to appear twice as specified in RFC 8200.\n\n\t "

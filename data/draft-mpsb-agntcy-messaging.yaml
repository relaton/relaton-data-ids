  content: "   Agentic AI systems require messaging infrastructure that supports\n
    \  real-time collaboration, high-volume streaming, and dynamic group\n   coordination
    across distributed networks.  Traditional protocols like\n   AMQP, MQTT, and NATS
    address some requirements but fall short on\n   security, particularly regarding
    [AMQP] [MQTT] [NATS] post-compromise\n   protection and quantum-safe encryption
    essential for autonomous\n   agents handling sensitive data.\n\n   This document
    analyzes six messaging protocols—AMQP, MQTT, NATS, AMQP\n   over WebSockets, Kafka,
    and AGNTCY SLIM—across dimensions critical\n   for GenAI agent systems: streaming
    performance, delivery guarantees,\n   security models, and operational complexity.
    \ We examine how each\n   protocol's design decisions impact agentic AI deployments,
    from\n   lightweight edge computing scenarios to large-scale multi-\n   organizational
    collaborations.\n\n   AGNTCY SLIM emerges as a purpose-built solution, integrating
    Message\n   Layer Security (MLS) [RFC9420] with gRPC [gRPC] over HTTP/2 [RFC7540]\n
    \  to provide quantum-safe end-to-end encryption, efficient streaming,\n   and
    OAuth-based authentication [RFC6749].  Unlike transport-layer\n   security approaches,
    SLIM's MLS implementation ensures secure\n   communication even through untrusted
    intermediaries while supporting\n   dynamic group membership changes essential
    for collaborative AI\n   agents.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Agentic AI systems require messaging infrastructure that supports real-time
    collaboration, high-volume streaming, and dynamic group coordination across distributed
    networks. Traditional protocols like AMQP, MQTT, and NATS address some requirements
    but fall short on security, particularly regarding [AMQP] [MQTT] [NATS] post-compromise
    protection and quantum-safe encryption essential for autonomous agents handling
    sensitive data. This document analyzes six messaging protocols—AMQP, MQTT, NATS,
    AMQP over WebSockets, Kafka, and AGNTCY SLIM—across dimensions critical for GenAI
    agent systems: streaming performance, delivery guarantees, security models, and
    operational complexity. We examine how each protocol's design decisions impact
    agentic AI deployments, from lightweight edge computing scenarios to large-scale
    multi- organizational collaborations. AGNTCY SLIM emerges as a purpose-built solution,
    integrating Message Layer Security (MLS) [RFC9420] with gRPC [gRPC] over HTTP/2
    [RFC7540] to provide quantum-safe end-to-end encryption, efficient streaming,
    and OAuth-based authentication [RFC6749]. Unlike transport-layer security approaches,
    SLIM's MLS implementation ensures secure communication even through untrusted
    intermediaries while supporting dynamic group membership changes essential for
    collaborative AI agents.</p>"

  content: "This document proposes a scheme to support Fast Handover over HMIPv6 \nnetworks.
    The HMIPv6 was developed to reduce the signaling overhead \nand delay concerned
    with Binding Update in Mobile IPv6. Therefore \nHMIPv6 still need a further handover
    enhancement for supporting the \nreal-time applications. Currently FMIPv6 is the
    typical protocol to \nreduce the handover latency. Accordingly it may be straightforward
    to \nsimply introduce FMIPv6 into HMIPv6 networks. However, it is noted \nthat
    such simple approach may induce unnecessary processing overhead. \nF-HMIPv6, described
    in this document, considers how to integrate these \ntwo protocols and provides
    a scheme for effective integration. \n\t "

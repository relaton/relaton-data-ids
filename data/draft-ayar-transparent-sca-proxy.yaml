  content: "   This draft complements the work of MPTCP by defining a TCP Splitter/\n
    \  Combiner Architecture (SCA) that enables non-MPTCP-capable single-\n   homed
    hosts to benefit from the multiple paths within Internet by\n   means of performance
    enhancing proxies (PEPs) placed in the access\n   networks.\n\n   SCA Proxies
    (SCAPs) make use of multiple paths in a way which is\n   completely transparent
    to end-hosts.  Since the existence of the\n   SCAPs is shielded from the TCP end-points,
    they can be deployed in\n   the Internet as well as on the end-systems.\n\n\t "

  content: "More and more activities rely on mobile devices. It is an  \nimportant
    issue on how to protect mobile users engaged in mobile \nservices. Unfortunately,
    the conventional firewalls are\ninappropriate for mobile networks. Furthermore,
    with a conventional \nfirewall, an administrator of mobile nodes is unable to
    monitor / \ncontrol dynamically the mobile nodes' activities when the mobile \nnodes
    roam. In this draft, we introduce a new concept of mobile\npersonal firewall and
    propose a concrete scheme that matches the\nmobile environment and exploits the
    mobile network facilities. \nWhen a mobile node (MN) roams into a foreign network
    managed by a \nmobility anchor point (MAP), the home agent (HA) will authorize
    the \nMAP to serve as a security proxy. The HA will negotiate with the MAP \non
    the security association and then transfer to the MAP the defined \nsecurity rules
    that will be applied on all communications to the MN.\nAccording to HMIPv6 protocol,
    all packets to MN will go through MAP. \nTherefore, the MAP has the ability of
    filtering packets. The MAP \ncould also send the MN's traffic logs to the HA.
    The MN's \nadministrator could dynamically monitor the MN's activities by \nretrieving
    the MN's traffic logs through the HA. If necessary, the \nMN's administrator could
    update the security rules so that the MN's \nactivities could be controlled dynamically.
    All the operations are \ntransparent to the MN, and the MN will be served in a
    way \nspecified by its administrator no matter where it roams.\n\t "

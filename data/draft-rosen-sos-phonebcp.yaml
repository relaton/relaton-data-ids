  content: "   Requesting help in an emergency using a communications device such
    as\n   a telephone or mobile is an accepted practice in most of the world.\n   As
    communications devices increasingly utilize the Internet to\n   interconnect and
    communicate, users will continue to expect to use\n   such devices to request
    help, regardless of whether or not they\n   communicate using IP.  The emergency
    response community will have to\n   upgrade their facilities to support the wider
    range of communications\n   services, but cannot be expected to handle wide variation
    in device\n   and service capability.  The IETF has several efforts targeted at\n
    \  standardizing various aspects of placing emergency calls.  This memo\n   describes
    best current practice on how devices and services should\n   use such standards
    to reliably make emergency calls\n\t "

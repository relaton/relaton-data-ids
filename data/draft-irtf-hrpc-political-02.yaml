  content: "   The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be used on\n
    \  networks, but the standards development process in the IETF has a\n   normative
    effect.  Among other things, the IETF's work affects what\n   is perceived as
    technologically possible and useful where networking\n   technologies are being
    deployed, and its standards reflect what is\n   considered by the technical community
    to be feasible and good\n   practice.  Because the IETF's protocols mediate many
    aspects of\n   modern life, and therefore contribute to the ordering of societies\n
    \  and communities, the consideration of the potential social impact of\n   protocols
    should be part of the standardization and development\n   process.\n\n\t "

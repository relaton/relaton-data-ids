abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT) and\n
    \  constrained environments that do not require confidentiality, though\n   message
    integrity for all communications and at least server, if not\n   mutual authentication
    during tunnel establishment, are both still\n   mandated.  This document gives
    examples of such use cases, although a\n   threat model is necessary to determine
    whether or not a given\n   situation falls into this category of use cases.  In
    order to serve\n   these use cases, this document defines the use of HMAC-only
    cipher\n   suites for TLS 1.3, which provides server and optionally mutual\n   authentication
    and data authenticity, but not data confidentiality.\n   The approach described
    in this document is not endorsed by the IETF\n   and does not have IETF consensus,
    but is presented here to enable\n   interoperable implementation of a reduced
    security mechanism that\n   provides authentication and message integrity without
    supporting\n   confidentiality.\n\n\t "

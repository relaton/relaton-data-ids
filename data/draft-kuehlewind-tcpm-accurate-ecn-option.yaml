  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies an TCP option to get accurate Explicit\n   Congestion
    Notification (ECN) feedback from the receiver.  ECN is an\n   IP/TCP mechanism
    where network nodes can mark IP packets instead of\n   dropping them to indicate
    congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-\n   capable receiver will feedback this
    information to the sender.  ECN\n   is specified for TCP in such a way that only
    one feedback signal can\n   be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently
    new TCP\n   mechanisms like ConEx or DCTCP need more accurate feedback\n   information
    in the case where more than one marking is received in\n   one RTT.  This TCP
    extension can be used in addition to the classic\n   ECN as well as with a more
    accurate ECN scheme recently proposed\n   which reuses the ECN bit in the TCP
    header.\n\n\t "

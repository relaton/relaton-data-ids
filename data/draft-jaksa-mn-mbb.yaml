  content: "   This draft documents the use of MCoA (Multiple Care-of Address)\n   method
    defined in [4] in order to facilitate a Make Before Break\n   within the Mobile
    IPv6 protocol [1] .  This draft is intended to\n   document the usage of MCoA
    for achieving Make Before Break behavior.\n   The current base Mobile IPv6 specification
    [1] doesn't include MCoA.\n   With that draft currently under consideration it
    is possible to use\n   these extensions for MBB.\n\n\t "

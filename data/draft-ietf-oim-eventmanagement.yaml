  content: "This draft provides a tutorial on OSI mechanisms for event management,
    \    alarm reporting, and log control in TCP/IP networks.  The mechanisms       are
    based on ISO Draft Proposals and are expected to align with agreements developed
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Network Management
    Forum (NMF).  Also included is a mechanism for incorporating event flow control
    as defined in the Internet.  It is proposed that systems implementing OSI management
    protocols for TCP/IP networks [1] should include the mechanisms described in this
    draft.\n\t "

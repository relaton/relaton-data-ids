  content: "   In Mobile IPv6 environment, TCP connections between MN (mobile node)
    \n   and CN (correspondent node) suffer a significant degradation in \n   performance
    in the form of poor throughput and very high interactive \n   delays during handoff.
    This note describes an optional modification \n   of TCP's congestion control
    mechanism for performance enhancement by \n   using Binding Update messages to
    invoke TCP's congestion control \n   processing. This modification is applied
    to TCP of CN side, and no \n   additional processing requirement is added to MN
    to save MN's power. \n\t "

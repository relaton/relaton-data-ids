  content: "   With the deployment of centralized control, the traffic scheduling\n
    \  can be easier to accomplish with PathID carried in the data plane.  A\n   PathID
    used to indicate a flow through a forwarding path which is not\n   the default
    shortest path.  It is encapsulated in the packet at the\n   ingress node, carried
    to indicate the forwarding at the transit node\n   and decapsulated at the egress
    node.\n\n   This document describes how to accomplish flexible forwarding with\n
    \  PathID in traffic scheduling.\n\n\t "

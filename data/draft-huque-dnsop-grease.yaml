  content: "   Long term evolvability of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol\n   requires
    the ability to support change.  Greasing is one technique\n   that exercises the
    regular use of unallocated protocol extension\n   points to prevent ossification
    of their current usage patterns by\n   middleboxes or DNS implementations.  This
    document describes\n   considerations and proposals for applying grease to the
    DNS protocol.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed before publishing
    as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at\n
    \  https://github.com/shuque/ietf-dns-grease.\n\n\t "

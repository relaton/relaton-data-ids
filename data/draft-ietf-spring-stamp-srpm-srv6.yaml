  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is\n
    \  applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6\n   (SRv6)
    data planes.  This document describes the procedures for\n   Performance Measurement
    for SRv6 using the Simple Two-Way Active\n   Measurement Protocol (STAMP), as
    defined in RFC 8762, along with its\n   optional extensions defined in RFC 8972
    and further augmented in RFC\n   9503.  The described procedure is used for links
    and SRv6 paths\n   (including SRv6 Policies, SRv6 IGP best paths, and SRv6 IGP
    Flexible\n   Algorithm paths), as well as Layer-3 and Layer-2 services over the\n
    \  SRv6 paths.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document describes the procedures for Performance Measurement for SRv6 using the
    Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP), as defined in RFC 8762, along
    with its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 and further augmented in RFC
    9503. The described procedure is used for links and SRv6 paths (including SRv6
    Policies, SRv6 IGP best paths, and SRv6 IGP Flexible Algorithm paths), as well
    as Layer-3 and Layer-2 services over the SRv6 paths.</p>"

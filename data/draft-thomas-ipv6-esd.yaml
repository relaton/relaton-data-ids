- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There is a proposal to split unicast IPv6 addresses into two 8 byte quantities.
    \ The first 8 bytes will contain routing information which is used to reach a
    subnetwork.  The last 8 bytes will contain a identifier of a node on that subnet.
    \ This identifier is globally unique and is called an End System Designator (ESD).
    \ The ESD (not the entire 16 byte address) will be used to accept packets and
    identify connections, among other things.\n\t "

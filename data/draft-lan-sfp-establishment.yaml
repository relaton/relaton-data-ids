  content: "   Service Function Chain architecture leads to more adaptive network\n
    \  nodes. It allows splitting the network function into fine-grained\n   build
    blocks --- service function, and combining the network\n   functions into service
    function chain to formulate complicated\n   services. Further, the service function
    chain should be instantiated\n   by selecting the optimal instance from the candidates
    for each\n   service function in it. This document discusses the required\n   components
    during the instantiation of service function chain in the\n   network.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Traditionally, routing protocols make routing decisions solely based\n
    \  on destination IP addresses, packets towards the same destination\n   will
    be delivered to the same next hop no matter where they come\n   from.  These protocols
    work well with simple networks that have only\n   one egress router.  However,
    in the multi-homing scenario, packets\n   may be dropped if forwarded only based
    on destination addresses.\n\n   This document defines enhancements to the OSPFv3
    protocol that allow\n   simple and flexible operations, with which packets will
    be routed\n   towards the corresponding upstream ISPs based on both destination
    and\n   source addresses.\n\n\t "

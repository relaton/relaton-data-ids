  content: "This Internet Draft offers seven MODP ?Diffie-Hellman? groups which\ncan
    be used in conjunction with other IETF standards to provide\nsecurity for Internet
    communications.  The groups are designed to\nallow implementers to use the same
    groups with different security\nprotocols such as SMIME, SSH, TLS and IKE.  The
    prime numbers which\nform part of the definition of these groups are designed
    to allow\nfor fast, small signatures and be of the correct form for compliance\nwith
    standards bodies such as ANSI, NIST and the IEEE.  This draft\nincludes groups
    with bit sizes of 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, and\n8192. These may be used in
    addition to the groups already specified\nor in place of them. Since these groups
    are acceptable for all \ncryptographic applications involving the difficulty of
    discrete \nlogarithms over GF(p) they are referred to as \n\t "

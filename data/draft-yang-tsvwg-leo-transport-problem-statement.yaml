- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   LSN, Starlink and OneWeb, can provide global Internet connectivity\n
    \  with latency comparable to terrestrial networks, but their fast\n   movement
    and frequent handovers result in highly dynamic connectivity\n   changes.  The
    fast movement of LSN will introduce frequent handover\n   and varying link delays
    every few minutes.  As the path over LSN\n   varies, TCP cannot tell whether changes
    in packet loss or RTT are due\n   to path changes or network congestion, thus
    it might not be able to\n   make proper adjustment.  This greatly impact the performance
    of TCP.\n\n\t "

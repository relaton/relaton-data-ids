  content: "   CoAP is to enable a concept of web of sensors, but there are many\n
    \  cases that the sensors are not always online and hence the requests\n   from
    the web client cannot reach them in timely manner.  This\n   document analyzes
    this problem and describes the requirements for a\n   CoAP enabled sensor to behave
    always online.\n\n\t "

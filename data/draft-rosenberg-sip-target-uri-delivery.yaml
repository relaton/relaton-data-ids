abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "When a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy receives a request\n   targeted
    at a URI identifying a user or resource it is responsible\n   for, the proxy translates
    the URI to a registered or configured\n   contact URI of an agent representing
    that user or resource.  In the\n   process, the original URI is removed from the
    request.  Numerous use\n   cases have arisen which require this information to
    be delivered to\n   the user agent.  This document describes these use cases and
    defines\n   an extension to the History-Info header field which allows it to be\n
    \  used to support those cases.\n\t "

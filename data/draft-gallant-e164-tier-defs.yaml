  content: "Describing numbering tiers has been informal to date.  This document \nproposes
    a simple recognition principle for tiers in terms of the \nprotocol mapping of
    an E.164 numbering resource to a DNS domain \nname, as described for ENUM in RFC
    2916.  Tier value is a formal \nattribute of the digit string for an arbitrary
    E.164 resource, and \nit applies also to the resulting domain name.  No assumptions
    about \nassignment, existence, or delegation are involved.\n\t "

  content: "Recent progress of virtual machine technology made it possible to\nhost
    various Internet service nodes in a so called cloud environment.\nThe virtual
    machine hosting technology provides a method to migrate a\nvirtual machine from
    one hypervisor to another.  However, such a\ntechnology is mainly focusing on
    a migration between hypervisors\nattached to the same link, and tend not to consider
    migration over\nthe Internet.  This document mentions the purpose of that type
    of\noperation and describe several possible operation methods to provide\nnetwork
    portability in cloud systems.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Until DNSSEC is fully deployed, so-called \"islands of trust\" will\n
    \  exist.  This will lead to a large number of keys with no method\n   within
    DNSSEC to manage the keys.  This proposal seeks to address\n   that issue using
    existing mechanisms to allow cross-signing of root\n   (i.e. roots of islands)
    keys.  This cross-signing of keys creates a\n   non-hierarchical web of trust
    which permits the efficient gathering\n   and validation of trust anchors.\n\n\t "

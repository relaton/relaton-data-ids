  script: Latn
  content: "   As users' traffic faces more unpredictable attacks during\n   transmission,
    there are more and more end-users now need high\n   security data transmission
    guarantee, they need ISPs to provide\n   security protection capabilities on the
    data forwarding path, but it\n   is very difficult for operators to manage the
    security attributes of\n   nodes through control surfaces.\n\n   ISPs need to
    have real-time awareness of the security capabilities\n   available in the network,
    then form a security capability map,\n   finally provide security protection for
    users at the routing level.\n   The goal of this draft is to collect the security
    capabilities of\n   nodes, which will be one of the factors to form the routing
    topology,\n   and use the routing programming capabilities to form a secure routing\n
    \  path.  The security capability includes healthy information(such as\n   the
    device software is up-to-date), security service information,\n   device information(such
    as the manufacturer information of the\n   equipment).\n\n   The BGP-LS protocol
    is extended to carry the security capabilities of\n   the node.  The controller
    collects topology information, forms a\n   topology path with security capabilities
    according to security\n   requirements, and supports SRv6 path sending to execute
    node\n   forwarding through programming.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected in the \nlast
    ten years. As IPv4 address exhaustion gets closer, the IPv4/IPv6 \ntransition
    issues become more critical and complicated. Host-based \ntransition mechanisms
    are not able to meet the requirements while \nmost end users are not sufficiently
    expert to configure or maintain \nthese transition mechanisms. Carrier Grade NAT
    with integrated \ntransition mechanisms can simplify the operation of end users
    during \nthe IPv4/IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes
    \nan incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) solution for IPv6 transition. \nIt can
    provide IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled end hosts and \nIPv4 access services
    for IPv4 end hosts while remaining most of \nlegacy IPv4 ISP networks unchanged.
    It is suitable for the initial \nstage of IPv4/IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone,
    it also supports and \nencourages transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP
    networks.\n\t "

  content: "   Internet privacy has become an important feature for users of\n   websites
    and services.  This document proposes a way for websites and\n   services to declare
    and disclose their usage of analytics and\n   tracking software. analytics.txt
    aims to be an elaborate file format\n   that describes the privacy related characteristics
    of analytics and\n   tracking software in a non-biased way.  An analytics.txt
    file is\n   understandable for a non-technical audience, while also useful for\n
    \  the automated consumption by tools and software.\n\n\t "

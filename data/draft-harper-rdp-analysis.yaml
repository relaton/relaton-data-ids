  content: "   This document reviews and analyzes the history and experience of the\n
    \  Reliable Data Protocol.  RDP was initially published as an\n   experimental
    protocol in RFC 908 in 1984 and subsequently revised in\n   RFC 1151 in 1991.
    \ RDP aimed to provide a message-oriented, reliable\n   transport service to meet
    specific application requirements such as\n   remote loading.  This document summarizes
    the key technical\n   experiences gained from RDP's experimental deployment, details
    the\n   lessons learned regarding checksum performance and flow control\n   mechanisms,
    and assesses the conceptual influence of its design\n   principles on subsequent
    IETF transport protocols.  The document is\n   intended for historical archiving,
    providing a reference for early\n   explorations of Internet transport protocols,
    and does not propose\n   any new standards or deployment recommendations.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews and analyzes the history and experience of the
    Reliable Data Protocol. RDP was initially published as an experimental protocol
    in RFC 908 in 1984 and subsequently revised in RFC 1151 in 1991. RDP aimed to
    provide a message-oriented, reliable transport service to meet specific application
    requirements such as remote loading. This document summarizes the key technical
    experiences gained from RDP's experimental deployment, details the lessons learned
    regarding checksum performance and flow control mechanisms, and assesses the conceptual
    influence of its design principles on subsequent IETF transport protocols. The
    document is intended for historical archiving, providing a reference for early
    explorations of Internet transport protocols, and does not propose any new standards
    or deployment recommendations.</p>"

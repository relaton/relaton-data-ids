  content: "As the OSI Directory progresses into an operational structure which is
    being increasingly used as a primary resource for Directory Information, it was
    perceived that having the Internet Site Contacts and some limited network information
    in the Directory would be immediately useful and would also provide the preliminary
    framework for some distributed NIC functions. This paper describes the interim
    schema used to contain this information.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In MIPv4, when a Mobile Node (MN) registers with the 'D' bit, in the MIP
    Registration to a Home Agent (HA), then the MN wishes to use a Co-located Care-of
    address (CCoA) with a specific Home Address (HoA). Packets sent to the MN Home
    Address (HoA) will then be encapsulated in the CCoA by the HA and forwarded directly
    to the MN. Alternatively, a MN can obtain from the local Foreign Agent(FA) a shared
    FA CoA for inclusion in its MIP Registration to the FA/HA. In this case, the HA
    encapsulates to the FA CoA, and the Foreign Agent then decapsulates and delivers
    the HoA addressed packet unencapsulated to the MN. This draft adds to MIPv4 the
    ability for the MN to acquire a MN specific FA CoA that provides the MN with a
    topologically correct local address and whose tunnel encaps/decaps is provided
    by the FA. This address is called a proxy CCoA (PCCoA) and the associated processing
    in the MN and FA is called Proxy CCoA tunneling. This capability is applicable
    to any access technology but is especially useful for wireless systems where the
    access bandwidth is expensive and when point-to-point link-layer connectivity
    exists between the MN and the FA. This draft also describes reverse tunneling
    and smooth hand-off extensions based on the PCCoA that enables inter-FA forwarding
    even for CCoAs.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation\n   function
    from tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to initiators (B4s), and\n   hence reduces the
    mapping scale on the concentrator to per-customer\n   level.  This document discusses
    various deployment models of\n   lightweight 4over6.  It also describes the deployment
    considerations\n   and applicability of the lightweight 4over6 architecture.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Mobile IPv6 mobility-management protocol enables minimum routing\n
    \  paths between a mobile node and a correspondent node, which may\n   itself
    be mobile. This feature is called route optimization. Route\n   optimization requires
    authorization of initially unacquainted and\n   untrusted parties. A so-called
    return-routability procedure was\n   integrated into the Mobile IPv6 in order
    to do this securely. The\n   return-routability procedure equips the mobile node
    with\n   cryptographic tokens that authenticate the mobile node and prove the\n
    \  mobile node's presence at a claimed new location after movement.\n   Recently,
    a number of improvements or optional alternatives have been\n   suggested to the
    standard procedure. The primary driver between these\n   improvements is oftentimes
    further reduction of signaling messages\n   and latency, but other improvements
    such as better security have also\n   been suggested. This document discusses
    the potential goals for\n   future enhancements of route optimization, the security
    threats that\n   such enhancements must consider, and the various enhancement\n
    \  proposals and their key ideas. An evaluation of some recent proposals\n   is
    included, as well as a discussion of how significant the Mobile\n   IPv6 related
    optimizations are related to other ongoing optimization\n   efforts. Finally,
    needs for future research are outlined.\n\t "

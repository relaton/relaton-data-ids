  content: "   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of\n
    \  object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for the\n   purpose
    of registering the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and\n   signature algorithms.
    \ This donated set of OIDs allowed for shorter\n   values than would be possible
    using the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.\n   This document describes the range
    of identifiers that were assigned\n   in that donated range, transfers control
    of that range to IANA, and\n   establishes IANA allocation policies for any future
    assignments\n   within that range.\n\n\t "

  content: "During the development of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), it is\ndiscovered
    that there is a substantial lack of information and\nmisunderstanding on Han ideographs
    and its folding mechanism.\n\nThis document attempts to address some of the issues
    on doing han\nfolding with respect to IDN. Hopefully, this will dispel some of
    the\ncommon misunderstanding of this problem and to discuss some of the\nissues
    with han ideograph and its folding mechanism.\n\nThis document addresses very
    specific problem to IDN and thus is not\nmeant as a reference for generic Han
    folding. Generic Han folding are\nmuch more complicated and certainly beyond this
    document. However, the\nuse of this document may be applicable to other areas
    that are related\nwith names, e.g. Common Name Resolution Protocol [CNRP].\n\t "

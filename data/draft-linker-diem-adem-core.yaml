abstract:
- content: "<p>In times of armed conflict, the protective emblems of the red cross,
    red crescent, and red crystal are used to mark physical assets. This enables military
    units to identify assets as respected and protected under international humanitarian
    law. This draft specifies the format and trust architecture of a protective, digital
    emblem to network-connected infrastructure. Such emblems mark assets as protected
    under IHL analogously to the physical emblems.</p>"

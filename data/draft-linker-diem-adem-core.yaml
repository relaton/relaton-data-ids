  content: "   In times of armed conflict, the protective emblems of the red cross,\n
    \  red crescent, and red crystal are used to mark physical assets.  This\n   enables
    military units to identify assets as respected and protected\n   under international
    humanitarian law.  This draft specifies the\n   format and trust architecture
    of a protective, digital emblem to\n   network-connected infrastructure.  Such
    emblems mark assets as\n   protected under IHL analogously to the physical emblems.\n\n\t "

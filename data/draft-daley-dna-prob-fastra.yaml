  script: Latn
  content: "   The IPv6 Neighbour Discovery RFC provides for random delays of\n   between
    0 to 500 milliseconds, in order to spread responses to\n   solicitations when
    multiple routers exist on a link.  This document\n   describes an alternative
    scheme for responding to Router\n   Solicitations which estimates the number of
    routers on the link, and\n   aims to reduce the delay spread for responding Router
    Advertisements.\n\t "

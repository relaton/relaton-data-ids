  content: "The Appliance Class Identifier option is used by a Dynamic Host \nConfiguration
    Protocol (DHCP) client to identify the type of \nappliance it is.  The information
    contained in this option is an \nopaque field that represents the appliance class
    of which the client \nbelongs.  Based on this class, a DHCP server selects the
    appropriate \naddress pool to assign an address and the appropriate configuration
    \nparameters to the client.  The value of this option should be \nselected by
    the appliance manufacturer and included in the DHCP \nDiscover/Request messages.
    \ Multiple vendors may choose to use the \nsame appliance class identifier for
    like appliances (an IP phone for \nexample).\n\t "

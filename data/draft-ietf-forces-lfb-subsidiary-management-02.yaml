  content: "Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using the Forwarding
    and Control Element Separation (ForCES) architecture to manage resources other
    than packet forwarding.  In that spirit, the Forwarding Element Manager (FEM)
    is modeled by creating a Logical Functional Block (LFB) to represent its functionality.
    \ We refer to this LFB as the Subsidiary Mechanism (SM) LFB.  A Control Element
    (CE) that controls a Forwarding Element's (FE) resources can also manage its configuration
    via the SM LFB.  This document introduces the SM LFB class, an LFB class that
    specifies the configuration parameters of an FE.  The configuration parameters
    include new LFB class loading and CE associations; they also provide manipulation
    of debug mechanisms along with a general purpose attribute definition to describe
    configuration information.\n\t "

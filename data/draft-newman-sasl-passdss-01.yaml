  content: "     Some system administrators are faced with a choice between\n     deploying
    a new authentication infrastructure or sending\n     unencrypted passwords in
    the clear over the Internet.  Deploying a\n     new authentication infrastructure
    often involves modifying\n     operating system services or keeping parallel authentication\n
    \    databases up to date and is thus unacceptable to many\n     administrators.\n
    \n     Solutions which encrypt the entire session are often crippled with\n     weak
    keys (due to government restrictions) which are unsuitable for\n     passwords.
    \ In addition, such solutions often reduce performance of\n     the entire session
    to an unacceptable level.  This specification\n     defines a SASL [SASL] mechanism
    which is compatible with existing\n     password-based authentication databases
    and does not require a\n     security layer for the remainder of the session.\n
    \n     [NOTE: Public discussion of this mechanism may take place on the\n     ietf-sasl@imc.org
    mailing list with a subscription address of\n     ietf-sasl-request@imc.org.  Private
    comments may be sent to the\n     author].\n\n\t "

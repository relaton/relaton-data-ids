  script: Latn
  content: "   Authoritative control of parts of the Domain Name System namespace\n
    \  are indicated with a special record type, the NS record, that can\n   only
    indicate the name of the server which a client resolver should\n   contact for
    more information.  Any other features of that server must\n   then be discovered
    through other mechanisms.  This draft considers\n   the limitations of the current
    system, benefits that could be gained\n   by changing it, and what requirements
    constrain an updated design.\n\n\t "

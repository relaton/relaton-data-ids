  content: "   This document illustrates the use case of remote driving that\n   leverages
    the human driver's advanced perceptual and cognitive skills\n   to enhance autonomous
    driving when it is absent or falls short.\n   Specifically the document analyzes
    the end-to-end latency that is\n   required in the network to support collision
    avoidance in remote\n   driving.  The document also summarizes the other necessary\n
    \  requirements that the networking services shall support.\n\n\n\t "

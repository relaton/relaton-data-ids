  content: "This document describes a mechanism that helps to protect and recover
    \nuser traffic when carried over pseudo-wires. The mechanism requires \nsome minor
    modification to the existing pseudo-wire setup procedure, \nand is fully backward
    compatible. \n    \nThe proposed mechanism allows the network operators to setup
    one or \nmultiple backup pseudo-wires to protect a working pseudo-wire. Upon \nnetwork
    failure, user traffic can be switched over to the next \"best\" \npseudo-wire
    base on preference levels. \n    \nThis document first describes the motivation
    of the work base on the \ndiscussions with a number of carriers. Then we define
    the protocol \nextension itself. \n\n\t "

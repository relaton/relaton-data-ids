  content: "   This document describes the logic for third-party and network\n   security
    to complement strong cryptographic protocols, and presents\n   data, including
    independently verifiable data, helping scale the\n   importance of blocking attacks
    that might be hiding in encrypted\n   network traffic.  This report includes data
    from multiple sources.\n   Some of that data is verifiable.\n\n\t "

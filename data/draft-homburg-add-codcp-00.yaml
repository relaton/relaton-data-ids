- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The introduction of many new transport protocols for DNS in recent\n
    \  years (DoT, DoH, DoQ) significantly increases the complexity of DNS\n   stub
    resolvers that want to support these protocols.  A practical way\n   forward is
    to have a DNS client proxy in the host operating system.\n   This allows applications
    to communicate using Do53 and still get the\n   privacy benefit from using more
    secure protocols over the internet.\n   However, such a setup leaves the application
    with no control over\n   which transport the proxy uses.  This document introduces
    EDNS(0)\n   options that allow a stub resolver to request certain transport and\n
    \  allow the proxy to report capabilities and actual transports that are\n   available.\n\n\t "

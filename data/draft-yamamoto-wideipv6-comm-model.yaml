  content: "This memo discusses semantics of communication with IPv6 addresses.  This
    model introduces three address scope classes, node-local, site-local, and global,
    for both IPv6 unicast and multicast addresses. For a given packet, all addresses
    in the packet including those in the routing header must be in the same address
    scope class.                                           Since the sockaddr_in6
    address data structure is extended to be able to hold an interface index number,
    a kernel and applications can exchange interface information. A source address
    is uniquely determined with the destination address and the outgoing interface.
    \                           This memo also clarifies packet processing mechanism
    for the input, forward, and output function.\n\t "

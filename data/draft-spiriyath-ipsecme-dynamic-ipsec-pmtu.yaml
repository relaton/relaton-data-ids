  content: "   This document describes Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery (PLPMTUD)\n
    \  procedures for IPSec tunnels.  In these procedures, the encrypting\n   node
    discovers and maintains a running estimate of the tunnel MTU.\n   In order to
    do this, the encrypting nodes sends Probe Packets of\n   various size through
    the IPSec tunnel.  If the size of Probe Packet\n   exceeds the tunnel MTU, a downstream
    node discards the packet and\n   sends an ICMP PTB message to the encrypting node.
    \ The encrypting\n   node ignores the ICMP PTB message.  If the size of the Probe
    Packet\n   does not exceed the tunnel MTU and the decrypting node receives the\n
    \  Probe Packet, the decrypting node sends an Acknowledgement Packet to\n   encrypting
    node through the IPSec tunnel.  The Acknowledgement Packet\n   indicates the size
    of the Probe Packet.\n\n   The procedures described in this document are applicable
    to IPSec\n   tunnels that are signaled by IKEv2 and provide authentication\n   services.\n\n\t "

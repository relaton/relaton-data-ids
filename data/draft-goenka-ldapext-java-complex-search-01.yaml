  content: "LDAP provides some simple primitives to construct search\nfilters. Complex
    LDAP search queries such as those involving\njoins or functional evaluation of
    simple query results require\nclient side processing of the intermediate search
    results. The\nnetwork overhead of retrieving intermediate results can be\nsubstantial
    for large databases. This document defines an LDAP\nextension for supporting server
    side evaluation of complex\nsearch queries.\n \n     Custom search logic can be
    sent across to the server,\n     encapsulated as a Java Object. The LDAP server
    supporting this\n     extension would instantiate the java object and invoke its
    well\n     known interfaces in a JVM. The java object running at the server\n
    \    end acts as the client-proxy, and makes a local search query to\n     the
    LDAP server. The directory entries are evaluated using the\n     custom logic
    embedded in the client-proxy, and those that\n     satisfy the evaluation function
    are returned as the search\n     result to the LDAP server, which passes it back
    to the\n     originating client. Even non-Java LDAP clients can use this\n     method,
    provided the search query is written as a java object.\n\t "

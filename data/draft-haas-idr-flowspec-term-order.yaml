  content: "   BGP Flowspec (RFC 8955) provides a mechanism for matching traffic\n
    \  flows.  The ordering of the Flow Specifications defined by that RFC\n   is
    provided by a sorting function that uses the contents of the\n   received BGP
    NLRI; that NLRI does not contain an explicit ordering\n   component.  The RFC's
    sorting function permits for origination of\n   Flowspec NLRI from multiple BGP
    Speakers and is generally appropriate\n   for mitigating distributed denial-of-service
    (DDoS) attacks.\n\n   There are circumstances where the implicit RFC 8955 sorting
    order is\n   not appropriate.  This document defines a mechanism that permits\n
    \  individual Flowspec NLRI to influence their sort order.\n\n\n\t "

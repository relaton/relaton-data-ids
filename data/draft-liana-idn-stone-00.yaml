  content: "Spoken language is human nature. An IDN system that users want is \nalways
    closely associated with linguistic issues. To represent a symbol \nof a script
    consistently, recognizable and easily accessible for \nwidest acceptance around
    the world has been the wish of many Internet \nengineers. For sensible, thus consistent
    and lasting IDN Domain Name \nidentifiers, these symbols have to be indexed on
    their phonetics, which \nis the basic element of linguistics. A joint effort from
    Unicode \nConsortium, Library of Congress, The International Phonetic Association
    \nand IETF IDN working group is necessary to codify transliteration scheme.\n\t "

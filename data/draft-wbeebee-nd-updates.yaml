  content: "\n   RFC 2461 [ND] describes host data forwarding and address resolution.\n
    \  However, nine years after the ND protocol became an RFC, IPv6 hosts\n   still
    do not fully comply with RFC 2461 [ND].  In particular, hosts\n   incorrectly
    implement on- vs. off-link data forwarding.  The set of\n   new requirements beyond
    what has been specified in RFC 2461 [ND] and\n   RFC 2462 [ADDRCONF] is restricted
    to clarifications deemed necessary\n   to facilitate correct implementation.  The
    intention of this document\n   is to incorporate normative changes into\n\n\t "

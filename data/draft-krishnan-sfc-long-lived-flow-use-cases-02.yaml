abstract:
- content: "<p>Long-lived flows such as file transfers, video streams are common in
    today's networks. In the context of service function chaining, this draft suggests
    use cases for dynamic bypass of certain service nodes for such flows. The benefit
    of this approach would be to avoid expensive Layer 7 service node processing for
    such flows based on dynamic decisions and improve overall performance.</p>"

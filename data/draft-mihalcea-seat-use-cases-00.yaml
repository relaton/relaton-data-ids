abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines use cases and desirable properties for integrating
    remote attestation (RA) capabilities with secure channel establishment protocols,
    with an initial focus on Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3 Handshake. Traditional
    peer authentication in TLS establishes trust in a peer's network identifiers but
    provides no assurance regarding the integrity of its underlying software and hardware
    stack. Remote attestation addresses this gap by enabling a peer to provide verifiable
    evidence about its current state, including the state of its trusted computing
    base (TCB). This document explores specific use cases, such as confidential data
    collaboration and secure secrets provisioning, to motivate the need for this integration.
    From these use cases, it specifies a set of essential properties the protocol
    solution must have, including cryptographic binding to the TLS connection, evidence
    freshness, and flexibility to support different attestation models. This document
    is intended to serve as an input to the design of protocol solutions within the
    SEAT working group.</p>"

  content: "   This document outlines use cases and desirable properties for\n   integrating
    remote attestation (RA) capabilities with secure channel\n   establishment protocols,
    with an initial focus on Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) v1.3 Handshake.  Traditional
    peer authentication in\n   TLS establishes trust in a peer's network identifiers
    but provides no\n   assurance regarding the integrity of its underlying software
    and\n   hardware stack.  Remote attestation addresses this gap by enabling a\n
    \  peer to provide verifiable evidence about its current state,\n   including
    the state of its trusted computing base (TCB).  This\n   document explores specific
    use cases, such as confidential data\n   collaboration and secure secrets provisioning,
    to motivate the need\n   for this integration.  From these use cases, it specifies
    a set of\n   essential properties the protocol solution must have, including\n
    \  cryptographic binding to the TLS connection, evidence freshness, and\n   flexibility
    to support different attestation models.  This document\n   is intended to serve
    as an input to the design of protocol solutions\n   within the SEAT working group.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes methods to avoid interactions between the\n
    \  flow control of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the\n   Quick-Start
    TCP mechanism.  Quick-Start is an optional TCP congestion\n   control extension
    that allows hosts to determine an allowed sending\n   rate from feedback of routers
    along the path.  With Quick-Start, data\n   transfers can start with a potentially
    large congestion window and\n   avoid the time-consuming slow-start.  In order
    to fully utilize the\n   data rate determined by Quick-Start, the sending host
    must not be\n   limited by the TCP flow control, i. e., the amount of free buffer\n
    \  space advertised by the receive window.\n\n   There are two potential interactions
    between Quick-Start and the TCP\n   flow control: First, receivers might not provide
    sufficiently large\n   buffer space after connection setup, or they may implement
    buffer\n   allocation strategies that implicitly assume the slow-start behavior\n
    \  on the sender side.  This document therefore provides guidelines for\n   buffer
    allocation in hosts supporting the Quick-Start extension.\n   Second, the TCP
    receive window scaling mechanism interferes with\n   Quick-Start when being used
    in the initial three-way handshake\n   connection setup.  This document describes
    a simple solution to\n   overcome this problem.\n\n\t "

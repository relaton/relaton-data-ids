  script: Latn
  content: "In PMIP6-MIP6 interactions scenario C, the HA and LMA are co-located\nand
    a transition between MIP6 and PMIP6 is supported without breaking\nthe session.
    \ This draft discusses possible data forwarding\nbehaviours of the co-located
    HA/LMA in such scenario.  The two\nrecently discussed options are: 1) data forwarding
    always according\nto the mobile node's MIP6 BCE, if exists, which means that MIP6
    BCE\nhas higher priority than PMIP6 BCE, or 2) data forwarding according\nto type
    of the last received mobility management registration\nmessage, i.e., PMIP6 and
    MIP6 BCE have equal priority.  It is argued\nthat option 1) increases handover
    delay by 1 MN-HA RTT and\nimplementation complexity of the HA/LMA may be higher.
    \ Hence, it is\nproposed that HA/LMA should behave according to option 2, i.e.,
    MIP6\nBCE and PMIP6 BCE have same priority and HA/LMA forwards data\naccording
    to the type of the last received mobility management\nregistration message.\n\t "

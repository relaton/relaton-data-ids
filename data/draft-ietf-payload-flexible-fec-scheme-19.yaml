  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error\n
    \  Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved\n   and
    interleaved parity codes from source media encapsulated in RTP.\n   These parity
    codes are systematic codes (Flexible FEC, or \"FLEX\n   FEC\"), where a number
    of FEC repair packets are generated from a set\n   of source packets from one
    or more source RTP streams.  These FEC\n   repair packets are sent in a redundancy
    RTP stream separate from the\n   source RTP stream(s) that carries the source
    packets.  RTP source\n   packets that were lost in transmission can be reconstructed
    using the\n   source and repair packets that were received.  The non-interleaved\n
    \  and interleaved parity codes which are defined in this specification\n   offer
    a good protection against random and bursty packet losses,\n   respectively, at
    a cost of complexity.  The RTP payload formats that\n   are defined in this document
    address scalability issues experienced\n   with the earlier specifications, and
    offer several improvements.  Due\n   to these changes, the new payload formats
    are not backward compatible\n   with earlier specifications, but endpoints that
    do not implement this\n   specification can still work by simply ignoring the
    FEC repair\n   packets.\n\n\t "

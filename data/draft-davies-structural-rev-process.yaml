  content: "This document suggests a possible process to address the\nstructural problems
    identified in the IETF Problem Statement as\nrequested in Version 02 of the IETF
    Problem Resolution draft.\nThe process proposes that the IESG delegate responsibility
    for\ncoordinating, moderating and synthesising proposals for solutions\nto parts
    of the structural problems to a Synthsis and Action Panel\n(SAP) selected through
    a variant of the nomcom selection process.\nThe SAP should, if possible, deliver
    an integrated set of\nproposals for changes derived from community input, both\nunsolicited
    and, if necessary, solicited. The SAP would act as a\nmoderator between authors
    of alternative propoasals in attempting\nto achieve a proposal on which the community
    could agree. The\nagreed plan be would be delivered to the IESG for final approval
    \nand action.\n\n\t "

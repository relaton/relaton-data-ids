  content: "   IPSec IKEv2, RFC 5996 [RFC5996], has been adopted by many\n   standardized
    network solutions to provide the secure transport\n   between network elements
    over third party's infrastructure.  Today\n   Femtocell deployment requires the
    mobile operator's Femtocell AP\n   (FAP) to leverage the IPSec IKEv2 to support
    mutual authentication\n   and data protection between the insecure Femtocell,
    which typically\n   deployed in customer's premise, and its corresponding mobile
    core\n   network.\n\n   A known security threat exists in Femto architecture for
    failing to\n   validate the FAP's identity and information provided by FAP at
    the\n   mobile operator's core network.\n\n   This document reviews this security
    threat and proposes a simple\n   extension of the IKEv2 to resolve the issue.\n\n\n\t "

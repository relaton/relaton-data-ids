  content: "   This draft proposes an estimation scheme of available capacity for\n
    \  network mobility (NEMO) with the multi-interfaced mobile router\n   (MMR).
    In the proposed scheme, mobile nodes (MNs) can get\n   information on available
    capacity irrespective of the presence or\n   absence of estimation functionality.
    Since the MMR with\n   heterogeneous wireless network interfaces estimates available\n
    \  capacity on behalf of the MNs inside the mobile network, the\n   proposed scheme
    does not require MNs to be involved in estimating\n   available capacity. A new
    algorithm for available capacity\n   estimation on MMR is developed to improve
    the estimation accuracy\n   compared with the existing scheme. The developed algorithm
    defines\n   three cases of the difference between the average output gap and the\n
    \  input gap, and then reflects fully them, which can reduce the\n   detection
    error for the turning point and thus provide more accurate\n   estimation than
    the existing algorithm. Then, MNs can get\n   information on estimated available
    capacity from the MMR using L3\n   messages. Therefore, the proposed scheme can
    reduce burden and power\n   consumption of MNs with limited resource and battery
    power since MNs\n   do not estimates directly available capacity. In addition,
    the\n   proposed scheme can reduce considerably traffic overhead over\n   wireless
    links on multiple estimation paths since signaling messages\n   and injected testing
    traffic are reduced.\n\n\t "

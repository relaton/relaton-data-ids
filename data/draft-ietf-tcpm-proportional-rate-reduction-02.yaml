  content: "   This document describes an experimental algorithm, Proportional Rate\n
    \  Reduction (PPR) to improve the accuracy of the amount of data sent by\n   TCP
    during loss recovery.  Standard Congestion Control requires that\n   TCP and other
    protocols reduce their congestion window in response to\n   losses.  This window
    reduction naturally occurs in the same round\n   trip as the data retransmissions
    to repair the losses, and is\n   implemented by choosing not to transmit any data
    in response to some\n   ACKs arriving from the receiver.  Two widely deployed
    algorithms are\n   used to implement this window reduction: Fast Recovery and
    Rate\n   Halving.  Both algorithms are needlessly fragile under a number of\n
    \  conditions, particularly when there is a burst of losses such that\n   the
    number of ACKs returning to the sender is small.  Proportional\n   Rate Reduction
    minimizes these excess window reductions such that at\n   the end of recovery
    the actual window size will be as close as\n   possible to ssthresh, the window
    size determined by the congestion\n   control algorithm.  It is patterned after
    Rate Halving, but using the\n   fraction that is appropriate for target window
    chosen by the\n   congestion control algorithm.\n\n\t "

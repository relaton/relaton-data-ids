  content: "   This document describes the nomenclature, requirements and framework\n
    \  for handling per-sample metadata for a live archive of Internet\n   measurements.
    \ By archive, we mean that once captured, the data MUST\n   NOT be altered or
    deleted.  By live, we mean that new data from\n   ongoing measurements are being
    continuously appended to the archive.\n\n   The purpose of the metadata is to
    support the use of the Scientific\n   Method in the study the archived data.  Under
    the principle of full\n   disclosure, the Scientific Method requires that later
    researchers be\n   able to repeat earlier studies using the original data, but
    refined\n   by new insights (such as improved calibration) gained from other\n
    \  intervening studies.\n\n\t "

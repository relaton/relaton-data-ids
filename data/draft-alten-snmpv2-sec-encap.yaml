  content: "This document proposes a practical solution for the security of SNMP packets.
    \ It allows any SNMP packet to be transmitted with strong authentication information.
    \ Packets can be optionally encrypted for full security.  This encapsulation protocol
    is designed to allow implementations to meet USA export requirements.  It supports
    SNMPv1 [2], SNMPv2 [11], and will support any future SNMP protocol enhancements.
    \ It can be added transparently so that investment in existing SNMP protocol stacks
    can be preserved.                                                   Administration
    is kept simple, in particular public key management and time synchronization.
    \ This encapsulation scales well to large numbers of managers and agents.  It
    is designed to facilitate implementation and to minimize troubleshooting with
    extensive error reporting mechanisms.\n\t "

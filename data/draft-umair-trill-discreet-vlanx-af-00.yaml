  content: "   According to RFC 7176, DRB on a link uses the Appointed Forwarders\n
    \  sub-TLV to inform other ISs on the link that they are the designated\n   VLAN-x
    forwarder for one or more ranges of VLAN IDs. Appointed\n   Forwarders sub-tlv
    has Appointed Information field which carries\n   information about Appointee
    Nickname, Start.VLAN and End.VLAN. Both\n   Start.VLAN and VLAN.end to the same
    value indicates a range of one\n   VLAN ID, if they are different then the Appointed
    RBridge is AF for\n   that range of VLAN ID's. If end-station's VLAN's are configured
    in\n   discontiguous/discreet [1,3,5,7 etc] way then DRB has to send\n   Appointed
    Information equal to number of Discreet VLAN's Appointed\n   for a particular
    RBridge. The problem will worsen if huge number of\n   endstation VLAN's are discreet.
    This paper is an attempt to handle\n   such scenarios.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document presents an extension to the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP)-Specific Event Notification mechanism for subscribing\nto a homogeneous
    list of resources.  Instead of the subscriber\nsending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource
    individually, the subscriber\ncan define an ad-hoc resource list, subscribe to
    it, and maintain it\n– all within a single SUBSCRIBE dialog. Changes in the state
    of the\nresources are reported using the same dialog in any standard SIMPLE\nformat
    for conveying notifications for lists of resources or\nindividual resources and
    agreed during the SUBSCRIBE dialog\nestablishment.\n\t "

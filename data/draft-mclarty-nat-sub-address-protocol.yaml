  content: "   This document defines the NAT Sub-Address Protocol (NATSAP), a Layer\n
    \  5 encapsulation protocol designed to facilitate seamless\n   bidirectional
    communication with devices behind Carrier-Grade NAT (CG\n   NAT).  NATSAP introduces
    dynamic sub-addresses assigned by the NAT\n   router, which external clients can
    use alongside the public IP to\n   route traffic back to internal devices without
    requiring traditional\n   port forwarding.  This document also defines the Dynamic
    Sub-Address\n   Assignment Protocol (DSAAP), to facilitate the acquiring of a
    NATSAP\n   Sub-Address.\n\n   The protocol offers backward compatibility with
    existing IPv4\n   infrastructure, efficient DNS-based service discovery, and simple,\n
    \  stateless mapping.  By encapsulating application-layer traffic,\n   NATSAP
    enables direct communication with devices behind NATs using a\n   standardized
    socket notation and DNS records.\n\n\t "

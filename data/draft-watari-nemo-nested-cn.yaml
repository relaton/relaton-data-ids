  content: "This document aims at assisting the problem statement of route\n   optimization
    in nested mobile networks.  We describe the paths\n   packets would take using
    existing Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support\n   mechanisms when one or both end
    nodes of a communication flow are\n   located in a nested NEMO.  One of both of
    the end nodes may\n   themselves be either mobile nodes performing Mobile IPv6,
    or standard\n   IPv6 nodes performing no mobility function at all.  The path can\n
    \  become extremely suboptimal if no optimization is provided.\n\t "

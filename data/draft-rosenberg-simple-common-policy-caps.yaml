  content: "An important component of presence and location services is policy.\n
    \  Policy systems allow the presentity or location target to grant\n   access
    to specific pieces of information to specific watchers or\n   requestors. These
    policy systems can be extremely simple, allowing a\n   user to accept or block
    requests based solely on the identity of the\n   requestor, to extremely complex,
    allowing for time based rules that\n   grant or deny specific pieces of information.
    Policy systems often\n   support vendor proprietary features. To allow for interoperability\n
    \  between clients which set such policies, and servers which execute\n   them,
    it is necessary for clients to be able to determine the\n   capabilities of the
    server to which it is connected. This\n   specification defines an Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) based\n   format for expressing such capabilities.\n\t "

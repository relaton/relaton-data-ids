  content: "Remote Passphrase Authentication provides a way to authenticate a user
    to a service by using a pass phrase over an insecure network, without revealing
    the pass phrase to eavesdroppers. In addition, the service need not know and does
    not learn the user's pass phrase, making this scheme useful in distributed environments
    where it would be difficult or inappropriate to trust a service with a pass phrase
    database or to allow the server to learn enough to masquerade as the user in a
    future authentication attempt.     This draft is part one of a four part series
    and contains an extended introduction to the problem and potential solutions to
    the problem.  It is optional reading for those already familiar with the general
    issues of authentication over insecure networks.  Part two (draft-petke-mech-00.txt)
    explains the RPA mechanism.  Part three (draft-petke-http-auth-scheme-00.txt)
    explains how to incorporate the mechanism into HTTP.  Part four (draft-petke-serv-deity-protocol-00.txt)
    explains the protocol between the service and deity.     This scheme was inspired
    by Dave Raggett's Mediated Digest Authentication paper.\n\t "

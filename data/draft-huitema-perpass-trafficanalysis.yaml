- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Traffic analysis is used by various entities to derive \"meta data\"\n
    \  about Internet communications, such as who communicates with whom or\n   what,
    and when.  We analyze how meta-data can be extracted by\n   monitoring IP headers,
    DNS traffic, and clear-text headers of\n   commonly used protocols.  We then propose
    a series of actions that\n   would make traffic analysis more difficult.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditional Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) typically
    involves producing a Modified-EU64 format identifier to be employed as the Interface-ID
    of the resulting address. In the case of Ethernet network interface cards, such
    identifier derived from the corresponding IEEE 802 address. IEEE 802 addresses
    are generally expected to be globally unique, thus resulting in non-duplicate
    addresses. However, in many real-world scenarios, these identifiers fail to be
    unique, thus resulting in duplicate IPv6 addresses. This document discusses the
    interoperability problems arising from duplicate IEEE 802 addresses with IPv6
    Stateless Address Auto- Configuration (SLAAC), and how some popular implementations
    react when the such problems arise. Finally, it discusses possible mitigations
    for the aforementioned issue.</p>"

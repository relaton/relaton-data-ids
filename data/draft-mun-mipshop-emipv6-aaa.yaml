  script: Latn
  content: "   When Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is deployed in commercial network, a mobile\n
    \  node needs AAA services for authentication, authorization and\n   accounting.
    MIPv6, however, does not provide any mean to authenticate\n   mobile nodes that
    are roaming in different domains, although visited\n   networks will need to check
    whether access of mobile nodes should be\n   authorized or not. Hence schemes
    which support both AAA services and\n   mobility have been emerged. These schemes
    enable access of the mobile\n   node to be authorized by visited networks through
    AAA as well as to\n   perform a home registration during AAA procedure. However,
    they\n   introduce lots of signal messages and long handover latency during\n
    \  handover, since Route Optimization mode for MIPv6 is performed using\n   Return
    Routability procedure. Especially, the long handover latency\n   is a critical
    problem in real-time communication such as voice over\n   IP (VoIP). To solve
    these problems, we propose an optimized scheme\n   which performs Route Optimization
    mode using the AAA infrastructure\n   between the home agent and a correspondent
    node instead of Return\n   Routability procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

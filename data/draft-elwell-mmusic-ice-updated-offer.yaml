  content: "   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) requires an updated\n
    \  offer-answer cycle under some circumstances, to satisfy the needs of\n   some
    devices on the signalling path.  When used with SIP, this\n   additional offer-answer
    cycle interacts with other things, such as\n   fax and third party call control
    (3PCC).  This document describes the\n   problems and discusses possible remedies.\n\n
    \  This work is being discussed on the mmusic@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t "

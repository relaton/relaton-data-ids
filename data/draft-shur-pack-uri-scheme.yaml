  content: "A package is a logical entity that holds a collection of parts. \nGiven
    the URI for a complete package, the \"pack\" URI scheme provides\nfor the construction
    and use of URIs referring to individual parts \nwithin the package.  It also provides
    for the use of part's URIs as \nbase URIs for resolving relative references between
    the parts in a \nsingle package.\n\t "

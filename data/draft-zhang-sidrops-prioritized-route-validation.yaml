  script: Latn
  content: "   RPKI ROAs and other digitally signed objects provide a practical\n
    \  solution to validate BGP routes for preventing route hijacks.  During\n   ROV
    operations, validation data may be sourced not only from issued\n   ROAs but also
    from other local sources.  These data sources can vary\n   in terms of credibility,
    and ROV operations may therefore require\n   different response actions for invalid
    or unknown routes.  This\n   document takes ROV as an example to describe a flexible
    RPKI-based\n   route validation using multi-priority data, and outlines relevant
    use\n   cases, framework, and requirements for ROV operations that involve\n   multi-priority
    data.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "OSPF is the Interior Gateway Protocol currently supported by the IETF\nand
    is widely deployed across the internet.  The current strongest\nauthentication
    method for OSPFv2 is the cryptographic authentication\n(RFC2328.D [4]) which uses
    shared secret key to authenticate the\npackets.  This memo explains the different
    security flaws we found in\nthe anti-replay and the MACs calculation.  The second
    part presents\npractical exploitations of these weaknesses: an attacker directly\nconnected
    to a link, can (i)   replay LSAs, (ii)  break neighborhood\nand (iii) flap routes.\n\t "

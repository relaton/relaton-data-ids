  content: "This is the second draft of the MIME with the Message Security Protocol
    (MSP) specification. This document defines the conventions for using MIME and
    MSP together.  For the most part, this specification is not controversial.  However,
    there is some debate about signed only MSP contents.  This draft documents the
    consensus from the MSP BOF held at the March 1996 IETF meeting.                                                   One
    open question was not discussed at the March 1996 IETF, and inputs are desired
    on this topic. Should the MIME format indicate whether a management message is
    being carried within the multipart/signed or multipart/encrypted content?  CRL
    distribution is one example of such a management message.\n\t "

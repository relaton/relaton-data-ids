  script: Latn
  content: "The HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2068) is silent about various details
    of TCP connection management when using persistent connections.  This document
    discusses some of the implementation issues discussed during HTTP/1.1's design,
    and introduces a few new requirements on HTTP/1.1 implementations learned from
    implementation experience, not fully understood when RFC 2068 was issued.  This
    is an initial draft for working group comment, and we expect further drafts.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "      Cross-realm operations in Kerberos allow users to access services\n
    \  offered by foreign realms.  The cross-realm operations are based on\n   inter-realm
    trust built using shared symmetric keys (aka. inter-realm\n   keys) between the
    KDCs of the realms offering cross-realm services.\n   The current cross-realm
    authentication model may be the origin of\n   performance, scalability and security
    issues.  This documents\n   provides a brief overview of these issues and introduces
    a new cross-\n   realm model based on PKINIT.  The new model called XTGSP, defines
    a\n   protocol that allows a client to obtain a service ticket, for a\n   service
    offered by a foreign realm, in a single round trip.  The\n   protocol specifies
    an exchange between Kerberos KDCs that enables a\n   local KDC to build a TGS-REP
    message for a service that is registered\n   in a remote realm.  The XTGSP exchange
    is secured using inter-realm\n   keys maintained using the the PKINIT extension.\n\n\t "

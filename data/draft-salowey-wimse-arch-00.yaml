- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The increasing prevalence of cloud computing and micro service\n   architectures
    has led to the rise of complex software functions being\n   built and deployed
    as workloads, where a workload is defined as a\n   running instance of software
    executing for a specific purpose.\n\n   Workloads need to be provisioned with
    a unique identity when they are\n   started.  This information and their security
    context needs to be\n   passed along the call chain.  This architecture document
    discusses\n   the motivation for designing and standardizing protocols and payloads\n
    \  for conveying identity and security context information.\n\n\t "

- content: "<p>This document provides an implementation report for RPKI Router protocol
    as defined in [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr]. The editor did not verify the accuracy
    of the information provided by respondents or by any alternative means. The respondents
    are experts with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
    considered authoritative for the implementations for which their responses represent.
    Respondents were asked to only use the YES answer if the feature had at least
    been tested in the lab.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes an extension to BGP-4 which may be used by
    a\n   BGP-4 speaker to solicit Virtual Private Network (VPN) reachability\n   information
    from other IBGP speakers.\n \n   The motivation of the proposed technique is to
    provide a means of\n   reducing the memory requirements of routers which use BGP-4
    to\n   distribute VPN reachability information as described in [1] and [4].\n
    \n   The extension is backward compatible in that a router which supports\n   the
    extension can interoperate with a router which doesn't.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility\n
    \  management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. When the\n   numbers
    of MNs which attaching to the same MAG is very large, it will\n   cause the problem
    that the arrival rate of data traffic is far\n   surpass the process capacity
    of the MAG. So the MAG will suffer from\n   process bottleneck. The IETF is working
    on optimization for PMIPv6.\n   This document proposes a load sharing solution
    for MAGs by migrating\n   the Picked Mobile Node (PMN) to some MAGs without overload
    to sharing\n   the traffic load, which can relieve stress of the overloaded MAG
    and\n   improve the performance of PMIPv6 network.\n\n\n\t "

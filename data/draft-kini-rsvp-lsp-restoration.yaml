  content: "Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of label \nswitched
    paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and with bandwidth\nguarantees. The
    reliability of these LSPs can be increased by providing\na backup LSP onto which
    traffic can be switched upon failure of an\nelement in the path of the active
    LSP. Backup LSPs can be routed in a\nway that bandwidth can be shared between
    backup links of more than one\nactive path while still guaranteeing recoverability
    for a set of\nfailures. This sharing greatly increases the network efficiency
    thereby\nincreasing the number of LSPs that can be carried while maintaining\nguarantees.
    Algorithms which can route such recoverable LSPs while\nusing only aggregate network
    usage information are being developed.\nKeeping these algorithms as the primary
    motivation this document\ndescribes a mechanism to signal shared backup LSPs using
    RSVP.\n\t "

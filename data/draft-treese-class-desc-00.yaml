  content: "Many applications for automated searching and selection of documents can
    benefit from a common notation for classifying documents.  This memo describes
    one such notation. The notation is extensible to allow the description of many
    different properties on a given document.  The notation can be employed by any
    application using RFC-822 headers, such as electronic mail and the HyperText Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). In addition, we define a new error code for HTTP to indicate
    a selection failure.\n\t "

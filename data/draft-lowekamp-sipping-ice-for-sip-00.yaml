abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "\n   This draft explores a way SIP can be extended to allow a new dialog\n
    \  directly between the endpoints to replace an initial dialog that had\n   one
    or more proxies in the signalling path.  This technique relies on\n   ICE to perform
    hole punching that allows a direct connection to be\n   used in deployments where
    a sip-outbound proxy or SBC is used to\n   establish SIP connections across NAT
    or firewall boundaries.  It can\n   also be used to replace such a dialog with
    a secure connection\n   directly between the endpoints.  This technique can be
    applied to\n   traditional proxy-based SIP routing as well as to emerging P2PSIP\n
    \  deployments that lack centrally located proxies.\n\n   This draft describes
    early work that evolved from ideas initially\n   developed for P2PSIP that are
    no longer being pursued.  We are\n   interested in feedback on whether there is
    broader interest in these\n   techniques.\n\t "

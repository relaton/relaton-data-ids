  content: "   Homomorphic encryption is an algorithm that allows computations to
    be\n   performed on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it.  This\n
    \  document provides a homomorphic cryptographic protocol that supports\n   addition
    and multiplication in the ciphertext state.  In this\n   document, the proposed
    protocol can be used to protect user privacy\n   in measurement information collection
    and statistics by using\n   homomorphic encryption.  And let the collector server
    receive the\n   computation results without having to acknowledge the information\n
    \  plaintext of each individual client.\n\n\t "

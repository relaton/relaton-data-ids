  content: "The transition mechanism described in the 6to4 draft [2] [6to4] \nraises
    scaling concerns when the matrix of IPv4 connected 6to4-\nrouter systems, communicating
    across to the native IPv6 only \nconnected systems, are on the order of tens to
    hundreds of millions. \nThis document will address those concerns, offer additional
    \nmechanisms for resolving them, and identify use for the scenario of \nlink-local
    addressing postulated in section 3.1.\n\t "

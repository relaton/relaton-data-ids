  content: "   A mobile node needs home address, home agent address and security\n
    \  association with home agent to register with the home agent.  The\n   process
    of obtaining this information is called bootstrapping.  This\n   document describes
    a bootstrapping architecture in which there is\n   some dependency between AAA
    for network access and AAA for mobility\n   service and DHCP in the visited network
    is used for carrying Mobile\n   IPv6 bootstrap information to the mobile node.
    \ The architecture is\n   based on an assumption that the mobile node uses network
    access\n   credentials as the seed information without a need to pre-configure\n
    \  any Mobile IPv6 service parameters.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Native Short\n
    \  Address (NSA) that enables IP packet transmission over links where\n   the
    transmission of a full length address may not be desirable.  This\n   document
    focuses on carrying IP packets across an LLN (Low power and\n   Lossy Network),
    in which the topology is relatively static where\n   nodes' location is fixed
    and the connection between nodes is rather\n   stable.  The changes in the logical
    topology are only caused by non-\n   frequent disconnection in the link.  The
    specifications details the\n   NSA architecture, address allocation, forwarding
    mechanism, header\n   format design, including length-variable fields, and IPv6\n
    \  interconnection support.\n\n\t "

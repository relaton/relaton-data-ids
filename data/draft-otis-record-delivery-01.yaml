  content: "This document is to allow record based equipment a common record \noffload
    layer suitable for other protocols.  As all storage protocols \nanticipate hardware
    acceleration, it becomes incumbent to provide \nthis hardware a generic structure
    that can be applied to many \nprotocols and yet allow an unencumbered feature
    set.  The structures \ndefined for SCTP [RFC2960] were developed to provide record
    based \nsolutions and are well suited for this common record offload layer.  \nThis
    document will assume either direct use of SCTP, a modified SCTP \ncommon header
    used as a TCP option, or this modified SCTP common \nheader placed within the
    TCP byte stream.  SCTP conventions will be \nused to enable enhanced features
    such as connection recovery in lieu \nof other techniques.  The sequential handling
    of delineated records \nis done in accordance with SCTP.\n\t "

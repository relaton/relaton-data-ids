  content: "   This document specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media\n   handling
    in multi-party calls.  The main RTT transport is to carry\n   Real-Time text by
    the RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode according\n   to RFC 4103 [RFC4103] .
    \ The mechanisms enable the receiving\n   application to present the received
    real-time text media separated\n   per source, in different ways according to
    user preferences.  Some\n   presentation related features are also described explaining
    suitable\n   variations of transmission and presentation of text.\n\n   Call control
    features are described for the SIP environment.  A\n   number of alternative methods
    for providing the multi-party\n   negotiation, transmission and presentation are
    discussed and a\n   recommendation for the main ones is provided.  The main solution
    for\n   SIP based centralized multi-party handling of real-time text is\n   achieved
    through a media control unit coordinating multiple RTP text\n   streams into one
    RTP stream.\n\n   Alternative methods using a single RTP stream and source\n   identification
    inline in the text stream are also described, one of\n   them being provided as
    a lower functionality fallback method for\n   endpoints with no multi-party awareness
    for RTT.\n\n   Bridging methods where the text stream is carried without the\n
    \  contents being dealt with in detail by the bridge are also discussed.\n\n   Brief
    information is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC\n   environment.\n\n\t "

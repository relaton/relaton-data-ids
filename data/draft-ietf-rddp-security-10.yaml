  content: "This document analyzes security issues around implementation and use of
    the Direct Data Placement Protocol (DDP) and Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol
    (RDMAP).  It first defines an architectural model for an RDMA Network Interface
    Card (RNIC), which can implement DDP or RDMAP and DDP.  The document reviews various
    attacks against the resources defined in the architectural model and the countermeasures
    that can be used to protect the system.  Attacks are grouped into those that can
    be mitigated by using secure communication channels across the network, attacks
    from Remote Peers, and attacks from Local Peers.  Attack categories include spoofing,
    tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege.

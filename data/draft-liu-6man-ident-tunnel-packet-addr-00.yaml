abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In the networks where IPv6 tunneling is used, it is not specific\n
    \  about how a tunnel end-node identifies the received tunnel packets by\n   checking
    the destination and source addresses.  when the tunnel end-\n   node is configured
    with multiple IPv6 addresses or multiple IPv6\n   tunnel instances, such identification
    is necessary.  This document\n   describes the problem and defines the behavior
    of IPv6 tunnel end-\n   nodes about identifying tunnel packets.\n\n\t "

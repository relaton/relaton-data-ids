  content: "This document describes PNG (Portable Network Graphics), an\n   extensible
    file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed\n   storage of raster
    images.  PNG provides a patent-free replacement for\n   GIF and can also replace
    many common uses of TIFF.  Indexed-color,\n   grayscale, and truecolor images
    are supported, plus an optional alpha\n   channel.  Sample depths range from 1
    to 16 bits.\n \n   PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications,
    such as\n   the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive\n
    \  display option.  PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity\n   checking
    and simple detection of common transmission errors.  Also,\n   PNG can store gamma
    and chromaticity data for improved color matching\n   on heterogeneous platforms.\n
    \n   This specification defines the Internet Media Type 'image/png'.\n\t "

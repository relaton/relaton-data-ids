  content: "   This document describes the problem statement, use cases, and\n   requirements
    for a \"Distributed Inference Network\" (DIN) in the era\n   of pervasive AI.
    \ As AI inference services become widely deployed and\n   accessed by billions
    of users, applications and devices, traditional\n   centralized cloud-based inference
    architectures face challenges in\n   scalability, latency, security, and efficiency.
    \ DIN aims to address\n   these challenges by leveraging distributed edge-cloud
    collaboration,\n   intelligent scheduling, and enhanced network security to support
    low-\n   latency, high-concurrency, and secure AI inference services.\n\n\t "

  content: "   CBOR (STD 94, RFC 8949) defines \"Deterministically Encoded CBOR\"
    in\n   its Section 4.2, providing some flexibility for application specific\n
    \  decisions.  To facilitate Deterministic Encoding to be offered as a\n   selectable
    feature of generic encoders, the present document defines\n   a CBOR Common Deterministic
    Encoding (CDE) Profile that can be shared\n   by a large set of applications with
    potentially diverging detailed\n   requirements.\n\n   This document also introduces
    the concept of Application Profiles,\n   which are layered on top of the CBOR
    CDE Profile and can address more\n   application specific requirements.  To demonstrate
    how Application\n   Profiles can be built on the CDE, a companion document defines
    the\n   application profile \"dCBOR\".\n\n\t "

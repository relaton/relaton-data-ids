  content: "This document defines the changes that need to be made to the Domain Name
    System to support hosts running Simple Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP).  A new resource
    record type is defined to store a SIPP address sequence and a new inverse lookup
    domain is used to store the inverse mapping. The definitions of existing query
    types that return Internet addresses as part of additional section processing
    are also updated.  The extensions are intended to be compatible with existing
    applications and name server/resolver implementations.\n\t "

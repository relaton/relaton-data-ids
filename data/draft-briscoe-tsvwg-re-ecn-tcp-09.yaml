abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new protocol for explicit congestion notification
    (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be deployed incrementally around unmodified routers.
    The protocol works by arranging an extended ECN field in each packet so that,
    as it crosses any interface in an internetwork, it will carry a truthful prediction
    of congestion on the remainder of its path. The purpose of this document is to
    specify the re-ECN protocol at the IP layer and to give guidelines on any consequent
    changes required to transport protocols. It includes the changes required to TCP
    both as an example and as a specification. It briefly gives examples of mechanisms
    that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond correctly to congestion,
    but these are described more fully in a companion document.</p>"

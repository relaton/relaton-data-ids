  content: "Geopriv defines the concept of a 'using protocol', a protocol that\ncarries
    geopriv location objects.  Geopriv also defines various\nscenarios for the distribution
    of location objects that require the\nconcept of subscriptions and asynchronous
    notifications.  This\ndocument examines some existing IETF work on the concept
    of presence,\nshows how presence architectures map onto geopriv architectures,
    and\npresents one pre-existing using presence protocol that might carry\nlocation
    objects.\n\t "

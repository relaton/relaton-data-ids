  script: Latn
  content: "Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, such as RADIUS
    and DIAMETER, are in use within the Internet today to provide authentication and
    authorization services for dial-up computers.  Mobile IP for IPv4 requires strong
    authentication between the mobile node and its home agent.  When the mobile node
    shares an AAA Security Association with its home AAA server, however, it is possible
    to use that AAA Security Association to create derived Mobility Security Associations
    between the mobile node and its home agent, and again between the mobile node
    and the foreign agent currently offering connectivity to the mobile node.  This
    document specifies extensions to Mobile IP registration messages that can be used
    to create Mobility Security Associations between the mobile node and its home
    agent, and/or between the mobile node and a foreign agent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

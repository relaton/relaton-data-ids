  content: "The draft \"MPLS Tunnels for Virtual Aggregation\"\n[I-D.ietf-grow-va-mpls]
    specifies how MPLS is used as the tunneling\nprotocol for Virtual Aggregation
    (VA).  The -00 version of that draft\nspecifies only one level of labels, with
    the result that one Label\nSwitched Path (LSP) for every remote ASBR must be established.
    \ For\nlarge ISPs, this can amount to a large number of LSPs.  This draft\nproposes
    adding the option of using an inner label to identify the\nremote ASBR.  Either
    an outer label or an IP tunnel is used to reach\nthe local ASBR.  When MPLS is
    used as the tunneling protocol, this\nreduces the number of LSPs to the number
    of local border routers\n(ASBR).\n\t "

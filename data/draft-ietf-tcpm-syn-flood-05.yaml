  content: "This document describes TCP SYN flooding attacks, which have been well-known
    to the community for several years.  Various countermeasures against these attacks,
    and the trade-offs of each, are described.  This document archives explanations
    of the attack and common defense techniques for the benefit of TCP implementers
    and administrators of TCP servers or networks, but does not make any standards-level
    recommendations.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

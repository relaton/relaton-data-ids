  content: "Server virtualization allows one physical server to support many\nvirtual
    machines (VMs) so that multiple hosts (20, 30, or hundreds)\ncan be running from
    one physical platform. As virtual machines are\nintroduced into a Data Center,
    the number of hosts within the data\ncenter can grow dramatically, which can have
    tremendous impact on the\nnetwork and hosts.\n\nThis document provides an analysis
    of the scalability of IPv6\nNeighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) in data centers with
    a large number of\nvirtual machines.\n\t "

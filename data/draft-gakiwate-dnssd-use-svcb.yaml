  content: "   DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) relies on a sequence of steps to\n   enable
    the discovery and connection to local network services.  The\n   use of Service
    Binding (SVCB) resource records during the service\n   discovery process enables
    service instances to advertise properties\n   such as Application-Layer Protocol
    Negotiation (ALPN) identifiers and\n   other endpoint configuration options.  This
    document describes the\n   use of SVCB / HTTPS RRs in the DNS Service Discovery
    process as an\n   additional step to allow clients to connect to service instances\n
    \  optimally.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies new Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\n
    \  Block-Wise transfer options: Block3 and Block4 Options.\n\n   These options
    are similar to the CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options, but\n   enable faster transmission
    rates for large amounts of data with less\n   packet interchanges as well as supporting
    faster recovery should any\n   of the blocks get lost in transmission.\n\n\t "

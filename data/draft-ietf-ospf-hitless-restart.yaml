  content: "This memo documents an enhancement to the OSPF routing protocol, whereby
    an OSPF router can stay on the forwarding path even as its OSPF software is restarted.
    \ This is called \"graceful restart\" or \"non-stop forwarding\".  A restarting
    router may not be capable of adjusting its forwarding in a timely manner when
    the network topology changes.  In order to avoid the possible resulting routing
    loops, the procedure in this memo automatically reverts to a normal OSPF restart
    when such a topology change is detected, or when one or more of the restarting
    router's neighbors do not support the enhancements in this memo.  Proper network
    operation during a graceful restart makes assumptions upon the operating environment
    of the restarting router; these assumptions are also documented.\n\t "

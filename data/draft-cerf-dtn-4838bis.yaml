  content: "   This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant and\n   disruption-tolerant
    networks.  It is an evolution of the architecture\n   originally designed for
    the Interplanetary Internet, a communication\n   system envisioned to provide
    Internet-like services across\n   interplanetary distances in support of deep
    space exploration.  This\n   document describes an architecture that addresses
    a variety of\n   problems with internetworks having operational and performance\n
    \  characteristics that make conventional (Internet-like) networking\n   approaches
    either unworkable or impractical.  We define a overlay\n   protocol that interconnects
    multiple internets.  The document\n   presents a motivation for the architecture,
    an architectural\n   overview, review of state management required for its operation,
    and\n   a discussion of application design issues.  This document represents\n
    \  the consensus of the IETF DTN working group and has been widely\n   reviewed
    by that group.\n\n\t "

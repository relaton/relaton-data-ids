- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines three types to be used in future AFS-3 Rx\n   Remote
    Procedure Calls (RPCs) to represent time.  Current AFS-3 RPCs\n   represent time
    as 32-bit integers representing seconds.  This is\n   insufficient in both granularity
    and range, so new types to represent\n   time are defined in this document to
    overcome these limitations.\n\nInternet Draft Comments\n\n   Comments regarding
    this draft are solicited.  Please include the\n   AFS-3 protocol standardization
    mailing list\n   (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.\n\n\t "

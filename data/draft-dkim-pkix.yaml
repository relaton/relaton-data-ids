  content: "This document describes a mechanism for using X.509v3 certificates \nthat
    comply with the PKIX profile with Domain Keys Identified Mail \n(DKIM).  \n          \nAn
    email signer MAY inform potential relying parties that a key \ndescribed in a
    DKIM key record has a corresponding PKIX certificate \nor certificate path by
    means of an attribute in the key record that \nprovides the URL of the certificate
    data. An email verifier MAY \nchoose to make use of this information in deciding
    the disposition \nof the signed email message.\n\t "

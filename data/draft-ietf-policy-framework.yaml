  content: "This document articulates the requirements and basic framework of a\npolicy-based
    management system for IP networks.  It focuses on the\nstorage and retrieval of
    Policy Rules from a repository, for use in\nthe management and operation of IP
    networks.  This framework document\ndescribes functional components and operational
    characteristics of a\nsystem that is intended to be device and vendor independent,\ninteroperable
    and scalable.\nThere are three basic sections of this draft, addressing:\no the
    motivation for policy-based management that briefly describes\nthe requirements
    for implementing policy in IP networks;\no a reference model that defines a first-level
    functional\ndecomposition of such a framework, and captures the key concepts in\ndefining
    policy tools, Policy Rules, the use of a repository and\nschema, and the mechanisms
    underlying the definition, storage and\nretrieval of policies; and\no a description
    of each of the functional components, as well as a\nnarrative about how a policy
    system can implement prescribed\npolicies.\n\n\n\t "

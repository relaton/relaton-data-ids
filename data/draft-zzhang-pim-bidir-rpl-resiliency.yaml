  content: "   With PIM-Bidir, the RPA does not have to be associated with a router.\n
    \  Rather, it only needs to be a routable address on a RPL (typically a\n   multi-access
    network).  Such a scenario is commonly referred as\n   Phantom RPA.  This achieves
    RP resiliency to some extent, because the\n   \"RP\" will not fail.  However,
    if the RPL itself partitions, traffic\n   converged to one partition will not
    be able to reach other parts of\n   the network where joins converge to the other
    partitions of the RPL.\n\n   This document proposes simple procedures, which does
    not require\n   signaling extensions, to achieve RPL resiliency.\n\n\n\t "

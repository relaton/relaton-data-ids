  content: "This memo first gives a brief review of a RSVP and Mobile IPv6\ninteroperation
    framework proposed in [1] and compared its features\nwith the Performance Requirements
    set forth by Requirements of a QoS\nSolution for Mobile IP [2]. The subsequent
    part of the memo presents\nspecification details including message formats, processing
    rules and\nalgorithms that form the framework. The vast majority of these\nspecifications
    has been verified by a prototype implementation. It is\nexpected that this work
    could serve as a useful input in dealing with\nNSIS protocol and mobility issue.\n\n\t "

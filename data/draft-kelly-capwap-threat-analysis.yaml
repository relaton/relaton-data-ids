  content: "Early Wireless LAN (WLAN) deployments feature a \"fat\" Access Point\n
    \  (AP) which serves as a standalone interface between the wired and\n   wireless
    network segments.  However, this model raises scaling,\n   mobility, and manageability
    issues, and the CAPWAP protocol [CAPWAP]\n   is being developed in reponse.  CAPWAP
    effectively splits the fat AP\n   functionality into two network elements, and
    the communication\n   channel between these components may traverse potentially
    hostile\n   hops.  This document analyzes the security exposure resulting from\n
    \  the introduction of CAPWAP, and summarizes the associated security\n   considerations
    for CAPWAP implementations and deployments.\n\t "

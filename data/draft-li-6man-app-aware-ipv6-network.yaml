  content: "   Application-aware IPv6 Networking (APN6) framework makes use of IPv6\n
    \  encapsulation in order to convey the application-aware information\n   along
    with the data packet to the network so to facilitate the\n   service deployment
    and SLA guarantee.\n\n   This document defines the encodings of the application
    characteristic\n   information, for the APN6 framework, that can be exchanged
    between an\n   application or a network edge device such as CPE (Customer-Premises\n
    \  Equipment) and the network infrastructure through the use of IPv6\n   extension
    headers.\n\n\n\t "

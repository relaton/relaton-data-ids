  content: "   This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario\n
    \  that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network\n   that
    is assumed to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host\n   has multiple
    routers to choose from.  It also applies to other\n   scenarios such as the usage
    of stateful firewalls that effectively\n   act as address-based filters.  Host
    behavior in choosing a first-hop\n   router may interact with source address selection
    in a given\n   implementation.  However, the selection of the source address for
    a\n   packet is done before the first-hop router for that packet is chosen.\n
    \  Given that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with\n   multiple
    provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to\n   use a source address
    in a given prefix, and that some but not all\n   neighboring routers are advertising
    that prefix in their Router\n   Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this
    document specifies to\n   which router a host should present its transmission.
    \ It updates RFC\n   4861.\n\n\t "

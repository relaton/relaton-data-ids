abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM, RFC6376) claims some responsibility
    for a message by associating a domain and protecting the integrity of the covered
    portion of a message during transit through a digital signature. DKIM survives
    basic email relaying. In a Replay Attack, the recipient of a DKIM-signed message
    sends the message further, to other recipients, while retaining the original,
    validating signature, thereby seeking to leverage the reputation of the original
    signer. This document discusses the damage this causes to email delivery and interoperability,
    and the associated Mail Flows. A significant challenge to mitigating this problem
    is that it is difficult for Receivers to differentiate between legitimate forwarding
    flows and DKIM Replay.</p>"

  content: "This document presents an information model for representing QoS\npolicies
    for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). The model is\nbased on the Policy Framework
    QoS Information Model (QPIM) and the\nPolicy Core Information Model (PCIM). These
    models are extended with\nnew classes for controlling and managing the life-cycle
    of Label\nSwitched Paths (LSPs) and for mapping of traffic onto existing LSPs.\nThe
    control and management of LSP life-cycles includes mainly the\ncreation, update,
    and deletion of LSPs and the assignment of QoS\nproperties to LSPs.\nEven if this
    document is primarily intended to cover the QoS related\nMPLS areas, it also covers
    traffic engineering related policies.\n\n\t "

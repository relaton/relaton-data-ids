abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has the potential for long\nperiods
    of time to elapse when no signaling traffic is sent between a\nUser Agent Client
    (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).  There are\nsituations when it may be necessary
    for some signaling traffic to\nflow periodically between these endpoints or to
    have a quick,\nlightweight check for whether a UAS is alive.  The PING method
    is\nproposed that can be used for these purposes.\n\n\t "

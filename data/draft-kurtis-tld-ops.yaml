  content: "   The Internet is today the defacto standard packet network for a lot\n
    \  of critical communications.  The Internet in turn have a heavy\n   dependency
    on the Domain Name System (DNS) for it's \"normal\"\n   operations.  The IETF
    in June 2000 described the operating\n   requirements [1]for the so called root-servers
    that defines the root\n   of the DNS lookup tree.  Similar requirements could
    where deemed\n   needed be applied to DNS infrastructure at other levels of the
    DNS\n   tree as well.  This document analyses these requirements and what can\n
    \  be done to ensure a reliable DNS infrastructure.\n\t "

  content: "This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label \n
    \  Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching \n   (GMPLS)
    Networks (MPLS and GMPLS are described in [RFC3031] and \n   [RFC3945]). This
    document addresses the security aspects that are \n   relevant in the context
    of MPLS and GMPLS. It describes the \n   security threats, the related defensive
    techniques, and the \n   mechanisms for detection and reporting. This document
    gives \n   emphasis to RSVP-TE and LDP security considerations, as well as  \n
    \  Inter-AS and Inter-provider security considerations for building \n   and maintaining
    MPLS and GMPLS networks across different domains or \n   different Service Providers.\n\t "

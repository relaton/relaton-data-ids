  content: "   Emergency alerts need to be delivered reliably from one source to\n
    \  many recipients at once.  TCP is unsuitable for this style of\n   delivery,
    because the large number of acknowledgements would likely\n   cause network congestion.
    \ This document defines a UDP-based protocol\n   for delivering alerts that supports
    fragmentation and retransmission\n   for reliability, and allows the sender of
    a datagram to control\n   whether acknowledgements are sent.\n\n   Please send
    feedback to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t "

  content: "In this document, we propose an extension to the BGP route selection rules
    that would avoid unnecessary best path transitions between external paths under
    certain conditions.  The proposed extension would help the overall network stability,
    and more importantly, would eliminate certain BGP route oscillations in which
    more than one external path from one BGP speaker contributes to the churn. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

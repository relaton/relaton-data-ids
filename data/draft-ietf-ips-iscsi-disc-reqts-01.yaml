  content: "This document describes the  iSCSI [7] naming and discovery \nrequirements.
    The requirements presented in this document have been \nagreed to by the members
    of the iSCSI naming and discovery team. This \ndocument complements the iSCSI
    IETF draft. Flexibility is the key \nguiding principle behind this requirements
    document. That is, an \neffort has been made to satisfy the needs of both small
    isolated \nenvironments, as well as large environments requiring secure/scalable
    \nsolutions.\n\t "

  content: "   Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant\n
    \  variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless\n   channel
    conditions, interference, or the end-user's movement.  These\n   variations in
    capacity take place in the order of hundreds of\n   milliseconds and is much too
    fast for end-to-end congestion signaling\n   by itself to convey the changes for
    an application to adapt.  Media\n   applications on the other hand demand both
    high throughput and low\n   latency, and are able to dynamically adjust the size
    and quality of a\n   stream to match available network bandwidth.  However, catering
    to\n   such media flows over a radio link where the capacity changes rapidly\n
    \  requires the buffers and QoS in general to be managed carefully.\n   This draft
    proposes to provide metadata about the media transported\n   in each packet to
    allow the wireless network to manage radio\n   resources optimally and to maximize
    network utilization while also\n   improving application performance.\n\n   This
    draft discusses at a high level potential solution options to\n   this problem
    and the trade-offs involved.  The draft then defines a\n   solution that uses
    a new UDP option to carry media metadata between a\n   UDP source and destination.
    \ This option is compact and has low\n   processing overhead at the wireless router.\n\n\t "

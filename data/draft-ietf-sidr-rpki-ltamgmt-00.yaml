  content: "This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP) to\nmanage
    trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key\nInfrastructure
    (RPKI). It is common to allow an RP to import TA\nmaterial in the form of self-signed
    certificates. The facility\ndescribed in this document allows an RP to impose
    constraints on such\nTAs. Because this mechanism is designed to operate in the
    RPKI\ncontext, the relevant constraints are the RFC 3779 extensions that\nbind
    address spaces and/or autonomous system (AS) numbers to\nentities. The primary
    motivation for this facility is to enable an RP\nto ensure that resource allocation
    information that it has acquired\nvia some trusted channel is not overridden by
    the information\nacquired from the RPKI repository system or by the putative TAs
    that\nthe RP imports. Specifically, the mechanism allows an RP to specify a\nset
    of bindings between public key identifiers and RFC 3779 extension\ndata and will
    override any conflicting bindings expressed via the\nputative TAs and the certificates
    downloaded from the RPKI repository\nsystem. Although this mechanism is designed
    for local use by an RP,\nan entity that is accorded administrative control over
    a set of RPs\nmay use this mechanism to convey its view of the RPKI to a set of
    RPs\nwithin its jurisdiction. The means by which this latter use case is\neffected
    is outside the scope of this document.\n\t "

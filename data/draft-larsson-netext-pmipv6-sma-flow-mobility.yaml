  content: "This document specifies how flow mobility can be realized for a\nmobile
    node with multiple network interfaces, for which the network\nprovides mobility
    support by means of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  By\nintroducing a \"Primary Prefix\",
    the mobile node is able to maintain\nIP data sessions when moving between different
    network interfaces.\n\nThis document introduces a new set of ICMP and Mobility
    Header\nmessages.  It requires modifications of the mobile node.  However,\nsince
    support for simultaneous multi-access and flow mobility\nrequires modifications
    of the mobile node anyway, the modifications\nsuggested in this document are considered
    to be modest.\n\nThe suggested enhancement is fully backwards compatible with
    the base\nProxy Mobile IPv6 specification.  The mobile node may be an IPv4-only\nnode,
    IPv6-only node, or a dual-stack node.\n\t "

  content: "   Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there
    is\n   no generally accepted definition of the term.  Complexity metrics\n   exist
    in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address\n   only a particular
    aspect of a network, for example the complexity of\n   a graph or software.  There
    is a desire to define the complexity of a\n   network as a whole, as deployed
    today to provide Internet services.\n   This document provides a framework to
    guide research on the topic of\n   network complexity.\n\n\t "

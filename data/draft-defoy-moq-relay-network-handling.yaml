abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for conveying media-frame metadata
    for low-latency, high-throughput traffic such as Extended Reality (XR). It enables
    the Media over QUIC (MoQ) protocol to carry frame-level information defined by
    3GPP to support functions including energy efficiency and congestion management
    in wireless networks. Because MoQ traffic is end-to-end encrypted, MoQ relays
    are expected to extract the metadata needed to perform these functions.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes a mechanism to convey information about media\n
    \  frames.  The information is used for specific handling in functions\n   such
    as error recovery and congestion handling.  These functions can\n   be critical
    to improve energy efficiency and network capacity in some\n   (especially wireless)
    networks.  Due to end-to-end encryption, MoQ\n   relays are expected to extract
    the metadata required by these\n   functions.  This document aims to enable a
    level of wireless network\n   support for MoQ that is equivalent to what is possible
    for RTP.\n\n\t "

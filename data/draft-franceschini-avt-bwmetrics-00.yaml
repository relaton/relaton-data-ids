  content: "   When delivering audio and video data through low capacity links, it
    \n   is important to optimally exploit the limited resources in order to \n   provide
    the best possible user experience. QoS aspects in this \n   respect might relate
    to the pure audio and video quality, as well as \n   to delay and lip-sync. The
    actual weights of the different QoS \n   aspects depend on the service being offered,
    and are out of the scope \n   of this document. \n   In order to optimally exploit
    the limited resources, it is necessary \n   to get a reasonable precise measurement
    of them. This document \n   proposes metrics to address this problem. \n\n   This
    document, in this initial draft, focuses only on the semantic \n   aspects, leaving
    out the syntactical details. \n\n\t "

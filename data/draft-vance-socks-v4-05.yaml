abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SOCKS version 4, a protocol designed to facilitate
    TCP proxy services across a network firewall. SOCKS operates at the session layer,
    providing application users with transparent access to network services on the
    other side of the firewall. It is application-protocol independent, allowing it
    to support a wide range of services, including those utilizing encryption, while
    maintaining minimum processing overhead by simply relaying data after initial
    access control checks. The protocol defines two primary operations: CONNECT for
    establishing outbound connections to an application server, and BIND for preparing
    for and accepting inbound connections initiated by an application server.</p>"

  content: "Enterprise users require mobility and secure connectivity when they\n
    \  roam and connect to the services offered in the enterprise.  Secure\n   connectivity
    is required when the user connects to the enterprise\n   from an untrusted network.
    \ Mobility is beneficial when the user\n   moves, either inside or outside the
    enterprise network, and acquires\n   a new IP address.  This document describes
    a solution using Mobile\n   IPv4 and mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to
    provide secure\n   connectivity and mobility.\n\t "

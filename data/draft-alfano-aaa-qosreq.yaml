  content: "This document describes requirements for a protocol that would \n   perform
    Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting for Quality-of-\n   Service reservations.
    \ Such a protocol would be used by entities to \n   authenticate a user's reservation
    request, to ensure that the \n   reservation is authorized and to provide accounting
    functionality.  \n    \n   The requirements covered in this document primarily
    address the \n   communication of AAA protocols and not the QoS signaling protocols,
    \n   although they have to provide some degree of interworking. Therefore, \n
    \  we list a minimal set of requirements on supported QoS signaling \n   protocols.

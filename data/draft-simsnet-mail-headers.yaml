  content: "   This document proposes two new, optional mail header fields.\n\n   *
    \ \"HeaderWrittenBy\" is designed to provide a simple attestation of\n      the
    host that injected a message's primary author-level headers\n      (such as \"From\")
    into the mail system.\n\n   *  \"SendingSoftware\" is designed to declare the
    Mail User Agent (MUA)\n      that composed the message.\n\n   These are intended
    to provide additional, simple-to-parse signals for\n   mail filtering and analysis,
    to be used in conjunction with existing\n   authentication mechanisms like DKIM.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes two new, optional mail header fields. * "HeaderWrittenBy"
    is designed to provide a simple attestation of the host that injected a message's
    primary author-level headers (such as "From") into the mail system. * "SendingSoftware"
    is designed to declare the Mail User Agent (MUA) that composed the message. These
    are intended to provide additional, simple-to-parse signals for mail filtering
    and analysis, to be used in conjunction with existing authentication mechanisms
    like DKIM.</p>

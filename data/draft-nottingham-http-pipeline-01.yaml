  content: "Pipelining was added to HTTP/1.1 as a means of improving the\nperformance
    of persistent connections in common cases.  While it is\ndeployed in some limited
    circumstances, it is not widely used by\nclients on the open Internet.  This memo
    suggests some measures\ndesigned to make it more possible for clients to reliably
    and safely\nuse HTTP pipelining in these situations.\n\t "

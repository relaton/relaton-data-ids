  content: "   This  draft presents CEDAR,   a   Core-Extraction Distributed  Ad\n
    \  hoc Routing algorithm for QoS routing in ad hoc network environments.\n   CEDAR
    has three  key  components: (a)  the establishment   and\n   maintenance  of  a
    \ self-organizing  routing infrastructure,  called\n   the  'core',  for   performing
    \  route computations,  (b)  the\n   propagation of the link-state of  stable
    high-bandwidth links in the\n   core  through  'increase/decrease' waves,  and
    \ (c)  a  QoS  route\n   computation  algorithm  that is executed at the core
    nodes using only\n   locally available state.\n\n\t "

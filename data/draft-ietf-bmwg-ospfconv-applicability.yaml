  content: "This document discusses the applicability of various tests for measuring
    single router control plane convergence, specifically in regard to the Open Shortest
    First (OSPF) protocol.  There are two general sections in this document, the first
    discusses advantages and limitations of specific OSPF convergence tests, and the
    second discusses more general pitfalls to be considered when routing protocol
    convergence is tested.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

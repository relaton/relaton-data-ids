  content: "   This document provides the application examples of mapping and\n   deployment
    algorithms to address the problems of large resource\n   overhead and end-to-end
    latency in Service Function Chain(SFC) that\n   cannot meet the requirements of
    latency-sensitive applications in\n   terms of both latency optimization and resource
    optimization.In terms\n   of delay-optimized mapping and deployment of SFC, the
    application\n   example of granularity-variable SFC mapping algorithm based on\n
    \  microservice architecture reduces the number of instantiated\n   microservice
    units and the number of end-to-end routing hops by\n   merging redundant microservice
    units within the service function\n   chain and reusing microservice units between
    the service function\n   chains.In terms of resource-optimized mapping and deployment
    of SFC,\n   the application example of SFC mapping algorithm based on improved\n
    \  gray wolf optimization algorithm optimizes the mapping of SFC through\n   two
    strategies of reverse learning initialization and nonlinear\n   convergence factor,
    and improves the efficiency of the mapping\n   scheme.\n\n\t "

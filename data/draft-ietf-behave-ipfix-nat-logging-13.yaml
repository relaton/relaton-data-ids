  content: "Network operators require NAT devices to log events like creation and
    deletion of translations and information about the resources that the NAT device
    is managing.  In many cases, the logs are essential to identify an attacker or
    a host that was used to launch malicious attacks and for various other purposes
    of accounting.  Since there is no standard way of logging this information, different
    NAT devices use proprietary formats; hence, it is difficult to expect consistent
    behavior.  This lack of standardization makes it difficult to write the Collector
    applications that would receive this data and process it to present useful information.
    \ This document describes the formats for logging NAT events.\n\t "

  content: "There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resource\nprovisioning
    solution for Diffserv network.  The Load Control PCN\n(LC-PCN) addresses the following
    issues:\no  Admission Control for real time data flows in stateless Diffserv\n\nDomains\n\no
    \ Flow Termination: Termination of flows in case of exceptional\n\nevents, such
    as severe congestion after re-routing.\n\nAdmission control in a Diffserv stateless
    domain can be performed\nusing two methods:\n\no  Admission Control based on data
    marking, whereby in congestion\n\nsituations the data packets are marked to notify
    the PCN-egress-\n\nnode that a congestion occurred on a particular PCN-ingress-node\n\nto
    PCN-egress-node path.\n\no  Probing, whereby a probe packet is sent along the
    forwarding path\n\nin a network to determine whether a flow can be admitted based\n\nupon
    the current congestion state of the network\n\nThe scheme provides the capability
    of controlling the traffic load in\nthe network without requiring signaling or
    any per-flow processing in\nthe PCN-interior-nodes.  The complexity of Load Control
    is kept to a\nminimum to make implementation simple.  LC-PCN can support the\ningress-egress-aggregate
    (i.e., trunk/pipe) bandwidth management\nmodel as well as the HOSE bandwidth management
    model.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an \"HTTPSSVC\" DNS resource record type to\n
    \  facilitate the lookup of information needed to make connections for\n   HTTPS
    URIs.  The HTTPSSVC DNS RR mechanism allows an HTTPS origin\n   hostname to be
    served from multiple network services, each with\n   associated parameters (such
    as transport protocol and keying material\n   for encrypting TLS SNI).  It also
    provides a solution for the\n   inability of the DNS to allow a CNAME to be placed
    at the apex of a\n   domain name.  Finally, it provides a way to indicate that
    the origin\n   supports HTTPS without having to resort to redirects, allowing\n
    \  clients to remove HTTP from the bootstrapping process.\n\n   By allowing this
    information to be bootstrapped in the DNS, it allows\n   for clients to learn
    of alternative services before their first\n   contact with the origin.  This
    arrangement offers potential benefits\n   to both performance and privacy.\n\n
    \  TO BE REMOVED: This proposal is inspired by and based on recent DNS\n   usage
    proposals such as ALTSVC, ANAME, and ESNIKEYS (as well as long\n   standing desires
    to have SRV or a functional equivalent implemented\n   for HTTP).  These proposals
    each provide an important function but\n   are potentially incompatible with each
    other, such as when an origin\n   is load-balanced across multiple hosting providers
    (multi-CDN).\n   Furthermore, these each add potential cases for adding additional\n
    \  record lookups in-addition to AAAA/A lookups.  This design attempts\n   to
    provide a unified framework that encompasses the key functionality\n   of these
    proposals, as well as providing some extensibility for\n   addressing similar
    future challenges.\n\n\t "

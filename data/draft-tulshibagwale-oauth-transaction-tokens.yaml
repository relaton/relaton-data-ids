abstract:
- content: "<p>Transaction Tokens (Tx-Tokens) enable workloads in a trusted domain
    to ensure that user identity and authorization context of an external programmatic
    request, such as an API invocation, is preserved and available to all workloads
    that are invoked as part of processing such a request. Tx-Tokens also enable workloads
    within the trusted domain to optionally immutably assert to downstream workloads
    that they were invoked in the call chain of the request.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service\n
    \  discovery system designed for Large Language Model (LLM) agents.\n   Inspired
    by the traditional Domain Name System (DNS), AgentDNS\n   enables agents to autonomously
    discover, resolve, and securely invoke\n   third-party agent and tool services
    across different vendors.\n   AgentDNS introduces a unified namespace, semantic
    service discovery,\n   protocol-aware interoperability, and unified authentication
    and\n   billing.  The system aims to address interoperability, service\n   discovery,
    and trust management challenges in large-scale agent\n   collaboration ecosystems.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service
    discovery system designed for Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Inspired by the
    traditional Domain Name System (DNS), AgentDNS enables agents to autonomously
    discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across
    different vendors. AgentDNS introduces a unified namespace, semantic service discovery,
    protocol-aware interoperability, and unified authentication and billing. The system
    aims to address interoperability, service discovery, and trust management challenges
    in large-scale agent collaboration ecosystems.</p>"

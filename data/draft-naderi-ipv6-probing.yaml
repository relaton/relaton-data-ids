abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document reports on experience and simulations of dynamic\n   probing
    of alternate paths between two IPv6 hosts when network\n   failures occur.  Two
    models for such probing were investigated: the\n   SHIM6 REAchability Protocol
    (REAP) and the Multipath Transmission\n   Control Protocol (MPTCP).  The motivation
    for this document is to\n   identify some aspects of path probing at large or
    very large scale\n   that may be broadly relevant to future protocol design.\n\n\t "

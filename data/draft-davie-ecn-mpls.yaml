abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 3270 defines how to support the Diffserv architecture in MPLS\n
    \  networks, including how to encode Diffserv Code Points (DSCPs) in an\n   MPLS
    header.  DSCPs may be encoded in the EXP field, while other uses\n   of that field
    are not precluded.  RFC3270 makes no statement about\n   how Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN) marking might be encoded\n   in the MPLS header.  This draft
    defines how an operator might define\n   some of the EXP codepoints for explicit
    congestion notification,\n   without precluding other uses.\n\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by\n
    \   Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text\n    passwords
    over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security\n    (TLS).  There are some
    significant security concerns with that\n    mechanism, which could be addressed
    by the use of a challenge\n    response authentication mechanism protected by
    TLS. Unfortunately,\n    the challenge response mechanisms presently on the standards
    track\n    all fail to meet requirements necessary for widespread deployment,\n
    \   and have had success only in limited use.\n\n    This specification describes
    an authentication mechanism called the\n    Salted Challenge Response Authentication
    Mechanism (SCRAM), which\n    addresses the security concerns and meets the deployability\n
    \   requirements. When used in combination with TLS or an equivalent\n    security
    layer, SCRAM could improve the status-quo for application\n    protocol authentication
    and provide a suitable choice for a\n    mandatory-to-implement mechanism for
    future application protocol\n    standards.\n\n    The purpose of this document
    is to describe the general SCRAM\n    protocol, and how it is used in the GSS-API
    environment.  Through\n    GS2, this makes the protocol available in the SASL
    environment as\n    well.\n\t "

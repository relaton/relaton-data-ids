  content: "   ROAMING-ELGAMAL is an SASL [SASL] authentication mechanism in which\n
    \  ElGamal [ELG] public key cryptography is used to encrypt the persona\n   and
    password thus giving a high degree of security.\n \n   Although specifically designed
    for the Simple Roaming Authentication\n   Protocol [SRAP], ROAMING-ELGAMAL is
    intended to be a registered SASL\n   mechanism and so could be adapted to other
    protocols.  The mechanism\n   has been designed to resist attack from interception,
    man in the\n   middle, and replay.  The security of the mechanism rests with the\n
    \  protection of the private key.\n\n\t "

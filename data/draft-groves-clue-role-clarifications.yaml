  script: Latn
  content: "   There have been recent discussions on the CLUE and DISPATCH mailing\n
    \  lists about \"roles\" associated with multimedia conferences.  From the\n   discussions
    it was apparent that there is some confusion as to what\n   the current defined
    roles actually imply and that people had\n   different understanding of the meaning
    and scope of the term \"role\".\n   This draft seeks to identify the various \"roles\"
    that may be\n   associated with a multimedia conference and to provide a grouping
    and\n   nomenclature for further discussions on this topic.\n\n   Specific to
    CLUE this draft proposes a number of attributes to be\n   able to clearly identify
    the various roles that may be associated\n   with a media capture.\n\n\t "

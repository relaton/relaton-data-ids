  content: "Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)\nhave
    been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers, governments,\nand
    industries. \nIn recent years, these two novel frameworks created jitters and
    excitements across\nmajor academic institutions and communities of practice. While
    these are considered disruptive\nto major network infrastructures operating on
    status quo, SDN and NFV nonetheless bring\nnetwork resiliency, scalability, manageability,
    and, most importantly, lower long-term operational\nexpenditures when implemented
    properly.\n\nThey create opportunities for  innovation that engage key players
    from networks,\nsecurity, and software to develop new controllers, APIs, networks,
    and technologies. However,\nnew innovations come with associated risks and security
    issues.\n\nThis document aims to propose a formal security architecture that overarches\nimportant
    aspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks. This architecture, which is considered first
    to be proposed\nthru this draft, can be elaborated and modified as the frameworks
    mature over\ntime. \n\n\t "

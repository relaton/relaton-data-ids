  content: "This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent a text
    string in a Dial Sequence.  A Dial Sequence is normally composed of Dual Tone
    Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements, plus separators and additional \"actions\" (such
    as \"wait for dialtone\", \"pause for N secs\", etc.) which could be needed to
    successfully establish the connection with the target service: this includes the
    cases where subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation apply.\n\t "

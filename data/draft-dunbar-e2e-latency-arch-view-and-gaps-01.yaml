  content: "Ultra-Low Latency is a highly desired property for many types of\n   services,
    such as 5G MTC (Machine Type Communication) requiring\n   E2E connection for V2V
    to be less than 2ms, AR/VR requiring delay\n   less than 5ms, V2X less than 20ms,
    etc.\n\n   This draft examines the E2E latency from architectural\n   perspective,
    from studying how different OSI layers contribute to\n   E2E latency, how different
    domains, which can be different\n   operators' domains or administrative domains,
    contribute to E2E\n   latency, to analyzing the gaps of recent technology advancement\n
    \  in reducing latency.\n\n   By studying the contributing factors to E2E latency
    from various\n   angles, the draft identifies some gaps of recent technology\n
    \  advancement for E2E services traversing multiple domains and\n   involving
    multiple layers, which can be the basis for IAB to\n   organize more in-depth
    discussion, like workshop or cross Area\n   (or industry wide) BOF, as the scope
    of the discussion will be\n   too wide for one IETF WG. The discussion might touch
    upon\n   multiple IETF areas.\n\n   The goal of those further \"deep-dive\" workshop
    or cross area BOF\n   is to establish more comprehensive foundation to IESG and
    the\n   IETF community in identifying potential new work initiatives for\n   reducing
    E2E latency of services over the Internet.\n\t "

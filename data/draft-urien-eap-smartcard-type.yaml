  content: "   The EAP Smart Card Protocol (EAP-SC) defines an EAP Method and \n   Multiplexing
    model for the support of Smart Card based \n   authentication methods. EAP-SC
    provides a uniform framework for \n   interfacing with Smart Cards within the
    EAP [RFC3748] context. EAP-\n   SC provides for encapsulation of other EAP methods
    (such as [EAP-\n   TLS], [EAP-SIM] and [EAP-AKA]). \n    \n   Smart Cards are
    hardware security devices that are widely used in \n   data and voice networks
    to authenticate users and devices, and to \n   enforce security policies on the
    client platform. \n    \n   EAP-SC enhances the security of authentication methods
    by enabling \n   the use of Smart Cards for the secure provisioning and storage
    of \n   keys and credentials, and the secure execution of security sensitive \n
    \  functions. In addition, EAP-SC provides security requirements for \n   the
    support of Smart Card based Authentication Methods that ensure a \n   uniform
    level of security complementary to the underlying \n   authentication method.

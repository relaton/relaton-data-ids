  content: "A Host Identity Protocol supporting host is able to use multiple\ninterfaces
    simultaneously when it implements the Mobility and\nMultihoming HIP extensions.
    \ The protocol defines currently\nsimultaneous usage via multiple interfaces only
    towards different\npeer hosts.  Simultaneously using multiple interfaces towards
    one\npeer node was not defined due to e.g. potential problems with upper\nlayer
    congestion control algorithms.  The limitation of that protocol\nis that it allows
    only one interface to be used at a time between the\nmulti-homed host and the
    peer host.  There is no mechanism to\nseparate the flows between two hosts and
    to allow them to use\ndifferent interfaces independent from each other.  This
    memo presents\na method where two HIP hosts, of which at least one is multi-homed,\ncan
    separate different upper layer data flows such as TCP and UDP\nbetween the hosts
    and allow them to use different interfaces at the\nmulti-homed host.\n\t "

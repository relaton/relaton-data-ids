  content: "This is an initial draft for consideration by the SPEERMINT WG as a \ncandidate
    for the chartered work item dealing with \"the minimum set of \nrequirements for
    SIP-based VoIP interconnection (BCP)\", due in March \n2007.  In its present form,
    this draft is intended solely to provide a \nbasis for WG discussion about requirements
    selection.  As such, it is \nprimarily structural and descriptive in nature, leaving
    prescriptive \ncontent to later revisions driven by WG consensus. \n\n\t "

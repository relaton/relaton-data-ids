  content: "This document describes a means for automated, authenticated and\n   authorized
    updating of DNSSEC \"trust anchors\".  The method provides\n   protection against
    single key compromise of a key in the trust point\n   key set.  Based on the trust
    established by the presence of a current\n   anchor, other anchors may be added
    at the same place in the\n   hierarchy, and, ultimately, supplant the existing
    anchor.\n\n   This mechanism, if adopted, will require changes to resolver\n   management
    behavior (but not resolver resolution behavior), and the\n   addition of a single
    flag bit to the DNSKEY record.\n\t "

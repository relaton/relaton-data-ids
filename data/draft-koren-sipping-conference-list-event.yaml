  content: "This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol \n
    \  (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications related to conference \n   lists.
    \ \n\n   A new conference list event package is specified. This event package
    \n   allows a user to subscribe to a single event (the conference-list) and receive
    notifications that contain the list of conferences to \n   which the user belongs
    and the status of each conference. The \n   notifications sent from the conference
    server can contain either the \n   entire list of the user's conferences or a
    partial list with the \n   updates since the previous notification. \n\t "

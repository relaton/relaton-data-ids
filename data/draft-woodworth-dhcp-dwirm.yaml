abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices are commonly added to home networks
    without fully understanding which services (hosts, ports, protocols) are being
    provided or consumed for those devices to operate. As a result, they are essentially
    unmanaged threats with full access to that network and the internet. The Defend
    the World from IoT Remote- threats &amp; Malware (DWIRM) extension to DHCP provides
    a framework for IoT devices to negotiate services that the local router in turn
    enforces as policy.</p>"

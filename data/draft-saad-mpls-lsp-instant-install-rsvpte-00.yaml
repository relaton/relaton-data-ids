  content: "   When establishing new RSVP-TE LSPs, it is permissible that LSRs along\n
    \  the LSP path to forward the RSVP Resv message upstream before\n   installing
    the forwarding state.  In practise, this is done to\n   parallelize the forwarding
    state installation.  While the ingress can\n   start to use the LSP as soon as
    the RSVP Resv message arrives, doing\n   so may lead to traffic drops at intermediate
    LSRs that may not have\n   completed the installation of forwarding state for
    the new LSP.\n\n   This document describes procedures and provides extensions
    to RSVP-TE\n   protocol to allow an ingress LSR to immediately install and forward\n
    \  traffic on a newly signalled LSP as soon as the RSVP reservation\n   state
    is received.\n\n\t "

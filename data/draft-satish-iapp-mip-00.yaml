  content: "With WLAN hotspots becoming more wide spread, there is growing interest\namong
    cellular service providers in WLAN-Cellular interworking/roaming\narchitectures.
    Service providers are looking at deployment of\ninterworking heterogeneous wireless
    access points. There is also a\ngrowing breed of terminals trying to build a capability
    to roam \nbetween 3G and 802.xx technologies. Working groups within IETF and\nIEEE
    802.21 are involved in defining seamless roaming standards.\n802.21 is attempting
    to define roaming standards not just from one\n802-based network to another, but
    also between 802-based networks\nand 3G cellular network. Support for handoff
    between heterogeneous\nwireless networks is becoming vital. Mobile IP has always
    been the\nmacro network mobility protocol of choice where as the IAPP - Inter\nAccess
    Point Protocol (802.11f) has been recommended as the roaming\nprotocol between
    802.11 access points.\n\nThis draft suggests a mechanism of supporting handoff
    between IAPP\nsupported 802.xx devices and 3G packet core networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the RIRs is\ncausing
    service providers around the world to question how they will\ncontinue providing
    IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers\nwhen there are no longer sufficient
    IPv4 addresses to allocate them\none per subscriber.  Several possible solutions
    to this problem are\nnow emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4 addressing.
    \ These\nsolutions give rise to a number of issues and this memo identifies\nthose
    common to all such address sharing approaches.  Solution-\nspecific discussions
    are out of scope.\n\t "

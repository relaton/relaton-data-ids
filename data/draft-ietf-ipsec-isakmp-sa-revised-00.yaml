  content: "ISAKMP/OAKLEY [2][3] is the key management protocol defined by IPSEC\n
    \  working to be a framework for authentication, security association\n   negotiation
    and key management. The protocol defines two phases\n   whereby, in the phase
    1, the peers are authenticates, the security\n   association (SA) for ISAKMP/Oakley,
    and keying material is agreed\n   upon by the peers to secure ISAKMP messages.
    The phase 2 is used to\n   negotiate security association for security applications
    (e.g.,\n   IPSEC AH and ESP). When perfect forward secrecy is required, phase
    2\n   is also used to exchange keying material for the application.\n   However,
    when perfect forward secrecy is not a requirement, the\n   keying material from
    the phase 1 is used to generate session keys\n   for the secure communication
    applications.\n \n   The proposal in this document is based on the observation
    that when\n   perfect forward secrecy is not a requirement, if application\n   specific
    SA was negotiated during phase 1, the application can start\n   immediately after
    phase 1. The phase 2 can be used subsequently for\n   key refresh on per need
    bases in the future. Therefore, this\n   proposal reduces startup time for communication
    and improves the\n   efficiency of the protocol.\n \n   Remark: This document
    is NOT self-contained, it is intended as an\n   addendum to [2][3]. Thus, it is
    best read in conjunction with\n   [2][3].\n\t "

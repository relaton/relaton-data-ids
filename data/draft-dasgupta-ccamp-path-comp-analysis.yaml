  content: "This document presents a performance comparison between the per-domain
    path computation method and the Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture-based
    Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) procedure.  Metrics to capture the
    significant performance aspects are identified, and detailed simulations are carried
    out on realistic scenarios.  A performance analysis for each of the path computation
    methods is then undertaken.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

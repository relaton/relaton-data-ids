  content: "   Current modelling techniques appear to have boundaries that make\n
    \  representation of some concepts in modern problems, such as intent\n   and
    capability, challenging.  The concepts all have in common the\n   need to represent
    uncertainty and vagueness.  The challenge results\n   from the rigidity of boundary
    representation, including the\n   absoluteness of instance value and the process
    of classification\n   itself, provided by current techniques.\n\n   When describing
    solutions, a softer approach seems necessary where\n   the emphasis is on the
    focus of a particular thing.  Intelligent\n   control (use of AI/ML etc.) could
    take advantage of partial\n   compatibilities etc. if a softer representation
    was achieved.\n\n   The solution representation appears to require\n\n   *  Expression
    of range, preference and focus as a fundamental part of\n\t "

  content: "   Post-compromise security is one of the core security guarantees\n   provided
    by the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.  MLS\n   provides post-compromise
    security for a member when the member's leaf\n   node in the MLS ratchet tree
    is updated, either by that member\n   sending a Commit message, or by an Update
    proposal from that member\n   being committed.  Unfortunately, Update proposals
    can only be\n   committed in the epoch in which they are sent, leading to missed\n
    \  opportunities for post-compromise security.  This document defines a\n   Replace
    proposal that allows the fresh leaf node in an Update\n   proposal to be applied
    in a future epoch, thus enabling post-\n   compromise security for the affected
    member even if their Update\n   proposal is received too late to be committed.\n\n\t "

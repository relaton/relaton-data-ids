  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects\n
    \  to Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n   different
    domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\" of protocols
    forming a unified, defragmented IoT platform.\n   Such a platform will make objects
    accessible to applications across\n   organizations and domains.  Towards this
    goal, quite a few proposals\n   have been made to build a unified host centric
    IoT platform as an\n   overlay on top of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions,
    however,\n   are inadequate to address the important challenges posed by a\n   heterogeneous,
    global scale deployment of IoT, especially in terms of\n   mobility, scalability,
    and communication reliability, due to the\n   inherent inefficiencies of the current
    Internet.  To address this\n   problem, we propose to build a common set of protocols
    and services,\n   which form an IoT platform, based on the Information Centric
    Network\n   (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages the\n
    \  salient features of ICN, and thus provides seamless mobility support,\n   scalability,
    and efficient content and service delivery.\n\n   This draft describes representative
    IoT requirements and ICN\n   challenges to realize a unified ICN-IoT framework.
    \ Towards this, we\n   first identify a list of important requirements which a
    unified IoT\n   architecture should have to support tens of billions of objects.\n
    \  Though we see most of the IoT requirements can be met by ICN, we\n   discuss
    specific challenges ICN has to address to satisfy them.  Then\n   we discuss important
    and popular IoT scenarios including the \"smart\"\n   home, campus, grid, transportation
    infrastructure, healthcare,\n   Education, and Entertainment.\n\n\t "

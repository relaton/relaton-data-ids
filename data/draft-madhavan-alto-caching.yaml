  content: "   The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches\n
    \  assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period\n   of
    time.  The purpose of this memo is to provide a mechanism where\n   ALTO clients
    cache the map information and the servers provide the\n   expiration time for
    invalidation.\n\n\t "

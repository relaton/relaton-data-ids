  content: "   This document provides use case studies and network design\n   considerations
    for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile\n   (MPLS-TP).\n\n   In the
    recent years, MPLS-TP has emerged as the technology of choice\n   for the new
    generation of packet transport. Many service providers\n   (SPs) are working to
    replace the legacy transport technologies, e.g.\n   SONET/SDH, TDM, and ATM technologies,
    with MPLS-TP for packet\n   transport, in order to achieve higher efficiency,
    lower operational\n   cost, while maintaining transport characteristics.\n\n   The
    use cases for MPLS-TP include Metro Ethernet access and\n   aggregation, Mobile
    backhaul, and packet optical transport. The\n   design considerations discussed
    in this documents ranging from\n   operational experience; standards compliance;
    technology maturity;\n   end-to-end forwarding and OAM consistency; compatibility
    with\n   IP/MPLS networks; multi-vendor interoperability; and optimization\n   vs.
    simplicity design trade off discussion. The general design\n   principle is to
    provide reliable, manageable, and scalable transport\n   solutions.\n\n\n\n\t "

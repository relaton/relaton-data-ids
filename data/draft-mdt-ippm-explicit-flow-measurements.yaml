  content: "   This document describes protocol independent methods called Explicit\n
    \  Flow Measurement Techniques that employ few marking bits, inside the\n   header
    of each packet, for loss and delay measurement.  The\n   endpoints, marking the
    traffic, signal these metrics to intermediate\n   observers allowing them to measure
    connection performance, and to\n   locate the network segment where impairments
    happen.  Different\n   alternatives are considered within this document.  These
    signaling\n   methods apply to all protocols but they are especially valuable
    when\n   applied to protocols that encrypt transport header and do not allow\n
    \  traditional methods for delay and loss detection.\n\n\t "

  content: "While using SIGComp [4] based compression in SIP/SDP [5] [6], it is \nimperative
    to have access to a static dictionary to be used on the \nfirst SIP message that
    the compressor sends out. The session set up\ntime can be reduced significantly
    if the compression rate of the \nfirst SIP message is considerably high.\n\nThe
    existing static dictionary for SIP and SDP [2], however, does not\ninclude some
    wireless specific data elements. This document \nintroduces these new data elements
    that are specific to various \nwireless access technologies. These new data elements
    are part of the  \nfirst SIP message (i.e., originating SIP Invite) used to initiate
    a \nsession.\n\n\t "

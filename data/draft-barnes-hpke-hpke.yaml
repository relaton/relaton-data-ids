  content: "   This document describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption\n
    \  (HPKE).  This scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of\n   arbitrary-sized
    plaintexts for a recipient public key.  It also\n   includes three authenticated
    variants, including one that\n   authenticates possession of a pre-shared key
    and two optional ones\n   that authenticate possession of a key encapsulation
    mechanism (KEM)\n   private key.  HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric
    KEM,\n   key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with\n   additional
    data (AEAD) encryption function.  Some authenticated\n   variants may not be supported
    by all KEMs.  We provide instantiations\n   of the scheme using widely used and
    efficient primitives, such as\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement,
    HMAC-based key\n   derivation function (HKDF), and SHA2.\n\n   This document is
    a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)\n   in the IRTF.\n\n\t "

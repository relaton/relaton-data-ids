  content: "AFS cache-control strategy is callback (invalidate) based. The \nAFS callback
    design allows a client to know when an object it \nhas cached is no longer consistent,
    but the callback \nnotification message itself provides no specific information
    \nabout the triggering event. This is a protocol inefficiency, as \nin several
    scenarios it results in unnecessary round-trips to \nfile servers to verify file
    status information, file access \ninformation, or to fetch file data which has
    not changed. We \npropose an extension of the callback mechanism to provide \ninformation
    about the event(s) triggering a callback, in the \npayload of the callback notification
    message itself. The \nproposed mechanism eliminates most or all unnecessary \nround-trips
    imposed by the current callback mechanism, and \nsimultaneously allows AFS implementations
    to (efficiently) \nprovide correct semantics in several scenarios involving \nmultiple
    writers (ie, where AFS currently provides incorrect \nsemantics).\n\t "

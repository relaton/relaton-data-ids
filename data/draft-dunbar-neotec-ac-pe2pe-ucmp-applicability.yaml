  content: "   This document explores how existing IETF YANG data models can be\n
    \  applied to support a use case involving dynamic, time-scoped UCMP\n   (Unequal
    Cost Multipath) policy enforcement across multiple network\n   segments interconnecting
    Edge Cloud sites.  The use case is motivated\n   by periodic, high-volume data
    exchanges between distributed AI\n   inference modules placed at geographically
    dispersed edge data\n   centers.  By mapping network requirements such as bandwidth,
    latency,\n   and availability to relevant YANG models, including AC, TE Topology,\n
    \  SR Policy, and QoS models, this document serves as a practical\n   exercise
    to evaluate the applicability and limitations of current\n   IETF specifications.
    \ It highlights the need for cloud-initiated,\n   time-bounded network policy
    activation and identifies potential gaps\n   in model expressiveness, policy lifecycle
    handling, and API-level\n   abstraction required for real-time cloud-network coordination.\n\n\t "

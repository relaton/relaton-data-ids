  script: Latn
  content: "   Congestion control (CC) is the key to achieving ultra-low latency,\n
    \  high bandwidth and network stability in high-speed networks.\n   However, the
    existing high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations\n   for reaching these
    goals.\n\n   In this document, we describe HPCC++ (High Precision Congestion\n
    \  Control), a new high-speed CC mechanism which achieves the three\n   goals
    simultaneously.  HPCC++ leverages inband telemetry to obtain\n   precise link
    load information and controls traffic precisely.  By\n   addressing challenges
    such as delayed inband telemetry information\n   during congestion and overreaction
    to inband telemetry information,\n   HPCC++ can quickly converge to utilize free
    bandwidth while avoiding\n   congestion, and can maintain near-zero in-network
    queues for ultra-\n   low latency.  HPCC++ is also fair and easy to deploy in
    hardware,\n   implementable with commodity NICs and switches.\n\n\t "

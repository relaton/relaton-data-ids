  content: "   Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations\n
    \  associated with pervasive surveillance.  Some of the reported attacks\n   involved
    compromising the smart card supply chain, such as attacking\n   SIM card manufacturers
    and operators in an effort to compromise\n   shared secrets stored on these cards.
    \ Since the publication of those\n   reports, manufacturing and provisioning processes
    have gained much\n   scrutiny and have improved.  However, the danger of resourceful\n
    \  attackers for these systems is still a concern.  Always assuming\n   breach
    such as key compromise and minimizing the impact of breach are\n   essential zero-trust
    principles.\n\n   This specification updates RFC 9048, the EAP-AKA' authentication\n
    \  method, with an optional extension.  Similarly, this specification\n   also
    updates the earlier version of the EAP-AKA' specification in RFC\n   5448.  The
    extension, when negotiated, provides Forward Secrecy for\n   the session key generated
    as a part of the authentication run in EAP-\n   AKA'.  This prevents an attacker
    who has gained access to the long-\n   term pre-shared secret in a SIM card from
    being able to decrypt any\n   past communications.  In addition, if the attacker
    stays merely a\n   passive eavesdropper, the extension prevents attacks against
    future\n   sessions.  This forces attackers to use active attacks instead.\n\n\t "

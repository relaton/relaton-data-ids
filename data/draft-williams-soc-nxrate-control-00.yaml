  content: "   A SIP overload control signalling protocol framework has previously\n
    \  been published, with the flexibility to allow different SIP request\n   rate
    limiting algorithms to be selected. This document proposes a\n   similar algorithm
    of maximum rate type with two advantages over\n   existing proposals. Firstly,
    it exempts certain classes of SIP\n   requests that are fundamental to correct
    operation of the SIP\n   protocol which, if rejected by control, would worsen
    rather than\n   improve SIP performance. Secondly, it allows target servers to\n
    \  control SIP traffic from sources not compliant with this document so\n   that
    it can be deployed in heterogeneous network environments.\n\n\t "

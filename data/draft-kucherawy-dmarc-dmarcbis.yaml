  script: Latn
  content: "   Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n   (DMARC)
    is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating\n   organization can express
    domain-level policies and preferences for\n   message validation, disposition,
    and reporting, that a mail-receiving\n   organization can use to improve mail
    handling.\n\n   Originators of Internet Mail need to be able to associate reliable\n
    \  and authenticated domain identifiers with messages, communicate\n   policies
    about messages that use those identifiers, and report about\n   mail using those
    identifiers.  These abilities have several benefits:\n   Receivers can provide
    feedback to Domain Owners about the use of\n   their domains; this feedback can
    provide valuable insight about the\n   management of internal operations and the
    presence of external domain\n   name abuse.\n\n   DMARC does not produce or encourage
    elevated delivery privilege of\n   authenticated email.  DMARC is a mechanism
    for policy distribution\n   that enables increasingly strict handling of messages
    that fail\n   authentication checks, ranging from no action, through altered\n
    \  delivery, up to message rejection.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 7489.\n\n\t "

  content: "   To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a\n
    \  device, its traffic, its location, and its user in [IEEE_802]\n   networks,
    client and client Operating System vendors have started\n   implementing MAC address
    randomization.  This technology is\n   particularly important in Wi-Fi [IEEE_802.11]
    networks due to the\n   over-the-air medium and device mobility.  When such randomization\n
    \  happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network\n   connectivity
    and user experience.  At the same time, devices may\n   continue using other stable
    identifiers, defeating the MAC address\n   randomization purposes.\n\n   This
    document lists various network environments and a range of\n   network services
    that may be affected by such randomization.  This\n   document then examines settings
    where the user experience may be\n   affected by in-network state disruption.
    \ Last, this document\n   examines two existing frameworks to maintain user privacy
    while\n   preserving user quality of experience and network operation\n   efficiency.\n\n\t "

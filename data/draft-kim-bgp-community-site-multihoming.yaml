  content: "This document presents for a new IPv6 site multihoming scheme and its
    \n   operational requirements. It aims at solving potential deployment \n   problems
    in 'IPv6 Multihoming Support at Site Exit Routers [2]'\n   using an application
    of BGP extended community attribute, called \n   multihomed community. In case
    of link failure in [2], basic \n   operations to support multihoming are entirely
    dependent on \n   functionality of border router in other ISPs. Hence, it causes
    \n   following problems; centralized encapsulation overhead for re-routing, packet
    delivery along un-optimized tunneling session, and losing \n   connectivity in
    case of ISP failure. Also, [2] do not provide any \n   alternative mechanism for
    long-term failure. For above reasons, if \n   the link remains failed for a long
    time, it has a little \n   applicability due to previously mentioned problems.
    In this memo, we \n   propose a new IPv6 site multihoming scheme, which establishes
    \n   multiple direct tunneling sessions between sender's site exit router \n   and
    reachable receiver's site exit router instead of one tunneling \n   session between
    border router and site exit router in [2]. \n   Furthermore, with some additional
    BGP operations, it can preserve \n   connectivity of on-going sessions regardless
    of ISP, intermediate \n   link, as well as directly connected site link failure.

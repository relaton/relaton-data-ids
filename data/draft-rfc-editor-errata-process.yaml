  content: "This document describes a web-based process for handling the\n   submission,
    verification, and posting of errata for the RFC Series.\n   The main concepts
    behind this process are (1) distributing the\n   responsibility for verification
    to the appropriate organization or\n   person for each RFC stream, and (2) using
    a Web portal to automate\n   the book-keeping for handling errata.\n\t "

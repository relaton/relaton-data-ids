  content: "This document defines an XML format for a buddy list, which\nrepresents
    a list of other users a particular user would like to\nsubscribe to. When a presence
    client starts up, it needs to initiate\nsubscriptions to the users on the buddy
    list. By keeping this list in\na standard XML format, the list can be stored locally,
    or retrieved\nremotely using HTTP or any other transfer protocol. The great\nadvantage
    of storing it remotely is that a user can move from machine\nto machine, fetch
    their buddy list from a home server, and then\nsubscribe to those users. This
    provides personal mobility for\npresence services.\n\n\t "

  content: "The ANNOTATE extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol permits
    clients and servers to maintain \"meta data\" for messages, or individual message
    parts, stored in a mailbox on the server. For example, this can be used to attach
    comments and other useful information to a message. It is also possible to attach
    annotations to specific parts of a message, so that, for example, they could be
    marked as seen, or important, or a comment added.\n\n Note that this document
    was the product of a WG that had good consensus on how to approach the problem.
    Nevertheless, the WG felt it did not have enough information on implementation
    and deployment hurdles to meet all of the requirements of a Proposed Standard.
    The IETF solicits implementations and implementation reports in order to make
    further progress.\n\n Implementers should be aware that this specification may
    change in an incompatible manner when going to Proposed Standard status. However,
    any incompatible changes will result in a new capability name being used to prevent
    problems with any deployments of the experimental extension. This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

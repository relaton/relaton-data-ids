  content: "   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Relying Parties (RPs) are\n
    \  commonly configured with five Trust Anchors (TAs), one for each of\n   the
    Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).  Each TA operator is able to\n   make arbitrary
    RPKI statements about resources independently of the\n   other TA operators: for
    example, one TA could issue a Route Origin\n   Authorization (ROA) for resources
    that have actually been assigned to\n   another TA.\n\n   This document specifies
    a protocol that allows a set of TAs to make\n   signed statements that assert
    their consensus as to the resources for\n   which each TA is authoritative.\n\n\t "

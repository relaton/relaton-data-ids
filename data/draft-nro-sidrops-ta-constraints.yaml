abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Relying Parties (RPs) are
    commonly configured with five Trust Anchors (TAs), one for each of the Regional
    Internet Registries (RIRs). Each TA operator is able to make arbitrary RPKI statements
    about resources independently of the other TA operators: for example, one TA could
    issue a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) for resources that have actually been
    assigned to another TA. This document specifies a protocol that allows a set of
    TAs to make signed statements that assert their consensus as to the resources
    for which each TA is authoritative.</p>"

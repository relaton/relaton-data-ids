  content: "The SIMPLE working group has been debating the issue of the IM\nsession
    model for quite some time. The primary issue is what\ntransport to use for the
    IMs once the session is established with\nSIP. Proposals have included the SIP
    MESSAGE request itself, IMSX,\nand a SIP spin-off, called IMTP. The usage of SIP
    MESSAGE, the very\nfirst proposal, had been rejected by the group because of several\ntechnical
    issues. This document revists that decision, based on the\nrecent enhancements
    made to SIP itself. We believe that SIP MESSAGE\nnow represents the ideal transport
    choice for the IM session model.\n\n\n\t "

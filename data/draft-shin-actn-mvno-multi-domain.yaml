  content: "   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for\n   virtual
    network operation for mobile operators, which is facilitated\n   by the application
    of network abstraction. These abstractions shall\n   create a virtual network
    operation environment supporting mobile\n   operators in viewing, managing and
    operating multi-domains of many\n   dimensions (e.g., radio access, backhaul transport,
    mobile DC edge,\n   mobile DC core, packet/optical transport for DC interconnect,
    etc.)\n   as a single virtualized network.\n\n   This use-case considers the application
    of these abstractions and\n   the need for the associated operational mechanisms
    within the\n   network of a single operator.\n\n\n\n\t "

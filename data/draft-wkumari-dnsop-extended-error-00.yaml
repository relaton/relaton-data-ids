  content: "   This document defines an extensible method to return additional\n   information
    about the cause of DNS errors.  The primary use case is\n   to extend SERVFAIL
    to provide additional information about the cause\n   of DNS and DNSSEC failures.\n\n
    \  [ Note: I always have a hard time with EDNS terminology - I'm saying\n   that
    Extended DNS Errors are carried as EDNS Options, but is this\n   correct?  They
    are optional TLVs in \"options\" in RDATA in OPTion RR ,\n   but that's not readable.
    ]\n\n   [ Open question: The document currently defines a registry for\n   errors.
    \ It has also been suggested that the option also carry human\n   readable (text)
    messages, so allow the server admin to provide\n   additional debugging information
    (e.g: \"example.com pointed their NS\n   at us.  No idea why...\", \"We don't
    provide recursive DNS to\n   192.0.2.0.  Please stop asking...\", \"Have you tried
    Acme Anvil and\n   DNS?  We do DNS right...\" (!).  Please let us know if you
    think text\n   is needed, or if a 16bit FCFS registry is expressive enough. ]\n\n
    \  [ Open question: This document discusses extended *errors*, but it\n   has
    been suggested that this could be used to also annotate *non-\n   error* messages.
    \ The authors do not think that this is a good idea,\n   but could be persuaded
    otherwise. ]\n\n\t "

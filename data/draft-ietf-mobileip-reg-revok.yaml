  content: "This document defines a Mobile IPv4 Registration Revocation mechanism
    whereby a mobility agent involved in providing Mobile IP services to a mobile
    node can notify the other mobility agent providing Mobile IP services to the same
    mobile node of the termination of this registration.  The mechanism is also usable
    by a home agent to notify a co-located mobile node of the termination of its binding
    as well.  Moreover, the mechanism provides for this notification to be acknowledged.
    \ A signaling mechanism already defined by the Mobile IPv4 protocol is leveraged
    as a way to inform a mobile node of the revocation of its binding. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

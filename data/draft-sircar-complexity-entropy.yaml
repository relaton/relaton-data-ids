  content: "   For the evaluation of network designs it is desirable to express\n
    \  their complexity in objective, measurable metrics.  Previous work has\n   shown
    that a large number of distinct, partly dependent scales play a\n   role in overall
    complexity.  This document proposes the use of multi-\n   scale entropy metrics
    to describe the complexity of a network.  We\n   observe that the complexity of
    a network which undergoes no changes\n   over a longer time period is constant.
    \ Conversely, when a network\n   undergoes changes entropy is increasing; this
    is independent on\n   whether the changes make the network more or less complex.
    \ In other\n   words, also a simplification effort increases complexity temporarily.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a new Phase I mode for IKE [RFC-2409] based\non
    the ISAKMP [RFC-2408] Base Exchange. The purpose of this new\nexchange is to allow
    support of all authentication methods with fixed\nand non-fixed IP addresses,
    while offering protection against a\ndenial of service attack aimed at costly
    operations. It also enables\nnegotiation capabilities beyond those offered by
    Aggressive Mode\n(DH/EC group). The exchange consists of only four messages and\ntherefor
    is useful when performance is crucial.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the Extensible Authentication Protocol over\nUDP
    (EAPoUDP) to be used for network access authentication. An\naccess domain is represented
    by one or many PANA Authentication\nAgents (PAAs). Before a PANA Client (PaC)
    is granted access to the\ndomain, a PAA and a PaC MAY use EAPoUDP to authenticate
    each other.\nEAPoUDP is a variation of the Extensible Authentication Protocol\n(PPP
    EAP) [2], but runs instead over IP - either IPv4 or IPv6.\nUnlike PPP EAP, EAPoUDP
    allows authentication over any link layer\ntechnology. Furthermore, the PAA and
    the PaC need not be on the same\nlink. EAPoUDP uses UDP as its transport protocol.\n\t "

  content: "   The original TCP specification (RFC 793) defines a \"USER TIMEOUT\"\n
    \  parameter that sets the policy as to when a user connection should be\n   aborted.
    However, TCP provides no means of letting users suggest an\n   abort policy to
    a remote peer dynamically. Even though a fixed policy\n   may work well in many
    cases, there are a number of scenarios where a\n   fixed USER TIMEOUT value may
    be inappropriate, and some means of\n   setting the abort policy dynamically may
    be necessary for TCP to be\n   used effectively in such scenarios. This document
    defines a new TCP\n   option, which lets a TCP peer suggest a USER TIMEOUT value
    to a\n   remote TCP during the connection-establishment phase, and modify it\n
    \  during the life of a connection, thus adapting TCP's connection-abort\n   policy
    as necessary.\n\t "

  content: "This document defines an IPv6 geo based global unicast address for-\nmat
    to use in the Internet. The address format is based on the 3GPP\nUniversal Geographical
    Area Description. The address format defined\nin this document is consistent with
    the IPv6 protocol and the 'IPv6\nAddressing Architecture'.\nIt is designed to
    not only facilitate two dimensional data but also\naltitude information. This
    kind of information becomes necessary in\nareas where different users  occupy
    floors (like in buildings) thus\nmaking plain geographical addressing ambiguous.
    In addition, provi-\nsion  were made to extract valid location reference field
    data even\nin cases where accurarcy of location data was sacrified for a larg-\ner
    subnet field.\n\n\t "

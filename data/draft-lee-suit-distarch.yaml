  content: "   The management of data is entirely centralized on servers in a server\n
    \  client model which leads the servers to be high-value targets for\n   adversaries.
    \ Also, firmware consumers fail to download the latest\n   firmware image if the
    author is disappeared in the server client\n   model.  The distribution of network
    for managing the manifest and\n   firmware image files thus required.  This draft
    introduces a\n   distributed SUIT architecture model, which utilizes blockchains
    to\n   resolve the issues of the server client model for SUIT.\n\n\n\t "

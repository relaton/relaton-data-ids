- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Dynamic MultiPath Routing (DMPR) is a loop free path vector routing\n
    \  protocol with built-in support for policy based multipath routing.\n   It has
    been designed from scratch to work at both low and high\n   bandwidth networks
    - even with high packet loss.  The objective was\n   to keep routing overhead
    low and ensure a deterministic protocol\n   exchange behavior.  DMPR can be used
    to manage larger networks with\n   characteristics based on BGPv4 with transport
    and self-configuration\n   properties taken from OSPF/OLSR.  Unlike BGPv4 or OSPF,
    DMPR does not\n   support higher network separation concepts.  A DMPR network
    is a flat\n   network in which DMPR nodes have equal tasks.  This also applies
    to\n   DMPR communication.  Unlike OLSR/OSPF there is no flooding messages\n   (topology
    broadcast), information are stored, accumulated/compressed\n   and forwarded at
    each DMPR node.  This feature contributes to the\n   message load being deterministic.\n\n\t "

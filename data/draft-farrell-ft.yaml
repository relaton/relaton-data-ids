  content: "   This memo describes an optional, fast-track way to progress a working\n
    \  group document to IESG review.  It is provided as a process\n   experiment
    as defined in RFC 3933 for use when working group chairs\n   believe that there
    is running code that implements a working group\n   Internet-Draft.  The motivation
    is to have the IETF process\n   explicitly consider running code, consistent with
    the IETF's overall\n   philosophy of running code and rough consensus.\n\n   In
    this process all of working group last call, IETF last call, and\n   Area Director
    review are carried out in the same two week period.\n   Only comments that meet
    IESG Discuss criteria need to be addressed\n   during this stage, and authors
    are required to make any changes\n   within two weeks.\n\n   This experiment will
    run for one year.\n\n\t "

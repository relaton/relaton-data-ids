  content: "   Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation\n   function
    from tunnel Concentrator (AFTR) to Initiators (B4s), and\n   hence reduces the
    mapping scale on the Concentrator to per-customer\n   level.  This document discusses
    various deployment models of\n   Lightweight 4over6.  It also describes the deployment
    considerations\n   and applicability of the Lightweight 4over6 architecture.\n\n\t "

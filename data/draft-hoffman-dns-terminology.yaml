  content: "   The DNS is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs.  The\n   terminology
    used in by implementers and developers of DNS protocols,\n   and by operators
    of DNS systems, has sometimes changed in the decades\n   since the DNS was first
    defined.  This document gives current\n   definitions for many of the terms used
    in the DNS in a single\n   document.\n\n\t "

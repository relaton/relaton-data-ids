abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS recursive resolver operators need to provide the best service possible
    for their users, which includes providing an operationally robust and privacy
    protecting service. Challenges to these deployment goals include difficulty of
    getting responses from the root servers (such as during a network attack), longer-than-desired
    round-trip times to the closest DNS root server, and privacy issues relating to
    queries sent to the DNS root servers. Resolvers can solve all of these issues
    by simply serving an already cached a copy of the full root zone. This document
    shows how resolvers can fetch, cache and maintain a copy of the root zone, how
    to detect if the contents becomes stale, and procedures for handling error conditions.</p>"

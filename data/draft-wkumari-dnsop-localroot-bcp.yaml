  content: "   DNS recursive resolver operators need to provide the best service\n
    \  possible for their users, which includes providing an operationally\n   robust
    and privacy protecting service.  Challenges to these\n   deployment goals include
    difficulty of getting responses from the\n   root servers (such as during a network
    attack), longer-than-desired\n   round-trip times to the closest DNS root server,
    and privacy issues\n   relating to queries sent to the DNS root servers.  Resolvers
    can\n   solve all of these issues by simply serving an already cached a copy\n
    \  of the full root zone.\n\n   This document shows how resolvers can fetch, cache
    and maintain a\n   copy of the root zone, how to detect if the contents becomes
    stale,\n   and procedures for handling error conditions.\n\n\t "

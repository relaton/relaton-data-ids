  content: "   Multiple key exchanges in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version\n
    \  2 (IKEv2) [RFC9370] specifies a framework, which supports multiple\n   key
    encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) in IKEv2 by allowing up to 7\n   layers of additional
    KEMs to derive the final shared secret keys for\n   IPsec protocols.  The primary
    goal is to mitigate the “harvest now\n   and decrypt later” threat posed by Cryptographically
    Relevant Quantum\n   Computers(CRQCs).  For this purpose, one or more post-quantum
    KEMs\n   are usually performed in addition to the traditional (EC)DH key\n   exchange.
    \ This draft specifies how the post-quantum KEM algorithm\n   FrodoKEM is instantiated
    for IKEv2 as an additional key exchange\n   mechanism.\n\n   [EDNOTE: IANA KE
    code points for FrodoKEM may need to be assigned, as\n   the code points for ML-KEM
    has been considered in [W-D.K25]. ]\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a command extension to the SOCKS Version 5 protocol
    which enables compliant clients to discover features supported by the server.
    \ After discovering the support of such features, the client may use them in subsequent
    connections to that server.  This mechanism does not provide for negotiation;
    it is a way of instructing the client what features the server supports, not establishing
    which features the client supports or wishes to use.\n\t "

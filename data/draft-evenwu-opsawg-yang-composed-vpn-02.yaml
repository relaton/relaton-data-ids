  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used by a network\n
    \  operator to configure a VPN service spanning across multiple\n   administrative
    domains environment consisting of L2VPN or L3VPN or a\n   mixture of the two.
    \ This model is intended to be instantiated at the\n   management system to deliver
    the end to end service (i.e., performing\n   service provision and activation
    functions at different levels\n   through a unified interface).  The model is
    not a configuration model\n   to be used directly on network elements.  This model
    provides an\n   abstracted common view of VPN service configuration components\n
    \  segmented at different layer and administrative domain.  It is up to\n   a
    management system to take this as an input and generate specific\n   configurations
    models to configure the different network elements\n   within each administrative
    domain to deliver the service.  How\n   configuration of network elements is done
    is out of scope of the\n   document.\n\n\t "

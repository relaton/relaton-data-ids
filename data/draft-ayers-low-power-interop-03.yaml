  content: "   Low-power wireless networks provide IPv6 connectivity through\n   6LoWPAN,
    a set of standards to aggressively compress IPv6 packets\n   over small maximum
    transfer unit (MTU) links such as 802.15.4.\n\n   The entire purpose of IP was
    to interconnect different networks, but\n   we find that different 6LoWPAN implementations
    fail to reliably\n   communicate with one another.  These failures are due to
    stacks\n   implementing different subsets of the standard out of concern for\n
    \  code size.  We argue that this failure stems from 6LoWPAN's design,\n   not
    implementation, and is due to applying traditional Internet\n   protocol design
    principles to low-power networks.\n\n   We propose three design principles for
    Internet protocols on low-\n   power networks, designed to prevent similar failures
    in the future.\n   These principles are based around the importance of providing\n
    \  flexible tradeoffs between code size and energy efficiency.  We apply\n   these
    principles to 6LoWPAN and show that the modified protocol\n   provides a wide
    range of implementation strategies while allowing\n   implementations with different
    strategies to reliably communicate.\n\n\t "

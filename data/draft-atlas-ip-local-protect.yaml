  content: "This document defines an architecture and selection process for\nproviding
    local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in the\nevent of a single link
    or node failure until the router has\nconverged.  When computing the primary next-hop
    for a prefix, a\nrouter S also determines an alternate next-hop which can be used
    if\nthe primary next-hop fails.  The alternate can be either a loop-free\nalternate,
    which goes to a neighbor whose shortest path to the prefix\ndoes not go back through
    the router S, or a U-turn alternate, which\ngoes to a neighbor whose primary next-hop
    to the prefix is the router\nS, and which has itself a loop-free node-protecting
    alternate, which\nthus does not go through router S to reach the destination prefix.\n\t "

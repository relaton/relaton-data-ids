- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memo describes requirements of compensation control of optical \nimpairments
    such as chromatic dispersion for dynamic optical paths, \nas well as automatic
    discovery of fiber-related impairments over \nlinks by collaboration of a pair
    of adjacent nodes upon installation. \nIt is intended as a supplement to the wavelength
    switched optical \nnetworks (WSON) framework with impairments, because GMPLS-based
    \nautomatic adjustment of impairment compensation and automatic \ndiscovery of
    link impairments will improve usability of WSON.\n\t "

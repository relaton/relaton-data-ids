abstract:
- content: "<p>The satellite routing is the premis to ensure that the satellite network
    provides end-to-end stable service covering the whole globe. However, the mature
    terrestrial network technologies are difficult to directly apply to the satellite
    network because of the highly dynamic network topology and the limited on-board
    resources. In view of this challenge, this document presents a hierarchical routing
    architecture for satellite networks based on the prediction topology between satellites
    or satellites and ground stations.</p>"

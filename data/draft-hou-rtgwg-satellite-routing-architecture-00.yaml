  content: "   The satellite routing is the premis to ensure that the satellite\n
    \  network provides end-to-end stable service covering the whole globe.\n   However,
    the mature terrestrial network technologies are difficult to\n   directly apply
    to the satellite network because of the highly dynamic\n   network topology and
    the limited on-board resources.  In view of this\n   challenge, this document
    presents a hierarchical routing architecture\n   for satellite networks based
    on the prediction topology between\n   satellites or satellites and ground stations.\n\n\t "

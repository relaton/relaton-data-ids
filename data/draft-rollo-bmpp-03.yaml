  content: "    BMPP is a protocol which allows bulk emailers to discover if a\n   mailbox
    is willing to accept bulk email.\n \n   From the bulk emailer's point of view,
    it allows them to find out for\n   certain if their email will be accepted or
    rejected by the recipient.\n \n   From the mailbox owner's point of view, it allows
    them to provide\n   permission to bulk emailers in jurisdictions where permission
    is\n   required, and allows them to express their desire not to receive such\n
    \  bulk mailings in jurisdictions where permission is not required.\n\n\t "

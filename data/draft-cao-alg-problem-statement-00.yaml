  content: "Application Layer Gateway (ALG) has been widely implemented and used\nto
    support address and port translation in the payload for some well-\nknown protocols.
    \ Due to the lackness of standardization on\naddressing ALG related issues, a
    number of serious problems are faced\nby service deployments and upgrades.  This
    document specifies the\ncommon problems for ALG in various aspects.  In addition,
    some\ncollected feedbacks are also listed as the next steps to tackle these\nproblems.\n\t "

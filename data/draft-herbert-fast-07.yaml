  content: "   This document describes the Firewalls and Service Tickets (FAST)\n
    \  protocol.  This is a generic and extensible protocol for hosts to\n   signal
    network nodes to request services or to gain admission into a\n   network.  A
    ticket is data that accompanies a packet and indicates a\n   granted right to
    traverse a network or a request for network services\n   to be applied (in the
    latter case the ticket serves as a service\n   profile).  Applications request
    tickets from a local agent in their\n   network and attach issued tickets to packets.
    \ Firewall tickets are\n   issued to grant packets the right to traverse a network;
    service\n   tickets indicate the desired service to be applied to packets.  A\n
    \  single ticket may provide both firewall and service ticket\n   information
    and semantics.  Tickets are sent in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop\n   options.\n\n\t "

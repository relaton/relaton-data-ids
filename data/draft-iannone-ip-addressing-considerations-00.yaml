  script: Latn
  content: "   The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success\n
    \  in information technology of the last half century.  As the Internet\n   becomes
    pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for\n   many domain-specific
    solutions, but it also has been extended to\n   better fit the specificities of
    the different use cases.  For\n   Internet addressing in particular, as it is
    defined in RFC 791 for\n   IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively, there exist
    many\n   extensions.  Those extensions have been developed to evolve the\n   addressing
    capabilities beyond the basic properties of Internet\n   addressing.  This document
    proposes a set of use cases showcasing the\n   continuing need to extend the Internet
    addressing model and the\n   methods used for doing so.  It further outlines the
    properties of\n   Internet addressing as a baseline against which the extensions
    are\n   categorized in terms of methodology used to extend the addressing\n   model,
    together with examples of solutions doing so.\n\n   The most important aspect
    of the analysis and discussion in this\n   document is that it represents a snapshot
    of the discussion that took\n   place in the IETF (on various mailing lists and
    several meetings) in\n   the early 2020s.  While the community did not converge
    on specific\n   actions to be taken, the content of this document may nonetheless
    be\n   of use at some point in the future should the community decides so.\n\n\t "

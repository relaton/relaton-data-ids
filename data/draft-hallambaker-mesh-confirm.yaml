  content: "   Mesh Confirmation Protocol (Mesh/Confirm) is a three-party Web\n   Service
    that supports a transactional second factor confirmation\n   mechanism that provides
    a superset of the capabilities of traditional\n   second factor authentication
    schemes.  The three parties in the\n   protocol are Enquirer who posts a confirmation
    request, a Responder\n   who may or may not respond to the request and the Broker
    which\n   provides a repository to which requests and responses are posted.\n\n

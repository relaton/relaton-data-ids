  content: "This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for the
    purpose of supporting validation of assertions of \"right-of-use\" of Internet
    Number Resources (INRs).  The certificates issued under this profile are used
    to convey the issuer's authorization of the subject to be regarded as the current
    holder of a \"right-of-use\" of the INRs that are described in the certificate.
    \ This document contains the normative specification of Certificate and Certificate
    Revocation List (CRL) syntax in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
    \ This document also specifies profiles for the format of certificate requests
    and specifies the Relying Party RPKI certificate path validation procedure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

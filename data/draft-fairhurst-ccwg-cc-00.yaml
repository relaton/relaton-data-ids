  content: "   When published as an RFC, this document provides guidance on the\n
    \  design of methods to avoid congestion collapse and how an endpoint\n   needs
    to react to congestion.  The IETF provides recommendations and\n   requirements
    on this topic that is distributed across many documents\n   in the RFC series.
    \ This document therefore gathers and consolidates\n   these recommendations.
    \ Based on these, and Internet engineering\n   experience, the document provides
    best current practice for the\n   design of new congestion control methods in
    Internet protocols.\n\n   When published, the document will update or replace
    the Best Current\n   Practice in BCP 41, which currently includes \"Congestion
    Control\n   Principles\" provided in RFC2914.\n\n\t "

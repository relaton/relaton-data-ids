  content: "   Network Access Identifier (NAI) is an identifier used by access\n   networks
    for identifying users requesting access to the network.  A\n   user may access
    the network using more than one device, but all using\n   the same NAI and the
    associated credentials.  There are various use-\n   cases where an access network
    needs to unambiguously identify a\n   device used for accessing the network, and
    NAI is not sufficient for\n   such determination.\n\n   This document describes
    a device identifier structure and also\n   identifies the potential stable identifiers
    that are present on a\n   dual-radio device which can be used as a device identifiers.
    \ This\n   document also describes mechanisms where the device can generate\n
    \  device identifiers using cryptographic methods.  These generated\n   identifiers
    are transient in nature and are unique to a given access\n   network.  Device
    identifier is intended to be shared only with a\n   trusted access network which
    holds the user's network access\n   credentials and for which the identifier was
    generated.\n\n\t "

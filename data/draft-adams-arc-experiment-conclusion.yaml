  content: "   This document calls for a conclusion to the experiment defined by\n
    \  “The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) Protocol,” (RFC8617) and\n   recommends
    that ARC no longer be deployed or relied upon between\n   disparate senders and
    receivers.  The document summarizes what ARC\n   set out to do, reports on operational
    experience, and explains how\n   the experience gained during the experiment is
    being incorporated\n   into the proposed DKIM2 work as the successor to DomainKeys\n
    \  Identified Mail (DKIM).  To avoid any future confusion, it is\n   therefore
    requested that ARC (RFC8617) be marked “Obsolete” by the\n   publication of this
    Internet-Draft.\n\n\t "

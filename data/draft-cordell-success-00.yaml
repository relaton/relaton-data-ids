- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Currently in the Internet there are a number of call control protocols,
    each of them tailored to their own special applications.  This includes SDP for
    session announcement, SIP and SCIP for session invitation and Q.931 used in H.323.
    \ None of these is likely to be turned into a generic call control protocol.  Q.931
    is limited to point-to-point calls.  SDP and SIP do not include close down phases
    which are important if calls are being charged for on a timed basis or gateways
    are involved.  Nor do they support supplementary services such as transfer.  This
    proposal addresses these issues by defining a protocol based on a new conference
    control paradigm (referred to as the hello-hello paradigm) that can be used to
    create and control conferences from simple point-to-point calls, to large `broadcasts'
    and all call models in between.  Both real-time peer-to-peer conversational models
    and client-server streaming models are catered for in the protocol so that all
    forms of real-time stream can feature in a conference.\n\t "

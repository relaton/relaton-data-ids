  content: "   Modern security architectures assume that trust established at login\n
    \  can safely extend to all subsequent actions within a session.  This\n   assumption
    is fundamentally flawed.  Sessions preserve the memory of\n   authentication but
    not the certainty of authority.  Post-Session\n   Execution Assurance (PSEA) is
    an architectural security model that\n   addresses this gap by requiring cryptographic
    proof of real human\n   presence, device trust, and execution authority at the
    exact moment a\n   sensitive action is approved — independent of prior authentication
    or\n   session state.  This paper defines the PSEA model, its core\n   principles,
    its distinction from existing security paradigms, and its\n   implications for
    regulated and mission-critical systems.\n\n\t "

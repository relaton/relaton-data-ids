  content: "   This document describes a practical mechanism to implement IP fast\n
    \  reroute using dynamic SPF to compute local and remote loop free \n   nexthops
    efficiently. Upon link failure, all the destinations \n   reachable via the primary
    nexthop will be forwarded to alternative \n   loop free nexthop, if any. If the
    alternative nexthop is remote, \n   packet will be forwarded using any connectionless
    (for example,\n   IP-in-IP) or connection-oriented (for example, MPLS) tunnels.
    This \n   mechanism doesn't impose any new protocol message/capability \n   exchange.
    It is shown that simple changes to existing IGP shortest\n   path computation
    and routing table structures are sufficient to \n   achieve the desired functionality.
    More over, routers which \n   implement the proposed mechanism can co-exist and
    can be fully\n   backward compatible with existing unmodified routers.\n\t "

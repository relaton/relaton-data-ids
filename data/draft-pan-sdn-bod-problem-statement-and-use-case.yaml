  content: "   Bandwidth on Demand services are offered by network operators in\n
    \  industry and research sectors to support the needs of selected\n   customers
    needing high bandwidth point-to-point connections.\n\n   Without a standard interface
    for controlling the use of network\n   resources, user applications and services
    are subject to limits of\n   layering, security and interoperability across multiple
    vendors of\n   network equipment.\n\n   In this document, we argue the necessity
    in providing network\n   information to the applications, thereby enabling the
    applications\n   to directly provision network elements associated with the relevant\n
    \  applications.\n\n\t "

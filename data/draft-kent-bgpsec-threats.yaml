abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a threat model for BGP path security\n   (BGPSEC).
    BGPSEC is assumed to make use of the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI)
    already developed in the SIDR WG [I-D.ietf-\n   sidr-arch], and thus threats and
    attacks against the RPKI are part of\n   this model. The model assumes that BGP
    path security is achieved\n   through the application of digital signatures to
    AS_Path Info. The\n   document characterizes classes of potential adversaries
    that are\n   considered to be threats, and examines classes of attacks that might\n
    \  be launched against BGPSEC. It concludes with brief discussion of\n   residual
    vulnerabilities.\n\n\t "

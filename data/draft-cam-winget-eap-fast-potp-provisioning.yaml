  content: "EAP-FAST is an extensible EAP method that enables the provisioning of
    \n   credentials or other information by using the Transport Layer \n   Security
    (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel.  As the \n   tunnel may be
    unauthenticated, EAP-FAST further enables the use of \n   inner EAP methods to
    establish mutual authentication prior to \n   provisioning.  This document describes
    how EAP-POTP may be used as \n   the EAP-FAST inner method for credential provisioning.

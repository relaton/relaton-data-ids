  content: "   This document describes the architecture of remote service\n   installation
    and configuration in the provider's network through a\n   centralized management
    system.  This is a typical scenario for\n   virtual network function installation
    and dynamic configuration in\n   network function virtualization (NFV) context.
    \ It is also a typical\n   scenario in cloud computing environment where end users
    do not have\n   to install applications on their end hosts, but can install their
    own\n   featured powerful software application in the cloud.  This\n   specification
    describes an architecture of virtual network function\n   installation and configuration.
    \ It is also applicable to other use\n   cases with similar requirements.\n\n\t "

  content: "The discovery mechanism described here is built upon and coexists\nwith
    BOOTP according to RFC 1542 and DHCP according to RFC 2131 \nand RFC 3203.\nIt
    allows server-initiated communication to specific or all clients \nin the network,
    using the DHCP packet format and with that the\nrelay agent functionality. \nThe
    Discovery Extensons are a powerful and flexible add-on to \nclient-initiated DHCP
    that allow a variety of applications.\n\t "

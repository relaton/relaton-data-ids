  content: "   Traditional discrete logarithm-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange\n
    \  during the TLS handshake suffers from a number of security,\n   interoperability,
    and efficiency shortcomings.  These shortcomings\n   arise from lack of clarity
    about which DH group parameters TLS\n   servers should offer and clients should
    accept.  This document offers\n   a solution to these shortcomings for compatible
    peers by establishing\n   a registry of DH parameters with known structure and
    a mechanism for\n   peers to indicate support for these groups.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies EAP-PSK, an Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) method for mutual authentication and session key derivation using a Pre-Shared
    Key (PSK).  EAP-PSK provides a protected communication channel when mutual authentication
    is successful for both parties to communicate over.  This document describes the
    use of this channel only for protected exchange of result indications, but future
    EAP-PSK extensions may use the channel for other purposes.  EAP-PSK is designed
    for authentication over insecure networks such as IEEE 802.11.  This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

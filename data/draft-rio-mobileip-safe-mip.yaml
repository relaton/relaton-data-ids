  script: Latn
  content: "To date, a number of authentication protocols have been proposed for\nMobile-IP.
    Among these incompatible protocols, it is not clear\nuntil now which one will
    be the preferred one for global deployment\nof Mobile-IP. Based on the policy
    of allowing various protocols\nto co-exist, this draft specifies an authentication
    framework that\nallows Mobile-IP entities to negotiate for a protocol to be employed.\nThe
    framework also outlines the utilization of message extension\nfor carrying all
    information required by the authentication protocol\nbeing used.\nBased on the
    proposed framework, this draft then proposes a 'Minimal\nPublic Key Based Authentication'
    which addresses the need for\nscalable but lightweight authentication protocol.
    The proposed\nprotocol secures the registration process, and requires a number
    of\nmessage rounds that is fully compatible with the base Mobile-IP.\n\n\t "

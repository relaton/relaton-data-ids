  content: "IPv4 and IPv6 are expected to coexist for a long period.  Currently,\nthere
    are many IPv4/IPv6 transition/coexistence techniques, roughly\ndivided into the
    categories of tunneling and translation.  Tunneling\nand translation have respective
    application scopes, and translation\nhas some technical limitations, including
    scalability issue,\napplication layer translation, operation complexity, etc.
    \ To improve\nthe availability of translation, this draft proposes the method
    of\nselecting appropriate translation spot to execute translation.  When\nthe
    translation spot is not on IPv4-IPv6 border, tunnel is used to\nachieve the traversing
    between translation spot and IP border.  This\nmethod applies well in mesh scenario
    where both IPv4 and IPv6 client\nnetwork exists, and BGP can be extended to achieve
    a translation spot\nsignaling.\n\t "

  content: "The rapid growth of the Internet and the increasing number of Internet
    users have resulted in many scaling and growth problems with application designs
    focused on operations at the ends (i.e. the client or the server). This has led
    to a wide deployment of network edge caching proxies as a key strategy to address
    these problems. These systems have been very successful in accelerating Web content
    delivery and reducing the load on origin Web servers.  \n\n\t "

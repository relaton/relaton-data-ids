  content: "   [1588overMPLS] defines two methods for transporting PTP messages\n
    \  (PDUs) over an MPLS network.  The second method is to transport PTP\n   messages
    inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation.  When PHP is applied\n   to PTP LSP or
    the PW is etablished between two routers directly and\n   no PTP LSP is needed,
    PW label must be associated with PTP\n   application at the PW termination point.
    \ This document introduces a\n   mechanism to associate PW label with PTP application.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The MPLS source routing mechanism developed by Source Packet Routing\n
    \  in Networking (SPRING) WG can be leveraged to realize a unified\n   source
    routing instruction which works across both IPv4 and IPv6\n   underlays in addition
    to the MPLS underlay.  The unified source\n   routing instruction can be used
    to realize a transport-independent\n   service function chaining by encoding the
    service function path\n   information or service function chain information as
    an MPLS label\n   stack.  This document describes how to advertise service functions\n
    \  and their corresponding attributes (e.g., service function label)\n   using
    IS-IS.\n\n\t "

  content: "HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities\n
    \      than the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging from\n       distributed
    authoring, collaboration, and printing, to various remote        procedure call
    mechanisms. The Protocol Extension Protocol (PEP) is an\n       extension mechanism
    designed to address the tension between private\n       agreement and public specification
    and to accommodate extension of\n       applications such as HTTP clients, servers,
    and proxies. The PEP\n       mechanism is designed to associate each extension
    with a URI[2], and\n       use a few new RFC 822[1] derived header fields to carry
    the extension\n       identifier and related information between the parties involved
    in an\n       extended transaction.\n \n       This document defines PEP and describes
    the interactions between PEP\n       and HTTP/1.1[7]. PEP is intended to be compatible
    with HTTP/1.0[5]\n       inasmuch as HTTP/1.1 is compatible with HTTP/1.0 (see
    [7], section\n       19.7). It is proposed that the PEP extension mechanism be
    included in\n       future versions of HTTP.\n \n       The PEP extension mechanism
    may be applicable to other information\n       exchange not mentioned in this
    document. It is recommended that\n       readers get acquainted with section 1.4
    for a suggested reading of\n       this specification and a list of sections specific
    for HTTP based\n       applications.\n\t "

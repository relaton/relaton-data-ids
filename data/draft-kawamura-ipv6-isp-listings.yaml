  content: "There are many web sites that list IPv6 enabled service providers, or\nattempt
    to categorize the IPv6 capability of ISPs.  While these\nopinions are helpful,
    there is no standard criteria used by the\nsites, so it is difficult to compare
    the results.  This document\nsurveys current listings, and proposes a set of guidelines
    that could\nbe taken into consideration by theses sites, or by anyone looking
    to\nevaluate an ISP's IPv6 capability.  This guideline can also be used\nas a
    checklist by ISPs planning activation of IPv6 in their network.\n\t "

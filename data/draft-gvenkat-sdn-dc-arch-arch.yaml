  content: "   This draft describes a distributed Control Element for SDN\n   implementations.
    This document describes various complexities\n   associated with data-center management
    on adoption of new\n   technologies in data center networking. While Server vitalization,\n
    \  cloud computing have very much increased the networking complexities\n   while
    OpenFlow/SDN gives a different perspective which could provide\n   solution.  Network
    virtualisation is next thing in happening.\n   Traditional methods of managing
    each data-center element are\n   increasing management complexities. The key to
    reduce the management\n   complexity, and have automated infrastructure in very
    highly scaled\n   data center network is to have orthogonal management and control\n
    \  network to the Data network. A distributed CE yet with a single\n   manager
    orchestrating the networks will give much needed intelligence\n   to OF controller.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is standardized in ISO-3779\n
    \  and ISO-3780.  The VIN is made of 17 alphanumeric characters code\n   that
    uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide.  Some public\n   information related
    to a vehicle can be obtained knowing its VIN\n   code.  This code may also be
    used to enable novel vehicular\n   networking communications.\n\n   RFC 4193 introduces
    a globally unique IPv6 unicast address format\n   intended for local communications,
    usually inside of a site.  These\n   addresses (ULA) are not expected to be routable
    on the global\n   Internet.  This document introduces a method to build a VIN-based\n
    \  IPv6 Prefix that is intended for local communications involving more\n   than
    one hop (VULA).  The VIN-based generated prefix is assured to be\n   unique among
    other VIN-based generated prefixes.  Typically, in a\n   scenario involving several
    vehicles, each single vehicle (in which\n   one Mobile Router is in charge) is
    capable of generating its own\n   unique infrastructure-independent globally-scoped
    VIN-based IPv6\n   prefix.  This document also describes some use cases where
    VULA could\n   be exploited.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a Diameter authorization extension that is used
    \nfor the delivery of Service-Flow Charging Rules. These Service-Flow\nCharging
    Rules identify service flows that can be used within a \ncredit control environment
    for distinguishing individual packet flows \nfor which credit control applies.
    Multiple Service-Flows can be \nprovided which then enable independent rating
    of the individual packet \nflows. Service-Flows can be provided at authentication
    and may be \ndynamically updated throughout the lifetime of an AAA session.\n\t "

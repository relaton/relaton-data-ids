  content: "   In accompany with the migration of a Virtual Machine (VM), state\n
    \  associated with the VM located on the Hypervisors and the network\n   side
    devices (e.g., Firewalls) need to be updated in order to\n   guarantee that the
    services executed on the migrated VM will not be\n   disrupted.  VM vendors have
    their own ways to migrate VM's state on\n   Hypervisors, and so this is out the
    scope of this draft.This draft\n   introduces the background of state migration
    on network devices using\n   several application scenarios and tries to specify
    a clear scope for\n   the future standardization work on state migration on network\n
    \  devices.\n\n\t "

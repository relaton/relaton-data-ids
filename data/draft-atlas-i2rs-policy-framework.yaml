  content: "   A key aspect of the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) is what\n
    \  mechanisms it includes to carry policy information and to enable\n   policy
    control.  This applies both in the protocol itself and in the\n   services associated
    with the different components of the routing\n   system.  Similarly, the data-models
    associated with the services must\n   be capable of expressing the appropriate
    granularity for access and\n   authorization-related policy.  This document describes
    the policy\n   framework for I2RS.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes an extension to the IP multicast architecture now
    being developed by the IP over ATM working group, also known as MARS (Multicast
    Address Resolution Server).  In the extended architecture the determination whether
    a Multicast Server (MCS) or a point-to-multipoint VC will be used for multicasting
    is made by the application in the sender endpoint.  Moreover, there can be senders
    in a multicast group using point-to-multipoint VCs while other senders use a MCS.
    \                    It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the MARS document
    [MARS].\n\t "

  content: "   This document formulates a plan of a phased transition to a state\n
    \  where RPKI repositories and Relying Party software performing RPKI\n   Validation
    will use the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)\n   [RFC8182] as the preferred
    access protocol, and require rsync as a\n   fallback option only.\n\n   In phase
    0, today's deployment, RRDP is supported by most, but not\n   all Repositories,
    and most but not all RP software.\n\n   In the proposed phase 1 RRDP will become
    mandatory to implement for\n   Repositories, in addition to rsync.  This phase
    can start as soon as\n   this document is published.\n\n   Phase 2 will start
    once the proposed updates are implemented by all\n   compliant Repositories.  In
    this phase RRDP will become mandatory to\n   implement for all compliant RP software,
    and rsync will be required\n   as a fallback option only.\n\n   It should be noted
    that although this document currently includes\n   descriptions and updates to
    RFCs for each of these phases, we may\n   find that it will be beneficial to have
    one or more separate\n   documents for these phases, so that it might be more
    clear to all\n   when the updates to RFCs take effect.\n\n\t "

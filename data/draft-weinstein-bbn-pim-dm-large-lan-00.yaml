  script: Latn
  content: "   Optimizations to the PIM-DM protocol [RFC3973] are proposed that\n
    \  dramatically reduce the PIM-DM routing overhead on local area\n   networks
    containing large numbers of PIM routers.  These\n   optimizations reduce the likelihood
    of two or more routers emitting\n   redundant JOIN or PRUNE messages onto the
    same LAN.  While these\n   optimizations are of general applicability to large
    LANs, they were\n   motivated in particular by performance requirements for supporting\n
    \  PIM-DM across LANs emulated by IP tunneling over large wireless\n   MANETs.\n\n
    \  PIM-DM routers supporting these optimizations will interoperate with\n   standard
    PIM-DM as defined in RFC 3973, even on the same LAN.\n   However, to obtain maximum
    benefit from these optimizations, all\n   PIM-DM routers on the LAN SHOULD support
    them.\n\n\t "

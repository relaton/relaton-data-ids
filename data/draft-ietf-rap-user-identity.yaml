  content: "   This document describes the representation of user identity\n   information
    in POLICY_DATA object [POL-EXT] for supporting policy\n   based admission control
    in RSVP. The goal of identity representation\n   is to allow a process on a system
    to securely identify the owner of\n   the communicating process (e.g. user id)
    and convey this information\n   in RSVP requests (PATH or RESV) in a secure manner.
    We describe the\n   encoding of user identity as RSVP policy element. Subsequently,
    we\n   describe representations of user identities for Kerberos and Public\n   Key
    based user authentication mechanisms. In summary we describe the\n   use of this
    identity information in an operational setting.\n\n\t "

  content: "Where the source and/or destination node of an IPv6 communication is\nmulti-addressed,
    a mechanism is required for the initiating node to\nselect the most appropriate
    address pair for the communication.  RFC\n3484 (IPv6 Default Address Selection)
    [RFC3484] defines such a\nmechanism for nodes to perform source and destination
    address\nselection.  While RFC3484 recognised the need for implementations to\nbe
    able to change the policy table, it did not define how this could\nbe achieved.
    \ Requirements have now emerged for administrators to be\nable to dynamically
    change the RFC 3484 policy tables from a central\ncontrol point, and for nomadic
    hosts to be able to obtain the policy\nfor the network that they are currently
    attached to without manual\nuser intervention.  This text discusses considerations
    for such\npolicy changes, including examples of cases where a change of policy\nis
    required, and the likely frequency of such policy changes.  This\ntext also includes
    some discussion on the need to also update RFC\n3484, where default policies are
    currently defined.\n\t "

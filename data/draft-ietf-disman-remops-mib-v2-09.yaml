  content: "This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for performing ping,
    traceroute, and lookup operations at a host. When managing a network, it is useful
    to be able to initiate and retrieve the results of ping or traceroute operations
    when they are performed at a remote host. A lookup capability is defined in order
    to enable resolution of either an IP address to an DNS name or a DNS name to an
    IP address at a remote host.\n\n Currently, there are several enterprise-specific
    MIBs for performing remote ping or traceroute operations. The purpose of this
    memo is to define a standards-based solution to enable interoperability. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

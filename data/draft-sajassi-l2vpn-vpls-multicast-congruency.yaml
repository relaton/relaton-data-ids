  content: "   The current VPLS multicast proposals based on multicast tree has  \n
    \  several issues that are outlined in [BRIDGE-INTEROP]. These issues \n   stems
    from the divergence of the multicast and unicast paths for a \n   given VPLS instance
    in the MPLS/IP network. This draft describes a \n   mechanism for building multicast
    and unicast paths that are congruent \n   in order to address these issues.   \n\t "

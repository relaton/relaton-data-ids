abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   SIP Referred-By header field conveys the referrer identity of a\n   request.
    \ This header field may be used when exploding a SIP MESSAGE\n   or a SIP INVITE
    request to a pre-defined group URI and the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header field
    or From header field in the exploded\n   SIP requests needs to carry another value
    (e.g. the URI of a pre-\n   defined group, or a conference focus URI).  In those
    cases, the\n   Referred-By header field in the resulting exploded requests is
    set to\n   the P-Asserted-Identity or to the From header field value of the\n
    \  original SIP request received before exploding, so as to convey to\n   the
    receiver the identity of the original inviting sender.\n\n   RFC 3892 restricts
    the value of the header to only one SIP URI.\n   However the P-Asserted-Identity
    header field currently allows two URI\n   values and may be expanded in the future
    to carry more than two\n   values as described in RFC5876.  This document extends
    the\n   Referred-By definition to support more than one value as well.\n\n\t "

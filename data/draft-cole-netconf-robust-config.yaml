  content: "This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configuration\nmanagement
    protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to perform\nsets of active tests (i.e.,
    verification) against servers' running\nconfiguration over a period of time to
    afford the client and server a\nmore robust and resilient configuration management
    capability.  This\nis of value to commercial enterprise and public networks as
    well as\nwireless emergency and military networks.  We accomplish this through\nthe
    definition of the new verify.yang module.  Servers supporting\nthis module will
    advertise this capability according to the YANG\nspecification.  We also explore
    the future alternatives for\ndeveloping these capabilities within the context
    of the existing\nNETCONF protocol, the YANG modeling language and existing related\nIETF,
    IEEE and ITU-T standards.\n\t "

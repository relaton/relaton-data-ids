  content: "   In the design of interfaces to allow for the provisioning of network-\n
    \  based security functions (NSFs), a critical consideration is to\n   prevent
    the creation of implied constraints.\n\n   This draft makes the recommendation
    that such interfaces be designed\n   from the paradigm of processing packets on
    the network.  NSFs\n   ultimately are packet-processing engines that inspect packets\n
    \  traversing networks, either directly or in context to sessions to\n   which
    the packet is associated.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Twamp can be used to measure the performance of end-to-end paths in\n
    \  networks. Stamp [rfc8762] and twamp light are more lightweight\n   measurement
    methods. In the SRv6 network, it is also necessary to\n   measure the performance
    of SRv6 policy. This document describes a\n   method to measure srv6 policy through
    stamp and twamp light.\n\n\t "

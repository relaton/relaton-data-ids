  content: "   The EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) protocol defined a Well-\n
    \  Known URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): /.well-known/est.  EST also\n   defined
    several path components that clients use for PKI (Public Key\n   Infrastructure)
    services, namely certificate enrollment (e.g.,\n   /simpleenroll).  In some sense,
    the services provided by the path\n   components can be thought of as PKI management-related
    packages.\n   There are additional PKI-related packages a client might need as
    well\n   as other security-related packages, such as firmware, trust anchors,\n
    \  and symmetric, asymmetric, and encrypted keys.  This document also\n   specifies
    the PAL (Package Availability List), which is an XML\n   (Extensible Markup Language)
    file that clients use to retrieve\n   packages available and authorized for them.
    \ This document extends\n   the EST server path components to provide these additional
    services.\n\n\t "

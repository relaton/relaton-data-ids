  content: "This memo describes a syntax for securing messages sent using the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis for the World Wide Web. Secure
    HTTP (S-HTTP) provides independently applicable security services for transaction
    confidentiality, authenticity/integrity and non-repudiability of origin.\n\n The
    protocol emphasizes maximum flexibility in choice of key management mechanisms,
    security policies and cryptographic algorithms by supporting option negotiation
    between parties for each transaction.\n\t "

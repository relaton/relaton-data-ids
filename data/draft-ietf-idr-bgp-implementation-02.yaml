  content: "This document reports the results of the BGP-4 implementation survey.
    The survey had 259 questions about implementations' support of BGP-4 as specified
    in RFC 4271. After a brief summary of the results, each response is listed. This
    document contains responses from the four implementers that completed the survey
    (Alcatel, Cisco, Laurel, and NextHop) and brief information from three that did
    not (Avici, Data Connection Ltd., and Nokia).\n\n The editors did not use exterior
    means to verify the accuracy of the information submitted by the respondents.
    The respondents are experts with the products they reported on. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

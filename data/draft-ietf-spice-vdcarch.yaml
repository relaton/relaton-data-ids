    flows of digital credentials.  The architecture\n   introduces the concept of
    a presentation mediator as the active\n   component responsible for managing,
    presenting, and selectively\n   disclosing credentials while preserving a set
    of security and privacy\n   promises that will also be defined.\n\nDiscussion
    Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source

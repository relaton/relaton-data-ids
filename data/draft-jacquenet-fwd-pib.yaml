  content: "This draft specifies a set of Policy Rule Classes (PRC) for the\n   enforcement
    of an IP forwarding policy by network devices. Instances\n   of such classes reside
    in a virtual information store, which is\n   called the IP Forwarding Policy Information
    Base (PIB). The\n   corresponding IP forwarding policy provisioning data are intended
    for\n   use by a COPS-PR TE Client-Type, and they complement the PRC classes\n
    \  that have been defined in the Framework PIB.\n\t "

  content: "   Various protocols are deployed in today's networks, such as BGP /\n
    \  ISIS / OSPF etc.  Link neighbor state changes and protocol neighbor\n   state
    changes are the most important network events that need to be\n   processed with
    the highest priority.  In particular, the SDN\n   controller needs to quickly
    sense the link neighbor & protocol\n   neighbor state change information in the
    network.  Thus, the various\n   policies applied by the SDN controller to the
    network can quickly\n   match the current state of the network.  This document
    discusses some\n   possible scenarios and the relevant requirements.\n\n\n\t "

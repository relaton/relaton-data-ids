abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the trust concept and design of the SCION _control-plane
    PKI_, SCION's public key infrastructure model. SCION (Scalability, Control, and
    Isolation On Next-generation networks) is a path-aware, inter-domain network architecture.
    The control-plane PKI, or short CP-PKI, handles cryptographic material and lays
    the foundation for the authentication procedures in SCION. It is used by SCION's
    control plane to authenticate and verify path information, and builds the basis
    for SCION's special trust model based on so- called Isolation Domains. The document
    first describes the trust model behind SCION's control- plane PKI, and provides
    a short overview of the certificates, keys, and roles involved. It then continues
    with detailed specifications of the building blocks of SCION's control-plane PKI.
    The document concludes with several considerations in regard to deploying the
    control-plane PKI.</p>"

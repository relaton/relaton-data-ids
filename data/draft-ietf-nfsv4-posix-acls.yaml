abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes four new optional file attributes for NFSv4.2
    to support POSIX ACLs conforming to the withdrawn POSIX 1003.1e draft 17. Although
    never ratified, POSIX ACLs are implemented in widely deployed operating systems.
    Existing attempts to map between NFSv4 and POSIX ACL models have been unsuccessful
    due to semantic incompatibilities. These new attributes allow servers to expose
    POSIX ACLs directly, avoiding lossy mapping.</p>"

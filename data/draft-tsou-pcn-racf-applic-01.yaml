  content: "This document is written to help coordinate work on pre-congestion\nnotification
    (PCN) between the IETF PCN Working Group and the ITU-T.\nIt maps the use of PCN
    into the ITU-T transport control architecture.\nIt examines three scenarios, showing
    in each, where new requirements\nare placed on the ITU-T architecture.  In each
    case, the ITU-T\nfunctional entity known as the Transport Resource Control Functional\nEntity
    (TRC-FE) is seen as the logical destination for PCN congestion\nreports and PCN
    flow termination reports, which it uses to keep track\nof network status.  As
    logical entities, instances of the TRC-FE can\nbe present in the ingress nodes,
    in one or more centralized devices,\nor in both.  These alternatives define the
    scenarios examined.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an experimentally deployed approach currently\n
    \  used within the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (WLCG)\n   to
    mark packets with their project (experiment) and application.  The\n   marking
    uses the 20-bit IPv6 Flow Label in each packet, with 15 bits\n   used for semantics
    (community and activity) and 5 bits for entropy.\n   Alternatives, in particular
    use of IPv6 Extension Headers (EH), were\n   considered but found to not be practical.
    \ The WLCG is one of the\n   largest worldwide research communities and has adopted
    IPv6 heavily\n   for movement of many hundreds of PB of data annually, with the\n
    \  ultimate goal of running IPv6 only.\n\n\t "

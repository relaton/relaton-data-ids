  content: "This document proposes a new architecture for providing an enhanced way\nof
    fragmenting PPP protocol frames which is self-scalable to operate\nover a wide
    range of multiple links ranging from low-bitrate, sub-T1\nline to very high speed
    SDH hierarchy. The scheme provides a relatively\nlow overhead for fragmentation
    procedure and can scale very well to\naccommodate multiple and diverse types of
    communication links operating\nat different speed. In addition, the generated
    data fragments are\ndistributed to the multiple communication links according
    to their QoS\nthat maximize the real time utilization of the links.\n\nThis proposal
    is not intended to limit the scope of functions and\nprocedures described in RFC
    1990[1]. This proposal solicits a new type\nof fragmentation procedure that can
    be used along with other functions\nand features described in the RFC 1990.\n\n\t "

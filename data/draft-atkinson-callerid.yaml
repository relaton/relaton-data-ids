- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "  When e-mail is handed off today from one organization to another, \n
    \ as a rule no authentication of the sender of the e-mail or the \n  computers
    delivering it on the sender’s behalf takes place. There \n  are some simple steps
    which can be taken to significantly alleviate \n  this problem, steps which mimic
    within the e-mail infrastructure \n  the caller ID mechanism found in today’s
    telephone system. This \n  proposal specifies that in addition to today’s practice
    of \n  publishing in DNS the addresses of their incoming mail servers, \n  administrators
    of domains also publish the addresses of their \n  outgoing mail servers, the
    addresses of the computers from which \n  mail legitimately originating from that
    domain will be sent. This \n  information will then be used in enhancements to
    software that \n  receives incoming mail to verify that computers handing off
    a \n  message to them in fact are authorized to do so by the legitimate \n  administrator
    of the domain from which the message is purported to \n  have been sent. \n\t "

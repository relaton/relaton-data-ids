  content: "Two solutions are presented to show how to use Dual-Stack Lite\ntransition
    technique in mobile networks: one for Proxy Mobile IPv6\nand the other for Dual-Stack
    Mobile IPv6.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows\nIPv4 nodes to receive mobility services
    using an IPv4 home address.\nMobile node can have IPv4 only operation by sending
    IPv4 datagrams\nwhich are encapsulated by the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) at the
    DS-\nlite home router and and tunneled to Local Mobility Anchor (LMA)\nwhich is
    also DS-lite carrier-grade Network Address Translator (NAT).\nIn case of client
    based mobility using DSMIPv6, mobile node is a\ndual-stack node and it can receive
    an IPv4 home address from the home\nagent which is co-located with DS-lite carrier-grade
    NAT.  Mobile\nnode (MN) encapsulates IPv4 datagrams in IPv6 which are decapsulated\nat
    the home agent (HA).  Mobile network could be WiMAX network or\n3GPP Long Term
    Evolution network.\n\t "

  content: "This document provides recommendations to the addressing registries (APNIC,
    ARIN and RIPE-NCC) on policies for assigning IPv6 address blocks to end sites.
    \ In particular, it recommends the assignment of /48 in the general case, /64
    when it is known that one and only one subnet is needed and /128 when it is absolutely
    known that one and only one device is connecting.\n\t "

  content: "We propose a diff-serv per hop behavior (PHB) for the transport\nof non-real
    time traffic with a guaranteed rate (GR). This\nproposal is based on principles
    developed for the specification\nof the Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR) service category
    currently\nbeing specified for ATM [TM5]. It is shown that a diff-serv\nnetwork
    using the GR PHB together with a explicit routing\ncapability can support edge-to-edge
    guaranteed rate service.\nInterconnection of diff-serv networks deploying GR to
    achieve\nend-to-end service and interworking with ATM's GFR service are\nalso
    discussed.\n\n\t "

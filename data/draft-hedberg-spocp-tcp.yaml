  content: "\n   The SPOCP protocol has been described in [SPOCP]. The description
    is\n   done in general terms and is not done in such a way that implementers\n
    \  can directly implement the protocol. To make that possible there has\n   to
    be a mapping defined between the more abstract description and a\n   bits on the
    wire description. This document represents one possible\n   mapping.\n\n\t "

  content: "   NSIS state management needs to track data path changes and update the\n
    \  states along the affected data paths.  However, in certain scenarios,\n   there
    are multiple concurrent paths involved in the communication.\n   In this case,
    the normal NSIS scheme does not provide sufficient\n   support for the state manipulation.
    \ Therefore, extra functionality\n   for data path identification and distinction
    is necessary.  In\n   current Internet, with the increasing use of multi-homing
    devices and\n   the employment of Mobile IP, the above issue is getting more\n
    \  prominent.  This draft discusses in detail the problems and issues\n   involved
    in the NSIS state management relevant to the data path\n   differentiation.  Specific
    scenarios for multi-homing and Mobile IP\n   route optimization are studied.  Potential
    solution and its impacts\n   on current NSIS protocol design are discussed as
    well.\n\t "

  content: "In a distributed, constraint-based routing environment, the\ninformation
    used to compute a path may be out of date. This means\nthat Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) label switched path (LSP)\nsetup requests may be blocked by links
    or nodes without sufficient\nresources. Crankback is a scheme whereby setup failure
    information is\nreturned from the point of failure to allow new setup attempts
    to be\nmade avoiding the blocked resources. Crankback can also be applied to\nLSP
    restoration to indicate the location of the failed link or node.\n\nThis document
    specifies crankback signaling extensions for use in\nMPLS signaling using RSVP-TE
    as defined in 'RSVP-TE: Extensions to\nRSVP for LSP Tunnels', RFC3209, so that
    the LSP setup request can be\nretried on an alternate path that detours around
    blocked links or\nnodes. This offers significant improvements in the successful
    setup\nand recovery ratios for LSPs, especially in situations where a large\nnumber
    of setup requests are triggered at the same time.\n\n\t "

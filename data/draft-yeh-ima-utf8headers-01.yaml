  content: "Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the\n   capability
    to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected\n   information in specific
    header fields, and to use international\n   characters in envelope addresses.
    \ It also requires being able to\n   express those addresses and information based
    on them in mail header\n   fields.  This document specifies the use of Unicode
    encoded in UTF-8,\n   rather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header
    fields.\n   This form is permitted in transmission only if authorized by an SMTP\n
    \  extension, as specified in an associated specification.\n\t "

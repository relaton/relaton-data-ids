  script: Latn
  content: "All IPv6 nodes must be able to process Routing Header [IPV6] and Home\nAddress
    [MIPV6] Options.  With these, packet filter access lists can\nbe tricked (among
    other things) as the destination and source\naddresses, respectively, are being
    rewritten as the packet traverses\nthe network.  Some of the security considerations
    of these features\nare analyzed, and a few possible solutions presented.  It will
    be\nshown that with the current architecture, the network-based security\ndoes
    not seem to scale to the requirements of Mobile IPv6; it seems\npossible that
    unless security is taken seriously when implementing\nthe nodes, the new Mobile
    IPv6 requirements might not be allowed to\nbe used at all in some circumstances.\n\t "

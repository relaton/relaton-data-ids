abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   AAA servers are in use within the Internet today to provide\n   authentication
    and authorization services for dial-up computers.\n   Such services are likely
    to be equally valuable for mobile nodes\n   using Mobile IP when the nodes are
    attempting to connect to foreign\n   domains with AAA servers.  AAA servers today
    identify clients by\n   using the Network Access Identifier (NAI).  Our proposal
    defines a\n   way for the mobile node to identify itself, by including the NAI\n
    \  along with the Mobile IP Registration Request.  This memo also\n\n\n   updates
    RFC 2290 which specifies the Mobile-IPv4 Configuration option\n   for IPCP, by
    allowing the Mobile Node's Home Address field of this\n   option to be zero and
    specifying a comprehensive procedure for\n   achieving a NAI-based home address
    assignment and more particularly,\n   the Home Agent and Mobile Node behaviors
    including the error recovery\n   mechanisms for various scenarios related to NAI-based
    home address\n   assignment.\n\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Static Artifact Exchange (SAE) protocol,
    an asynchronous protocol for exchanging cryptographic artifacts between two parties
    via a shared, stateless repository. SAE uses a pull-only communication model where
    peers poll for the presence of immutable, pre-computed artifacts to coordinate
    a sequenced exchange. By design, this static artifact model avoids dynamic request
    processing, reducing common attack surfaces like injection and parser vulnerabilities.
    The protocol is transport-agnostic, allowing each party to access the repository
    using different underlying mechanisms (e.g., cloud APIs or standard HTTPS). SAE
    is intended as a foundational transport pattern for protocols like Ephemeral Compute
    Attestation (ECA), which require a secure, minimal channel where trust is derived
    from the cryptographic content of the artifacts, not from the channel itself.</p>"

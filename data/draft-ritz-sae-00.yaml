  content: "   This document specifies the Static Artifact Exchange (SAE) protocol,\n
    \  an asynchronous protocol for exchanging cryptographic artifacts\n   between
    two parties via a shared, stateless repository.  SAE uses a\n   pull-only communication
    model where peers poll for the presence of\n   immutable, pre-computed artifacts
    to coordinate a sequenced exchange.\n   By design, this static artifact model
    avoids dynamic request\n   processing, reducing common attack surfaces like injection
    and parser\n   vulnerabilities.  The protocol is transport-agnostic, allowing
    each\n   party to access the repository using different underlying mechanisms\n
    \  (e.g., cloud APIs or standard HTTPS).  SAE is intended as a\n   foundational
    transport pattern for protocols like Ephemeral Compute\n   Attestation (ECA),
    which require a secure, minimal channel where\n   trust is derived from the cryptographic
    content of the artifacts, not\n   from the channel itself.\n\n\t "

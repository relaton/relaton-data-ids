  content: "   The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in network management\n
    \  (NM) solutions is becoming a reality.  It is mainly supported by the\n   need
    to resolve complex problems arisen from the acceptance of SDN/\n   NFV technologies
    as well as network slicing.  Thus, the AINEMA\n   framework, as discussed in this
    document, is required to keep focus\n   and organize the efforts on applying AI
    to NM.  This is enlarged by\n   the inclusion of external events in NM operations
    as well as the\n   consideration of a full intelligence process instead of simple
    AI-\n   based guesses.  Such process will be highly based in reasoning and\n   formal
    and target-based intelligence analysis and decision.  This\n   will allow computer
    and network system infrastructures to grow in\n   complexity.  The same applies
    to user demands.  The construction and\n   maintenance of AINEMA requires a comprehensive
    inclusion of several\n   mechanisms.  For instance, although there has been a
    lot of effort to\n   make Machine Learning (ML) solutions reliable and acceptable,
    other\n   mechanisms have been forgotten.  It is the particular case of\n   reasoning,
    which is the key within AINEMA.  It will provide enormous\n   benefits to NM solutions
    by, for example, inferring new knowledge and\n   applying different kind of rules
    (e.g. logical) to choose from\n   several actions.  While ML solutions work with
    data, so their only\n   requirement from the network infrastructure is data retrieval,
    AINEMA\n   will work in collaboration to the network it is managing.  This makes\n
    \  the challenges arisen from intelligent reasoning essential for the\n   evolution
    of NM.  They will be addressed within the context of\n   AINEMA.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Message Disposition Notification (MDN) facility defined in RFC 2298
    provides a means by which a message can request that message processing by the
    recipient be acknowledged as well as a format to be used for such acknowledgements.
    \ However, it doesn't describe how multiple Mail User Agents (MUAs) should handle
    the generation of MDNs in an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP4) environment.
    \ This document describes how to handle MDNs in such an environment and provides
    guidelines for implementers of IMAP4 that want to add MDN support to their products.

  content: "   This document presents a Fast Reroute (FRR) approach aimed at\n   providing
    link and node protection of node and adjacency segments\n   within the Segment
    Routing (SR) framework.  This FRR behavior builds\n   on proven IP-FRR concepts
    being LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote\n   LFAs with directed forwarding (DLFA).
    \ It extends these concepts to\n   provide guaranteed coverage in any IGP network.
    \ We accommodate the\n   FRR discovery and selection approaches in order to establish\n
    \  protection over post-convergence paths from the point of local\n   repair,
    dramatically reducing the operator's need to control the tie-\n   breaks among
    various FRR options.\n\n\t "

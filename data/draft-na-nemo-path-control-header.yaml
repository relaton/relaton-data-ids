  content: "In this memo, we propose a unified Route Optimization (RO) scheme \nthat
    can solve several types of RO problem by using Path Control \nHeader (PCH) Piggybacking.
    In our scheme, Home Agent (HA) does \npiggyback the PCH on the packet which is
    reversely forwarded from \nMobile Router (MR). That enables any PCH-aware routing
    facility on\nthe route to make a RO tunnel with MR using the Care-of address of
    \nMR contained in the PCH. By applying to some already known NEMO RO \nproblems,
    we show that our scheme can incrementally optimize the \nroutes via default HA-MR
    tunnel through the simple PCH \ninterpretation. \n\t "

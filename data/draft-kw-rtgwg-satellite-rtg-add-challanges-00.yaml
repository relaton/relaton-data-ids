  content: "   Future networks, including the Internet, will utilize an increasing\n
    \  amount of space-based transport infrastructure. Control and\n   transport between
    Earth-based and space-based networks present\n   several problems - high dynamicity,
    spatial connectivity, continual\n   movement tracking and prediction, ocular obstruction,
    integration\n   with existing Internet infrastructure, all of which challenge\n
    \  existing architectures, routing mechanisms and addressing schemes.\n\n   This
    document summerises near-to-mid-term space-networking problems;\n   it outlines
    the key components, challenges, and requirements for\n   integrating future space-based
    network infrastructure with existing\n   networks and mechanisms. Furthermore,
    this document highlights the\n   network control and transport interconnection,
    and identify the\n   resources and functions required for successful interconnection
    of\n   space-based and Earth-based Internet infrastructure.\n\n\t "

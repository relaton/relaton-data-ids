  content: "   The physical separation of the LAC and LNS with L2TP[2] and logical\n
    \  separation of the responsibilities of each with respect to negotiated\n   link
    parameters introduces a lack of awareness between the tunnel\n   endpoints that
    does not exist in a typical PPP dialup device. When\n   possible, Proxy LCP provides
    a manner in which to negotiate link\n   parameters at the LAC and communication
    of these in full to the LNS.\n   If these options can be made acceptable to the
    LNS, then there should\n   not be any insurmountable difficulty with regard to
    mismatch of link\n   expectations. However, given that there are instances where\n
    \  negotiation of LCP[1] must take place at the LNS, some direction by\n   the
    LAC as to what parameters are acceptable, as well as some\n   communication from
    the LNS as to what parameters have been\n   negotiated, is desirable.\n\n\t "

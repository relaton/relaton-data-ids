  content: "   In a virtual RBridge(RBv), traffic from end station ES1 to ES2 will\n
    \  enter a TRILL campus through one member RBridge RB1 of RBv, but\n   reverse
    traffic might choose another member RBridge RB2 to leave\n   TRILL campus.  If
    RB1 can't obtain the location of ES2 via other\n   means, it has to treat the
    traffic to ES2 as unknown destination\n   traffic and multicasts it in TRILL campus.
    \ However, if RB2 can share\n   its learned MAC addresses with RB1, the above
    problem can be\n   resolved.\n\n   Based on appropriate extensions of ESADI, this
    document proposes, in\n   control plane, an approach for informations synchronization
    within a\n   group of RBridges.  Current informations mainly include end station\n
    \  addresses, but may include other informations in the future.\n\n\t "

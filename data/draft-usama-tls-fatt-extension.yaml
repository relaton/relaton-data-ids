abstract:
- content: "<p>This document applies only to non-trivial extensions of TLS, which
    require formal analysis. It proposes the authors provide a threat model and informal
    security goals in the Security Considerations section, and a protocol diagram
    in the draft. We also briefly present a few pain points of the one doing the formal
    analysis which require refining the process: * Contacting FATT * Understanding
    the opposing goals * No response from some authors * Slots at meeting</p>"

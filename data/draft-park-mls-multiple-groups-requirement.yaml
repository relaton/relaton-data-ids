  content: "   This document proposes a functional requirement of Message Level\n
    \  Security (MLS) which provide an efficient management for multiple\n   groups.
    \ Although MLS defines an architecture and an abstract\n   protocol for a secure
    group communication, it overlooks the need of\n   multiple groups.  This document
    describes a usecase of the multiple\n   groups, and the need for an efficient
    multiple group membership\n   management.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the architectural model and core protocol behaviors
    for the Artificial Intelligence Internet Protocol (AIIP). AIIP provides a uniform
    way for agents, robots, tools, models, and services to be addressed and invoked
    either natively or through an HTTPS gateway. Beyond addressing, AIIP defines a
    _stateless compute_ profile in which endpoints do not retain caller data and each
    invocation returns a signed _execution receipt_. Receipts are REQUIRED to be attested
    with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) evidence and MAY additionally include
    zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Receipts MAY also be anchored to external settlement
    systems without exposing user data.</p>"

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a mechanism to extend the record header in\n
    \  DTLS.  To that aim, the DTLS header is modified as follows: the\n   length
    field is trimmed to 15 bits, and the length's top bit is given\n   the \"record
    header extension indicator\" semantics, allowing a sender\n   to signal that one
    or more record header extensions have been added\n   to this record.  We define
    the generic format of a record header\n   extension and the general rules associated
    with its handling.  Any\n   details regarding syntax, semantics and negotiation
    of a specific\n   record header extension, are left to future documents.\n\n\t "

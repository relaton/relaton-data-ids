  content: "   This document is derived from the architecture and detailed functions\n
    \  of SDAF.  It is a network function to perform a security analysis and\n   provide
    analysis results in a 5G system with a service-based\n   architecture (SBA).  To
    this end, the concept of SDAF, the structure\n   of internalizing the 5G system,
    and the communication interface used\n   by SDAF are defined.  It also defines
    the use cases that can utilize\n   SDAF.  This standard is based on the service
    and operation\n   requirements for a 5G system with SBA.\n\n\t "

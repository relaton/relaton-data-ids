abstract:
- content: "<p>The CoAP standard is fast emerging as a key protocol in the area of
    resource-constrained devices. Such IP-based systems are foreseen to be used for
    building and lighting automation systems where devices interconnect with each
    other, forming, for example, low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). Both multicast
    and its security are key needs in these networks. This draft presents a method
    for securing IPv6 multicast communication based on the DTLS which is already supported
    for unicast communication for CoAP devices. This draft deals with the adaptation
    of the DTLS record layer to protect multicast group communication, assuming that
    all group members already have the group security association parameters in their
    possession. The adapted DTLS record layer provides message confidentiality, integrity
    and replay protection to group messages using the group keying material before
    sending the message via IPv6 multicast to the group.</p>"

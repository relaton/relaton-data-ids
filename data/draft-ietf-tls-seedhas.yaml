  content: "This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS\nprotocol
    1.0 [TLS] to support SEED and HAS-160.\nThe SEED algorithm is 128-bit symmetric
    block cipher algorithm.\n[SEED] The HAS-160 is 160-bit secure hash function, whose
    block size\nis 512 bit. [HAS] Both algorithms are developed in Korea since 1997\nfor
    stronger communication security.  Currently, SEED is widely used\nand is the mandatory
    cipher in banking and stock applications in\nKorea.\n\t "

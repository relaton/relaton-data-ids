  content: "The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a simple interface for running external
    programs, software or gateways under an information server in a platform-independent
    manner. Currently, the supported information servers are HTTP servers.\n\n The
    interface has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) since 1993. This specification
    defines the 'current practice' parameters of the 'CGI/1.1' interface developed
    and documented at the U.S. National Centre for Supercomputing Applications. This
    document also defines the use of the CGI/1.1 interface on UNIX(R) and other, similar
    systems. This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

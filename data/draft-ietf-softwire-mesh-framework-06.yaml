  content: "The Internet needs to be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  However,
    it is expected that some constituent networks of the Internet will be \"single-protocol\"
    networks.  One kind of single-protocol network can parse only IPv4 packets and
    can process only IPv4 routing information; another kind can parse only IPv6 packets
    and can process only IPv6 routing information.  It is nevertheless required that
    either kind of single-protocol network be able to provide transit service for
    the \"other\" protocol.  This is done by passing the \"other kind\" of routing
    information from one edge of the single-protocol network to the other, and by
    tunneling the \"other kind\" of data packet from one edge to the other.  The tunnels
    are known as \"softwires\".  This framework document explains how the routing
    information and the data packets of one protocol are passed through a single-protocol
    network of the other protocol.  The document is careful to specify when this can
    be done with existing technology and when it requires the development of new or
    modified technology. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

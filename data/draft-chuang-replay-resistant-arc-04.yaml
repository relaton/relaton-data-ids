  script: Latn
  content: "   DKIM [RFC6376] is an IETF standard for the cryptographic protocol to\n
    \  authenticate email at the domain level and protect the integrity of\n   messages
    during transit.  Section 8.6 (https://www.rfc-\n   editor.org/rfc/rfc6376.html#section-8.6)
    defines a vulnerability\n   called DKIM Replay as a spam message sent through
    a SMTP MTA DKIM\n   signer, that then is sent to many more recipients, leveraging
    the\n   reputation of the signer.  We propose two Replay Resistant\n   cryptographic
    domain based protocols that leverage ARC [RFC8617].\n   The first technique discloses
    all SMTP recipients as signed RFC822\n   headers by the sender which allows a
    receiver to verify this.  The\n   second technique defines a SMTP extension that
    allows both the sender\n   and receiver to participate in signing the message
    signature.  It\n   includes a path building technique that accurately defines
    the SMTP\n   forwarding path of the message.  Both techniques permit a receiver
    to\n   detect DKIM and ARC replay attacks and other attacks.  This\n   specification
    also defines a relay flow identifier to prevent\n   spammers from using relay
    forwarding, We do this by having relays\n   categorize their authenticated traffic
    flows and publish to receivers\n   identifiers associated with those flows.  Receivers
    can use this\n   identifier to help categorize traffic through the relay and use
    that\n   identifier to apply fine-grain anti-abuse policies instead of on the\n
    \  entire traffic through the relay.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] is designed to monitor\n
    \  BGP [RFC4271] running status, such as BGP peer relationship\n   establishment
    and termination and route updates.  At present, the BMP\n   only monitors the
    incoming bgp routes (Adj-RIB-In), does not monitor\n   the outgoing bgp routes
    (Adj-RIB-Out).\n\n   This draft extends the applicability of BMP [RFC7854] to
    monitor the\n   outgoing bgp routes.\n\n\n\t "

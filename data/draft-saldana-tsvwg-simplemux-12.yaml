  content: "   The high amount of small packets present in nowaday's networks\n   results
    in a low efficiency, as the size of both the headers and the\n   payload in these
    packets can be comparably large, often falling\n   within the same order of magnitude.
    \ In some situations, multiplexing\n   (i.e. aggregating) a number of small packets
    into a bigger one is\n   desirable to improve the efficiency.  For example, a
    number of small\n   packets can be sent together between a pair of machines if
    they share\n   a common network path.  This may happen between machines in different\n
    \  locations or even inside a datacenter with a number of servers\n   hosting
    virtual machines.  The traffic profile can be shifted from\n   small to larger
    packets, thus reducing the network overhead and the\n   number of packets per
    second to be managed by intermediate devices.\n\n   This document describes Simplemux,
    a protocol able to encapsulate a\n   number of packets belonging to different
    protocols into a single\n   packet.  Small headers (separators) are added at the
    beginning of\n   each multiplexed packet, including some flags, the packet length
    and\n   a \"Protocol\" field.  The presence of this \"Protocol\" field allows
    it\n   to aggregate packets belonging to any protocol (the \"multiplexed\n   packets\"),
    in a single packet belonging to other (or the same)\n   protocol (the \"tunneling
    protocol\").\n\n   To reduce the overhead, the size of the multiplexing headers
    is kept\n   very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing packets of small\n
    \  size).\n\n\t "

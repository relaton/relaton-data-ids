  content: "   In the SRv6 network, the headend node could use Ping (ICMPv6 Echo)\n
    \  to detect the connectivity of the SRv6 path to implement path\n   switching.
    When a headend use Ping to detect the segment list/CPath\n   of SRv6 Policy, the
    forward path of ICMPv6 Echo Request message is\n   indicated by segment list,
    the reverse path of ICMPv6 Echo Reply\n   message is via the shortest path from
    the destination node to the\n   source as determined by routing. The forward path
    and reverse path\n   of ICMPv6 message are likely inconsistent going through different\n
    \  intermediate nodes or links. This document describes how to ensure\n   the
    consistency of the forward path and the reverse path when using\n   ICMPv6 Echo
    messages to detect SRv6 Policy.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Pairing is a special map from two elliptic curve that called Pairing-\n
    \  friend curves to a finite field and is useful mathematical tools for\n   constructing
    cryptographic primitives.  It allows us to construct\n   powerful primitives.
    (e.g. [3] and [4])\n\n   There are some types of pairing and its choice has an
    impact on the\n   performance of the primitive.  For example, Tate Pairing [3]
    and Ate\n   Pairing [4] are specified in IETF.  This memo focuses on Optimal Ate\n
    \  Pairing [2] which is an improvement of Ate Pairing.\n\n   This memo defines
    Optimal Ate Pairing for any pairing-friendly curve.\n   We can obtain concrete
    algorithm by deciding parameters and building\n   blocks based on the form of
    a curve and the description in this memo.\n   It enables us to reduce the cost
    for specifying Optimal Ate Pairing\n   over additional curves.  Furthermore, this
    memo provides concrete\n   algorithm for Optimal Ate Pairing over BN-curves [7]
    and its test\n   vectors.\n\n\t "

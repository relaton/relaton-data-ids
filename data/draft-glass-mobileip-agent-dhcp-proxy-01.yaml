  content: "Since the inclusion of the Network Access Identifier (NAIs) into\nthe
    mobile ip fabric, home agents have had a way to identify mobile\nnodes which do
    not have home IP addresses.  After authenticating the\nregistration request from
    such a mobile node, the home agent is then\nexpected to assign a home addresses
    to the mobile node in the\nregistration reply to be used on a semi-permanent basis.\nUnfortunately,
    no specific mechanism has yet been proposed.  Ideally,\nas DHCP centralizes address
    management, a home agent should contact a\nDHCP server to allocate an address
    for the mobile node, thereby\npreserving DHCP as the central address maintainer.
    \ The technology\ndoes exist for a Home Agent to use DHCP controlled addresses,
    namely\nfor the Home Agent to behave as a DHCP proxy agent.\n\t "

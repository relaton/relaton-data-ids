- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A highly spam resistant protocol is shown, which could be implemented\n
    \  for negligible costs.  Accepted email's do the sender not cost money,\n   not
    accepted ones do.  A decentralized server for keeping track of\n   money and information
    is needed.  The protocol, in which encryption\n   naturally appears and can be
    used transparently aside of the existing\n   mail protocol, allows to freely distribute
    your emailadress.  The\n   protocol avoids the micro payment problem.\n\t "

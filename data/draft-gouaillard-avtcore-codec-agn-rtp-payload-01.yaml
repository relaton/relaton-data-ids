  content: "   RTP Media Chains usually rely on piping encoder output directly to\n
    \  packetizers.  Media packetization formats often support a specific\n   codec
    format and optimize RTP packets generation accordingly.\n\n   With the development
    of Selective Forward Unit (SFU) solutions, that\n   do not process media content
    server side, the need for media content\n   processing at the origin and at the
    destination has arised.\n\n   RTP Media Chains used e.g. in WebRTC solutions are
    increasingly\n   relying on application-specific transforms that sit in-between\n
    \  encoder and packetizer on one end and in-between depacketizer and\n   decoder
    on the other end.  This use case has become so important,\n   that the W3C is
    standardizing the capacity to access encoded content\n   with the [WebRTCInsertableStreams]
    API proposal.  An extremely\n   popular use case is application level end-to-end
    encryption of media\n   content, using for instance [SFrame].\n\n   Whatever the
    modification applied to the media content, RTP\n   packetizers can no longer expect
    to use packetization formats that\n   mandate media content to be in a specific
    codec format.\n\n   In the extreme cases like encryption, where the RTP Payload
    is made\n   completely opaque to the SFUs, some extra mechanism must also be\n
    \  added for them to be able to route the packets without depending on\n   RTP
    payload or payload headers.\n\n   The traditionnal process of creating a new RTP
    Payload specification\n   per content would not be practical as we would need
    to make a new one\n   for each codec-transform pair.\n\n   This document describes
    a solution, which provides the following\n   features in the case the encoded
    content has been modified before\n   reaching the packetizer: - a paylaod agnostic
    RTP packetization\n   format that can be used on any media content, - a negotiation\n
    \  mechanism for the above format and the inner payload, Both of the\n   above
    mechanism are backward compatible with most of (S)RTP/RTCP\n   mechanisms used
    for bandwidth estimation and congestion control in\n   RTP/SRTP/webrtc, including
    but not limited to SSRC, RED, FEC, RTX,\n   NACK, SR/RR, REMB, transport-wide-CC,
    TMBR, .... It as illustrated by\n   existing implementations in chrome, safari,
    and Medooze.\n\n   This document also describes a solution to allow SFUs to continue\n
    \  performing packet routing on top of this generic RTP packetization\n   format.\n\n
    \  This document complements the SFrame (media encryption), and\n   Dependency
    Descriptor (AV1 payload annex) documents to provide an\n   End-to-End-Encryption
    solution that would sit on top of SRTP/Webrtc,\n   use SFUs on the media back-end,
    and leverage W3C APIs in the browser.\n   A high level description of such system
    will be provided as an\n   informational I-D in the SFrame WG and then cited here.\n\n\t "

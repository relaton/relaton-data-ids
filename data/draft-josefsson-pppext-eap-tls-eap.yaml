  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for\n   multiple
    authentication methods. This document defines the Protected\n   Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (PEAP) Version 2, which provides\n   an encrypted and authenticated tunnel
    based on transport layer\n   security (TLS) that encapsulates EAP authentication
    mechanisms.\n   PEAPv2 uses TLS to protect against rogue authenticators, protect\n
    \  against various attacks on the confidentiality and integrity of the\n   inner
    EAP method exchange and provide EAP peer identity privacy.\n   PEAPv2 also provides
    support for chaining multiple EAP mechanisms,\n   cryptographic binding between
    authentications performed by inner EAP\n   mechanisms and the tunnel, exchange
    of arbitrary parameters (TLVs),\n   and fragmentation and reassembly.\n\t "

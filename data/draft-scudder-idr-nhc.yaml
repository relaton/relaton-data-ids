  content: "   RFC 5492 allows a BGP speaker to advertise its capabilities to its\n
    \  peer.  When a route is propagated beyond the immediate peer, it is\n   useful
    to allow certain characteristics to be conveyed further.  In\n   particular, it
    is useful to advertise forwarding plane features.\n\n   This specification defines
    a BGP transitive attribute to carry such\n   information, the \"Next Hop Dependent
    Characteristics Attribute,\" or\n   NHC.  Unlike the capabilities defined by RFC
    5492, the\n   characteristics conveyed in the NHC apply solely to the routes\n
    \  advertised by the BGP UPDATE that contains the particular NHC.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditional path selection conditions include the shortest path, the
    lowest delay, and the least jitter, this paper proposes to add a new factor: security,
    which determines the forwarding path from security dimension. The frequent occurrence
    of security incidents, users' demand for security services is increasingly strong.
    As there are many security devices in the ISP's network, this draft proposes secure
    routing, the purpose of secure routing is to converge security and routing to
    ensure the security of the transmission process. The scope is transmission process
    security, end-to-end security and processing security are out of scope.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>Current routing mechanism based on the shortest path, only the path
    accessibility is considered, but the security of links and forwarding nodes is
    not considered. As security has become an important factor in the service layer.
    this paper proposes to add a new factor: security. The frequent occurrence of
    security incidents, users' demand for security services is essential. As there
    are many security devices in the ISP's network, this draft proposes secure routing,
    the purpose of secure routing is to converge security and routing to ensure the
    security of the transmission process. The scope is transmission process security,
    while end-to-end security and application layer security are out of scope.</p>"

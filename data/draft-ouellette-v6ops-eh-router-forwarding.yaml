  content: "   It has become accepted that packets containing IPv6 Extension\n   Headers,
    especially Hop-by-hop Options, are frequently dropped on the\n   Internet.  However,
    the question still remains as to why they get\n   dropped and what type of devices
    may be dropping them.  This document\n   describes research conducted to isolate
    routers in a simple topology,\n   with minimal configuration, and shows that router
    implementations\n   alone are likely not the cause of packets containing IPv6
    Extension\n   Headers being dropped on the Internet.\n\n\t "

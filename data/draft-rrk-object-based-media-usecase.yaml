  content: "   This document outlines the challenges and use cases for the\n   deployment
    and operation of Object-Based Media (OBM), also known as\n   Flexible Media (FM),
    across the Internet.  It discusses key\n   considerations such as compute-aware
    traffic steering, metric usage,\n   bandwidth optimization, and latency reduction
    techniques.\n\n   The intention of this document is to highlight specific challanges
    or\n   areas where IETF investigation and applicable solutions are needed\n   for
    the optimal deployment of OBM-based media services.\n\n\t "

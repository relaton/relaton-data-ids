  content: "The IPP event notification specification [ipp-ntfy] is an OPTIONAL\nextension
    to IPP/1.0, IPP/1.1, and future versions.  [ipp-ntfy] which\nenables IPP clients
    to request notification of printer and job events.\nThe IPP notification extension
    gives IPP Printers the flexibility to\nchoose how many Subscriptions objects (individual
    requests for\nnotification), what delivery methods, and what natural languages
    to\nsupport, among others.  In practice, it's the working environment where\nan
    IPP Printer is deployed what ultimately dictates the notification\nrequirements
    for that printer.  Notification Delivery Services exist to\nhelp event producers,
    such as IPP Printers, meet the varying\nnotification needs of disparate environments.
    \ Specifically, an IPP\nNotification Delivery Service may extend the notification
    capabilities\nof IPP Printers and help customize the type of notification required
    in\na highly specialized environment.   This documents defines the IPP\nNotification
    Delivery Protocol (INDP), a protocol for IPP Printers to\ncommunicate with Notification
    Delivery Services using 'application/ipp'\nas the encoding mechanism and HTTP
    as the transport.  The definition of\nINDP lends itself nicely for use by IPP
    Printers and Notification\nDelivery Services for dispatching IPP Notifications
    to Notification\nRecipients as well.\n\n\n\t "

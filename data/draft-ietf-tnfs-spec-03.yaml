  content: "Additional functionality has been developed for UNIXr systems to address
    the TCSEC requirements for trusted systems.  New requirements are driving  efforts
    to develop interoperable, networked solutions for trusted UNIX environments.   A
    specific approach for addressing TCSEC MLS requirements is identified in the CMW
    requirements document.  Developing support for network interoperability among
    MLS classified systems is a primary goal of the trusted UNIX community.\n\t "

  content: "   As IP networks grow more complicated, these networks require a new\n
    \  interaction mechanism between customers and their networks based on\n   intent
    rather than detailed specifics.  An intent-based language is\n   need to enable
    customers to easily describe their diverse intent for\n   network connectivity
    to the network management systems.  This\n   document describes the problem Intent-Based
    NEtwork Modelling (IB-\n   NEMO) language is trying to solve, a summary of the
    use cases that\n   demonstrate this problem, and a proposed scope of work.  Part
    of the\n   scope is the validation of the language as a minimal (or reduced)\n
    \  subset.\n\n   The IB-NEMO language consists of commands exchanged between an\n
    \  application and a network manager/controller.  Some would call this\n   boundary
    between the application and the network management system as\n   northbound interface
    (NBI).\n\n   IB-NEMO focuses on creating minimal subset of the total possible\n
    \  Intent-Based commands to pass across this NBI.  By creating a minimal\n   subset
    (about 20% of the total possible) of all intent commands, the\n   IB-NEMO can
    be a simple Intent interface for most applications\n   (hopefully 80%).  Part
    of validation of this command language is to\n   to provide test cases where a
    set of commands are used to convey\n   information for a use case which result
    in a particular data model in\n   the network controller.\n\n\t "

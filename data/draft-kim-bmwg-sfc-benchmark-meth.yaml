  content: "   Service Function Chain is the ordered set of service functions such\n
    \  as firewall, Deep Packet Inspection(DPI), virtualized Evolved Packet\n   Core
    (vEPC), and etc,. Operators make chains with several service\n   functions depending
    on the service which they have to provide.  The\n   chain needs to be evaluated
    to measure the SLA.  This draft describes\n   the benchmarking methodologies for
    Service Function Chain(SFC)\n   performance and the affecting factors to SFC performance.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Port Control Protocol (PCP) allows clients to request explicit\n
    \  dynamic inbound and outbound port mappings in their closest on-path\n   NAT,
    firewall, or other middlebox.  However, in today's world, there\n   may be more
    than one NAT on the path between a client and the public\n   Internet.  This document
    describes how the closest on-path middlebox\n   generates a corresponding upstream
    PCP request to the next closest\n   on-path middlebox, to request an appropriate
    explicit dynamic port\n   mapping in that middlebox too.  Applied recursively,
    this generates\n   the necessary chain of port mappings in any number of middleboxes
    on\n   the path between the client and the public Internet.\n\n\t "

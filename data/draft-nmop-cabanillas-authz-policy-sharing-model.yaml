abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines mechanisms and conventions for the representation
    and sharing of authorization policies in distributed and automated environments.
    It specifies the foundational elements required to express policies in a consistent,
    machine-readable, and interoperable manner, enabling fine-grained control and
    context-aware evaluation. The framework supports the complete policy lifecycle,
    including creation, validation, versioning, distribution, and decommissioning,
    with YANG serving as the canonical representation format. It also establishes
    the relationship between policy representation and the structure of tokens used
    in enforcement and authorization exchanges, ensuring coherent and dynamic policy
    evaluation across heterogeneous systems.</p>"

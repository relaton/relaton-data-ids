  content: "   This document defines mechanisms and conventions for the\n   representation
    and sharing of authorization policies in distributed\n   and automated environments.
    \ It specifies the foundational elements\n   required to express policies in a
    consistent, machine-readable, and\n   interoperable manner, enabling fine-grained
    control and context-aware\n   evaluation.\n\n   The framework supports the complete
    policy lifecycle, including\n   creation, validation, versioning, distribution,
    and decommissioning,\n   with YANG serving as the canonical representation format.
    \ It also\n   establishes the relationship between policy representation and the\n
    \  structure of tokens used in enforcement and authorization exchanges,\n   ensuring
    coherent and dynamic policy evaluation across heterogeneous\n   systems.\n\n\t "

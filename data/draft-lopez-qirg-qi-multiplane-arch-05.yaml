  content: "   A consistent reference architecture model for the Quantum Internet
    is\n   required to progress in its evolution, providing a framework for the\n
    \  integration of the protocols applicable to it, and enabling the\n   advance
    of the applications based on it.  This model has to satisfy\n   three essential
    requirements: agility, so it is able to adapt to the\n   evolution of quantum
    communications base technologies,\n   sustainability, with open availability in
    technological and\n   economical terms, and pliability, being able to integrate
    with the\n   operations and management procedures in current networks.  This\n
    \  document proposes such an architecture framework, with the goal of\n   providing
    a conceptual common framework for the integration of\n   technologies intended
    to build the Quantum Internet infrastructure\n   and its integration with the
    current Internet.  The framework is\n   based on the already extensive experience
    in the deployment of QKD\n   network infrastructures and on related initiatives
    focused on the\n   integration of network infrastructures and services.\n\n\t "

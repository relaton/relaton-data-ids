  content: "DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level\n   authentication
    framework for email using public-key cryptography and\n   key server technology
    to permit verification of the source and\n   contents of messages by either Mail
    Transfer Agents (MTAs) or Mail\n   User Agents (MUAs).  The ultimate goal of this
    framework is to permit\n   a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message,
    thus proving\n   and protecting message sender identity and the integrity of the\n
    \  messages they convey while retaining the functionality of Internet\n   email
    as it is known today.  Proof and protection of email identity,\n   including repudiation
    and non-repudiation, may assist in the global\n   control of \"spam\" and \"phishing\".\n\t "

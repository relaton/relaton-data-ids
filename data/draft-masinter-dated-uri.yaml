  content: "   This document defines two URI schemes.  The first, 'duri' (standing\n
    \  for \"dated URI\"), identifies a resource as of a particular time.\n   This
    allows explicit reference to the \"time of retrieval\", similar to\n   the way
    in which bibliographic references containing URIs are often\n   written.\n\n   The
    second scheme, 'tdb' ( standing for \"Thing Described By\"),\n   provides a way
    of minting URIs for anything that can be described, by\n   the means of identifying
    a description as of a particular time.\n   These schemes were posited as \"thought
    experiments\", and therefore\n   this document is designated as Experimental.\n\n\t "

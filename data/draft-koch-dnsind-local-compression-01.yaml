- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The compression of domain names in DNS messages was introduced in\n   [RFC1035].
    \ Although some remarks were made about applicability to\n   future defined resource
    record types, no method has been deployed yet\n   to support interoperable DNS
    compression for RR types specified since\n   then.\n \n   This document summarizes
    current problems and proposes a new\n   compression scheme to be applied to future
    RR types, which supports\n   interoperability.  Also, suggestions are made how
    to deal with RR\n   types defined so far.\n\t "

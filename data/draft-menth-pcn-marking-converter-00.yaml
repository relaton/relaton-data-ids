  content: "This document proposes an algorithm that converts packet markings of\na
    stream that was excess-marked based on a lower-rate into packet\nmarkings that
    correspond to a stream that was excess-marked based on\na higher-rate.  It may
    be applied in the PCN context to convert\nmarked admissible-rate-overload into
    marked supportable-rate-\noverload.  This allows to perform marked flow termination
    when\npackets are excess-marked based on the admissible rate only.\n\t "

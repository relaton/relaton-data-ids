  content: "   This document explores the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n
    \  in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  We do so by outlining the\n   goals
    and the non-goals for the use of TLS and SIP.  In doing so, a\n   number of open
    questions are encountered regarding the contents of\n   certificates and the behavior
    of SIP entities using such\n   certificates.  We hope to foster discussion in
    the SIP working group\n   on these issues.\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses mechanisms for Mobile IPv6 allowing the \nefficient
    establishment of bidirectional link layer connectivity of \nmobile receivers moving
    to access networks with unidirectional links.\nScenarios are derived from the
    need to support seamless mobile\nin heterogeneous networking environment including
    unidirectional \ndownstream link interfaces, such as DVB-H, DVB-T, DVB-S or \nsatellites.
    \  \n\nIn order to establish quickly the upstream connectivity of a mobile \nreceiver,
    when moving to downstream unidirectional network in MIPv6 \nenvironment, the Link-Layer
    Tunneling Mechanisms defined in \nRFC 3077 are used in interaction with Mobile
    IPv6 protocols.  \n\t "

  content: "This document presents the test specifications for M2UA (MTP2 User\nAdaptation)
    protocol (RFC 3331), which can be used to test M2UA\nimplementations for conformance
    to the protocol definition. The list of\ntest is exhaustive and covers almost
    all the categories of test.\nThis draft can also be used in conjunction with M2UA
    specification by\nimplementers of protocol as implementers guide, as the pictorial\nrepresentation
    of various scenarios help easy understanding of the\nprotocol. Next revision of
    the draft will cover the additions done to\nthe protocol revision and any subsequent
    RFC published by IETF.\n\t "

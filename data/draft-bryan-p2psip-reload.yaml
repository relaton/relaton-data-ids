  content: "This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a\npeer-to-peer
    (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.  A P2P\nsignaling protocol provides
    its clients with an abstract storage and\nmessaging service between a set of cooperating
    peers that form the\noverlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session\nInitiation
    Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other\napplications with similar
    requirements by defining new usages that\nspecify the kinds of data that must
    be stored for a particular\napplication.  RELOAD defines a security model based
    on a certificate\nenrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal
    is\na fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access\nfrom \"client\"
    nodes which do not need to route traffic or store data\nfor others.\n\t "

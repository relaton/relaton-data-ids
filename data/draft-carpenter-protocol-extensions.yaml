  content: "This document discusses procedural issues related to the extensibility
    of IETF protocols, including when it is reasonable to extend IETF protocols with
    little or no review, and when extensions or variations need to be reviewed by
    the IETF community. Experience has shown that extension of protocols without early
    IETF review can carry risk. The document also recommends that major extensions
    to or variations of IETF protocols only take place through normal IETF processes
    or in coordination with the IETF.\n\n This document is directed principally at
    other Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and vendors considering requirements
    for extensions to IETF protocols. It does not modify formal IETF processes. This
    document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

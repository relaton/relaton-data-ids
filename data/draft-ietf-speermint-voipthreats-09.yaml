  script: Latn
  content: "The Session PEERing for Multimedia INTerconnect (SPEERMINT) working group
    (WG) provides a peering framework that leverages the building blocks of existing
    IETF-defined protocols such as SIP and ENUM for the interconnection between SIP
    Service Providers (SSPs).  The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate
    SPEERMINT- specific threat vectors and to give guidance for implementers on selecting
    appropriate countermeasures.  Security requirements for SPEERMINT that have been
    derived from the threats detailed in this document can be found in RFC 6271; this
    document provides concrete countermeasures to meet those SPEERMINT security requirements.
    \ In this document, the different security threats related to SPEERMINT are classified
    into threats to the Lookup Function (LUF), the Location Routing Function (LRF),
    the Signaling Function (SF), and the Media Function (MF) of a specific SIP Service
    Provider.  Various instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the
    classification.  Finally, existing security solutions for SIP and RTP/RTCP (Real-time
    Transport Control Protocol) are presented to describe countermeasures currently
    available for such threats.  Each SSP may have connections to one or more remote
    SSPs through peering or transit contracts.  A potentially compromised remote SSP
    that attacks other SSPs is out of the scope of this document; this document focuses
    on attacks on an SSP from outside the trust domain such an SSP may have with other
    SSPs.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Many devices in private homes can be controlled via Web browser from\n
    \  another computer in the internet.  This assumes that the IP address\n   of
    the device is known and that the private internet access has a\n   public IP address
    at all.\n\n   Due to the IPv4 address shortage many internet providers only provide\n
    \  IPv6 internet access while many internet accesses (and therefore Web\n   browsers)
    are IPv4-only.\n\n   This document describes a method that allows an internet
    service\n   provider that also provides dynamic DNS to the customers to allow\n
    \  accessing IPv6-only devices from IPv4-only Web browsers.\n\n\t "

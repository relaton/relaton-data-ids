  content: "   Computing-aware traffic steering (CATS) is a traffic engineering\n
    \  approach [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis] that takes into account the\n   dynamic
    nature of computing resources and network state to optimize\n   service-specific
    traffic forwarding towards a given service instance.\n   Various relevant metrics
    may be used to enforce such computing-aware\n   traffic steering policies.It is
    critical to meet different types of\n   computing-aware traffic steering requirements
    without disrupting the\n   existing network architecture.  In this context, this
    document\n   proposes a computing-aware traffic steering solution based on the
    SR-\n   TE infrastructure of the current traffic engineering technology to\n   reduce
    device resource consumption and investment and meet the\n   requirements for computing-aware
    traffic steering of network devices.\n\n\t "

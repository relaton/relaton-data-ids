  content: "This document specifies an extension to the File Transfer Protocol\n(FTP)
    which provides for inter-operation between existing\nimplementations and those
    supporting the exchange of UTF-8 encoded\npathnames, and clarifies certain issues
    involved with UTF-8 encoding.\nIt introduces a new option, UTF-8, negotiated by
    use of the OPTS\ncommand.  Through use of this option, the user informs the server
    of\nits willingness to accept UTF-8 encoded pathnames.  The proposed\nextension
    requires that neither party transmit UTF-8 encoded\npathnames without having first
    successfully negotiated this option.\n\n\t "

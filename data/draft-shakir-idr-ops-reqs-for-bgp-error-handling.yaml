  content: "BGP-4 is utilised as a key intra- and inter-Autonomous System routing\nprotocol
    in modern IP networks.  The failure modes as defined by the\noriginal protocol
    standards are based on a number of assumptions\naround the impact of session failure.
    \ Numerous incidents both in the\nglobal Internet routing table and within Service
    Provider networks\nhave been caused by strict handling of a single invalid UPDATE\nmessage
    causing large-scale failures in one or more Autonomous\nSystems.\n\nThis memo
    describes the current use of BGP-4 within Service Provider\nnetworks, and outlines
    a set of requirements for further work to\nenhance the mechanisms available to
    a BGP-4 implementation when\nerroneous data is detected.  Whilst this document
    does not provide\nspecification of any standard, it is intended as an overview
    of a set\nof enhancements to BGP-4 to improve the protocol's robustness to suit\nits
    current deployment.\n\t "

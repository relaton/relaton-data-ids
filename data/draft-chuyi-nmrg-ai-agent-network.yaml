  content: "   Current advancements in AI technologies, particularly large models,\n
    \  have demonstrated immense potential in content generation, reasoning,\n   analysis
    and so on, providing robust technical support for network\n   automation and self-intelligence.
    \ However, in practical network\n   operations, challenges such as system isolation
    and fragmented data\n   lead to extensive manual, repetitive, and inefficient
    tasks, the\n   improvement of intelligence level is very necessary.  This document\n
    \  identifies typical scenarios requiring enhanced intelligence, and\n   explains
    how AI Agents and large model technologies can empower\n   networks to address
    operational pain points, reduce manual efforts,\n   and explore impacts on network
    data, system architectures, and\n   interfaces correspondingly.  It further explores
    and summarizes\n   standardization efforts in implementation.\n\n\n\t "

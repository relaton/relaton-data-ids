  content: "This document describes extensions to the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    RFC(2543) for supporting telephony services using the\nDistributed Call Signaling
    architecture described in [2]. This\ndocument discusses extensions to the host
    parameter in the SIP URL\nfor supporting the following: (a) a call signaling architecture\nwhere
    call state is distributed to the clients during call setup and\nstored there for
    the duration of the call, (b) support for local\nnumber portability and (c) relaxation
    of the strong coupling between\nthe phone number and its gateway in the telephony
    subscriber URL as\ndefined in RFC 2543. Additional headers in SIP messages for
    passing\ncall state information between the clients and their proxies, and\nsupport
    for PSTN-based operator services are also discussed in this\ndocument. In addition,
    the need for the Also and Replaces headers\npreviously discussed in [3]) are mentioned
    here.\n\t "

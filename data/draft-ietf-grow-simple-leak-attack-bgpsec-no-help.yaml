- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates\n
    \  how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily\n   circumvented
    in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via\n   BGP.  It is meant
    to serve as input to the IETF's Global Routing\n   Operations Working group (GROW)
    during routing security requirements\n   discussions and subsequent specification.\n\n\t "

  content: "Security and Smooth handoff with minimal data loss and delay are\ndesirable
    goals of any mobile network. To minimize data loss while\nchanging FAs, a MN can
    request the previous FA to allocate buffers\nfor storing its (MN's) data. This
    buffered data is then forwarded\nto the MN when it registers with the new FA.
    This approach may\ndecrease the window of data loss and delay during handoff.\nAdditionally,
    it may be necessary for the MN to authenticate the\nnew FA before allowing it
    (the new FA) to receive data from the\nprevious FA.\nThis draft outlines a buffering
    protocol that minimizes the\npotential loss of data while the MN changes its subnetwork
    point of\nattachment. This draft also provides a way for the MN to verify the\nnew
    FA during the handoff, if and when that is needed.\n\n\t "

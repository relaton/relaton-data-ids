  content: "This document describes the set of Remote Authentication Dial-In User
    Service Vendor-Specific Attributes (RADIUS VSAs) defined by the DSL Forum.\n\n
    These attributes are designed to transport Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) information
    that is not supported by the standard RADIUS attribute set. It is expected that
    this document will be updated if and when the DSL Forum defines additional vendor-specific
    attributes, since its primary purpose is to provide a reference for DSL equipment
    vendors wishing to interoperate with other vendors' products. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a bandwidth saving method for exporting Flow or
    packet information using the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol. As the
    Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol is based on IPFIX, these considerations are valid
    for PSAMP exports as well.\n\n This method works by separating information common
    to several Flow Records from information specific to an individual Flow Record.
    Common Flow information is exported only once in a Data Record defined by an Options
    Template, while the rest of the specific Flow information is associated with the
    common information via a unique identifier. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "        This memorandum discusses the issues and options involved\n        in
    the design of a new transport protocol for multiplexed\n        voice within a
    single packet. The intended application is\n        the interconnection of devices
    which provide trunking or\n        long distance telephone service over the Internet.
    Such\n        devices have many voice connections simultaneously between\n        them.
    Multiplexing them into the same connection improves\n        on the efficiency,
    enables the use of low bitrate voice\n        codecs, and improves scalability.
    Options and issues con-\n        cerning timestamping, payload type identification,
    length\n        indication, and channel identification are discussed. Sev-\n        eral
    possible header formats are identified, and their\n        efficiencies are compared.\n\n\t "

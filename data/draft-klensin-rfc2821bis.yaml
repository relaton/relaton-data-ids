  content: "This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet electronic
    mail transport.  It consolidates, updates, and clarifies several previous documents,
    making all or parts of most of them obsolete.  It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms
    and best practices for the contemporary Internet, but does not provide details
    about particular extensions.  Although SMTP was designed as a mail transport and
    delivery protocol, this specification also contains information that is important
    to its use as a \"mail submission\" protocol for \"split-UA\" (User Agent) mail
    reading systems and mobile environments. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

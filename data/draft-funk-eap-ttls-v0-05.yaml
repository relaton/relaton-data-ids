  content: "EAP-TTLS is an EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) method that encapsulates
    a TLS (Transport Layer Security) session, consisting of a handshake phase and
    a data phase.  During the handshake phase, the server is authenticated to the
    client (or client and server are mutually authenticated) using standard TLS procedures,
    and keying material is generated in order to create a cryptographically secure
    tunnel for information exchange in the subsequent data phase.  During the data
    phase, the client is authenticated to the server (or client and server are mutually
    authenticated) using an arbitrary authentication mechanism encapsulated within
    the secure tunnel.  The encapsulated authentication mechanism may itself be EAP,
    or it may be another authentication protocol such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, or MS-CHAP-V2.
    \ Thus, EAP-TTLS allows legacy password-based authentication protocols to be used
    against existing authentication databases, while protecting the security of these
    legacy protocols against eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, and other attacks.
    \ The data phase may also be used for additional, arbitrary data exchange.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

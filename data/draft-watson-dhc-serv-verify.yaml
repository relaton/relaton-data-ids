  content: "The document defines a mechanism to allow a DHCP client to verify\n   the
    authenticity of a DHCP server configuration offer using\n   DNSSEC.   Currently
    DHCP clients have no way to assess which of\n   DHCP OFFERS are from valid DHCP
    servers, and which are not.\n   Malicious DHCP servers can cause various network
    problems for\n   unsuspecting clients. \n\n   In order to support DHCP server
    authorization a new DNS Resource \n   Record type (ALLOC) is added. Using the
    ALLOC record in combination \n   with the servers KEY record the client can authoritatively
    assess if\n   the server is authorized.\n\t "

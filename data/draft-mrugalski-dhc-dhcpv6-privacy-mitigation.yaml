  content: "   There is work ongoing in the dhc working group that discusses the\n
    \  various identifiers used by DHCPv6 and the potential privacy\n   implications.
    \ This draft explores several migitation techniques that\n   could be used to
    address the privacy issues in DHCPv6.  This draft is\n   expected to evolve significantly
    over time, but the ultimate goal is\n   to standardize mitigation techniques the
    DHC working group considers\n   useful.\n\n\t "

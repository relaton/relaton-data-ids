abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   In a mobile network, when a mobile device (referred to as User\n   Equipment
    or UE) moves from one Access Node (source AN) to another\n   (target AN), the
    anchoring node that connects the UE to the Data\n   Network sends an End Marker
    to the source AN after it starts sending\n   UE traffic towards the target AN.
    \ The target AN buffers the data\n   until it receives the End Marker forwarded
    by the source AN.  This is\n   to preserve the order of packets during the handover
    between ANs.\n\n   The anchoring node is referred to as User Plane Function (UPF)
    in 5G\n   and it is a Network Function of the mobile network.  The UPFs are\n
    \  traditionally centrally deployed but are more and more distributed\n   closer
    to the edge.  With distributed UPFs, handover becomes\n   necessary among UPFs,
    and the End Marker mechanism may need to be\n   extended to Data Network devices
    that are not mobile network\n   functions.  This document discusses the problem
    and proposes a\n   solution based on ICMP messages if packet ordering needs to
    be\n   preserved during handover between UPFs.\n\n\t "

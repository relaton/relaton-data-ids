  content: "   This document defines a very narrow profile of CBOR intended for use\n
    \  with the special tag 42.  Like the earlier internet-draft submitted\n   under
    the name \"CBOR Core,\" much of its design dates to the first\n   CBOR RFC and
    predates much of the layered approach to determinism and\n   profiling in later
    years.\n\n   Also like \"CBOR/c\", CBOR-42 can be used as an internet-scale\n
    \  serialization for JSON, and is optimized for objects that compose\n   into
    a directed acyclical graph.  Since CBOR-42 objects link to one\n   another by
    hash-based identifiers tagged \"42\", deterministic encoding\n   is mandated to
    verify dereferenced links and encode new ones.\n\n\t "

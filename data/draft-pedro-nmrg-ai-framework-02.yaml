  content: "   The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in network management\n
    \  (NM) solutions is the way to resolve complex management problems\n   arisen
    from the adoption of NFV, SDN, and network slicing\n   technologies.  The AINEMA
    framework, as discussed in this document,\n   includes the functions, capabilities,
    and components that MUST be\n   provided by AI modules and models to be successfully
    applied to NM.\n   This is enlarged by the consideration of seamless integration
    of\n   different services, including the ability of having multiple AI\n   models
    working in parallel, as well as the ability of complex\n   reasoning and event
    processing.  In addition, disparate sources of\n   information are put together
    with limited complexity, through the\n   definition of a control and management
    service bus.  It allows, for\n   instance, to involve external events in NM operations.
    \ Using all\n   available sources of information --- namely, intelligence sources
    ---\n   allows NM solutions to apply proper intelligence processes instead of\n
    \  simple AI-based guesses.  Such processes are highly based in\n   reasoning
    and formal and target-based intelligence analysis and\n   decision --- providing
    evidence-based conclusions and proofs for the\n   decisions.  This will allow
    computer and network system\n   infrastructures --- and user demands --- to grow
    in complexity.\n\n   The construction and maintenance of AINEMA-compatible components
    MUST\n   consider the existence several mechanisms, which are extended beyond\n
    \  machine learning (ML).  For instance, intelligent reasoning is a key\n   aspect
    of AINEMA that MUST be taken into account by autonomic\n   management components
    and solutions.  It will provide enormous\n   benefits to NM solutions by, for
    example, inferring new knowledge and\n   applying different kind of rules (e.g.
    logical) to choose from\n   several actions.  While ML solutions work with data,
    so they only\n   require to retrieve data from the network infrastructure, AINEMA\n
    \  modules MUST work in collaboration to the network it is managing.\n   This
    makes the challenges arisen from intelligent reasoning essential\n   for the evolution
    of NM.  They will be addressed within the context\n   of AINEMA.\n\n\t "

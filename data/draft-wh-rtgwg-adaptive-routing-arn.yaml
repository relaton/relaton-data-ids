  content: "   Large-scale supercomputing and AI data centers utilize multipath to\n
    \  implement load balancing and/or improve transport reliability.\n   Adaptive
    routing (AR), widely used in direct topologies such as\n   dragonfly, is growing
    popular in commodity data centers to\n   dynamically adjust routing policies based
    on path congestion and\n   failures.  When congestion or failure occurs, the sensing
    node can\n   not only apply AR locally but also send the congestion/failure\n
    \  information to other nodes in a timely and accurate manner to enforce\n   AR
    on other nodes, thus avoiding exacerbating congestion on the\n   reported path.
    \ This document specifies Adaptive Routing Notification\n   (ARN), a general mechanism
    to proactively disseminate congestion\n   detection and congestion elimination
    information for remote nodes to\n   perform re-routing policies.  Particularly
    for AI workloads like\n   DeepSeek's MoE models that exhibit dynamic all-to-all
    communication\n   patterns with bursty traffic characteristics, such mechanisms
    become\n   crucial to enable immediate network response to transient congestion\n
    \  conflicts.\n\n\t "

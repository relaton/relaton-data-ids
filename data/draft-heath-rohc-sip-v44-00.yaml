  content: "This document describes a compression method based on the data\ncompression
    algorithm described in ITU-T Recommendation V.44 [V44].\nRecommendation V.44 is
    a modem standard but Annex B of the \nrecommendation describes the implementation
    of V.44 in packet\nnetworks.  This document defines the application of V.44 to
    packets\nor messages where some or all of the contents of the data is known\nahead
    of time.  For such applications the V.44 dictionary is \npartially pre-loaded
    after intialization with words and/or phrases \nthat are expected to appear in
    the data.  This Internet Draft\ndescribes the mechanism of the dictionary pre-load
    and its \nadvantages for applications such as SIP/SDP.\n\t "

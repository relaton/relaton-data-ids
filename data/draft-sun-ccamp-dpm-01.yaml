  content: "When setting up a label switched path (LSP) in Generalized MPLS and\nMPLS/TE
    networks, the completion of the signaling process does not\nnecessarily mean that
    the cross connection along the LSP have been\nprogrammed accordingly and in a
    timely manner.  Meanwhile, the\ncompletion of signaling process may be used by
    applications as\nindication that data path has become usable.  The existence of
    this\ndelay and the possible failure of cross connection programming, if\nnot
    properly treated, will result in data loss or even application\nfailure.  Characterization
    of this performance can thus help\ndesigners to improve the application model
    and to build more robust\napplications.  This document defines a series of performance
    metrics\nto evaluate the availability of data path in the signaling process.\n\nStatus

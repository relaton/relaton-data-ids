  content: "   This document provides test vectors to validate implementations of\n
    \  the two mandatory authentication algorithms specified for the TCP\n   Authentication
    Option over both IPv4 and IPv6. This includes\n   validation of the key derivation
    function (KDF) based on a set of\n   test connection parameters as well as validation
    of the message\n   authentication code (MAC). Vectors are provided for both currently\n
    \  required pairs of KDF and MAC algorithms: one based on SHA-1 and the\n   other
    on AES-128. The vectors also validate both whole TCP segments\n   as well as segments
    whose options are excluded for NAT traversal.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "   This document describes an operational problem that arises due to the\n
    \  impossibility of managing the address generation policy employed by\n   hosts
    participating in IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\n   (SLAAC).  Additionally,
    it specifies a new field in the Prefix\n   Information option of Router Advertisement
    messages, such that\n   routers can advertise, for each network prefix included
    in a Router\n   Advertisement message, the desired address generation policy to
    be\n   used for SLAAC.\n\n\t "

  content: "The ability of a multiple segment network to zero configure has\nadvantages.
    \ This is especially the case when the network\ndesigner/builder has few IP networking
    skills, as can be expected in\nthe home environment.  This document describes
    a method for the zero-\nconfiguration of unique subnet prefixes in a network.
    \ The method\nproposed is based on the existence of the Unique Identifier\nAllocation
    Protocol (UIAP) but can be modified to use another\nprotocol providing the same
    service.\n\t "

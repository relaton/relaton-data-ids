- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document provides a framework for group key management for \nmulticast
    security, motivated by three main considerations, namely \nthe multicast application,
    scalability and trust-relationships among \nentities.  It introduces two planes
    corresponding to the network \nentities and functions important to multicasting
    and to security. The \nkey management plane consists of two hierarchy-levels in
    the form of \na single 'trunk region' (inter-region) and one or more 'leaf regions'
    \n(intra-region). The advantages of the framework among others \nare that it is
    scalable, it has reduced complexity and allows the \nindependence in regions of
    group key management.\n\t "

  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or\n
    \  green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-\n   BGP)now
    plays an important role in the transition of their Provider\n   (P) core network
    as well as Provider Edge (PE) Inter-AS peering\n   network from IPv4 to IPv6.
    \ Operators must be able to continue to\n   support IPv4 customers when both the
    Core and Edge networks are\n   IPv6-Only.\n\n   This document details an important
    External BGP (eBGP) PE-PE Inter-AS\n   IPv6-Only peering design that leverages
    the MP-BGP capability\n   exchange by using IPv6 peering as pure transport, allowing
    both IPv4\n   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer\n
    \  Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over the same (Border\n   Gateway
    Protocol) BGP TCP session for all Address Family Identifiers\n   (AFI) and Subsequent
    Address Family Identifiers(SAFI).  The design\n   change provides the same Dual
    Stacking functionality that exists\n   today with separate IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions
    as we have today.\n   With this IPv6-Only PE Design, IPv4 address MUST not be
    configured on\n   the the Provider Edge (PE) - Customer Edge (CE), or Inter-AS
    ASBR\n   (Autonomous System Boundary Router) to ASBR (Autonomous System\n   Boundary
    Router) PE-PE Provider Edge (PE) - Provider Edge (PE).  From\n   a control plane
    perspective a single IPv6-Only peer is required for\n   both IPv4 and IPv6 routing
    updates and from a data plane forwarindg\n   perspective an IPv6 address need
    only be configured on the PE to PE\n   Inter-AS peering interface for both IPv4
    and IPv6 packet forwarding.\n   This document defines the IPv6-Only PE Design
    as a new PE-CE and PE-\n   PE BGP peering Standard which is described in the POC
    testing\n   document [I-D.ietf-bess-ipv6-only-pe-design] to all AFI/SAFI\n   ubiquitously.
    \ As service providers migrate to Segment Routing\n   architecture SR-MPLS and
    SRv6, VPN overlay exsits as well, and thus\n   Inter-AS options Option-A, Option-AB
    and Option-C are still\n   applicable and thus this extension of IPv6-Only peering
    architecure\n   extension to Inter-AS peering is very relevant to Segment Routing
    as\n   well.\n\n\t "

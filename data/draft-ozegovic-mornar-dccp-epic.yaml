  content: "This draft describes a profile for compressing Datagram Congestion \nControl
    Protocol DCCP/IP using the Efficient Protocol Independent \nCompression (EPIC)
    [2] scheme.\nThe RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is designed to compress\npacket
    headers over error prone channels.  It is built around an\nextensible core framework
    that can be tailored to compress new\nprotocol stacks by adding additional ROHC
    profiles.\nDCCP [3] is a relatively new protocol and has not yet entered the \nprocess
    of wide implementation. It is intended to provide a unified\ncongestion control
    interface to the end user applications. It should\noffer the same unreliable transport
    as UDP does, and on the other \nhand, include mechanisms for congestion avoidance
    and control.\nThis profile describes a new profile for ROHC which will allow DCCP/\nIP
    headers to be compressed.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes the UDP-based Lightweight GeneRic Autonomic\n
    \  Signaling Protocol (LW-GRASP), which is designed to be a lightweight\n   version
    of the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol(GRASP, or the\n   standard GRASP),
    with shortened messages and a built-in reliability\n   mechanism.  LW-GRASP can
    work reliably over UDP, making it suitable\n   for the IoT, where lightweight
    and resource-constrained devices\n   dominate.  Furthermore, this document also
    discusses the potential\n   way to adapt the LW-GRASP to work on the network without
    IP\n   connectivity.\n\n\t "

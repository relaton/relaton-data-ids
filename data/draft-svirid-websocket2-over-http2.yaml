  content: "   This document specifies a new protocol called WebSocket2 ontop of\n
    \  HTTP/2.  The WebSocket2 protocol enables two-way binary communication\n   between
    a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment\n   to a remote host
    that has opted-in to communications from that code.\n\n   This protocol has little
    incommon with the WebSocket protocol\n   [RFC6455] other than client side API
    compatibility.\n\n   Please send feedback to the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list.\n\n\t "

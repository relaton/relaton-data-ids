  content: "   The U.S. Congress, having hit a home run with the do-not-call list,\n
    \  has decided that since computers are like telephones, a do-not-email\n   list
    ought to win them the pennant.  You have an opportunity to block\n   that metaphor.
    \ The FTC has issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed\n   Rulemaking and has given
    the public until March 31, 2004 to respond.\n   This document tells you how and
    explains the issues.\n\t "

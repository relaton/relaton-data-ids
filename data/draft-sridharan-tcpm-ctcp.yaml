  content: "Compound TCP (CTCP) is a modification to TCP's congestion control  \nmechanism
    for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  \nThis document describes
    the Compound TCP algorithm in detail, and  \nsolicits experimentation and feedback
    from the wider community.  The  \nkey idea behind CTCP is to add a scalable delay-based
    component to the  \nstandard TCP's loss-based congestion control. The sending
    rate of CTCP  \nis controlled by both loss and delay components. The delay-based
    \ \ncomponent has a scalable window increasing rule that not only  \nefficiently
    uses the link capacity, but on sensing queue build up,  \nproactively reduces
    the sending rate.  \n\t "

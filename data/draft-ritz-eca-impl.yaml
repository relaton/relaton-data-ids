abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides implementation guidance, deployment patterns,
    and integration considerations for the Ephemeral Compute Attestation (ECA) protocol.
    It explores concrete Instance Factor patterns ranging from hardware-rooted to
    artifact-based approaches, documents operational experiences from prototype implementations,
    and describes how ECA integrates with existing identity frameworks such as ACME
    and SPIFFE/SPIRE. The document includes practical examples, test vectors, and
    architectural guidance for deploying ECA across diverse compute environments from
    cloud VMs to bare-metal systems.</p>"

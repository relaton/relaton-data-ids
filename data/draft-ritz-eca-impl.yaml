  content: "   This document provides implementation guidance, deployment patterns,\n
    \  and integration considerations for the Ephemeral Compute Attestation\n   (ECA)
    protocol.  It explores concrete Instance Factor patterns\n   ranging from hardware-rooted
    to artifact-based approaches, documents\n   operational experiences from prototype
    implementations, and describes\n   how ECA integrates with existing identity frameworks
    such as ACME and\n   SPIFFE/SPIRE.  The document includes practical examples,
    test\n   vectors, and architectural guidance for deploying ECA across diverse\n
    \  compute environments from cloud VMs to bare-metal systems.\n\n\t "

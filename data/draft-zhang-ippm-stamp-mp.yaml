- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   STAMP is typically used to perform the measurement of one-way and\n
    \  round-trip performance metrics.  However, when using active\n   measurement
    mechanisms in a multi-path topology, the default\n   forwarding behavior is to
    go through one path.  So, it cannot collect\n   the information of all the paths
    at one time.\n\n   This document extends STAM with a Multi-path TLV to implement
    the\n   multi-path performance measurement, which can help the operators to\n
    \  know the performance of network comprehensively and efficiently.\n\n\t "

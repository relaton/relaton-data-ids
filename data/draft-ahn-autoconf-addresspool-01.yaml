  content: "This document describes an address configuration mechanism based on\n
    \  the concept of address pool allocation in the connected MANET.\n   The Internet
    gateway acts as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration\n   Protocol) server and assigns
    not a single address but a part of its\n   address pool to an address requesting
    node and, then, the node can\n   assign a part of its own address pool to its
    neighbor nodes.\n   By doing this, the address allocation procedure can be expedited.\n\n\t "

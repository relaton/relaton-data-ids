  content: "   In recent years, high-bandwidth LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite\n   networks,
    such as Starlink and OneWeb, have seen tremendous\n   development and are gradually
    becoming an important part of the\n   global Internet.  However, due to the unique
    characteristics of\n   satellite networks, using TCP for data transmission faces
    challenges\n   in multiple aspects, such as high latency caused by long-distance\n
    \  propagation and high error rates due to signal attenuation.  This\n   proposal
    summarizes the basic requirements that need to be considered\n   for designing
    transport layer protocols tailored to LEO satellites.\n\n\t "

  content: "   NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the latest\n
    \  being RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  A core component of the protocol and the\n   algorithms
    is the Reference ID, or REFID, which is used to identify\n   the source of time
    used for synchronization.  Traditionally, when the\n   source of time was another
    system the REFID was the IPv4 address of\n   that other system.  The core purpose
    of the REFID is to prevent a\n   one-degree timing loop, where if A has several
    timing sources that\n   include B, if B decides to get its time from A we don't
    want A then\n   deciding to get its time from B.  The REFID is considered to be\n
    \  \"public data\" and is a vital core-component of the base NTP packet.\n   If
    a system's REFID is the IPv4 address of its system peer, an\n   attacker can try
    to use that information to send spoofed time packets\n   to either or both the
    target or the target's server, attempting to\n   cause a disruption in time service.
    \ This proposal is a backward-\n   compatible way for a time source to tell its
    peers or clients \"If you\n   use me as your system peer, use this nonce as your
    REFID.\"  This\n   nonce SHOULD be untraceable to the original system, and if
    it is used\n   as the REFID this type of attack is prevented.\n\n\t "

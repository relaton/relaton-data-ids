- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Dual-Stack lite requires that the AFTR must have IPv4 connectivity.\nThis
    forbids a service provider who wants to deploy AFTR in an IPv6-\nonly network.
    \ This memo proposes an extension to implement a\nstateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation
    in the AFTR so that AFTR can be\ndeployed in an IPv6-only network.\n\t "

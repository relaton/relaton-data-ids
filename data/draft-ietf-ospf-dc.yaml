  content: "OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.
    \ OSPF behavior over demand circuits (DC) is optimized in RFC 1793 to minimize
    the amount of overhead traffic.  A part of the OSPF demand circuit extensions
    is the Hello suppression mechanism.  This technique allows a demand circuit to
    go down when no interesting traffic is going through the link.  However, it also
    introduces a problem, where it becomes impossible to detect an OSPF-inactive neighbor
    over such a link.  This memo introduces a new mechanism called \"neighbor probing\"
    to address the above problem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

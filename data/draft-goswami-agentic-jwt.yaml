  content: "   This document specifies Agentic JSON Web Token (Agentic JWT), as an\n
    \  extension to OAuth 2.0 that addresses authorization challenges unique\n   to
    autonomous agentic AI systems.  This protocol solves the problem\n   of Zero-Trust
    drift due to non-deterministic Agentic AI clients\n   causing separation between
    user's (resource owner's) intent and\n   client application's actions.\n\n   Traditional
    OAuth 2.0 assumes that client applications faithfully\n   represent user intent
    when requesting authorization.  This assumption\n   breaks down when autonomous
    AI agents dynamically generate workflows,\n   create sub-agents, and make authorization
    decisions without\n   continuous human oversight.  We term this the \"intent-execution\n
    \  separation problem.\"\n\n   Agentic JWT introduces three mechanisms to address
    this problem: (1)\n   cryptographic agent identity through agent checksums (based
    on\n   agent's system prompts, tools and configurations), (2) workflow-aware\n
    \  token binding that links user intent to agent execution, and (3) a\n   new
    OAuth 2.0 grant type (agent_checksum) for secure token issuance,\n   (4) a flavor
    of PoP (Proof-of-Possession) at the level of an agentic\n   identity to prevent
    token replays by other agents in the same multi-\n   agent process.\n\n   This
    specification enables Zero-Trust security principles in multi-\n   agent systems
    while maintaining backward compatibility with existing\n   OAuth 2.0 infrastructure.
    \ The security analysis and experimental\n   validation are described in the companion
    research paper.\n\n\t "

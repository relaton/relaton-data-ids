  content: "   This memo describes an extension to the HTTP protocol allowing web\n
    \  host operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to remember (\"pin\") the\n   hosts'
    cryptographic identities for a given period of time.  During\n   that time, UAs
    will require that the host present a certificate chain\n   including at least
    one Subject Public Key Info structure whose\n   fingerprint matches one or more
    of the pinned fingerprints for that\n   host.  By effectively reducing the scope
    of authorities who can\n   authenticate the domain during the lifetime of the
    pin, pinning may\n   reduce the incidence of man-in-the-middle attacks due to
    compromised\n   Certification Authorities and other authentication errors and\n
    \  attacks.\n\n\t "

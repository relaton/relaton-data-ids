abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC7344 specifies how DNS trust can be maintained in-band between\n
    \  parent and child.  There are two features missing in that\n   specification:
    initial trust setup and removal of trust anchor.  This\n   document addresses
    both these omissions.\n\n   Changing a domain's DNSSEC status can be a complicated
    matter\n   involving many parties.  Some of these parties, such as the DNS\n   operator,
    might not even be known by all organisations involved.  The\n   inability to enable
    or disable DNSSEC via in-band signalling is seen\n   as a problem or liability
    that prevents DNSSEC adoption at large\n   scale.  This document adds a method
    for in-band signalling of DNSSEC\n   status changes.\n\n   Initial trust is considered
    a much harder problem, this document will\n   seek to clarify and simplify the
    initial acceptance policy.\n\n\t "

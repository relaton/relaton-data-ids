  content: "   LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking system by\n
    \  separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN\n   addresses.
    \ This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as\n   a critically necessary
    evolutionary architectural step for the\n   Internet.  In LISP, nodes have both
    a 'locator' (a name which says\n   _where_ in the network's connectivity structure
    the node is) and an\n   'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent
    handle\n   for the node).  A node may have more than one locator, or its locator\n
    \  may change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the\n   same
    identifier.\n\n   One of the chief novelties of LISP, compared to other proposals
    for\n   the separation of location and identity, is its approach to deploying\n
    \  this upgrade.  In general, it is comparatively easy to conceive of\n   new
    network designs, but much harder to devise approaches which will\n   actually
    get deployed throughout the global network.  LISP aims to\n   achieve the near-ubiquitous
    deployment necessary for maximum\n   exploitation of an architectural upgrade
    by i) minimizing the amount\n   of change needed (existing hosts and routers can
    operate unmodified);\n   and ii) by providing significant benefits to early adopters.\n\n
    \  This document gives additional architectural insight into LISP, and\n   analyzes
    a number of aspects of LISP from a long-term perspective.\n\n   NOTE: This is
    an initial rough draft, a much better version will be\n   out shortly.\n\n\t "

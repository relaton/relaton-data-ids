  script: Latn
  content: "   The presence of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)\n
    \  would render state-of-the-art, traditional public-key algorithms\n   deployed
    today obsolete, since the assumptions about the\n   intractability of the mathematical
    problems for these algorithms that\n   offer confident levels of security today
    no longer apply in the\n   presence of a CRQC.  This means there is a requirement
    to update\n   protocols and infrastructure to use post-quantum algorithms, which\n
    \  are public-key algorithms designed to be secure against CRQCs as well\n   as
    classical computers.  These new public-key algorithms behave\n   similarly to
    previous public key algorithms, however the intractable\n   mathematical problems
    have been carefully chosen so they are hard for\n   CRQCs as well as classical
    computers.  This document explains why\n   engineers need to be aware of and understand
    post-quantum\n   cryptography.  It emphasizes the potential impact of CRQCs on
    current\n   cryptographic systems and the need to transition to post-quantum\n
    \  algorithms to ensure long-term security.  The most important thing to\n   understand
    is that this transition is not like previous transitions\n   from DES to AES or
    from SHA-1 to SHA-2.  While drop-in replacement\n   may be possible in some cases,
    others will require protocol re-design\n   to accommodate significant differences
    in behavior between the new\n   post-quantum algorithms and the classical algorithms
    that they are\n   replacing.\n\n\t "

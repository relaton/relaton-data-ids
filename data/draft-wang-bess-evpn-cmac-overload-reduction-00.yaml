  content: "   When there are too many customer-MACs (C-MACs), the RRs and/or ASBRs\n
    \  will be overloaded by the RT-2 routes for these MACs according to\n   [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services].
    \ This issue can be simply solved by\n   making the remote C-MAC entries learnt
    via data-plane MAC learning\n   (like what PBB VPLS have been done since [RFC7041])
    rather than\n   received from RT-2 routes.  This simplified solution will works
    as\n   well as PBB VPLS.  But this simplified solution will lose many\n   important
    features that based on the ESI concept.  Because the\n   ingress-ESI can't be
    learnt via data-plane MAC learning at the egress\n   PE.  So when the data packets
    is forwarded following these MAC\n   entries, they can't benefit from the EAD/EVI
    routes as per RFC7432.\n   So the All-Active Redundancy mode for ES can't be supported.
    \ This\n   make the simplified solution can't work as well as PBB EVPN\n   ([RFC7623]).\n\n
    \  This document proposes a new SRv6 function type and an extension to\n   [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services]
    to achieve all-active mode ES\n   redundancy on TPEs and reduce the C-MAC loads
    for RRs and ASBRs.  The\n   new solution will work even more better than PBB EVPN
    under the help\n   of these extensions.\n\n\t "

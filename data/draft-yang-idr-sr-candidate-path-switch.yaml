  content: "   Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly\n   indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node.  An SR\n   policy is a set
    of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more\n   segment lists with necessary
    path attributes. If an SR policy has\n   multiple valid candidate paths, the device
    chooses the candidate path\n   with the greatest preference value. If the chosen
    path fails, the SR\n   policy must select another candidate path. During path
    reselection,\n   packet loss might occur and thus affect service continuity. Therefore\n
    \  the candidate path hot-standby function occurs, the headend can\n   compute
    two candidate paths, one is master and the other is backup,\n   set them to the
    forwarding plane, and in this way, the switchover\n   time is reduced.\n\n   This
    document defines extensions to BGP to distribute hot-standby\n   switch within
    SR policies.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The Node Potential Oriented Multi-Nexthop Routing Protocol (NP-\n   MNRP)bases
    on the idea of \"hop-by-hop routing forwarding, multi-\n   backup next hop\" and
    combines with the phenomena that water flows\n   from higher place to lower. NP-MNRP
    defines a metric named as node\n   potential, which is based on hop count and
    the actual link bandwidth,\n   and calculates multiple next-hops through the potential
    difference\n   between the nodes.\n\n\n\t "

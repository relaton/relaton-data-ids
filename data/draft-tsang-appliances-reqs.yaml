  content: "Today, there are a variety of technologies available to network \nappliances
    and provide degrees of home automation and control.  \nHowever, there is a lack
    of support for wide-area access control and \ninterworking of these Networked
    Appliances (NA).  The ability to \nprovide such support will radically enhance
    people’s ability to \nprovide exciting new services.  This document outlines a
    set of \nrequirements for providing such support.\n\t "

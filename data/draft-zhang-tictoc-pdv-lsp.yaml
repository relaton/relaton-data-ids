  content: "   This document defines a mechanism for the setup,reoptimization and\n
    \  recovery of PTP LSP based on the PDV metrics between the 1588 Master\n   and
    the 1588 Slave.\n\n   When a PTP communication path goes through the third party
    networks\n   (e.g. the MPLS networks), the PDV noise caused by the third party\n
    \  networks will have a significant impact on the synchronization\n   performance.
    \ So, the PDV metrics should be considered in the setup\n   of PTP LSP.\n\n   In
    addition, when the PDV noise exceeds to a certain degree, it is\n   necessary
    to notify the head-end LSR(i.e. the 1588 Master) to switch\n   to the backup PTP
    LSP and to reoptimize the primary PTP LSP in order\n   to improve the PTP reliability.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Optical networking poses a number challenges for Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS).  Fundamentally, optical technology is an analog rather
    than digital technology whereby the optical layer is lowest in the transport hierarchy
    and hence has an intimate relationship with the physical geography of the network.
    \ This contribution surveys some of the aspects of optical networks that impact
    routing and identifies possible GMPLS responses for each: (1) Constraints arising
    from the design of new software controllable network elements, (2) Constraints
    in a single all-optical domain without wavelength conversion, (3) Complications
    arising in more complex networks incorporating both all-optical and opaque architectures,
    and (4) Impacts of diversity constraints.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

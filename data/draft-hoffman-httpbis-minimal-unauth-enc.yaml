  script: Latn
  content: "   HTTP/2 can be run under TLS as a transport if the origin for the\n
    \  request is an https: URL.  There is a desire to encrypt much more web\n   traffic
    than just the traffic that is already encrypted with TLS.\n   This document proposes
    a method to establish unauthenticated\n   encryption within normal HTTP/2 flows
    to prevent passive surveillance\n   using as few as zero additional round trips.
    \ The method described\n   here is definitely less robust than normal TLS and
    is thus not\n   offered as an alternative to TLS for https: URLs; it is only offered\n
    \  as a fast way within HTTP/2 to cause unauthenticated encryption.\n\n\t "

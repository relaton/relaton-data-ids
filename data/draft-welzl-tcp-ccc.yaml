  content: "   This document specifies a method, TCP-CCC, to combine the congestion\n
    \  controls of multiple TCP connections between the same pair of hosts.\n   This
    can have several performance benefits, and it makes it possible\n   to precisely
    assign a share of the congestion window to the\n   connections based on priorities.
    \ This document also addresses the\n   problem that TCP connections between the
    same pair of hosts may not\n   share the same path.  We discuss methods to detect
    if, or enforce\n   that connections traverse a common bottleneck.\n\n\n\t "

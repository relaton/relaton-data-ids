abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute\n
    \  for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to\n   determine
    the reachability path of requests to a target.  A new\n   mechanism for media-loopback
    calls is also being defined separately,\n   which enables test calls to be generated
    which result in media being\n   looped back to the originator.  This document
    is a strawman proposal\n   for a means of performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style
    test calls\n   using the media-loopback mechanism, in order to test the media
    path\n   when SIP sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.\n\n\n\t "

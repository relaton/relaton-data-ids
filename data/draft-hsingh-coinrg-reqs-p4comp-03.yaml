  content: "   For distributed computing, the P4 research community has published
    a\n   paper to show how to split a P4 program into sub-programs which run\n   on
    heterogeneous network nodes in a network.  Examples of nodes are a\n   network
    switch, a smartNIC, or a host machine.  The paper has\n   developed artifacts
    to split program based on latency, data rate,\n   cost, etc.  However, the paper
    does not mention any requirements.  To\n   provide guidance, this document covers
    requirements for splitting P4\n   programs for heterogeneous network nodes.\n\n\t "

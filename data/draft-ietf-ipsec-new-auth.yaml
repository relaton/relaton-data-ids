  content: "The IP Authentication Header (AH) is used to provide connectionless integrity
    and data origin authentication for IP datagrams (hereafter referred to as just
    'authentication'), and to provide protection against replays.  This latter, optional
    service may be selected when a Security Association is established.  AH provides
    authentication for as much of the IP header as possible, as well as for upper
    level protocol data.  However, some IP header fields may change in transit and
    the value of these fields, when the packet arrives at the receiver, may not be
    predictable by the transmitter.  The values of such fields cannot be protected
    by AH.  Thus the protection provided to the IP header by AH is somewhat piecemeal.\n\t "

  content: "ENUM is an Internet information service for the benefit\nof private users
    of the Internet.  It makes use of\nauthoritative E.164 telephone number data maintained\namong
    public telecommunication service providers to\nenable some useful value added
    messaging services on\nthe Internet.  Anyone can (and several companies do)\nprovide
    these ENUM services competitively today without\ngovernment involvement or regulation.
    \ Other providers\ncan enter the marketplace.\nAlthough one ENUM provisioning
    option is to denominate\na particular Internet offering worldwide as 'public'\nand
    'authoritative,' there are significant technical,\noperational, and regulatory
    burdens and costs created\nthat make the prospect rather daunting at best.  It
    is\nalso unnecessary.  A more effective alternative is to\nfacilitate ENUM service
    providers' access to authoritative \nE.164 number and customer information through
    fair and \nnon-discriminatory contractual arrangements with public \ntelecommunication
    service providers, and leave the rest \nto a competitive ENUM provider marketplace
    and the \ncommercial relationships between Internet Service \nProviders and public
    telecommunication carriers.\n\t "

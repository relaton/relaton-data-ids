  content: "   The Internet provides standardized mechanisms for resolving\n   identifiers,
    such as domain names, to network locations.  These\n   mechanisms assume that
    a client already knows the identifier of the\n   resource it wishes to access.
    \ Emerging classes of applications,\n   including augmented reality, autonomous
    systems, robotics, and\n   spatial computing, operate under a different assumption.
    \ In these\n   systems, discovery begins with physical presence and observer context\n
    \  rather than with a predefined name.\n\n   This document describes the architectural
    gap addressed by a\n   Geospatial Resource Discovery service.  It defines the
    problem space,\n   explains why existing standards are insufficient, and outlines
    a\n   conceptual architecture for spatial discovery.  This document is\n   informational
    and architectural in nature.  It does not define a\n   protocol, data format,
    or implementation.\n\n\t "

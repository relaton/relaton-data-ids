  content: "Remote configuration of network devices which implement IPsec-\n   related
    services is desirable as a matter of convenience and of\n   scale. In some cases,
    these devices are installed on a network with\n   no prior configuration. In such
    cases, secure mechanisms for\n   bootstrap configuration are required. In this
    document the associated\n   issues are examined, and a multi-tiered approach is
    proposed from\n   which a specific method may be selected based upon the security\n
    \  requirements of the environment in which the security device exists.\n   While
    the primary devices considered here are security gateways and\n   bump-in-the-wire
    encryptors, many of the resulting conclusions may\n   extend to other devices,
    including host IPsec implementations.\n\t "

  content: "   DNS RR types with numbers in the range 0xFA00-0xFDFF are now included\n
    \  in special treatment like DS RR type specified in [RFC4035].\n   Authoritative
    servers, DNSSEC signers, and recursive resolvers need\n   to extend the conditions
    for DS special handling to also include this\n   range.  This means: being authoritative
    on the parent side of a\n   delegation; being signed by the parent; being provided
    along with\n   delegations by the parent.  DNSSEC validators also need to implement\n
    \  downgrade protection described in Section 5.3.\n\n\t "

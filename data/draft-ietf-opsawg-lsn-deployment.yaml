  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address Translation
    (NAT) layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier-Grade NAT (also
    known as CGN or Large-Scale NAT).  The CGN infrastructure will often form a NAT444
    environment as the subscriber home network will likely also maintain a subscriber-side
    NAT function.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is a major driver compelling
    some operators to implement CGN.  Although operators may wish to deploy IPv6 to
    strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near- term needs may not be satisfied
    with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This document provides a practical integration
    model that allows the CGN platform to be integrated into the network, meeting
    the connectivity needs of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting
    existing services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN brings.  The model
    included in this document utilizes BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, which allow for virtual routing
    separation, helping ease the CGN's impact on the network.  This document does
    not intend to defend the merits of CGN.\n\t "

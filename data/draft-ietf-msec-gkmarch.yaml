    key management protocols to support a variety of application, transport, and network
    layer security protocols.  It also defines the group security association (GSA),
    and describes the key management protocols that help establish a GSA.  The framework
    and guidelines described in this document permit a modular and flexible design
    of group key management protocols for a variety of different settings that are
    specialized to applications needs.  MSEC key management protocols may be used
    to facilitate secure one-to-many, many-to-many, or one-to-one communication.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

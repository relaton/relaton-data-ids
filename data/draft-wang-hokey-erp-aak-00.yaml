  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework\nsupporting
    multiple types of authentication methods.\n\nThe EAP Re-authentication Protocol
    (ERP) specifies extensions to EAP\nand the EAP keying hierarchy to support an
    EAP method-independent\nprotocol for efficient re-authentication between the peer
    and an EAP\nre-authentication server through any authenticator.\n\nAuthenticated
    Anticipatory Keying (AAK) is a method by which\ncryptographic keying material
    may be established prior to handover\nupon one or more candidate attachment points
    (CAPs), AAK uses the AAA\ninfrastructure for key transport.\n\nThis document specifies

abstract:
- content: "<p>The Universal Zero-Port Interconnect Framework (UZPIF) describes a
    post-port networking model in which communication is established via outbound,
    identity-bound sessions to Rendezvous Nodes (RNs). By removing publicly reachable
    listening ports at endpoints, UZPIF aims to reduce exposure to Internet-wide scanning
    and unsolicited ingress, and to constrain a broad class of lateral-movement vectors.
    This document outlines architectural motivation, a high-level security model,
    operational and economic considerations, a governance concept (Pantheon), and
    an incremental migration approach. UZPIF is intended to be read alongside companion
    work describing the Universal Zero-Port Transport Protocol (UZP; [UZP]) and TLS-UZP
    ([TLS-DPA]).</p>"

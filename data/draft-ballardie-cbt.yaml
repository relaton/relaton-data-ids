- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "One of the central problems in one-to-many wide-area communications is
    forming the delivery tree - the collection of nodes and links that a multicast
    packet traverses. Significant problems remain to be solved in the area of multicast
    tree formation, the problem of scaling being paramount among these.                               This
    draft presents a new scalable multicast architecture, followed by a protocol description,
    that can provide low-cost, relatively simple, and efficient multicast routing.
    We also show how this architecture is decoupled from (though dependent on) unicast
    routing, and is therefore easy to install in an internet that comprises multiple
    heterogeneous unicast routing algorithms.             A mailing list is in place
    in idmr@cs.ucl.ac.uk (subscribe to idmr-request@cs.ucl.ac.uk) to discuss this
    and other inter-domain  multicast routing issues.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a problem statement on collaborative\n   mitigation
    of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.\n   The evolving trends of DDoS
    attacks, including their types,\n   intensities, and attack methods, pose formidable
    challenges to\n   existing defense systems.  This problem statement examines the\n
    \  current defense landscape, highlighting the distributed deployment of\n   defense
    systems across various network positions and the imbalances\n   in defense capabilities.
    \ Collaboration is crucial for effective DDoS\n   attack mitigation, considering
    that a considerable number of attacks\n   are spread across operators.  The existing
    collaborative framework,\n   DOTS, shows promise but requires addressing these
    challenges to\n   enhance its efficacy.  The existing collaborative framework
    DOTS\n   demonstrates potential, but there are still numerous challenges in\n
    \  its practical application.  This document aims to address these key\n   issues
    that impact the implementation of collaborative technologies.\n\n\t "

  content: "  This document describes a self-managed network identifying network\n
    \  problems during failures and repairing them.  Self-managed Network\n   Element
    (sNE) architectures and Network Management System (sNMS)\n   architectures for
    centrally and distributedly managed networks are\n   described.  A hierarchy among
    repairing entities is defined.  An in-\n   band message format for Metro Ethernet
    networks is proposed for the\n   fault management communication.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies FTP commands to download thumbnails of remote\nimages,
    remove entire directory trees, request the amount of storage\nspace available
    to the user, and to request the size of a remote\ndirectory and its contents.
    \ The commands are designed to reduce the\nnumber of server / client exchanges,
    provide information that was not\npreviously available, and to reduce bandwidth
    requirements for some\nhigher level operations.\n\t "

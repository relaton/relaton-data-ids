- language: en

  content: "TMMH is a 'universal' hash function suitable for message\nauthentication
    in the Wegman-Carter paradigm.  It is simple, quick,\nand especially appropriate
    for Digital Signal Processors and other\nprocessors with a fast multiply operation.
    \ This document specifies\nversion two of TMMH, which eliminates the large storage
    requirement\nfor hashing large messages that was present in version one.\n\t "

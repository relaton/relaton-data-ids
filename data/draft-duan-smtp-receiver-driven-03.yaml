  content: "The Differentiated Mail Transfer Protocol (DMTP) provides simple\nextensions
    to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that enable\nreceivers to exercise
    greater control over the email delivery\nprocess.  The current SMTP-based email
    delivery architecture is\nfundamentally sender-driven and distinctly lacks receiver
    control\nover the message delivery mechanisms.  This document describes DMTP\nthat
    enables receivers to classify senders into three categories --\nallowed, denied,
    and unclassified -- and process the delivery of\nmessages from each category independently.
    \ As is the current\npractice, receivers may directly accept messages from senders
    in the\nallowed category and decline senders in the denied category.  In\naddition,
    DMTP receivers require senders in the unclassified category\nto store messages
    on the senders' own mail servers.  Such messages\nare retrieved only if and when
    the end receivers wish to do so.  By\ngranting  greater control over message  delivery
    to receivers and\nimposing greater message storage and maintenance overhead on
    senders,\nDMTP provides  significant  advantages in  controlling spam.  DMTP\nalso
    easily operates in conjunction  with (but does not require) many\ncurrently deployed
    anti-spam techniques.\n\t "

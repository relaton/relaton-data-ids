  content: "   IGP Flexible Algorithm allows IGPs to compute constraint-based paths\n
    \  over the network using different types of metrics or constraints.\n\n   This
    document defines a new type of constraint called \"Time\n   Constraint\", which
    can be used to control the time period during\n   which a Flex-Algorithm takes
    effect for constraint-based path\n   calculation.  Such mechanism may be useful
    in network scenarios where\n   either the traffic demand or the characteristics
    of the network\n   varies as a function of time.  The procedures of using Time\n
    \  Constraint in Flexible Algorithm is also described.\n\n\t "

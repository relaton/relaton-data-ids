  content: "   Network mobility (NEMO) provides session continuity for mobile nodes\n
    \  (MN) while moving in vehicles without their involvement in signaling\n   process.
    NEMO Basic support protocol is standardized to provide\n   network mobility support.\n\n
    \  Current mobility management protocols rely on a central mobility\n   anchor
    in order to provide mobility support for the mobile nodes.\n   These centralized
    approaches show some big issues, such as a single\n   point of failure, non-optimal
    routing, and scalability.\n   Ever-increasing demand for the mobile traffic changes
    the network\n   architecture from hierarchical to flat architecture, and distributed\n
    \  mobility management (DMM) approaches are being researched to adapt\n   the
    new flat architecture and overcome big above issues.\n\n   This document presents
    about detailed protocol operation to support\n   network mobility in the DMM domain.\n\n\n\t "

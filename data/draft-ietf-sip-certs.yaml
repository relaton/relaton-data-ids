  content: "This document defines a credential service that allows Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs) to use a SIP event package to discover the certificates
    of other users.  This mechanism allows User Agents that want to contact a given
    Address-of-Record (AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the
    credential service, which returns an authenticated response containing that certificate.
    \ The credential service also allows users to store and retrieve their own certificates
    and private keys. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

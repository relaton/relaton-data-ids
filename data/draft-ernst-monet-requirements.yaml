  content: "The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuous\nInternet
    connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support). In\ncontrast, network mobility
    support is concerned with situations where\nan entire network changes its point
    of attachment to the Internet and\nthus its reachability in the topology. We shall
    refer to such a\nnetwork as a mobile network (MONET). This document tries to identify\nwhat
    constraints limit the implementation and the deployment of a\npotentially and
    ideally good solution, and what requirements\nsolutions must comply to. Our main
    aim is to raise the discussion on\nthe mailing list.\n\t "

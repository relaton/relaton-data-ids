  content: "Multihoming technology improves the availability of host and network connectivity.
    \ Since the behaviors of fixed and mobile networks differ, distinct architectures
    for each have been discussed and proposed.  This document proposes a common architecture
    for both mobile and fixed networking environments, using mobile IP (RFC 3775)
    and Network Mobility (NEMO; RFC 3963).  The proposed architecture requires a modification
    of mobile IP and NEMO so that multiple Care-of Addresses (CoAs) can be used.  In
    addition, multiple Home Agents (HAs) that are located in different places are
    required for redundancy.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

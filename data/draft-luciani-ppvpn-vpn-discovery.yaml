  content: "Virtual private networks are becoming a common offering of many\nservice
    providers.  There are many technologies with which to\nimplement a VPN service,
    ranging from MPLS to GRE to IPSEC.  A\ncommon requirement of all VPN technologies
    is the need to discover\nall of the sites, or at least all the provider equipment
    associated\nwith the sites, that are in a particular VPN.   DNS provides a\nsimple
    and commonly available mechanism for site discovery that is\nindependent of any
    signaling or tunneling protocol.  This draft\nproposes the use of DNS as a discovery
    mechanism for VPN maintenance\nand control.  \n\n\t "

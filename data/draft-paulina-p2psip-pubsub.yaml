  content: "This document introduces a generic publish-subscribe protocol, that \ncan
    be built on top of RELOAD or P2PP. It works both for the \nunstructured and DHT-based
    Peer-to-Peer networks. Moreover it is \nhighly customizable to address the optimization
    issues and support \ndifferent topology structures. It can be used to implement
    P2P-SIP \nservices such as presence or event notification.\n\t "

  content: "   In this document we first identify the (neighbor-AS based) Group Best\n
    \  Paths for an address prefix as the sufficient subset that can be\n   advertised
    by a BGP route reflector or a BGP confederation ASBR to\n   eliminate the MED-type
    route oscillations in a network.  We then\n   propose a BGP extension to support
    the advertisement of the Group\n   Best Paths by a route reflector or a confederation
    ASBR.  The\n   extension also allows the advertisement of all the paths in a group\n
    \  that survive the MED comparison, thus achieving the same routing\n   consistency
    as the full IBGP mesh.  The proposed mechanisms are\n   designed such that the
    vast majority of the BGP speakers in a network\n   need only minor software changes
    in order to deploy the mechanisms.\n\t "

  content: "   Satellite networks present some interesting challenges for packet\n
    \  networking.  The entire topology is continually in motion, with links\n   that
    are far less reliable than what is common in terrestrial\n   networks.  Some changes
    to link connectivity can be anticipated due\n   to orbital mechanics.\n\n   This
    document proposes a scalable routing architecture for satellite\n   networks based
    on existing routing protocols and mechanisms, enhanced\n   with scheduled link
    connectivity change information.  This document\n   proposes no protocol changes.\n\n
    \  This document presents the author's view and is neither the product\n   of
    the IETF nor a consensus view of the community.\n\n\t "

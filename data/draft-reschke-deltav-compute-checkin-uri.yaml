  content: "In many cases, a versioning-aware client might want to display/\ninclude
    the URI of the version it's editing while it's being edited.\nFor instance, an
    editor might include this as meta information, or\nthe author of a document might
    want to know the URI of the version\nbefore it's checked in. A well-known example
    is the W3C way of\nreferring to document versions in recommendations: it contains\nreferences
    to 'the current version', to 'this version' and to the\n'previous version'. Something
    like this is currently impossible with\nWebDAV versioning [RFC3253], as the version
    URI is determined at the\ntime of CHECKIN.\nDistribution of this document is unlimited.
    Please send comments to\nthe WebDAV versioning (delta-V) mailing list at\nietf-dav-versioning@w3.org

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a profile for certificates that are issued for
    validation of the digital signature produced by a single signing operation. Each
    certificate is created at the time of signing and bound to the signed content.
    The associated signing key is generated, used to produce a single digital signature,
    and then immediately destroyed. The certificate never expires and is never revoked,
    which simplifies long-term validation.</p>"

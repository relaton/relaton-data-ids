  content: "   This document defines a profile for certificates that are issued for\n
    \  validation of the digital signature produced by a single signing\n   operation.
    \ Each certificate is created at the time of signing and\n   bound to the signed
    content.  The associated signing key is\n   generated, used to produce a single
    digital signature, and then\n   immediately destroyed.  The certificate never
    expires and is never\n   revoked, which simplifies long-term validation.\n\n\t "

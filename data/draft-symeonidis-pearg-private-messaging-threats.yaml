  content: "   Modern email and instant messaging applications offer private\n   communications
    between users.  As IM and Email network designs become\n   more similar, both
    share common concerns about security and privacy\n   of the information exchanged.
    \ However, the solutions available to\n   mitigate these threats and to comply
    with the requirements may\n   differ.  The two communication methods are, in fact,
    built on\n   differing assumptions and technologies.  Assuming a scenario of\n
    \  untrusted servers, we analyze threats against message delivery and\n   storage,
    the requirements that these systems need, and the solutions\n   that exist in
    order to help implement secure and private messaging.\n   From the discussed technological
    challenges and requirements, we aim\n   to derive an open standard for private
    messaging.\n\n\t "

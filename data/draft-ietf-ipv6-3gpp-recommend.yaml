  content: "This document contains recommendations from the Internet\nEngineering
    Task Force (IETF) IPv6 Working Group to the Third\nGeneration Partnership Project
    (3GPP) community regarding the use\nof IPv6 in the 3GPP standards. Specifically,
    this document\nrecommends that the 3GPP:\n1. Specify that multiple prefixes may
    be assigned to each\nprimary PDP context,\n2. Require that a given prefix must
    not be assigned to more\nthan one primary PDP context, and\n3. Allow 3GPP nodes
    to use multiple identifiers within those\nprefixes, including randomly generated
    identifiers.\nThe IPv6 Working Group supports the use of IPv6 within 3GPP and\noffers
    these recommendations in a spirit of open cooperation\nbetween the IPv6 Working
    Group and the 3GPP community.  Since the\noriginal publication of this document
    as an Internet-Draft, the\n3GPP has adopted the primary recommendations of this
    document.\n\t "

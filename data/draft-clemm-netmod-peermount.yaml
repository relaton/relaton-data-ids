  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a mechanism, Peer-Mount, that allows YANG\n   datastores
    to reference and incorporate information from remote\n   datastores.  This is
    accomplished by extending YANG with the ability\n   to define mount points that
    reference data nodes in other YANG\n   subtrees and subsequently allowing those
    data nodes to be accessed by\n   client applications as if they were part of the
    same local data\n   hierarchy.  In addition, means to manage and administer tho
    mount\n   points are provided.  This facilitates the development of\n   applications
    that need to access network-wide data that treanscends\n   individual network
    devices while ensuring network-wide data\n   consistency.  One example concerns
    example applications that require\n   a network inventory and/or network topology
    with access to select\n   management data within the nodes that comprise it.\n\n
    \  The concept of Peer-Mount was first introduced in an earlier Internet\n   Draft
    that was no longer pursued due to lack of interest at the time.\n   It is being
    revived now in light of renewed IETF interest in network\n   inventory, network
    topology, and related use cases, for which Peer-\n   Mount is of specific interest.
    \ Other concepts defined in the earlier\n   draft, notably Alias-Mount, are not
    considered here since they\n   provide other capabilities that are less applicable
    to those topics.\n\n\t "

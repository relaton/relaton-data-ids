  content: "This document describes a Simple Extended Area Network (SEAN) architecture
    to offer comprehensive services as part of a Full Service Network (FSN) by service
    providers.  The motivation for this document is that today's networks are far
    too complicated to design, deploy and operate, and incurs network overhead and
    inefficiencies that would soon drive up the costs and the rates to consumers.
    \ This cost and complexity situation is also a barrier to deploy advanced and
    useful network services that offer audio-visual communications.  There are technologies
    like XDSL available today that can simplify network implementations and operations
    and at the same time provide the bandwidth and other capabilities that allows
    migration to a simpler network architecture in the future.  This document describes
    the current problems that thwart progress and offers a solution based on XDSL
    technology to overcome or avoid unnecessary complexities and limitations.                                                               This
    document does not specify an Internet Standard of any kind. It is presented for
    discussion purpose only.\n\t "

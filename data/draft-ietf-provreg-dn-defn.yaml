    communications protocols in light of the current \nand evolving scope and utility
    of DNS, domain name registries and \nrelated entities. In order for this work
    to be truly effective and \nbroadly applicable, it is important that accepted

    \npoint for the requisite dialogue that will ultimately foster the \ndetermination
    and acceptance of these new protocols. This document \nobsoletes <draft-rader-dnwhois-defn-00.txt>.\n\t "

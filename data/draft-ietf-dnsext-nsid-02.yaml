  content: "With the increased use of DNS anycast, load balancing, and other mechanisms
    allowing more than one DNS name server to share a single IP address, it is sometimes
    difficult to tell which of a pool of name servers has answered a particular query.
    \ While existing ad-hoc mechanisms allow an operator to send follow-up queries
    when it is necessary to debug such a configuration, the only completely reliable
    way to obtain the identity of the name server that responded is to have the name
    server include this information in the response itself.  This note defines a protocol
    extension to support this functionality. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

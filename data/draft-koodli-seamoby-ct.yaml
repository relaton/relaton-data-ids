  content: "Mobile nodes enhance the performance of their connections\nacross wireless
    media by establishing various kinds of state\n(context), in order to use the available
    bandwidth securely and\neconomically.  During handover from one access router
    to another, a\nbandwidth-constrained mobile node needs to have state information\npassed
    from the previous router to the new one.  This document\nproposes a framework
    for control structures that enable authorized\ncontext transfers.  We demonstrate
    how the proposed framework could\nbe applied during handovers so that the applications
    running on\nthe mobile node could operate with minimal disruption, by reducing\nlatency
    and packet losses\n\t "

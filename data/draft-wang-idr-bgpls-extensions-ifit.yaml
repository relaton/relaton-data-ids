  content: "   This document extends Node and Link Attribute TLVs to Border Gateway\n
    \  Protocol-Link State (BGP-LS) to advertise supported In-situ Flow\n   Information
    Telemetry (IFIT) capabilities at node and/or link\n   granularity.  An ingress
    router cannot insert IFIT-Data-Fields for\n   packets going into a path unless
    an egress router has indicated via\n   signaling that it has the capability to
    process IFIT-Data-Fields.  In\n   addition, such advertisements would be useful
    for entities (e.g.\n   Path Computation Element (PCE)) to gather each router's
    IFIT\n   capability for achieving the computation of end-to-end Traffic\n   Engineering
    (TE) paths that be able to fulfill the visibility of on-\n   path OAM data.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes and lists the functional requirements of a\nfederated
    file system and defines related terms.  Our intent is to\nuse this draft as a
    starting point and refine it, with input and\nfeedback from the file system community
    and other interested parties,\nuntil we reach general agreement.  We will then
    begin, again with the\nhelp of any interested parties, to define standard, open
    federated\nfile system protocols that satisfy these requirements and are\nsuitable
    for implementation and deployment.\n\t "

  content: "   IP spoofing always is bothering us along with the Internet invention.\n
    \  With the rapid development of IPv6 next generation Internet, this\n   issue
    is more prominent. Though many studies have made their\n   contributions to the
    prevention of IP-spoofing, the most excellent\n   one is the SAVI (Source Address
    Validation Improvement) proposal\n   advocated by IETF, since it can prevent IP-spoofing
    from happening by\n   automatically binding the key properties of hosts in layer2
    access\n   subnet. Nevertheless, till now, SAVI only focuses on the IPv6 stack\n
    \  and simple network access scenarios. To the best of our knowledge,\n   there
    is no solution even has paid attention to IPv4/IPv6 transition\n   scenarios.
    Given the fact that IPv4/IPv6 transition will continue to\n   be adopted for a
    long period of time, this issue is becoming\n   increasingly urgent. However,
    since transition schemes are plenty and\n   diverse, hardly can an ordinary solution
    satisfy all the requirements\n   of various transition scenarios. In this document,
    we present an\n   improved general SAVI-based framework of IP source address validation\n
    \  and traceback for IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios. To achieve this\n   goal,
    we extract essential and mutual properties from these\n   transition schemes,
    and create sub-solutions for each property.\n   Naturally, if one transition scheme
    is proposed by combining some\n   properties, the corresponding sub-solutions
    would be included into\n   its IP source address validation and traceback solution.
    Therefore,\n   the advantage of this framework is its capability to adapt to all
    the\n   transition schemes.\n\n\t "

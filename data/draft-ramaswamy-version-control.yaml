  content: "   Version control has a wide range applications starting from a simple\n
    \  ASCII text file management to a complex software source management.\n \n   This
    document discusses the basic requirement and framework for an\n   open interface
    for Version Control System. Such an open interface\n   would bring platform independence
    as well as flexibility and\n   extensibility.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) works by validating so called\n
    \  chains of authority.  The start of these chains of authority are\n   usually
    public keys that are anchored in the DNS clients.  These keys\n   are known as
    the so called trust anchors.\n\n   This memo describes a method how these client
    trust anchors can be\n   replaced using the DNS validation and querying mechanisms
    (in-band)\n   when the key pairs used for signing by zone owner are rolled.\n\n
    \  This memo also describes a method to establish the validity of trust\n   anchors
    for initial configuration, or priming, using out of band\n   mechanisms.\n\t "

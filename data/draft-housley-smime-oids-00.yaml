  content: "   When the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group was chartered, an object\n
    \  identifier arc was donated by RSA Data Security for use by that\n   working
    group.  This document describes the object identifiers that\n   were assigned
    in that donated arc, it transfers control of that arc\n   to IANA, and it establishes
    IANA allocation policies for any future\n   assignments within that arc.\n\n\t "

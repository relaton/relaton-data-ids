  content: "This document describes goals for Localized Mobility Management (LMM)\n
    \  for IP layer mobility, such Mobile IP and Mobile IPv6.  These goals\n   are
    intended to guide the design of a protocol specification for LMM.\n   Localized
    Mobility Management, in general, introduces enhancements to\n   IP layer mobility
    protocols to reduce the amount of latency in IP\n   layer mobility management
    messages exchanged between a Mobile Node\n   (MN) and its peer entities. In addition,
    LMM seeks to reduce the\n   amount of signaling over the global Internet when
    a mobile node\n   traverses within a defined local domain.  The identified goals
    are\n   essential for localized mobility management functionality. They are\n
    \  intended to be used as a guide for analysis on the observed benefits\n   over
    the identified goals for architecting and deploying LMM schemes.\n\t "

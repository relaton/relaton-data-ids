  content: "   This document provides security methods based on identity based\n   cryptography
    to protect DHCP messages.  Identity based cryptography\n   is a special kind of
    public key cryptography.  Specifically, an\n   authetication protocol based on
    IBS (identity based signature)\n   algorithms is proposed.  A key distribution
    method adopting IBE (\n   identity based encryption) algorithms is also proposed,
    where key is\n   used as a shared secret in calculating authentication information\n
    \  according to authentication protocol specified in RFC 3315.\n\n\t "

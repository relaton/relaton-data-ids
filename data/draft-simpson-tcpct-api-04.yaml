  content: "TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) [RFC6013] deter spoofing of\n\n\n  |\nconnections
    and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder\n(server) state during
    the initial handshake.  The Initiator (client)\nhas sole responsibility for ensuring
    required delays between\nconnections.  The cookie exchange may carry data, limited
    to inhibit\namplification and reflection denial of service attacks.\n\nThis document
    provides a sockets Application Program Interface (API)\nto support \"basic\" and
    \"advanced\" TCPCT applications.  TCP/IP\napplications written using the sockets
    API have enjoyed a high degree\nof portability.\n\nCopyright Notice\n\nCopyright

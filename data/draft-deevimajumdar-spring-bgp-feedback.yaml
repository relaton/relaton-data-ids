  content: "   In support of Segment Routing(SR), routing protocols advertise a\n
    \  variety of identifiers used to define the segments that direct packet\n   forwarding.\n\n
    \  In cases where the information advertised by a given protocol\n   instance
    is either internally inconsistent or conflicts with\n   advertisements from another
    protocol instance a means of notifying\n   the originator about the inconsistency
    is required.  This document\n   defines a generic mechanism to notify the BGP
    originator about the\n   inconsistency in the network.\n\n\n\t "

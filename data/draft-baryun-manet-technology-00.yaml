  content: "   This documents describes three subnet technologies requirements,\n
    \  and considerations. These subnets are at layer 2 of the Mobile\n   Ad hoc Network
    (MANET) protocols, which have some implications on\n   router protocols and interfaces
    considerations. For example Packet\n   Radio subnets (PRNETs), Low power and Lossy
    subnets (LLNs), and\n   Satellite subnets (SNETs), have different service requirements\n
    \  which needs considerations when designing MANET routing protocols.\n   This
    document also outlines use-case of these MANET subnets, and\n   requirements that
    may be considered in MANET routing, for the users\n   and designers information.\n\n\t "

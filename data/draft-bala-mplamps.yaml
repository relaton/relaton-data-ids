  content: "Mostly Pointless Lamp Switching (MPLampS) is an architecture for carrying
    electricity over IP (with an MPLS control plane).  According to our marketing
    department, MPLampS has the potential to dramatically lower the price, ease the
    distribution and usage, and improve the manageability of delivering electricity.
    \ This document is motivated by such work as SONET/SDH over IP/MPLS (with apologies
    to the authors).  Readers of the previous work have been observed scratching their
    heads and muttering, \"What next?\".  This document answers that question.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

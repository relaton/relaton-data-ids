  content: "   The \" ANY \" query type in DNS requests the server to return all\n
    \  available resource records for a given domain name.  While RFC 8482\n   defines
    a mechanism for authoritative servers to minimize ANY\n   responses, a recursive
    resolver may still generate an ANY query\n   response directly from its cache,
    thereby bypassing the authoritative\n   side's ANY query minimization strategy.
    \ This document provides\n   supplementary guidance for recursive resolvers on
    processing ANY\n   queries to mitigate potential operational and security issues.\n\n\t "

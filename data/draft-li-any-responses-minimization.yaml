abstract:
- content: <p>The " ANY " query type in DNS requests the server to return all available
    resource records for a given domain name. While RFC 8482 defines a mechanism for
    authoritative servers to minimize ANY responses, a recursive resolver may still
    generate an ANY query response directly from its cache, thereby bypassing the
    authoritative side's ANY query minimization strategy. This document provides supplementary
    guidance for recursive resolvers on processing ANY queries to mitigate potential
    operational and security issues.</p>

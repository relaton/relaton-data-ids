  content: "   As the development of cloud computing, increasing services have been\n
    \  migrated from enterprise sites to clouds, so the connections between\n   sites
    and clouds are critical for enterprises.\n\n   SRv6 provides a sourcing routing
    mechanism to connect the enterprise\n   sites and clouds by programming the end-to-end
    path at the ingress\n   node.  In this scenario, the SRv6 packets may traverse
    multiple\n   network domains and some of them may not be SRv6-capable.\n\n   In
    order to support SRv6 end-to-end path programming, this document\n   proposes
    the mechanism of SRv6 traversing IPv4 network.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows calls to both addresses\n
    \  of record (AORs) such as sip:alice@example.com and telephone numbers\n   with
    either sip or tel schemes such as tel:+12127771234.  As opposed\n   to the AOR
    where the domain specifies the exact location or realm of\n   the user and a reject
    code provides enough visiblity to the calling\n   party to exit gracefully (e.g.
    a 404 indicates that there is no point\n   in trying further as the requested
    user either does not exist or is\n   offline with no voicemail) with telephone
    numbers (TNs) this is not\n   the case.  With more and more TNs representing actual
    IP endpoints\n   there is a need to differentiate in an error code between rejecting
    a\n   call due to a misdialed number (i.e. the number does not exist) and a\n
    \  number that is just not associated with an IP endpoint (for example\n   in
    a case where there is no billing relationship and as such the\n   rejecting proxy
    cannot forward to a PSTN termination provider.  This\n   specification defines
    a new SIP response code (No Service Reject -\n   nsr) for this purpose.\n\n\t "

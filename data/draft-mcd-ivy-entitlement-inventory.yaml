  content: "   This document proposes a YANG module for incorporating entitlements\n
    \  in a network inventory.  Entitlements define the rights for their\n   holder
    to use specific capabilities in a network element(s).  The\n   model is rooted
    by the concept of the capabilities offered by a\n   network element, enabled by
    the held entitlements, and considers\n   entitlement scope, how they are assigned,
    and when they expire.  The\n   model introduces a descriptive definition of capabilities
    and the\n   entitlement use restrictions, supporting entitlement administration\n
    \  and the understanding of the capabilities available through the\n   network.\n\n\t "

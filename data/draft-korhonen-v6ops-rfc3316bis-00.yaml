  content: "   As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks\n
    \  progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to\n   the
    Internet.  Standardization organizations are making Internet\n   Protocol version
    6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications.\n   However, the concept of IPv6 covers
    many aspects and numerous\n   specifications.  In addition, the characteristics
    of cellular links\n   in terms of bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements
    on how\n   IPv6 is used.  This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that\n
    \  attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Universal Mobile\n   Telecommunications
    System (UMTS), or Evolved Packet System (EPS)\n   networks (Hereafter collectively
    referred to as 3GPP networks).  This\n   document also lists out specific IPv6
    functionality that needs to be\n   implemented in addition what is already prescribed
    in the IPv6 Node\n   Requirements document.  It also discusses some issues relating
    to the\n   use of these components when operating in these networks.  This\n   document
    obsoletes RFC 3316.\n\n\t "

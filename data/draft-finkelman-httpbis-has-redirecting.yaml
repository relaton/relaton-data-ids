  content: "   This document motivates the need for clarifications of client\n   behavior
    in cases of HTTP redirect to a content delivery network\n   (CDN) when the redirected
    object contains relative references.  This\n   document focuses on HTTP Adaptive
    Streaming (HAS) use cases, but it\n   might be possible to generalize to other
    use cases.  The goal of this\n   document is to present the current status of
    things and to explore\n   potential solutions.\n\n\t "

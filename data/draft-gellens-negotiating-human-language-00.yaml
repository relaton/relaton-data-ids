  content: "   Users have various human language needs, abilities, and preferences\n
    \  regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When establishing\n   interactive
    communication \"calls\" there needs to be a way to\n   communicate and ideally
    match (i.e., negotiate) the caller's needs,\n   abilities, and preferences with
    the capabilities of the called party.\n   This is especially important with emergency
    calling, where a call can\n   be routed to a PSAP or call taker capable of communicating
    with the\n   user, or a translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call\n
    \  during setup, but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an\n   example,
    when calling an airline reservation desk).\n\n   This document describes the need
    and expected use, and discusses the\n   solution using either an existing or new
    SDP attribute.\n\n\t "

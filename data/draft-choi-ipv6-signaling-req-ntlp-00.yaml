  script: Latn
  content: "In this draft, we present the features of IPv6 protocol related to \nNSIS
    Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP) and requirements for IPv6 \nsignaling as NTLP
    in different Internet transport infrastructure, \nsuch as SDH/SONET switch, Optical
    cross-connect (OXC), ATM switch, \nEthernet switch, wireless system, and router.
    In this framework, user \ndata is transported via nodes in the data plane and
    signaling \nmessages are routed to NEs in the control plane. We propose the new
    \nprotocol, Internet Signaling Message Protocol (ISMP) for carrying \nsignaling
    messages. And other delivering methods of signaling \nmessages in IPv6 network
    are also presented in appendix.  \n\t "

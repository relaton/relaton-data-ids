  content: "It is often useful to be able to use distributed identity--an\nidentity
    from one organization for accessing resources from another.\nfor example it would
    be useful to use an identifier corresponding to\nyour work identity when accessing
    business partners' websites.\nSimilarly collaborative projects can benefit from
    distributed\nidentity.  This memo proposes a scheme for distributed identity that\nmeets
    requirements to minimize the risk of phishing attacks for HTTP-\nbased applications
    including websites.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a widely-implemented URI scheme, as World-Wide
    Web browsers are starting to appear on a variety of consumer electronic devices,
    such as television sets and television set-top boxes, which are capable of receiving
    television programming from either terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast,
    or cable.  In this context there is a need to reference television broadcasts
    using the URI format described in RFC 2396.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

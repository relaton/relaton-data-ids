  content: "   The BGP Flow Specification enables the distribution of traffic filter\n
    \  policies (traffic filters and actions) via BGP, facilitating DDoS\n   traffic
    filtering.  However, the traffic filterer in FSv1 and FSv2\n   predominantly focuses
    on IP header fields, which may not adequately\n   address new types of DDoS attack
    traffic characterized by constant\n   patterns within the packet content.  This
    document introduces a new\n   flow specification filter type designed for packet
    content filtering.\n   The match field includes offset-type, offset value, content-length,\n
    \  and content-value, encoded in the Flowspec NLRI.  This new filter\n   aims
    to augment DDoS defense capabilities.\n\n\t "

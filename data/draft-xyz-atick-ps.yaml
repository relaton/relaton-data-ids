  content: "   Problem Statement for Secure End to End Privacy Enabled Mapping\n   System
    for Identifier Locator separation systems is presented.  Since\n   identifiers
    are often carried in packet headers in clear, and mapping\n   systems are often
    designed to be accessible by any entity, to\n   preserve identifier's privacy,
    lookups to the mapping system should\n   be allowed only by authorized entities.
    \ In mapping systems, in\n   addition to privacy, security also requires special
    attention because\n   of the caches introduced into the data path.  Any denial
    of service\n   attacks on the cache should not allow the communication to come
    to an\n   end.\n\n\t "

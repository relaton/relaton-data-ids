  content: "   Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones\n
    \  and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other\n   by
    touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no\n   more than
    10 cm.  NFC standards cover communications protocols and\n   data exchange formats,
    and are based on existing radio-frequency\n   identification (RFID) standards
    including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.\n   The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and
    those defined by the NFC\n   Forum.  The NFC technology has been widely implemented
    and available\n   in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.
    \ This\n   document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN\n
    \  techniques.\n\n\t "

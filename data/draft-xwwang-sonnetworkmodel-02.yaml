  content: "In this paper, a swarm intelligence based self-organizing network\n   model
    was introduced to network providers.  The problems of the\n   existing network
    as well as the characteristics of the NGI (Next\n   Generation Internet) were
    described to illustrate the motivation of\n   the proposed self-organizing network
    model.  A network architecture\n   model based on swarm intelligence was introduced,
    the used technical\n   terms was defined.  The network parameters, network behaviors
    and\n   node stability under the proposed model were described.  Especially,\n
    \  some important QoS routing elements under the proposed model, such as\n   the
    user QoS routing requirements, link satisfaction degree, utility\n   computation,
    unicast path and multicast tree evaluation, mathematical\n   model of QoS route
    optimization and small-world behaviors, were\n   introduced.\n\n\t "

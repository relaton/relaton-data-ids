  content: "   The inter-satellite routing is the premis to ensure that the\n   satellite
    network provides end-to-end stable service covering the\n   whole globe.  However,
    the mature terrestrial network technologies\n   are difficult to directly apply
    to the satellite network because of\n   the highly dynamic network topology and
    the limited on-board\n   resources.  This issue is further exacerbated in LEO
    mega-\n   constellations.  In view of this challenge, this document presents a\n
    \  routing framework for LEO mega-constellation.  Based on the orbit\n   position
    characteristic and the predictable topology, this framwork\n   realizes flexible
    region division, establishes intra-region and\n   inter-region path, as well as
    completes end-to-end data forwarding.\n\n\t "

  content: "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has been extended to encompass\n
    \  point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As with\n   point-to-point
    MPLS LSPs the requirement to detect, handle and\n   diagnose control and dataplane
    defects is critical.\n\n   For operators deploying services based on P2MP MPLS
    LSPs the\n   detection and specification of how to handle those defects is\n   important
    because such defects may not only affect the fundamental\n   of an MPLS network,
    but also because they MAY impact service level\n   specification commitments for
    customers of their network.\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines a potential solution to IPv6 multihoming in\norder
    to stimulate discussion.  This proposal is a middle ground\nbetween the NOID and
    CB128 proposals.\nThis proposed solution relies on verification the crypto-based\nidentifier
    properties (using public-key crypto during uncommon\noperations), while allowing
    locator rewriting by (border) routers,\nwith no per-packet overhead.  The solution
    does have something which\ncould be viewed as a 'stack name' type of identifier,
    but this isn't\nexposed to upper layer protocols.  Instead it ensures that all
    upper\nlayer protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting while\nstill
    seeing a stable IPv6 address, even though the address\ninternally consists of
    64-bits worth of subnet locator plus 64-bits\nof crypto-based identifier.\n\nThis
    solution (and this draft) is remarkably similar to draft-\nnordmark-multi6-noid-00.txt;
    only issues related to prevention of\nredirection attacks differ.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo specifies an unified radio and optical control architecture\n
    \  based on Software Defined Networking (SDN).  The architecture is\n   designed
    for the purposes of end-to-end 5G Radio Access Networks\n   (RAN) service, which
    enables joint radio and optical network resoures\n   orchestration.  Based on
    this architecture, some new applications\n   could be achieved, such as enhanced
    Coordinated MultiPoint (eCoMP)\n   service, Baseband Unit (BBU) aggregation, fronthaul
    traffic\n   prediction and so on.\n\n\t "

  content: "   An IPv4 or IPv6 host can use the Port Control Protocol (PCP) to\n   flexibly
    manage the IP address and port mapping information on\n   Network Address Translators
    (NATs) or firewalls, to facilitate\n   communications with remote hosts.  However,
    the un-controlled\n   generation or deletion of IP address mappings on such network
    devices\n   may cause security risks and should be avoided.  In some cases the\n
    \  client may need to prove that it is authorized to modify, create or\n   delete
    PCP mappings.  This document proposes an in-band\n   authentication mechanism
    for PCP that can be used in those cases.\n   The Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) is used to perform\n   authentication between PCP devices.\n\n\t "

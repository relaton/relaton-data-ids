  content: "   This document describes a technique to improve DNS privacy, a\n   technique
    called \"QNAME minimisation\", where the DNS resolver no\n   longer sends the
    full original QNAME to the upstream name server.\n\n   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE
    BEFORE PUBLICATION.  The original [RFC7816]\n   had the experimental status.  This
    document is intended for the\n   standards track.  It should be discussed in the
    IETF DNSOP (DNS\n   Operations) Working Group, through its mailing list.  The
    source of\n   the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently kept
    at\n   Framagit [1].\n\n\t "

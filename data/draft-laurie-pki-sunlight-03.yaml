  content: "   The aim of Certificate Transparency is to have every public end-\n
    \  entity and intermediate TLS certificate issued by a known Certificate\n   Authority
    recorded in one or more certificate logs.  In order to\n   detect mis-issuance
    of certificates, all logs are publicly auditable.\n   In particular, domain owners
    or their agents will be able to monitor\n   logs for certificates issued on their
    own domain.\n\n   To protect clients from unlogged mis-issued certificates, logs
    sign\n   all recorded certificates, and clients can choose not to trust\n   certificates
    that are not accompanied by an appropriate log\n   signature.  For privacy and
    performance reasons log signatures are\n   embedded in the TLS handshake via the
    TLS authorization extension\n   [RFC5878], in a stapled [RFC6066] OCSP extension
    [RFC2560], or in the\n   certificate itself via an X.509v3 certificate extension
    [RFC5280].\n\n   To ensure a globally consistent view of the log, logs also provide
    a\n   global signature over the entire log.  Any inconsistency of logs can\n   be
    detected through cross-checks on the global signature.\n   Consistency between
    any pair of global signatures, corresponding to\n   snapshots of the log at different
    times, can be efficiently shown.\n\n   Logs are only expected to certify that
    they have seen a certificate,\n   and thus we do not specify any revocation mechanism
    for log\n   signatures in this document.  Logs are append-only, and log\n   signatures
    will be valid indefinitely.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the process that Certificate Authorities\n(CAs)
    and Relying Parties (RP) participating in the Resource Public\nKey Infrastructure
    (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new\n(and probably cryptographically
    stronger) algorithm set.  The process\nis expected to be completed in a time scale
    of months or years.\nConsequently, no emergency transition is specified.\n\t "

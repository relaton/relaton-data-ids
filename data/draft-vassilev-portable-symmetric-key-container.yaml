  content: "   This document specifies a shared secret token format for transport\n
    \  and provisioning of shared secrets (One Time Password (OTP) keys or\n   symmetric
    cryptographic keys) to different types of strong\n   authentication devices.  The
    standard token format enables\n   enterprises to deploy best-of-breed solutions
    combining components\n   from different vendors into the same infrastructure.\n\n
    \  This work is a joint effort by the members of OATH (Initiative for\n   Open
    AuTHentication) to specify a format that can be freely\n   distributed to the
    technical community.  The authors believe that a\n   common and shared specification
    will facilitate adoption of two-\n   factor authentication on the Internet by
    enabling interoperability\n   between commercial and open-source implementations.\n\t "

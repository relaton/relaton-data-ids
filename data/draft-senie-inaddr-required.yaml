  content: "The Domain Name Service has provision for providing mapping of IP\naddresses
    to host names. It is common practice to ensure both name to\naddress, and address
    to name mappings are provided for networks. This\npractice, while documented,
    has never been documented as a\nrequirement placed upon those who control address
    blocks. This\ndocument fills this gap.\n\t "

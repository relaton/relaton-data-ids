  content: "This memo is a digest of the user network interface specification of NTT
    Communications' dual stack ADSL access service, which provide a IPv6/IPv4 dual
    stack services to home users.  In order to simplify user setup, these services
    have a mechanism to configure IPv6 specific parameters automatically.  The memo
    focuses on two basic parameters: the prefix assigned to the user and the addresses
    of IPv6 DNS servers, and it specifies a way to deliver these parameters to Customer
    Premises Equipment (CPE) automatically.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

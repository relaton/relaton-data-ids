  content: "Messages accessed via the IMAP4 [RFC1730] protocol are immutable in order
    to permit efficient disconnected access.  However, many message systems not based
    on IMAP4 allow individual messages to be annotated in a number of ways.  For example,
    one popular mail interface permits the user to enter a short message description
    for future reference.  Other interfaces may wish to add text or voice annotations
    to messages in shared mailstores, or to store window positions for individual
    messages.          This document defines the ANNOTATE extension to the IMAP4 protocol
    which permits storage of arbitrary read-write per-message information, without
    destroying the valuable immutable property of the basic message text and headers.\n\t "

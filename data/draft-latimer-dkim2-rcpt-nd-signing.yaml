  content: "   This document proposes using the DKIM2 ESMTP extension to pass a\n
    \  signature for each intended recipient through the SMTP session rather\n   than
    splitting email at the time of signing.  This approach meets the\n   DKIM2 objective
    of preventing email replay, while also preserving\n   existing SMTP delivery logic,
    maintaining compatibility with DKIM and\n   avoiding multiple calls to the DKIM2
    filter.\n\n   Also proposed is a method of signing the next domain in the DKIM2\n
    \  chain of custody independently from the DKIM2-Signature.\n\n   As per RFC5321,
    \"... each and every extension, regardless of its\n   benefits, must be carefully
    scrutinized with respect to its\n   implementation, deployment, and interoperability
    costs\".  The\n   requirements outlined herein ensure the majority of DKIM2 logic
    can\n   be implemented within filters or supporting code, with only minimal\n
    \  and isolated changes in SMTP code.\n\n\t "

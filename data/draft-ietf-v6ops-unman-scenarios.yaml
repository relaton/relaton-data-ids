  content: "This document defines the scenarios in which IPv6 transition mechanisms
    are to be used in unmanaged networks.  In order to evaluate the suitability of
    these mechanisms, we need to define the scenarios in which these mechanisms have
    to be used.  One specific scope is the \"unmanaged network\", which typically
    corresponds to a home or small office network.  The scenarios are specific to
    a single subnet, and are defined in terms of IP connectivity supported by the
    gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP).  We first examine the generic
    requirements of four classes of applications: local, client, peer to peer and
    server.  Then, for each scenario, we infer transition requirements by analyzing
    the needs for smooth migration of applications from IPv4 to IPv6.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

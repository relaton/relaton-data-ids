  content: "RTSP defines the setup and control for on demand and live streaming\n
    \  media sessions, which are delivered via an external media transport\n   protocol
    such as RTP/UDP.  RTSP does not define a mechanism to change\n   the content during
    an on-going streaming session.  Such a mechanism\n   improves the streaming experience
    when a user browses through\n   multiple offerings on a single streaming site.\n\n
    \  This document describes several methods to improve content switching.\n   The
    basic principle is to re-use already established transport\n   sessions (e.g.
    \ RTP/UDP sessions) and negotiate new content to be\n   delivered on the existing
    sessions.  If additional transport sessions\n   are necessary, those sessions
    are established separately.  This\n   principle of re-using the RTSP control and
    transport sessions\n   decreases the content switch delay to a large extent and
    improves the\n   end-user experience.\n\n   The present document defines a mechanism
    for switching to new\n   content, both when the client already has the content
    description\n   available and when it does not.\n\n   This document additionally
    considers switching of a single media\n   stream in a session, when several alternative
    media components are\n   available.  For instance, the content may provide several
    alternate\n   audio tracks in different languages to be played with a single video\n
    \  stream.\n\n   The principle of Fast Content Switching and Start-up is also
    defined\n   in 3GPP TS 26.234 [3GPP.26.234] for RTSP 1.0 [RFC2326].\n\t "

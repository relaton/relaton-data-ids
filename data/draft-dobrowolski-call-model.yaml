  content: "Several different call models are in common use today in conventional
    \nTelephony. IP Telephony is gaining wider acceptance. There is, as yet,\nno well-defined,
    widely accepted call model for this domain. In this \ndraft, we study some of
    the issues associated with call models for IP \nTelephony, and suggest how a single
    call model representation may be\nselected to effectively represent call processing
    in this domain.\n\n\t "

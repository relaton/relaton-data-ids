  content: "   The BBS Signatures scheme defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures],\n
    \  describes a multi-message digital signature, that supports\n   selectively
    disclosing the messages through unlinkable presentations,\n   built using zero-knowledge
    proofs.  Each BBS proof reveals no\n   information other than the signed messages
    that the Prover chooses to\n   disclose in that specific instance.  As such, the
    Verifier (i.e., the\n   recipient) of the BBS proof, may not be able to track
    those\n   presentations over time.  Although in many applications this is\n   desirable,
    there are use cases that require the Verifier be able to\n   track the BBS proofs
    they receive from the same Prover.  Examples\n   include monitoring the use of
    access credentials for abnormal\n   activity, monetization etc.. This document
    presents the use of\n   pseudonyms with BBS proofs.\n\n   A pseudonym, is a value
    that will remain constant each time a Prover\n   presents a BBS proof to the same
    Verifier, but will be different (and\n   unlinkable), when the Prover interacts
    with a different Verifier.\n   This provides a way for a recipient (Verifier)
    to track the\n   presentations intended for them, while also hindering them from\n
    \  tracking the Prover's interactions with other Verifiers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Designers of information models for challenged devices connected to\n
    \  the Internet, and most especially for devices that will be carried by\n   people
    or that will be operating in people's homes, need to not\n   forget that people
    own the devices and the data, and expect those to\n   work for them, not against
    them.  This draft discusses some security\n   and privacy issues that may be relevant
    for the IAB's IOTSI workshop\n   on information models for such devices and related
    services.\n\n\t "

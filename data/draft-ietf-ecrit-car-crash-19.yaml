  content: "   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n   mechanisms
    to support the next generation of emergency calls placed\n   by vehicles (automatically
    in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle
    occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the
    crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n
    \  (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\" (AACN), even in the\n   case
    of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers to the\n   ability to carry
    a richer set of data.\n\n   This document also registers a MIME media type and
    Emergency Call\n   Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location
    data\n   (often referred to as \"crash data\" even though there is not\n   necessarily
    a crash) and an INFO package to enable carrying this and\n   related data in INFO
    requests.  An external specification for the\n   data format, contents, and structure
    are referenced in this document.\n\n   This document reuses the technical aspects
    of next-generation pan-\n   European eCall (a mandated and standardized system
    for emergency\n   calls by in-vehicle systems within Europe and other regions).\n
    \  However, this document specifies a different set of vehicle (crash)\n   data,
    specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than\n   the eCall
    Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is an extension\n   of the eCall document,
    with the primary differences being that this\n   document makes the MSD data set
    optional and VEDS mandatory, and adds\n   attribute values to the metadata/control
    object to permit greater\n   functionality.  This document registers a new INFO
    package (identical\n   to that registered for eCall but with the addition of the
    VEDS MIME\n   type).  This document also describes legacy (circuit-switched) ACN\n
    \  systems and their migration to next-generation emergency calling, to\n   provide
    background information and context.\n\n\t "

  content: "   As the increment of network scale, optical networks need to be\n   partitioned
    into multi-layer and multi-domain networks for the\n   purpose of better management.
    \ Meanwhile, as the variety of user\n   requests, different LSPs need to be established.
    \ In order to meet\n   different requirements of users, the LSP establishment
    performance is\n   necessary to be measured in multi-layer and multi-domain networks.\n
    \  For this reason, typical performance measurement metrics need to be\n   proposed.
    \ In this document, the LSP establishment delay and bit\n   error ratio (BER),
    which are both as the performance measurement\n   metrics, are illustrated, and
    the definition and methodologies are\n   proposed.\n\n\t "

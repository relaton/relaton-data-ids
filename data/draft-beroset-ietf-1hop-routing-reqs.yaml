  content: "Wireless mesh routing for low cost wireless mesh devices can be done\nat
    a layer under IPv6.  This document examines the functional\nrequirements of this
    kind of routing and to explore why this approach\nmight be used in some contexts.
    \ It should be noted that this kind of\nrouting is orthogonal to IP-level routing;
    there is no inherent\nconflict between the two.\n\t "

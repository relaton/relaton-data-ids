abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines guidelines for including YANG example instances
    in IETF documents in a way that enables automatic extraction and validation. It
    introduces the concept of YANG module "coverage" to measure how thoroughly example
    instances exercise a YANG module's data nodes. The goal is to improve the quality
    and usability of YANG models in IETF documents by providing authors with tools
    to validate their examples and assess coverage completeness.</p>

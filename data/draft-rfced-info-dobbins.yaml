  content: "The Address Resolution and Location Discovery (ARLD) protocol is part
    of the InterSwitch Message Protocol (ISMP).  ISMP was designed to facilitate interswitch
    communication within distributed connection-oriented switching networks.  The
    ARLD protocol is used to resolve a packet destination address when the source
    and destination pair of a packet does not match a known connection.  It is also
    used to provide end-station address mobility between switches.\n\t "

  content: "   An analysis is performed on the advantages and disadvantages for\n
    \  provision of Location Information (LI) by-reference in the GEOPRIV\n   architecture.
    \ The concept of a Location URI, that is, a URI that\n   references LI, is introduced.
    \ A number of usage patterns for\n   Location URIs are discussed, particularly
    with regard to addressing\n   mobility.  Security concerns that are introduced
    by Location URIs are\n   also considered.\n\t "

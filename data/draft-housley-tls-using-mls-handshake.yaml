abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3 that allows TLS clients and servers to use the Message
    Layer Security (MLS) Protocol handshake to establish the shared secret instead
    to the traditional shared secret establishment mechanism. The MLS protocol provides
    straightforward mechanism to update the shared secret that can be initiated by
    either the client or the server during the TLS session, and each epoch provides
    forward security and post-compromise security.</p>"

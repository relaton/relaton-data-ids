  content: "   This document specifies an extension to the Transport Layer Security\n
    \  (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3 that allows TLS clients and servers to use\n   the
    Message Layer Security (MLS) Protocol handshake to establish the\n   shared secret
    instead to the traditional shared secret establishment\n   mechanism.  The MLS
    protocol provides straightforward mechanism to\n   update the shared secret that
    can be initiated by either the client\n   or the server during the TLS session,
    and each epoch provides forward\n   security and post-compromise security.\n\n\t "

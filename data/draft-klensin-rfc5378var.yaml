  content: "RFC 5378, \"Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust\", has been\ninterpreted
    in a way that is unworkable in practice for updates to\ndocuments created before
    it came into effect, and for other documents\nthat derive significant amounts
    of text from such earlier documents.\nIt requires, as a condition of Internet
    Draft posting or RFC\npublication or even as a condition of posting of Internet
    Drafts,\nthat authors or editors obtain rights from people who may be\nunavailable
    or uncooperative.  This specification modifies the RFC\n5378 rules to permit the
    IETF to continue to do work in an orderly\nfashion when documents containing earlier
    text are involved and\npermission is not easily obtained.\n\t "

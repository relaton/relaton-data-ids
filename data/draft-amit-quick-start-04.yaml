abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft specifies an optional Quick-Start mechanism for transport\n
    \   protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed\n    sending
    rate at the start and at times in the middle of a data\n    transfer.  While Quick-Start
    is designed to be used by a range of\n    transport protocols, in this document
    we describe its use with TCP.\n    By using Quick-Start, a TCP host, say, host
    A, would indicate its\n    desired sending rate in bytes per second, using a Quick
    Start\n    Request option in the IP header of a TCP packet.  A Quick-Start\n    request
    for a higher sending rate would be sent in a TCP packet.\n    Each router along
    the path could, in turn, either approve the\n    requested rate, reduce the requested
    rate, or indicate that the\n    Quick-Start request is not approved.  If the Quick-Start
    request is\n    not approved, then the sender would use the default congestion\n
    \   control mechanisms.  The Quick-Start mechanism can determine if\n    there
    are routers along the path that do not understand the Quick-\n    Start Request
    option, or have not agreed to the Quick-Start rate\n    request.  TCP host B communicates
    the final rate request to TCP host\n    A in a transport-level Quick-Start Response
    in an answering TCP\n    packet.  Quick-Start is designed to allow connections
    to use higher\n    sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along
    the\n    path, and all of the routers along the path support the Quick-Start\n
    \   Request.\n\t "

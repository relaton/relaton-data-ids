  content: "   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides configuration parameters such as IPv6\n   network
    addresses for hosts.  The unencrypted nature and use of\n   various identifiers
    make its privacy and security become more\n   vulnerable.  With appropriate protection
    mechanisms, the privacy and\n   security can be improved to some extent.  This
    document specifies\n   such a mechanism that builds a trusted relationship between
    DHCPv6\n   clients and servers before solicitation.  The mechanism enables a\n
    \  valid client to find and access the legitimate server or reject and\n   blacklist
    a rogue server.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a technology to separate local
    desktop and remote computing/storage resources, which was initially derived from
    the remote desktop administration but with new business models and very different
    use cases. Most of existing VDI systems are based on proprietary implementation,
    and positioning different market with different features. Since virtual desktop
    technology is believed to be a mainstream application delivery method, like http
    protocol against web applications, so it's important to make the virtual desktop
    access protocol open and standard. This draft summarizes the limitations of existing
    virtual desktop systems, and proposes the intent standardization work in IETF.</p>"

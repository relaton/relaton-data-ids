  content: "The success of time sensitive services like VoIP telephony, video, \netc.,
    in a mobile environment depends heavily on the ability to \nminimize the impact
    of the traffic redirection during a change of \npacket forwarding path. In the
    process of establishing the new \nforwarding path, the nodes along the new path
    must be prepared to \nprovide similar forwarding treatment to the IP packets.
    The transfer\nof context information may be advantageous in minimizing the impact\nof
    host mobility on IP services. This document captures the set of \nrequirements
    for a context transfer framework and the requirements\nfor a generic context transfer
    protocol to carry the context between\nthe context transfer peers.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes an upgrade to HTTP messaging which aims at\n
    \  being faster, more robust and more friendly to mobile networks than\n   the
    current version, while retaining the same semantics and offering\n   a high enough
    compatibility level to make it possible to implement\n   highly efficient gateways
    between existing implementations and this\n   presently described version, thus
    offering a smooth upgrade path for\n   legacy applications.\n\n\t "

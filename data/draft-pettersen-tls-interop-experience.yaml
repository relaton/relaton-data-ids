  content: "   This document presents a number of problems encountered when\n   implementing
    TLS 1.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS Extensions for clients, and\n   their consequences.  The
    problems include servers that refuse to\n   connect with clients supporting newer
    versions of the protocol, or\n   does not handle such negotiation properly.  Other
    problems\n   encountered are incorrect use of values in the protocol messages.\n\n
    \  The consequences of these problems range from delayed introduction of\n   new
    protocol versions and features, to fallback mechanisms that may\n   disable protocol
    security features, to implementations that cannot\n   interoperate with some other
    implementations.\n\t "

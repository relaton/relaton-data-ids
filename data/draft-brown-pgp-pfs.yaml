  content: "The confidentiality of encrypted data depends on the secrecy of the\nkey
    needed to decrypt it. If one key is able to decrypt large\nquantities of data,
    its compromise will be disastrous. This memo\ndescribes three methods for limiting
    this vulnerability for OpenPGP\nmessages: reducing the lifetime of confidentiality
    keys; one-time\nkeys; and the additional use of lower-layer security services.\n\t "

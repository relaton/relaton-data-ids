  content: "The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for advancing
    a routing protocol to Full Standard have been satisfied by Border Gateway Protocol
    version 4 (BGP-4) (and create needless busywork).  This report provides a roadmap
    to all information necessary to move BGP-4 to Standard.  This is the first of
    two final reports on the BGP protocol.  As required by the Internet Activities
    Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the second report
    will present additional knowledge and understanding gained in the time when the
    protocol was mada a Draft standard and when it was submitted for Standard.                           The
    remaining sections of this memo document how BGP satisfies General Requirements
    specified in Section 3.0, as well as Requirements for Standard specified in Section
    6.0 of the 'Internet Routing Protocol Standardization Criteria' document [1].

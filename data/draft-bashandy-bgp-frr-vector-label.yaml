  content: "Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1,\nPE2,...,
    PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1,\nCE2,..., CEm.  If the
    edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally\ndisconnected from the core, it is
    desirable for a core router \"P\"\ncarrying traffic to the failed edge router
    PEi to immediately restore\ntraffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled
    to PEi and\ndestined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers that\nadvertised
    P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it is\nhighly desirable to
    keep the core BGP-free while not imposing\nrestrictions on external connectivity
    or complicating provisioning\neffort. Thus (1) a core router should not be required
    to learn any\nBGP prefix, (2) the size of the forwarding and routing tables in
    the\ncore routers should be independent of the number of BGP prefixes, (3)\nre-routing
    traffic without waiting for re-convergence must not cause\nloops, (4) provisioning
    effort should be kept at minimum, and (5)\nthere should be no restrictions on
    what edge routers advertise what\nprefixes. For labeled prefixes, (6) the label
    stack on the packet\nmust allow the repair PEj to correctly forward the packet
    and (7)\nthere must not be any need to perform more than one label lookup on\nany
    edge or core router during steady state\n\n\t "

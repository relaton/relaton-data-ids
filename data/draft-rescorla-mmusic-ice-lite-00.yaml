  content: "   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a technique for\n   discovering
    a set of addresses which two peers can use to\n   communicate, even in the face
    of topological obstacles such as NATs.\n   Because the topologies in which ICE
    may be used are complex, a full\n   ICE implementation is also fairly complex.
    \ Implementation which will\n   only be deployed in settings where they have public
    addresses (e.g.,\n   SIP-PSTN gateways) can, however, be substantially simpler.
    \ This\n   document describes a subset of ICE suitable for such implementations.\n\n\t "

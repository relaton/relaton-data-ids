  content: "   In various network deployments, end to end paths are partitioned into\n
    \  multiple segments.  In some cloud based WAN connections, multiple\n   overlay
    tunnels in series are used to achieve better path selection\n   and lower latency.
    \ In satellite communication, the end to end path\n   is split into two terrestrial
    segments and a satellite segment.\n   Packet losses can be caused both by random
    events or congestion in\n   various deployments.\n\n   Traditional end-to-end
    transport layers respond to packet loss slowly\n   especially in long-haul networks:
    They either wait for some signal\n   from the receiver to indicate a loss and
    then retransmit from the\n   sender or rely on sender's timeout which is often
    quite long.  Non-\n   congestion caused packet loss may make the TCP sender over-reduce
    the\n   sending rate unnecessarily.  With end-to-end encryption moving under\n
    \  the transport (QUIC), traditional PEP (performance enhancing proxy)\n   techniques
    such as TCP splitting are no longer applicable.\n\n   LOOPS (Local Optimizations
    on Path Segments) aims to provide non end-\n   to-end, locally based in-network
    recovery to achieve better data\n   delivery by making packet loss recovery faster
    and by avoiding the\n   senders over-reducing their sending rate.  In an overlay
    network\n   scenario, LOOPS can be performed over the existing, or purposely\n
    \  created, overlay tunnel based path segments.\n\n\t "

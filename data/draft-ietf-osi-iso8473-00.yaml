  content: "This memo defines an echo function for the connection-less network layer
    protocol.  Two mechanisms are introduced that may be used to implement the echo
    function.  The first mechanism is recommended as an interim solution for the Internet
    community.  The second mechanism will be progressed to the ANSI X3S3.3 working
    group for consideration as a work item.  When an ISO standard is adopted that
    provides functionality similar to that described by this memo, then this memo
    will become obsolete and superceded by the ISO standard.  This memo is not intended
    to compete with an ISO standard. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed.\n
    \  The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being\n   a
    collection of nodes.  Each site is named by an exterior address\n   whereas each
    node by an interior local address.  Exterior routing\n   depends solely on site
    addresses while interior routing on node\n   addresses.  Mobility is inherent
    in Interior routing while migration\n   and multihoming are in exterior routing.
    \ The model can recursively\n   repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the
    network, enabling its\n   applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well
    as Internet of\n   Things.\n\n\t "

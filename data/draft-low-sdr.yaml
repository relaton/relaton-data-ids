  content: "   This document describes a human-readable, textual syntax for\n   representing
    self-describing structured data. This representation was\n   designed as a transfer
    syntax for loosely-coupled distributed\n   applications where one cannot depend
    on sender(s) and receiver(s)\n   sharing a schema for exchanged data. The syntax
    is compact,\n   expressive, intuitive, and simple to implement.\n\t "

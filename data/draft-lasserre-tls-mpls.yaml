  content: "This document describes a transparent virtual LAN service (VLS) \nsolution
    over MPLS, sometimes known as Transparent LAN Services \n(TLS). VLS simulates
    an Ethernet virtual 802.1d bridge [6] [7] for a \ngiven set of users.  It delivers
    a layer 2 broadcast domain that is \nfully capable of learning and forwarding
    on Ethernet MAC addresses \nthat is closed to a given set of users.  Many VLS
    services can be \nsupported from a single PE node.\n\t "

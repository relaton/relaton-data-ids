  content: "This document discusses and describes an architecture and protocol\nframework
    for the design and specification of a generic IP based\narchitecture and protocol
    for Dormant Mode Host Alerting, aka IP\npaging. It focuses on the location and
    operation related interworking\nof the different functional entities as required
    to allow for a\nflexible and scalable deployment of the protocol. Furthermore,\nprotocol
    transport and security mechanisms are evaluated and proposed\nto meet respective
    requirements on a DMHA protocol. This document\nintends to be a comprehensive
    guideline for the design of a generic\nIP paging architecture and protocol.\n\n\n\t "

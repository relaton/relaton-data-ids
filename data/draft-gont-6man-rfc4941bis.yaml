- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate\n   addresses
    using a combination of locally available information and\n   information advertised
    by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining\n   network prefixes with an interface
    identifier.  This document\n   describes an extension that causes nodes to generate
    global scope\n   addresses from interface identifiers that change over time.  Changing\n
    \  the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated\n   from
    it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and\n   other information
    collectors to identify when different addresses\n   used in different transactions
    actually correspond to the same node.\n\n\t "

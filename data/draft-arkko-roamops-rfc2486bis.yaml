  content: "In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have a\n   standardized
    method for identifying users.  This document defines the\n   syntax for the Network
    Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity\n   submitted by the client during,
    for instance,  PPP and wireless LAN\n   authentication.  'Roaming' may be loosely
    defined as the ability to\n   use any one of multiple Internet service providers
    (ISPs), while\n   maintaining a formal, customer-vendor relationship with only
    one.\n   Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required include ISP\n
    \  'confederations' and ISP-provided corporate network access support.\n   This
    document is a revised version of RFC 2486 which originally\n   defined NAIs.  Enhancements
    include international character set and\n   privacy support, as well as a number
    of corrections to the original\n   RFC.\n\t "

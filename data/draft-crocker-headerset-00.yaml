  content: "Data often are aggregated with an initial set of descriptor information,
    followed by some number of user data portions.  This specification formalizes
    the occurrences of such aggregations as a MIME Multipart Content-type.  It is
    intended that MIME processors which are aware of the Header-Set construct will
    be able to process the user data portions, even when they do not understand the
    specific header (or descriptor) information which begins the set.\n\t "

  content: "Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays an\nimportant
    role in external BGP peering relations.  The most common\ntool used today to attach
    various information about routes is\nrealized with the use of BGP communities.
    \ Such information is\nimportant for the peering AS to perform some mutually agreed
    actions\nwithout the need to maintain a separate offline database for each\npair
    of prefix and an associated with it requested set of action\nentries.\n\nThis
    document proposes to establish a new IANA maintained registry of\nmost commonly
    used Wide BGP Communities by network operators.  Such\npublic registry will allow
    for easy refernece and clear\ninterpretation of the actions associated with received
    community\nvalues.\n\t "

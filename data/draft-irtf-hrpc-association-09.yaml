  content: "   This document explores whether is a relation between the Internet\n
    \  architecture and the ability of people to exercise their right to\n   peaceful
    assembly and the right to association online.  It does so by\n   asking the question:
    what are the protocol development considerations\n   for freedom of assembly and
    association?  The Internet increasingly\n   mediates our lives, our relationships,
    and our ability to exercise\n   our human rights.  As a global assemblage, the
    Internet provides a\n   public space, yet it is predominantly built on private\n
    \  infrastructure.  Since Internet protocols and architecture play a\n   central
    role in the management, development, and use of the Internet,\n   we analyze the
    relation between protocols, architecture, and the\n   rights to assemble and associate
    to mitigate infringements on those\n   rights.  This document concludes that the
    way in which infrastructure\n   is designed and implemented impacts people's ability
    to exercise\n   their freedom of assembly and association.  It is therefore\n
    \  recommended that the the potential impacts of Internet technologies\n   should
    be assessed, reflecting recommendations of various UN bodies\n   and norms.  Finally,
    the document remarks that non-interoperable\n   platforms that do not allow for
    interoperability or data-portability,\n   render users unable to change platforms,
    therefore leading to a sort\n   of \"forced association\" that inhibits people
    to fully exercise their\n   freedom of assembly and association.\n\n\t "

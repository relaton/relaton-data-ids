  content: "This document presents a method for using [SPKM] with exclusively\nshared
    secret key technologies.  The messages and tokens of [SPKM] are\nunchanged; the
    only modifications required are to replace the default\npublic-key cipher suite
    with ciphers and algorithms suitable for use\nwith shared secret keys.\nAll messages
    and tokens defined in [SPKM] are preserved; no changes\nare required to the various
    authentication modes of [SPKM].  Integrity\nalgorithms and key establishment algorithms
    suitable for use with\nsecret keys are added to those specified in [SPKM], which
    are well\nknown and specified for use in other existing IETF standards.  We in\neffect
    implement the implicit authenticated key exchange protocol\nproposed in [BR94]
    using the messages and tokens defined in [SPKM].\nAn overview and brief discussion
    of the protocol appears in section\n1.  The specific algorithms and object identifiers
    are listed in\nsection 2.  Discussion of how [SPKM] messages are used with shared\nsecret
    keys appears in section 3.  Security concerns are addressed in\nsection 4.  Patent
    issues are covered in section 5.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The ISATAP tunnel MTU is currently recommended to be set to 1480 or\n
    \  less.  This is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but\n   requires
    the ISATAP tunnel ingress interface to drop any IPv6 packet\n   larger than 1480
    bytes and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB)\n   message.  Concerns for operational
    issues with both IPv4 and IPv6\n   Path MTU Discovery point to the possibility
    of MTU-related black\n   holes when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction,
    so dropping\n   packets is considered highly undesirable.  Fortunately, the \"Internet\n
    \  cell size\" is 1500 bytes, i.e., the minimum MTU configured by the\n   vast
    majority of links in the Internet.  This document therefore\n   presents a method
    to boost the ISATAP MTU to 1500 bytes.\n\n\t "

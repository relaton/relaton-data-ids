  content: "   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol supports Mobile Hosts moving\n   independently,
    but not Mobile Routers in charge of moving networks.\n\n   This draft addresses
    this problem.  The goal is to allow\n   bidirectional communication between a
    Local Fixed Node (in the moving\n   network) and a Correspondent Node (situated
    arbitrarily somewhere in\n   the Internet).  First, a mechanism of \"prefix division\"
    is presented,\n   whereby the Home Network Prefix typically assigned by PMIPv6
    to a MH\n   is used by MR to form Mobile Network sub-Prefix(es); they are used
    by\n   LFNs within the moving network to form addresses; this avoids changes\n
    \  in the PMIPv6 protocol specification.  A second mechanism proposes\n   enhancements
    to the use of the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation protocol\n   entities informing the
    PMIPv6 entities about the allocated MNP; this\n   is achieved by equaling MNID
    and DUID.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Message redirection is a basic capability provided by the Diameter\n
    \  base protocol.  In its conventional form, message redirection is\n   performed
    by an application-independent \"redirect agent\", which\n   returns one or more
    individual hosts to the message sender as\n   possible destinations of the redirected
    message.\n\n   However, in some circumstances an operator may wish to redirect\n
    \  messages to an alternate domain without specifying individual hosts.\n   This
    document specifies an application-specific mechanism by which\n   that can be
    achieved.  New applications may incorporate this\n   capability by reference to
    the present document.\n\n   Because the redirection mechanism is application-specific,
    it must be\n   performed by a Diameter server or proxy rather than a basic redirect\n
    \  agent as defined in the Diameter base protocol.  A new term, \"Realm-\n   based
    Redirect Server\", is introduced in this document to\n   differentiate the application-specific
    nature of realm-based\n   redirection from the conventional Diameter redirection
    performed by a\n   basic redirect agent.\n\n   This memo updates Sections 6.13
    and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect to\n   the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and
    Redirect-Max-Cache-Time\n   AVPs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In many environments, firewall, NAT and IP addressing issues make\n
    \  remote management of devices containing SIP user agents difficult.\n   This
    document defines a SIP event package for notifying a user agent\n   that it should
    initiate a session with a management entity for\n   management operations.  This
    type of \"call-home\" management avoids\n   the need to maintain persistent TCP
    connections, or generate\n   additional STUN traffic, with the management entity.
    \ This event\n   package is intended not to tunnel management protocols or otherwise\n
    \  provide management itself, but instead to provide a means for\n   signaling
    a SIP UA that a management session is desired.\n\n\t "

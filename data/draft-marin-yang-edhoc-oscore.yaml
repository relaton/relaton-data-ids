  content: "   This document defines YANG data models which allow a Software-Defined\n
    \  Networking (SDN) Controller (Controller) using NETCONF, RESTCONF or\n   CORECONF
    to provide configuration and monitoring Internet-of-Things\n   devices (Things)
    that support Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE\n   (EDHOC) and/or OSCORE.  In
    particular, a YANG data model defines the\n   required configuration parameters
    to perform EDHOC between two Things\n   (EDHOC case).  Another YANG data model
    is to configure the OSCORE\n   contexts directly into the Thing (OSCORE case).
    \ The service\n   described in this document allows the configuration and monitoring
    of\n   Things that supports EDHOC and OSCORE or only OSCORE by allowing a\n   protected
    Thing-to-Thing communication based on CoAP.\n\n   This document focuses on providing
    YANG data models for configuring\n   EDHOC or OSCORE.  This allows OSCORE establishment
    with minimal\n   intervention by the network administrator.\n\n\t "

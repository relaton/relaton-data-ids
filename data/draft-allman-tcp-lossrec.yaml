  content: "This document proposes two new TCP mechanisms that can be used to\nmore
    effectively recover lost segments when a connection's\ncongestion window is small,
    or when a large number of segments are\nlost in a single transmission window.
    \ The first of these\nmechanisms, 'Limited Transmit', calls for sending a new
    data\nsegment in response to each of the first two duplicate\nacknowledgments
    that arrive at the sender.  The second mechanism is\nto reduce, in certain special
    circumstances, the number of duplicate\nacknowledgments required to trigger a
    fast retransmission.\n\t "

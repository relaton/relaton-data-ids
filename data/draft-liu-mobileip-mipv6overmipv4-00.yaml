  content: "This document specifies a mechanism for Mobile IPv6 nodes of a 6to4  \nsite
    [4] to continue utilizing Mobile IPv6 [5] services when they  \nroam into IPv4
    domains. The mechanism is based on Mobile IPv6 and  \nMobile IPv4 [7] glued together
    naturally by the 6to4 protocol [4] for  \ndelivering IPv6 packets between the
    Mobile IPv6 nodes and their  \nMobile IPv6 home agents. To support the mechanism
    specified in this  \ndraft, the Mobile IPv6 nodes MUST be Mobile IPv4 capable
    and MUST NOT  \nutilize Mobile IPv6 route optimization. The 6to4 border router(s)
    at  \nthe 6to4 site MUST also be capable to act as Mobile IPv4 home  \nagent(s).

  content: "   Data leaks are a serious privacy problem for Internet users.  Data
    in\n   flight and at rest can be protected with traditional communications\n   security
    and data encryption.  Protecting data in use is more\n   difficult.  In addition,
    failure to protect data in use can lead to\n   disclosing session or encryption
    keys needed for protecting data in\n   flight or at rest.\n\n   This document
    discusses the use of Confidential Computing, to reduce\n   the risk of leaks from
    data in use.  Our example use case is in the\n   context of DNS resolution services.
    \ The document looks at the\n   operational implications of running services in
    a way that even the\n   owner of the service or compute platform cannot access
    user-specific\n   information produced by the resolution process.\n\n\t "

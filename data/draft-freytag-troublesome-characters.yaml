  script: Latn
  content: "   Unicode's design goal is to be the universal character set for all\n
    \  applications.  The goal entails the inclusion of very large numbers\n   of
    characters.  It is also focused on written language in general;\n   special provisions
    have always been needed for identifiers.  The\n   sheer size of the repertoire
    increases the possibility of accidental\n   or intentional use of characters that
    can cause confusion among\n   users, particularly where linguistic context is
    ambiguous,\n   unavailable, or impossible to determine.  A registry of code points\n
    \  that can be sometimes especially problematic may be useful to guide\n   system
    administrators in setting parameters for allowable code points\n   or combinations
    in an identifier system, and to aid applications in\n   creating security aids
    for users.\n\n\t "

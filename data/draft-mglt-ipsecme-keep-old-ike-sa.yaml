  content: "   This document considers a VPN Client setting a VPN with a security\n
    \  gateway where at least one of the peer has multiple interfaces.\n\n   With
    the current IKEv2, the outer IP addresses of the VPN are\n   determined by those
    used by IKEv2 channel.  As a result using\n   multiple interface requires to set
    an IKEv2 channel on each\n   interface, and then on each paths if both the VPN
    Client and the\n   security gateway have multiple interfaces.  Setting multiple
    IKEv2\n   channel involves multiple authentications which MAY each require\n   multiple
    round trips and delay the VPN establishment.  In addition\n   multiple authentications
    unnecessarily load the VPN client and the\n   authentication infrastructure.\n\n
    \  This document presents the KEEP_OLD_IKE_SA extension, where an\n   additional
    IKEv2 channel from an already authenticated IKEv2 channel.\n   The newly created
    IKEv2 channel is set without the IKEv2\n   authentication exchange.  The newly
    created IKEv2 channel can then be\n   assigned to another interface using MOBIKE.\n\n\t "

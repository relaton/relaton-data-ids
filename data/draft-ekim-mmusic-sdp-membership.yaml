  content: "   This document defines a set of Session Description Protocol \n   (SDP)attributes
    that allow SDP to provides tightly controlled \n   membership information. Some
    multimedia conferencing applications may \n   require strict membership control
    policies. A group session creator \n   describes basic membership information
    in SDP, and it can be \n   negotiated by the Offer / Answer model. \n\t "

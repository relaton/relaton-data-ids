  script: Latn
  content: "   In a classical network the link layer is responsible for transferring\n
    \  a datagram between two nodes that are connected by a single link,\n   possibly
    including switches.  In a quantum network however, the link\n   layer will need
    to provide a robust entanglement generation service\n   between two quantum nodes
    which are connected by a quantum link,\n   possibly including quantum repeaters.
    \ This service can be used by\n   higher layers to produce entanglement between
    distant nodes or to\n   perform other operations such as qubit transmission, without
    full\n   knowledge of the underlying hardware and its parameters.  This draft\n
    \  defines what can be expected from the service provided by a link\n   layer
    for a Quantum Network and defines an interface between higher\n   layers and the
    link layer.\n\n\t "

  content: "IPFIX Flow Aggregation describes a methodology for reducing the\namount
    of measurement data exchanged between monitoring devices\n(IPFIX Exporters) and
    analyzers (IPFIX Collectors).  Aggregation\ntechniques represent a necessary enhancement
    in order to cope with\nincreasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with
    the ever-\ngrowing network capacities.  Using Flow Selection Criteria and\nCompound
    Flow creation techniques, measurement information of\nmultiple Flows that are
    sharing some common criteria is merged to be\nexported in one Compound Flow.  Subsets
    of Flows eligible for\naggregation, as well as the desired degree of similarity,
    can be\ncustomized using a set of Aggregation Rules.\n\t "

  content: "There is wide interest in the technology for interconnecting Content\nNetworks,
    variously called 'Content Peering' or 'Content\nInternetworking'. We present the
    general architecture and core\nbuilding blocks used in the internetworking of
    Content Networks. \nThe scope of this work is limited to external interconnections
    with\nContent Networks and does not address internal mechanisms used\nwithin Content
    Networks, which for the purpose of the document are\nconsidered to be black boxes.
    This work establishes an abstract\narchitectural framework to be used in the development
    of protocols,\ninterfaces, and system models for standardized Content\nInternetworking.\n\n\t "

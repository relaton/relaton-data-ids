  content: "     In the Internet PKI, trust anchor keys are distributed as self-\n
    \    signed X.509 security certificates. This document specifies a trust\n     anchor
    key renewal mechanism that leverages the confidence in the\n     initial certificate
    distribution. A non-critical X.509 certificate\n     extension holds a sequence
    of opaque octet strings. The trust\n     anchor renewal operation occurs upon
    receipt of a message that\n     hashes to one of those octet strings.\n\t "

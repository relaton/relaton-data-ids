  content: "   Multipath TCP [RFC6824] defines the ADD_ADDR option to allow a host\n
    \  to announce its addresses to the remote host.  In this document we\n   analyze
    some of the issues with the address advertisement technique\n   defined [RFC6824]
    and propose some modifications to mitigate these\n   problems.  We also show that
    the reverse DNS could be an excellent\n   alternative to advertise the stable
    addresses of a server.\n\n\t "

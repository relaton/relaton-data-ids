  content: "    This draft describes a framework for providing quantitative IP\n    services
    with guaranteed QoS. Although the proposed reservation\n    approach is based
    on a new, lightweight signaling protocol, it can\n    be used with interoperability
    with other IP QoS techniques such as\n    Diff-Serv, Int-Serv.\n \n        Distinguishing
    features of the Boomerang protocol are:\n           * signaling messages are generated
    only by the initiating\n             node, therefore complexity and intelligence
    is\n             concentrated in one point enabling simple implementation\n           *
    flow state aggregation can be suggested to subsequent\n             nodes by appending
    the Boomerang message, thus good\n             scalability can be achieved\n           *
    bi-directional reservation can be made independently of\n             the path,
    which yields a fast and effective reservation\n             process\n           *
    the only requirement on the far-end node is that it\n             should be able
    to bounce the Boomerang message back,\n             ensuring quick penetration
    into the current Internet.\n\n        There is a lab prototype in which the Boomerang
    protocol is\n    wrapped in ICMP ECHO / ECHO-REPLY (PING) messages.\n\n\t "

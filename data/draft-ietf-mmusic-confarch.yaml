    \ The protocols mentioned are specified elsewhere as RFCs,\nInternet-Drafts, or
    ITU recommendations.  Each of these\nspecifications gives details of the protocol
    itself, how it works and\nwhat it does.  This document attempts to provide the
    reader with an\noverview of how the components fit together and of some of the\nassumptions
    made, as well as some statement of direction for those\ncomponents still in a
    nascent stage.\n\t "

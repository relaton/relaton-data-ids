  content: "   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to\n
    \  manipulate configuration datastores.  NMDA introduces additional\n   datastores
    for systems that support more advanced processing chains\n   converting configuration
    to operational state.  However, client\n   applications are not able to be aware
    of common events pertaining to\n   additional datstores, such as a data validation
    state change in\n   NETCONF server, that may impact management applications.  This\n
    \  document updates [RFC6470] to allow a NETCONF client to receive\n   additional
    notifications for some common system events pertaining to\n   the Network Management
    Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in\n   [RFC8342].\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document extends the pNFS protocol to communicate errors caused
    \n   by inability to access data servers referenced by layouts, including \n   checks
    performed by both clients and the MDS. The extension provides \n   means for clients
    to communicate client-detected access denial errors \n   to the MDS, including
    the case in which a client requests direct NFS \n   access via the MDS that the
    MDS cannot perform.\n\t "

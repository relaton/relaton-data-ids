abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF CATS WG considers the problem of how the network edge can
    steer traffic between clients of a service and the sites offering the service.
    The service QoE and/or the performance experienced by edge clients may depend
    on both network metrics and compute metrics. CATS leverages these metrics and
    strives to optimize how a network edge node may steer traffic, as appropriate
    to the service. Revolving around the 'optimized' objective, the CATS Framework
    proposes and defines a general architecture for the distribution of network and
    compute metrics and for the transport of traffic from network edge to service
    instance. This draft illustrates the applicability of the CATS framework to various
    noteworthy scenarios.</p>"

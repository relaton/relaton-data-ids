  content: "   The IETF CATS WG considers the problem of how the network edge can\n
    \  steer traffic between clients of a service and the sites offering the\n   service.
    \ The service QoE and/or the performance experienced by edge\n   clients may depend
    on both network metrics and compute metrics.  CATS\n   leverages these metrics
    and strives to optimize how a network edge\n   node may steer traffic, as appropriate
    to the service.  Revolving\n   around the 'optimized' objective, the CATS Framework
    proposes and\n   defines a general architecture for the distribution of network
    and\n   compute metrics and for the transport of traffic from network edge to\n
    \  service instance.  This draft illustrates the applicability of the\n   CATS
    framework to various noteworthy scenarios.\n\n\t "

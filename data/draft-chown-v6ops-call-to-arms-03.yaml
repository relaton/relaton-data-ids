  content: "   The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011 will be\n
    \  World IPv6 Day, on which some major organisations are going to make\n   their
    content available over IPv6.  With the likes of Google and\n   Facebook providing
    IPv6 access to their production services and\n   domains, it is very likely we
    will see more IPv6 traffic flowing\n   across the Internet than has ever been
    seen before.  With this in\n   mind, it seems timely to issue a call to arms for
    systems and network\n   administrators to review their organisation's IPv6 capabilities
    in\n   order to mitigate common causes of IPv6 connectivity problems in\n   advance
    of the day.  The increased traffic on World IPv6 Day should\n   also create an
    excellent opportunity to observe the behaviour and\n   performance of IPv6; it
    is thus very desirable to have appropriate\n   measurement tools in place in advance.
    \ We discuss some appropriate\n   tools from the network and application perspective.\n\n\t "

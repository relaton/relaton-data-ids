  content: "   This document specifies the requirements for an end-to-end session\n
    \  identifier in IP-based multimedia communication networks.  This\n   identifier
    would enable endpoints, intermediate devices, and\n   management and monitoring
    systems to identify a session end-to-end,\n   associate multiple endpoints with
    a given multipoint conference,\n   track communication sessions when they are
    redirected, and associate\n   one or more media flows with a given communication
    session.\n\n\t "

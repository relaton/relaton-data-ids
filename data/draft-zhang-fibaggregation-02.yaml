  content: "The rapid growth of Forwarding Information Base (FIB) has raised\nconcerns
    among many Internet Service Providers.  One potential\nsolution to this problem
    is FIB aggregation, i.e. letting each router\naggregate its FIB entries without
    affecting the forwarding paths\ntaken by data traffic.  It is a simple local software
    optimization\nwithin a router, requiring no changes to routing protocols or router\nhardware.
    \ To understand the effectiveness of using FIB aggregation\nto extend router lifetime,
    in this draft we present several FIB\naggregation algorithms and evaluate their
    performance using routing\ntables and updates collected from tens of networks.
    \ Our results show\nthat FIB aggregation can reduce the FIB table size by as much
    as 70%\nwith small computational overhead.  We also show that the\ncomputational
    overhead can be controlled through various mechanisms.\n\t "

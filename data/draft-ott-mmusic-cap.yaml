  content: "This document presents a notation for describing potential and\nspecific
    configurations of end systems in multiparty collaboration\nsessions. The objective
    is to define a configuration description\nframework that can be used to define
    end system capabilities, to\ncalculate a set of appropriate common capabilities
    based on the\ndescriptions of all (end) systems and to express a selected media\ndescription
    for use in session descriptions. One application for this\nframework would be
    multiparty multimedia conferencing, an application\narea where multiple tools
    have to be configured on conference startup\n(and/or during the conference) concerning
    media encoding types and\nother parameters. Other applications are IP Telephony
    and media\ngateway control.\n\t "

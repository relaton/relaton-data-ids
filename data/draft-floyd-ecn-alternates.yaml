  content: "    There have been a number of proposals for alternate semantics for\n
    \   the ECN field in the IP header [ECN].  This document discusses some\n    of
    the issues in defining alternate semantics for the ECN field, and\n    specifies
    requirements for a safe co-existence in an Internet that\n    could include routers
    that do not understand the defined alternate\n    semantics.  This document evolved
    as a result of discussions with\n    the authors of one recent proposal for such
    alternate semantics.\n\t "

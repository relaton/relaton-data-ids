- language: en

  content: "This document describes the framework to support a new protocol for\nexplicit
    congestion notification (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be\ndeployed incrementally
    around unmodified routers.  Re-ECN allows\naccurate congestion monitoring throughout
    the network thus enabling\nthe upstream party at any trust boundary in the internetwork
    to be\nheld responsible for the congestion they cause, or allow to be\ncaused.
    \ So, networks can introduce straightforward accountability\nfor congestion and
    policing mechanisms for incoming traffic from end-\ncustomers or from neighbouring
    network domains.  As well as giving\nthe motivation for re-ECN this document also
    gives examples of\nmechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources
    respond\ncorrectly to congestion.  And it describes example mechanisms that\nensure
    the dominant selfish strategy of both network domains and end-\npoints will be
    to use the protocol honestly.\n\t "

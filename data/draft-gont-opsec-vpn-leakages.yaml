  content: "   The subtle way in which the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols co-exist in\n   typical
    networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in\n   popular Virtual
    Private Network (VPN) products, may inadvertently\n   result in VPN traffic leaks.
    \ That is, traffic meant to be\n   transferred over a VPN connection may leak
    out of such connection and\n   be transferred in the clear on the local network.
    \ This document\n   discusses some scenarios in which such VPN leakages may occur,
    either\n   as a side effect of enabling IPv6 on a local network, or as a result\n
    \  of a deliberate attack from a local attacker.  Additionally, it\n   discusses
    possible mitigations for the aforementioned issue.\n\n\t "

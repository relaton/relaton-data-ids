abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Next Hop Dependent Characteristics Attribute (NHC) provides
    a way for a BGP speaker to advertise certain characteristics of routes. In particular,
    it is useful to advertise forwarding plane features. This specification defines
    an NHC characteristic that can be used to advertise the ability to process the
    MPLS Entropy Label as an egress LSR for all NLRI advertised in the BGP UPDATE.
    It updates RFC 6790 and RFC 7447 concerning this BGP signaling.</p>"

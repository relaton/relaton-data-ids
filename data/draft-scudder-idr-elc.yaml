  content: "   The BGP Next Hop Dependent Characteristics Attribute (NHC) provides
    a\n   way for a BGP speaker to advertise certain characteristics of routes.\n
    \  In particular, it is useful to advertise forwarding plane features.\n\n   This
    specification defines an NHC characteristic that can be used to\n   advertise
    the ability to process the MPLS Entropy Label as an egress\n   LSR for all NLRI
    advertised in the BGP UPDATE.  It updates RFC 6790\n   and RFC 7447 concerning
    this BGP signaling.\n\n\t "

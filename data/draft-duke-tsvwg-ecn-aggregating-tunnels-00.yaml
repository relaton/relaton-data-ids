  content: "   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) provides two bits in the IP\n
    \  header for routers to signal congestion to endpoints without\n   resorting
    to packet loss.  RFC6040 provided guidance for how IP-in-IP\n   tunnels should
    transfer (ECN) markings between inner and outer IP\n   headers.  However, that
    document implicitly assumes that no more than\n   one inner packet is present
    in an outer packet.  As numerous\n   tunneling technologies have since emerged
    that break this assumption,\n   further guidance is needed.\n\n\t "

  content: "   According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives\n
    \  an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to\n   reset
    the session over which the offending attribute was received.\n   This behavior
    is undesirable as a session reset would impact not only\n   routes with the offending
    attribute, but also other valid routes\n   exchanged over the session.  This document
    partially revises the\n   error handling for UPDATE messages, and provides guidelines
    for the\n   authors of documents defining new optional attributes.  Finally, it\n
    \  revises the error handling procedures for several existing\n   attributes.\n\n\t "

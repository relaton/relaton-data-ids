  content: "There are times when pseudowires must be transported over physical\nlinks
    with limited bandwidth.  We shall use the term \"bonding\" (also\nvariously known
    as inverse multiplexing, link aggregation, trunking,\nteaming, etc.) to mean an
    efficient mechanism for separating the PW\ntraffic over several links.  Unlike
    load balancing and equal cost\nmultipath, bonding makes no assumption that the
    PW traffic can be\ndecomposed into distinguishable flows, and thus bonding requires\ndelay
    compensation and packet reordering.  Furthermore, PW bonding\ncan optionally track
    bandwidth constraints in order to minimize\npacket loss.\n\t "

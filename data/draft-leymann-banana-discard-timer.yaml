  content: "   Various tunnel based methods have been developed to realize BANdwidth\n
    \  Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA). At the egress point of\n   bonding
    tunnels, packets that have been delivered through different\n   tunnels are reordered
    in a bonding reordering buffer. Along each\n   tunnel, network devices may set
    aside buffers, which are referred as\n   tunnel buffers, to cache packets as well.
    This document exposes that\n   a time boundary, which is referred as \"Discard
    Timer\", imposed on\n   tunnel buffers could improve the throughput and reliability
    of the\n   bonding tunnels.\n\n\t "

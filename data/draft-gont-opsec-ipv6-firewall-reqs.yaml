  content: "   While there has been some work in the area of firewalls, concrete\n
    \  requirements for IPv6 firewalls have never been specified in the RFC\n   series.
    \ The more limited experience with the IPv6 protocols and the\n   more reduced
    number of firewalls that support IPv6 has made it rather\n   difficult to infer
    what are reasonable features to expect in an IPv6\n   firewall.  This has typically
    been a problem for network operators,\n   who typically have to produce a \"Request
    for Proposal\" from scratch\n   that describes such features.  This document specifies
    a set of\n   requirements for IPv6 firewalls, in order to establish some common-\n
    \  ground in terms of what features can be expected in them.\n\n\t "

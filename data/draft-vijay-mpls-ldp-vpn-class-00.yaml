  content: "This document describes the use of LDP in establishing VPNs for \ntransporting
    traffic that needs to be classified based on \napplication flows. \nThis document
    proposes extensions to existing LDP for establishing \nend-to-end VPN LSPs for
    transporting traffic meant for specific \ndestination addresses and applications
    from specific applications. \nThis document proposes to use a Flow FEC element,
    which contains the \nLayer 3 and transport information which is used for identifying
    the \nflow. The flow is mapped onto the appropriate VPN LSP.  \n\t "

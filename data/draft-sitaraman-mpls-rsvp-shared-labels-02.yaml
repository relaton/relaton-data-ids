  content: "   As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, so the number of\n
    \  Label Switched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements\n   has
    increased.  Various implementation recommendations have been\n   proposed to manage
    the resulting increase in control plane state.\n\n   However, those changes have
    had no effect on the number of labels\n   that a transit Label Switching Router
    (LSR) has to support in the\n   forwarding plane.  That number is governed by
    the number of LSPs\n   transiting or terminated at the LSR and is directly related
    to the\n   total LSP state in the control plane.\n\n   This document defines a
    mechanism to prevent the maximum size of the\n   label space limit on an LSR from
    being a constraint to control plane\n   scaling on that node.  That is, it allows
    many more LSPs to be\n   supported than there are forwarding plane labels available.\n\n
    \  This work introduces the notion of pre-installed 'pop labels' that\n   are
    applied per Traffic Engineering link and that can be shared by\n   MPLS RSVP-TE
    LSPs that traverse these links.  This approach\n   significantly reduces the forwarding
    plane state required to support\n   a large number of LSPs.  This couples the
    feature benefits of the\n   RSVP-TE control plane with the simplicity of the Segment
    Routing MPLS\n   forwarding plane.\n\n   This document also introduces the ability
    to mix different types of\n   label operations along the path of an LSP, thereby
    allowing the\n   ingress router or an external controller to influence how to\n
    \  optimally place a LSP in the network.\n\n\n\t "

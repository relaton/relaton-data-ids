  content: "   This draft presents an additional architectural option for control
    of\n   packet over optical networks by extending and complementing the IETF\n
    \  draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable and by introducing an additional\n   approach
    for control of optical plugs in packet devices.  It provides\n   the direct read/write
    access of coherent plugs to the optical\n   controller, thereby allowing the end-to-end
    optical service\n   management.  The approach, introduced in this draft, can be
    further\n   generalized to support other uses cases.\n\n   The architectural option
    for control of packet over optical networks,\n   introduced by this draft, also
    provides a clear separation between\n   control of packet functions and control
    of optical functions.  The\n   packet and optical controls are partitioned so
    that the functions\n   specializing in control of the optical capabilities can
    control\n   corresponding functions in packet devices, optical devices or both\n
    \  without interfering with packet control functions.\n\n\t "

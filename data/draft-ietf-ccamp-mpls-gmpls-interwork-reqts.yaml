  content: "Operation of a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineering
    (TE) network as a client network to a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) network has enhanced
    operational capabilities compared to those provided by a coexistent protocol model
    (i.e., operation of MPLS-TE over an independently managed transport layer).\n\n
    The GMPLS network may be a packet or a non-packet network, and may itself be a
    multi-layer network supporting both packet and non-packet technologies. An MPLS-TE
    Label Switched Path (LSP) originates and terminates on an MPLS Label Switching
    Router (LSR). The GMPLS network provides transparent transport for the end-to-end
    MPLS-TE LSP.\n\n This document describes a framework and Service Provider requirements
    for operating MPLS-TE networks over GMPLS networks. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

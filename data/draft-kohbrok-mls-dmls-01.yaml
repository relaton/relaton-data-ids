  content: "   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) provides strong end-to-end security\n
    \  guarantees for group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and\n   Post-Compromise
    Security (PCS).  MLS requires a Delivery Service (DS)\n   component to facilitate
    agreement between group members on the order\n   of Commit messages.  In decentralized
    settings without an\n   authoritative entity to enforce ordering, group members
    will likely\n   have to retain key material so they can process commits out-of-order.\n\n
    \  Retaining key material, however, significantly reduces the FS of the\n   protocol.
    \ This draft specifies Decentralized MLS (DMLS), based on\n   the the Fork-Resilient
    Continuous Group Key Agreement protocol FREEK\n   proposed by Alwen et al.  [FRCGKA].
    \ In essence, DMLS extends MLS\n   such that key material can be retained to process
    Commits out-of-\n   order with recuded impact to FS, thus allowing safer deployment
    in\n   decentralized environments.\n\n\t "

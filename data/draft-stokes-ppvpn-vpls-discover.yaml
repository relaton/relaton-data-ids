- language: en

  content: "This document describes a methodology for allowing the nodes in a\nVirtual
    Private LAN Service (VPLS) network as described in [VPLS]\nto discover each other
    via MPLS signaling.  It also defines a\nmethodology whereby the individual VPLS
    services are discovered via\nMPLS signaling.  The goal is to allow a VPLS network
    to be created\nusing MPLS signaling and a minimal amount of configuration.\n\n\n\t "

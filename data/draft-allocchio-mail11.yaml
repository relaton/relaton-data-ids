  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a set of mappings which will enable inter working
    between systems operating the ISO/IEC 10021 - CCITT (now ITU) X.400 Recommendations
    on Message Handling Systems, and systems running the Mail-11 (also known as DECnet
    mail or VMSmail) protocol.  The specifications are valid both within DECnet Phase
    IV and DECnet/OSI addressing and routing scheme.     The complete scenario of
    X.400 / MIME / Mail-11 is also considered, in order to cover the possible complex
    cases arising in multiple gateway translations.    This document covers mainly
    the X.400 O/R address to/from Mail-11 address mapping and the RFC822 to/from Mail-11
    ones; other mappings are based on MIXER specifications. Bodypart mappings are
    not specified in this document: MIXER and MIME-MHS specifications can be applied
    to map bodyparts between X.400, MIME and Mail-11, too. In fact MIME encoding can
    be used without modifications within Mail-11 text bodyparts.    This document
    obsoletes RFC 1405, which was a combined effort of RARE Working Group on Messaging,
    and the IETF X.400 Ops Working Group.\n\t "

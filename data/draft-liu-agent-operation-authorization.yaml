abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Agent Operation Authorization framework
    — a structured mechanism that enables verifiable delegation of actions from human
    principals to autonomous AI agents with fine-grained agent operation authorization.
    The framework introduces two distinct phases: * *Agent Operation Authorization
    Request:* A human-readable proposal of operations derived from natural language
    input and converted to a JSON Web Token (JWT). * *Agent Operation Authorization
    Token:* A JSON Web Token representing confirmed authorization for a specific agent
    operation, enforceable at runtime by agents and verifiers. It cryptographically
    verifies user intent, prevents unauthorized or hallucinated actions, and ensures
    auditable traceability of each authorized operation.</p>"

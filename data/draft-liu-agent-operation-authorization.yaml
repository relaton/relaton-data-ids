  content: "   This document specifies the Agent Operation Authorization framework
    —\n   a structured mechanism that enables verifiable delegation of actions\n   from
    human principals to autonomous AI agents with fine-grained agent\n   operation
    authorization.\n\n   The framework introduces two distinct phases:\n\n   *  *Agent
    Operation Authorization Request:* A human-readable proposal\n      of operations
    derived from natural language input and converted to\n      a JSON Web Token (JWT).\n\n
    \  *  *Agent Operation Authorization Token:* A JSON Web Token\n      representing
    confirmed authorization for a specific agent\n      operation, enforceable at
    runtime by agents and verifiers.  It\n      cryptographically verifies user intent,
    prevents unauthorized or\n      hallucinated actions, and ensures auditable traceability
    of each\n      authorized operation.\n\n\t "

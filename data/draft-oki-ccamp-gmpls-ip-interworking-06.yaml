  content: "     Over time Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic \n     engineered
    networks may be migrated to use Generalized MPLS \n     (GMPLS). This will allow
    the networks to benefit from many new \n     features that have been added to
    the GMPLS protocols. \n     Additionally, such migration will facilitate easy
    interworking \n     of packet networks that are controlled by IP/MPLS-TE protocols
    \n     and networks that are controlled by GMPLS protocols. \n      \n     During
    this migration phase MPLS and GMPLS capable elements will  \n     have to co-exist
    and interwork. GMPLS signaling and routing \n     protocols are subtly different
    from the MPLS protocols and so \n     interworking and migration strategies are
    needed. \n\n     This document describes issues associated with interworking of
    \n     IP/MPLS-TE networks and GMPLS-based optical networks. Then it \n     describes
    possible migration scenarios, mechanisms to compensate \n     for the differences
    between MPLS and GMPLS protocols, and how to \n     apply those mechanisms in
    order to achieve migration from MPLS \n     to GMPLS.  \n\t "

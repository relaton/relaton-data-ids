  content: "   This document defines a new URL scheme, 'eid'.  This scheme provides\n
    \  a mechanism by which the local application can reference data that\n   has
    been obtained by other, non-URL scheme means.  The scheme is\n   intended to provide
    a general escape mechanism to allow access to\n   information for applications
    that are too specialized to justify\n   their own schemas.\n\n\t "

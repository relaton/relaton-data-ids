  content: "   This document defines an MSRP extension, Connection Establishment for\n
    \  Media Anchoring (CEMA).  Support of the extension is optional.  MSRP\n   endpoints
    can implement the extension in order to allow MSRP\n   communication in networks
    where Middleboxes anchor the MSRP\n   connection, without the need for the Middleboxes
    to enable MSRP B2BUA\n   functionality in most cases.  The document also defines
    a Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] attribute, a=msrp-cema, that
    can\n   be used by MSRP endpoints to indicate support of the CEMA extension.\n\n\t "

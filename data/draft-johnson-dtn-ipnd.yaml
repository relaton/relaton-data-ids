  content: "   Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) IP Neighbor Discovery\n
    \  (IPND), is a method for otherwise oblivious nodes to learn of the\n   existence,
    availability, and addresses of other DTN participants.\n   IPND both sends and
    listens for small IP UDP announcement “beacons.”\n   Beacon messages are addressed
    to an IP unicast, multicast, or\n   broadcast destination to discover specified
    or unspecified remote\n   neighbors, or unspecified local neighbors in the topology,
    e.g.\n   within wireless range.  IPND beacons advertise neighbor availability\n
    \  by including the DTN node’s canonical endpoint identifier.  IPND\n   beacons
    optionally include service availability and parameters.  In\n   this way, neighbor
    discovery and service discovery may be coupled or\n   decoupled as required.  Once
    discovered, new neighbor pairs use\n   advertised availabilities to connect, exchange
    routing information,\n   etc.  This document describes DTN IPND.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) can provide data transmission with\n
    \  end-to-end bounded latency and extremely low packet loss for user's\n   services.
    \ In order to better control and manage deterministic\n   network services.  It
    is necessary to measure and monitor DetNet QoS\n   information.  As introduced
    in [I-D.chen-detnet-loss-delay], packet\n   loss rates and end-to-end delay can
    be measured by using passive\n   Performance Measurement (PM) in MPLS-based DetNet
    encapsulation.\n\n   This document implement three new QoS related attribute to
    support\n   passive Performance Measurement for DetNet service.\n\n\t "

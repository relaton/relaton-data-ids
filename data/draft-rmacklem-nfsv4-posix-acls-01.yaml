  content: "   This document describes the addition of three new attributes that are\n
    \  used by servers to support POSIX ACLs.  The term POSIX ACLs refers to\n   the
    ACL component of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)\n   1003.1e draft
    17 [IEEE] document for which sponsorship was withdrawn\n   in January 1998.  Although
    the draft POSIX standard that describes\n   these ACLs was never ratified, several
    POSIX based operating systems,\n   such as Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD include
    support for them.  The NFS\n   Version 4 (NFSv4) ACLs described in [RFC8881] henseforth
    referred to\n   as NFSv4 ACLs, use a different model and attempts to map between
    the\n   ACLs of these two models has not been completely successful.  As\n   such,
    this document proposes three new attributes that may optionally\n   be used by
    an NFS Version 4, minor version 2 (NFSv4.2) server to\n   support ACLs that conform
    the afor mentioned POSIX 1003.1e draft 17.\n\n\t "

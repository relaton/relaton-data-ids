  content: "This document  describes some issues related to performing \nencryption
    at layer-3.  In particular, routing protocol problems \nmay result if the time-to-live
    (TTL) field in IPv4 or the Hop Limit \nfield in IPv6 is decremented once before
    encapsulation [1][2].   \nAlso, special provisions may be necessary within the
    encryptor \ndevices if broadcast messages are to transition the encryptor \npairs.
    \ Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) issues are also presented. \n   \n\t "

  content: "   When using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to perform\n
    \  route origin validation (ROV) with route origin authorizations\n   (ROAs),
    there have been security and usability issues identified and\n   reported.  This
    memo revisits these issues from the perspective of\n   the operational granularity
    of ROA management, demonstrates problems\n   and their root cause with the existing
    ROA encoding scheme,\n   summarizes design requirements to address them, and evaluates
    three\n   potential solutions.  Though neither of existing solutions satisfies\n
    \  all requirements, a hybrid solution composed of two existing schemes\n   is
    recommended to use in ROA management.\n\n\t "

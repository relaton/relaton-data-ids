  content: "This document defines an extension to the Session Description \nProtocol
    (SDP) and to Session Description Protocol new generation \n(SDPng - work in progress).
    The intention of this draft is to provide \ndescriptions in SDP and SDPng that
    specify the source port of media \nstreams. Such specification within the session
    description is \nrequired in many network quality of service (QoS) management
    systems \nin order to be able to track the media streams from their source to
    \ntheir destination. Thus the QoS management system can differentiate \nthe stream
    tracks end-to-end and guarantee QoS for every single \nmedia.\n\t "

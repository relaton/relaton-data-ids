  content: "   Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are an important technique in attack\n
    \  defence (often called cyber defence).  This document outlines the\n   different
    types of IoC, their associated benefits and limitations,\n   and discusses their
    effective use.  It also contextualises the role\n   of IoCs in defending against
    attacks through describing a recent case\n   study.  This draft does not pre-suppose
    where IoCs can be found or\n   should be detected - as they can be discovered
    and deployed in\n   networks, endpoints or elsewhere - rather, engineers should
    be aware\n   that they need to be detectable (either by endpoints, security\n
    \  appliances or network-based defences, or ideally all) to be\n   effective.
    \ The purpose of this draft is to document both the\n   operational issues, but
    also the best practices associated with use\n   of IoCs today.  This draft provides
    a foundation for proposals for\n   new approaches to operational challenges in
    network security.\n\n\t "

  content: "6to4 [1] defines a mechanism for allowing sites to communicate\nusing
    IPv6 over the public IPv4 Internet.  It does so by assigning a\nblock of IPv6
    addresses corresponding to any 'public' (globally-scoped)\nIPv4 address, and a
    means of tunneling IPv6 traffic destined for such\naddresses over the IPv4 Internet.
    \ In this way, any site which is\nconnected to the IPv4 Internet and which has
    at least one global IPv4\naddress assigned to it, can communicate with IPv6.\nThe
    advantage of 6to4 is that it decouples deployment of IPv6 by\nthe core of the
    network (e.g. Internet Service Providers or ISPs) from\ndeployment of IPv6 at
    the edges (e.g. customer sites), allowing each\nsite or ISP to deploy IPv6 support
    in its own time frame according to\nits own priorities.  With 6to4, the edges
    may communicate with one\nanother using IPv6 even if one or more of their ISPs
    do not yet provide\nnative IPv6 service.  In addition, the principal cost of the
    6to4\ntransition mechanism is borne by those who benefit from it.\nHowever, the
    ability to perform so-called 'reverse lookups'\n(lookups of IP addresses rather
    than domain names) in DNS requires that\nthere be a delegation path for the IP
    address being queried, from the\nDNS root to the servers for the DNA zone which
    provides the PTR records\nfor that IP address.  For ordinary IPv6 addresses, the
    necessary DNS\nservers and records for IPv6 reverse lookups would be maintained
    by the\neach organization to which an address block is delegated; the delegation\npath
    of DNS records reflects the delegation of address blocks\nthemselves.  However,
    for IPv6 addresses beginning with the 6to4 address\nprefix, the DNS records would
    need to reflect IPv4 address delegation.\nSince the entire motivation of 6to4
    is to decouple site deployment of\nIPv6 from infrastructure deployment of IPv6,
    such records cannot be\nexpected to be present for a site using 6to4 - especially
    for a site\nwhose ISP did not yet support IPv6 in any form.\nThis memo discusses
    several potential mechanisms for locating the\nDNS servers which are assumed to
    provide 'reverse lookup' of 6to4\naddresses.\n\n\t "

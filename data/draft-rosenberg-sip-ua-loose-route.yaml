  content: "A key part of the behavior of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\nis
    that SIP proxies rewrite the Request-URI as a request moves\nthroughout the network.
    \ Over the years, experience has shown this to\nbe problematic.  It makes it difficult
    to use Request URI for service\ninvocation, complicates emergency services, makes
    it more complex to\nsupport aliases, and so on.  Architecturally, it confounds
    the\nconcepts of address and route.  This document proposes to change this\nthrough
    a new mechanism called UA loose routing.\n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes a home network prefix and address assignment\n
    \  algorithm running on top of any 'flooding protocol' that fulfills the\n   specified
    requirements.  It is expected that home border routers are\n   allocated one or
    multiple IPv6 prefixes through DHCPv6 Prefix\n   Delegation (PD) or that prefixes
    are made available through other\n   means.  An IPv4 address can also be assigned
    and private addresses be\n   used with NAT to provide IPv4 connectivity.  In both
    cases, provided\n   prefixes need to be efficiently divided among the multiple
    links, and\n   routers need to obtain addresses.  This document describes a\n
    \  distributed algorithm for IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes division, assignment\n   and
    router's address assignment, and specifies how hosts can be given\n   addresses
    and configuration options using DHCP or SLAAC.\n\n\t "

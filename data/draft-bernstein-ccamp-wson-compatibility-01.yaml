  content: "While the current GMPLS WSON framework can deal with many types of\nwavelength
    switching systems there is a desire to extend the control\nplane to networks that
    include a combination of transparent optical\nand hybrid electro optical systems
    such as OEO switches,\nregenerators, and wavelength converters. Such networks
    are frequently\nreferred to as translucent optical networks in the literature.
    Some\nof the systems use in such networks can be limited to processing WSON\nsignals
    with specific characteristics or attributes. In addition,\nsome of the network
    elements may be able to perform important\noptional processing functions such
    as regeneration on a signal and\nwould need to be provisioned as part of optical
    path establishment.\n\nThis document provides a WSON signal definition and attributes\ncharacterization
    based on ITU-T interface and signal class standards\nand describes the signal
    compatibility constraints of this extended\nset of network elements. The signal
    characterization, network element\ncompatibility constraints and enhanced provisioning
    support enable\nGMPLS routing and signaling to control these devices and PCE to\ncompute
    optical light-paths subject to signal compatibility\nattributes.\n\t "

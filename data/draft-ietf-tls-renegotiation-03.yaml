  script: Latn
  content: "Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation
    are vulnerable to an attack in which the attacker forms a TLS connection with
    the target server, injects content of his choice, and then splices in a new TLS
    connection from a client.  The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake
    as a renegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted by the
    attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data.  This specification
    defines a TLS extension to cryptographically tie renegotiations to the TLS connections
    they are being performed over, thus preventing this attack. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

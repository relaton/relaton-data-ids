  content: "   The document discusses some deployment considerations of the various\n
    \  options to discover encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS,\n   DNS-over-TLS,
    or DNS-over-QUIC).  In particular, the document\n   describes how Discovery of
    Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) and\n   Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR)
    can be used in typical\n   deployment contexts.\n\n   This document does not intend
    to provide deployment recommendations,\n   but is meant to exemplify how operators
    can enable the encrypted DNS\n   discovery mechanisms.  In addition, the document
    illustrates the\n   feasibility of hosting encrypted DNS forwarders in Customer
    Premises\n   Equipment (CPEs).\n\n\t "

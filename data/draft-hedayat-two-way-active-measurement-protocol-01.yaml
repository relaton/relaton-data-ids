  content: "    The IPPM One-way Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP] provides a \n
    \   common protocol for measuring one-way metrics between network \n    devices.
    \ OWAMP [OWAMP] can be used in both directions \n    independently to measure
    one-way metrics in both directions between \n    two network elements.  However,
    it does not accommodate round-trip \n    or two-way measurements.  This draft
    proposes a Two-way Active \n    Measurement Protocol, based on the One-way Active
    Measurement \n    Protocol [OWAMP], that will accommodate two-way or round-trip
    \n    measurements.  \n\t "

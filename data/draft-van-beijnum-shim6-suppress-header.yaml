  content: "The shim6 protocol defines a header that contains a \"context tag\" that\nidentifies
    packets as belonging to a certain shim6 context that exists\nbetween two hosts.
    It has been suggested that this shim6 header is\ninserted between the IPv6 header
    and the upper layer protocol such as\nTCP in all packets where the shim layer
    has rewritten the source and/or\ndestination address. This document considers
    the suppression of this\nheader in situations where packets can be successfully
    demultiplexed by\nthe receiver without it.\n\n\t "

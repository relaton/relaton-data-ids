  content: "TLS supports X.509 and OpenPGP certificate based mechanisms to\nauthenticate
    a server.  Users want their applications to verify that\nthe certificate provided
    by the TLS server is in fact associated with\nthe domain name they expect.  Instead
    of trusting a certificate\nauthority to have made this association correctly,
    and an X.509/\nOpenPGP implementation to validate that properly, the user might\ninstead
    trust the authoritative DNS server for the domain name to\nmake that association.
    \ This document describes how to use secure DNS\nto associate the certificate
    chain transferred by TLS with the\nintended domain name.\n\t "

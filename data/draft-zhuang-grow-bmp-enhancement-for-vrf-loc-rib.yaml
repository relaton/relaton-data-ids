abstract:
- content: "<p>BMP Loc-RIB [RFC9069] enforces that the BMP router sets the Peer Address
    value of a VPN route information to zero, and sets the Peer Distinguisher value
    of a VPN route information to the route distinguisher or unique locally defined
    value of the particular instance the Loc-RIB belongs to. This document introduces
    the option to communicate the Remote VRF Information from which a VPN route was
    received when reporting that VPN route information with BMP Loc-RIB.</p>"

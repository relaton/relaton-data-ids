  content: "   Recovering from failure of IPsec gateways or servers maintaining\n
    \  large numbers of SAs may take several minutes, if they need to re-\n   establish
    the IPsec SAs by re-running the key management protocol,\n   IKEv2.  This draft
    proposes IPsec and IKEv2 SA storage and retrieval\n   mechanisms to improve the
    recovery time after an IPsec gateway or\n   server failure.\n\n\t "

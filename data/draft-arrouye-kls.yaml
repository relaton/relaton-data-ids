  content: "This document emphasizes the convergence of thinking regarding\nInternet
    naming in the industry and the technical community.\nThere is strong consensus
    for establishing a layer above the current\nDNS to address some of its current
    limitations. At the same time, the\ncommunity stresses the necessity for the new
    layer to go beyond the\nsole needs of the domain name system to realize an architecture\ncapable
    of accommodating diverse services, with separate ownerships,\ndifferent scopes
    and distinct operating models. In that context,\ninteroperability is critical.\n\t "

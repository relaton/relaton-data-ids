  content: "   This document describes syntax for conveying key origin attestation\n
    \  information to a Certification Authority (CA) or other entity, so\n   that
    they may decide how much trust to place in the management of the\n   private key.
    \ For example, a reliant party may use this information\n   to support a decision
    about whether to issue a certificate.  In\n   contrast to other key attestation
    formats, the one defined in this\n   document requires only ASN.1 and the standard
    PKIX modules.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Full life cycle network management will be a key feature of the\n   future
    communication networks.  Meanwhile, the complexity of the\n   network management
    should be reduced and the network expects to be\n   managed in a fully automated
    manner with humans out of the loop.  In\n   this document, we propose an use case
    of intent based network\n   management to achieve more flexible , convenient,
    and efficient\n   network management.  In this use case, we propose an architecture
    and\n   attempt to illustrate the five levels of achieving full autonomous\n   network
    management.\n\n\n\t "

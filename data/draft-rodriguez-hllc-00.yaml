  content: "The great advance in telecommunications techniques to increase the \nlevel
    of reliability on the physical layer (Packet Loss) has made a \ntremendous contribution
    to the way higher layer protocols are designed \nnowadays. The High-Level Logical
    Link Control (HLLC) is intended for \nuse as a highly reliable and fast host-to-host
    protocol between hosts \ncurrent packet-switched computer communication networks.\n\nThis
    document describes the functions to be performed by the \nHigh-Level Logical Link
    Control, the program that implements it, and \nits interface to programs or users
    that require its services.\n\n\n\t "

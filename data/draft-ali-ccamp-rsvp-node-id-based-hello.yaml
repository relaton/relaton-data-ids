abstract:

  content: "Use of node-id based RSVP Hello messages is implied in a number of \n
    \  cases, e.g., when data and control plan are separated, when TE links \n   are
    unnumbered. Furthermore, when link level failure detection is \n   performed by
    some means other than RSVP Hellos, use of node-id based \n   Hellos is optimal
    for detecting signaling adjacency failure for RSVP-\n   TE. Nonetheless, this
    implied behavior is unclear and this document \n   formalizes use of node-id based
    RSVP Hello sessions as a best current \n   practice (BCP) in some scenarios.\n\t "

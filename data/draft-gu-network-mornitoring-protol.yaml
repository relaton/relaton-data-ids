  content: "   To enable automated network OAM (Operations, administration and\n   management),
    the availability of network protocol running status\n   information is a fundamental
    step.  In this document, a network\n   monitoring protocol (NMP) is proposed to
    provision the information\n   related to running status of IGP (Interior Gateway
    Protocol) and\n   other control protocols.  It can facilitate the network\n   troubleshooting
    of control protocols in a network domain.  Typical\n   network issues are illustrated
    as the usecases of NMP for ISIS to\n   showcase the necessity of NMP.  Then the
    operations and the message\n   formats of NMP for ISIS are defined.  In this document
    ISIS is used\n   as the illustration protocol, and the case of OSPF and other
    control\n   protocols will be included in the future version.\n\n\n\t "

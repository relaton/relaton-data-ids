  content: "   This document describes extension to the CBT protocol to maintain a\n
    \  multicast tree with user-specified QoS properties.  Specifically, it\n   describes
    enhancements in the member join/leave and state\n   update/refresh procedures
    to facilitate the deployment of additive\n   (e.g., end-to-end delay bound), multiplicative
    (e.g., packet loss\n   ratio along a path) and concave (e.g., minimum bandwidth
    available)\n   QoS.\n \n   Eligibility tests are devised to verify whether or
    not a new member\n   can join a multicast tree at adequate QoS, while not violating
    the\n   QoS received by on-tree members.  Management of router state is based\n
    \  on a simple state update and refresh procedure that can be readily\n   integrated
    with the tree maintenance mechanism that exists in CBT\n   (i.e., echo-requests
    and echo-replies).\n\n\t "

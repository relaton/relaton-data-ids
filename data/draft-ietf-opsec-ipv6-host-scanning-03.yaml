abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4\n   counterpart.
    \ The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)\n   accommodate approximately
    1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a\n   much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses)
    than is typical in IPv4\n   networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or less
    unique addresses.\n   As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous\n
    \  effort to perform address scanning attacks against IPv6 networks, and\n   therefore
    brute-force IPv6 address scanning attacks have been\n   considered unfeasible.
    \ This document updates RFC 5157 by providing\n   further analysis on how traditional
    address scanning techniques apply\n   to IPv6 networks, and exploring some additional
    techniques that can\n   be employed for IPv6 network reconnaissance.  In doing
    so, this\n   document formally obsoletes RFC 5157.\n\n\t "

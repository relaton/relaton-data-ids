  content: "   The primary purpose of this memo is to remember substantial\n   contributors
    to the Internet Engineering Task Force who have passed\n   away in the year 2025.
    \ Some substantial contributors who died in\n   prior years are also recognized.\n\n
    \  This memo is NOT a general memorial notice for the broader Internet\n   community.
    \ Rather it is centered on persons who made notable\n   contributions to IETF.\n\n
    \  This memo is NOT the product of any IETF or IRTF working group.  It\n   is
    published in the Independent RFC Stream consistent with guidelines\n   in RFC4846.\n\n\t "

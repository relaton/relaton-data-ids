  content: "   This note is intended to describe the end to end problem as it\n   applies
    to a network of networks, wherein some component networks\n   independently run
    only IPv4 with or without a transition mechanism,\n   some run only IPv6 with
    or without a transition mechanism and without\n   coordination of transition mechanisms,
    and some run IPv4 and IPv6 in\n   parallel supporting native routing.\n\t "

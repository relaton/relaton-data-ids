  content: "This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/IP using the\nRobust
    Header Compression Formal Notation.\nThe RObust Header Compression [1] scheme
    is designed to compress\npacket headers over error prone channels.  It is built
    around an\nextensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new\nprotocol
    stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.\nThis draft describes a modification
    of previously published RTP\nprofiles for ROHC to conform to ROHC-FN [2] and Prolog.\n\n\t "

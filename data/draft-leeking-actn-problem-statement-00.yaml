abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Previously transport networks were typically static, lacked\n   flexibility,
    and required long planning times when deploying new\n   services. Network Providers
    and Service Providers have embraced\n   technologies that allow separation of
    data plane and control plane,\n   distributed signaling for path setup and protection,
    and centralized\n   path computation for service planning and traffic engineering.\n
    \  Although these technologies provide significant benefits, they do\n   not meet
    the growing need for network programmability, automation,\n   resource sharing,
    and service elasticity necessary for meeting\n   customer demands and evolving
    Internet applications\n\n   By combining the aforementioned capabilities with
    network resource\n   virtualization and abstraction mechanisms, available via
    well-\n   defined customer interfaces, providing significant operational\n   benefits
    to meet the growing demands from customers and\n   applications. The work effort
    investigating this problem space is\n   known as Abstraction and Control of Transport
    Networks (ACTN).\n\n   This document provides an ACTN problem description, scope
    of work,\n   and outlines the core requirements to facilitate network resource\n
    \  virtualization and resource slicing for customers and applications,\n   across
    Service Provider and Network Provider transport network\n   infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\t "

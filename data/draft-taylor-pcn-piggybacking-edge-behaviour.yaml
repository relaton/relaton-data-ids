  content: "Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of\nservice
    for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The\noverall PCN architecture
    is described in RFC 5559.  This memo\ndescribes a behaviour for PCN egress nodes
    known as the\n\"piggybacking\" edge behaviour, because it \"piggybacks\" PCN\ninformation
    in resource signalling messages.  This version of the\nmemo describes two alternatives,
    where piggybacking is derived from\nthe CL edge behaviour and where it is derived
    from the SM edge\nbehaviour.  The SM and CL edge behaviours are specified in companion\ndocuments.\n\t "

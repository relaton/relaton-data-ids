- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a software defined networking (SDN) based\n
    \  unified IPv6 transition framework.  This framework makes use of the\n   flow-based
    packet forwarding technology, which can simplify the\n   implementation of both
    control plane and data plane operations of\n   transition mechanisms.  The purpose
    of this work is to provide an\n   integrated and flexible framework to implement
    and deploy transition\n   mechanisms, such as MAP-E, Lightweight 4over6, etc.\n\n\n\t "

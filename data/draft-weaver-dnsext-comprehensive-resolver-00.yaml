  content: "DNS resolvers are vulnerable to many attacks on their network\ncommunication,
    ranging from blind attacks to full men-in-the-middle.\nAlthough a full man-in-the-middle
    can only be countered with\ncryptography, there are many layers of defenses which
    apply to less\npowerful attackers.  Of particular interest are defenses which
    only\nrequire changing the DNS resolvers, not the authoritative servers or\nthe
    DNS protocols.  This document begins with a taxonomy of attacker\ncapabilities
    and desires, and then discusses defenses against classes\nof attackers, including
    detecting non-disruptive attacks, entropy\nbudgeting, detecting entropy stripping,
    semantics of duplication, and\ncache policies to eliminate \"race-until-win\"
    conditions.  Proposed\ndefenses were evaluated with traces of network behavior.\n\t "

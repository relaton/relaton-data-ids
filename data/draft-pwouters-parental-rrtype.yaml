  content: "   This document updates the DNS Parameters' Resource Record (RR) TYPEs\n
    \  registry by adding a field denotating \"Parental RRtype\" that\n   instructs
    DNS name servers to store or query RRtypes that have this\n   new field set at
    the parent side of a delegation instead of at the\n   child side.  These DNS protocol
    rules match those already in use for\n   the Delegation Signer (DS) RRtype.\n\n
    \  It additonally reserves a small part of the \"Reserved for future use\"\n   allocation
    space in the RRtype registry to mark a group of RRtypes\n   values to have this
    new flag set.\n\n   The goal of this document is to provide a general facility
    that\n   future RRtypes can use without requiring to wait a period of many\n   years
    for DNS implementations and deployments before these type of\n   new RRtype become
    usable in practise.  It is similar in goal to the\n   support of Unknown DNS RRtypes
    as specified in RFC 3597.\n\n   This document updates [many things which we should
    figure out].\n\n\t "

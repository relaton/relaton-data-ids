  content: "   This draft presents a work-in-progress on a challenge-response based\n
    \  lightweight authentication scheme to mutually authenticate CoAP\n   client
    and server for establishing a secure unicast communication\n   channel. The draft
    discusses the generic idea behind the proposed\n   authentication scheme, as well
    as presents its CoAP specific\n   adoption. The proposed scheme has low communication
    overhead and can\n   be a robust alternative against the usual DTLS based connection\n
    \  initiation scheme with PSK.\n\n\t "

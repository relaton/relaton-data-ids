  content: "Interoperation of Instant Messaging and Presence systems has been\ndefined
    in IMPP Working Group.  IMPP WG has come up with baseline\ninteroperable operations
    and formats for Presence and Instant\nMessaging systems.  However, these base
    formats might need\nstandardized extensions in order to enable building rational\napplications
    using Presence and Instant Messaging.  This memo\nproposes an extension to PIDF
    presence document format to be used in\nSIMPLE based Presence systems [1] but
    may also be applied to other\nprotocols as well.\n\t "

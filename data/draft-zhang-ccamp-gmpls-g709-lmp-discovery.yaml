  content: "   Recent progress of the Optical Transport Network (OTN) has introduced\n
    \  new signal types (i.e., ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex) and new\n   Tributary
    Slot granularity (1.25Gbps).\n\n   Since equipments deployed prior to recently
    defined ITU-T\n   recommendations only support 2.5 Gbps Tributary Slot granularity
    and\n   ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 containers, the compatibility problem should be\n
    \  considered. In addition, a Higher Order ODU (HO ODU) link may not\n   support
    all the types of Lower Order ODU (LO ODU) signals defined by\n   the new OTN standard
    because of the limitation of the devices at the\n   two ends of a link. In these
    cases, the control plane is required to\n   run the capability discovering functions
    for the evolutive OTN.\n\n   This document describes the extensions to the Link
    Management\n   Protocol (LMP) needed to discover the capability of HO ODU link,\n
    \  including the granularity of Tributary Slot to be used and the LO ODU\n   signal
    types that the link can support.\n\n\n\t "

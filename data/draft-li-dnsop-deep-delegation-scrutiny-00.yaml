  content: "   The Domain Name System (DNS) relies on caching to ensure its\n   scalability
    and performance.  However, certain behaviors in the DNS\n   delegation and caching
    mechanisms can be exploited to circumvent\n   domain name revocation.  A recently
    discovered attack, named PHOENIX\n   DOMAIN T2, allows a malicious domain that
    has been revoked at its\n   parent zone to remain resolvable for an extended period.
    \ This is\n   achieved by creating a chain of deeply nested subdomains, effectively\n
    \  keeping the delegation information alive in recursive resolver\n   caches.\n\n
    \  This document describes the PHOENIX DOMAIN T2 attack mechanism and\n   proposes
    a set of operational best practices for DNS recursive\n   resolver operators to
    mitigate this threat.  The primary\n   recommendation is for resolvers to apply
    additional scrutiny to\n   domain names with an excessive number of labels, which
    is a key\n   characteristic of this attack.\n\n\t "

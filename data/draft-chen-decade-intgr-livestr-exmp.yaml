  content: "DECADE is an in-network storage infrastructure which is under\n   discussions
    and constructions.  It can be integrated into Peer-to-\n   Peer (P2P) applications
    to achieve more efficient content\n   distributions.  This document represents
    two detailed examples of how\n   to integrate DECADE into P2P applications (live
    streaming and file\n   sharing).  Specifically, it describes mainly about: 1)
    a preliminary\n   DECADE client API; 2) a P2P live streaming integration with
    DECADE;\n   3) a P2P file sharing integration with DECADE; 4) tests on our DECADE\n
    \  integrarions and 5) an application performance analysis from the\n   tests.\n\n\t "

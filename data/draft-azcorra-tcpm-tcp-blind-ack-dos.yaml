- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "TCP relies in communication peers to implement congestion control by\n
    \  hosts voluntary limiting their own data rate. Nevertheless this\n   assumption
    introduces unsolved DoS attack opportunities.\n   A DoS attack can be easily performed
    by a host that acknowledges TCP\n   segments not yet received (maybe even not
    sent).\n   This document presents and briefly describes the problem, already\n
    \  identified and pointed before, but also shows than it can be easily\n   performed
    (with very interesting results) and proposes some\n   server-side modifications
    to TCP stack in order to make this attack\n   more difficult to perform. These
    modifications do nor cause\n   interoperability issues.\n\t "

  content: "This draft aims to document an issue raised in the Mobile IP working\ngroup
    related to fast handoff between Access Routers. The fast\nhandoff work aims to
    rapidly enable IP service at the new access\nrouter. In Mobile IP this implies
    that Binding Updates at the\nnetwork layer enable forwarding of packets to the
    new access router.\nHowever, it may also imply other network layer activities
    because\nthe IP service given to the MN may depend on state which is\npresently
    located in the old access router. This draft aims to\ndocument the issue through
    examples so that the IETF can resolve how\nto approach this issue.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Near-term quantum networks will grow to form a Noisy, Intermediate-\n
    \  Scale Quantum Internet (NISQI).  Connection setup will require\n   adapting
    behavior along the path to the noise levels of individual\n   elements.  In this
    proposal, path creation is triggered by an\n   application at the Initiator, information
    is accumulated node-by-node\n   on an outbound pass in a series of QCap (quantum
    capability) blocks,\n   then the RuleSets are created at the Responder.  RuleSets
    are\n   installed at the individual nodes on the return pass.  This document\n
    \  describes the architecture of connection setup in a network.  Details\n   of
    the RuleSets and QCaps, addressing architecture, link protocols,\n   routing,
    resource allocation (multiplexing), extension of this setup\n   procedure to an
    internetwork, and extension to multiparty\n   communications are beyond the scope
    of this document.\n\n\t "

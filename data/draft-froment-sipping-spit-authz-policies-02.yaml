  content: "   SPAM, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk,\n
    \  might be a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks.  The\n   responsibility
    for filtering or blocking calls can belong to\n   different elements in the call
    flow and may depend on various\n   factors.  This document discusses mechanisms
    to establish policies to\n   react on potentially unwanted communication attempts.\n\n
    \  These policies match a particular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   communication
    pattern based on a number of attributes.  The range of\n   attributes includes
    information provided, for example, by the SIP\n   itself, by the SIP identity
    mechanism, by information carried within\n   SAML assertions (as introduced with
    SIP-SAML) and by the SPIT-SAML\n   extensions.\n\n   This document raises the
    question whether it is worth to investigate\n   the aspect of authorization policy
    usage for SPIT prevention.  If so,\n   then the choice of a policy language for
    describing authorization\n   policies and the details of the authorization policies
    becomes\n   important.  Mechanisms to create, modify and delete authorization\n
    \  policies that are stored in XML documents are already available with\n   XCAP
    or WEBDAV and they could be reused.\n\n\t "

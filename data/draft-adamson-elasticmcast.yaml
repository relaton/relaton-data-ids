  content: "   This document describes an Internet Protocol (IP) multicast routing\n
    \  protocol suitable for dynamic network environments including mobile\n   wireless.
    \ To handle high dynamics, this routing mechanism uses\n   redundant forwarding,
    based upon the Simplified Multicast Forwarding\n   (SMF) approach of [RFC6621],
    while converging to regular multicast\n   distribution trees where or when the
    network becomes relatively\n   stable.  The rationale is that intermittent connectivity
    directly\n   affects the ability of routers to synchronize on their view of the\n
    \  network, thus making it difficult to converge on efficient\n   distribution
    trees, while network wide broadcast may be prohibitively\n   expensive for relatively
    sparse groups.  A hybrid approach, called\n   Elastic Multicast, is specified
    which dynamically switches between\n   limited scope broadcast and tree path forwarding
    independently at\n   each node.  The trees created during stable periods and portions
    of\n   the network are pruned from the SMF efficient flooding mesh.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking MPLS \n   protection
    mechanisms using the terminology defined in [TERMID].  \n   An overview of existing
    MPLS protection terminology and \n   functionality is provided as as background
    for the \n   methodology.  The methodology can be applied to any MPLS protection\n
    \  mechanisms such as Standby LSP, Fast Reroute Detour  Mode, and Fast \n   Reroute
    Bypass Mode.  The methodology can also be used to benchmark\n   LSP rerouting
    due to a Headend Reroute.  The data plane is measured \n   to obtain the benchmarking
    metrics.  Discussion is included to \n   explain the differences between MPLS
    Protection mechanisms, the \n   network events that cause failover, and the benefits
    of measuring \n   the data plane for black-box MPLS Protection benchmarking.   \n
    \  Measurements can be used to compare failover performance of \n   different
    Label-Switched Routers and evaluate the different MPLS \n   protection mechanisms.\n\n\t "

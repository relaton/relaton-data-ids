  content: "Point to point (P2P) communication between arbitrary IPv6 routers and\nhosts
    in a Low power and Lossy Network (LLN) is a key requirement for\nmany applications.
    \ RPL, the IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs,\nconstrains the LLN topology to a Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DAG) and\nrequires the P2P routing to take place along the DAG
    links.  Such P2P\nroutes may be significantly suboptimal and may lead to traffic\ncongestion
    near the DAG root.  This document describes a P2P route\ndiscovery mechanism complementary
    to RPL base functionality.  This\nmechanism allows an RPL-aware IPv6 router or
    host to discover and\nestablish on demand one or more routes to another RPL-aware
    IPv6\nrouter or host in the LLN such that the discovered routes meet the\nspecified
    cost criteria.\n\t "

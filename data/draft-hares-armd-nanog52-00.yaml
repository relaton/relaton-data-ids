  content: "   Data Centers are growing in number of physical and virtual machines.\n
    \  The scaling of broadcast domains impacts the scale of basic Address\n   resolution
    protocols (ARP and ND).\n\n   The ARMD working (http://tools.ietf.org/wg/armd/charters)
    has been\n   charter to examine the details of this problem. Part of the\n   examination
    was to ask operators of data centers and researchers to\n   provide details on
    the scope of the problem. The ARMD chairs (Benson\n   Schliesser (Cisco) and Linda
    Dunbar (Huawei) held a panel session at\n   NANOG 52 to report initial findings.\n\n
    \  The researchers on the panel were: Manish Karir (Merit), and K.K.\n   Ramakrishnan
    (AT&T Research). The Operators on this panel were from\n   Google (Scott Whyte),
    Yahoo (Igor Gashinsky), and Adhost (Michael K.\n   Smith).\n\n   This memo brings
    into IETF format notes taken at the panel session.\n   Any errors in the summary
    are the author's.  The presentations for\n   the session are listed at the ARMD
    track at:\n\n   http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog52/agenda.php\n\n   However,
    an audio recording was not made. This document is an\n   informational RFC whose
    intent is to record a moment in time.\n\n\t "

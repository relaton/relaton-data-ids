  content: "   This document describes a means of multiplexing RTP streams having\n
    \  different media types within a single transport connection and a\n   means
    of representing this multiplexing option in SDP so that network\n   nodes can
    easily identify groups of RTP streams and their associated\n   RTCP packets for
    differential treatment as necessary.  This mechanism\n   can be used to complement
    the BUNDLE multiplexing scheme, which uses\n   the grouping framework to identify
    all media lines associated with a\n   single transport connection, but provides
    no means for network nodes\n   to group RTP streams and their RTCP packets for
    differential\n   treatment.  RTP subsessions is an alternative to the SHIM\n   multiplexing
    proposal; it clearly partitions packets associated with\n   different media lines
    without changing the format of individual RTP\n   and RTCP packets, but it does
    not maintain a completely independent\n   SSRC space for each media line, as does
    SHIM.  RTP subsessions avoid\n   SSRC conflicts by construction and can be used
    in all RTP topologies\n   in which all systems implement RTP subsessions, although
    SSRC mapping\n   might be needed when forwarding RTP streams from an unpartitioned
    RTP\n   session into an RTP subsession.\n\n\t "

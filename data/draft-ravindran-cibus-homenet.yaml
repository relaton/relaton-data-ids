  content: "   Home network (Homenet) is a good application scenario for ICN\n   considering
    it is a point where diverse users, devices, applications,\n   and services meet.
    \ Homenets are getting increasingly complex with\n   the presence of application
    specific sensors, smart appliances, and\n   smart networking devices such as residential
    gateway.  Home\n   automation today is being driven by several alliances such
    as DLNA,\n   AllJoyn, ZigBee, and Z-Wave aimed at supporting homenet services
    such\n   as multimedia sharing, lighting control, climate control, and energy\n
    \  management.  These standards overlay application semantics over a\n   host
    centric architectures which is inefficient, and the lack of\n   inter-operability
    among these standards results in high cost,\n   inflexibility, and management
    issues.  Homenet is an information-\n   centric environment where the objective
    is to enable consumers and\n   producers to interact in a contextual manner independent
    of their\n   underlying topology arrangement.  Although the overall homenet\n
    \  objectives over an ICN framework versus any other are the same; ICN\n   can
    distinguish itself by providing a rich service abstraction layer\n   applicable
    in local scale as in BAN/PAN/LAN, and also enable\n   intelligent interaction
    beyond the homenet boundary.\n\n   In this draft we share the idea of a contextualized
    information-\n   centric bus (CIBUS) which builds on ICN abstractions of naming,
    name\n   resolution, and content dissemination for home network by providing\n
    \  support for service management, context processing and monitoring,\n   policy
    management, and policy based routing and forwarding.  CIBUS\n   allows applications
    and services to discover each other, subscribe/\n   notify to event upon which
    service composition can be realized\n   locally or in a centralize manner.  Furthermore,
    service policies can\n   be applied at high granularity which can be imposed in
    the routing\n   and forwarding plane through ICN extensions.  Some of these CIBUS\n
    \  features that were realized in [5] is presented here.\n\n\t "

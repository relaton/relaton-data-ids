  content: "This document lays out a set of requirements related to role-based\nauthorization
    for the Session Initiation Protocol.  While numerous\nauthentication mechanisms
    are described in the base SIP\nspecification, role-based authorization provides
    information used to\nmake policy decisions based on the attributes of a participant
    in a\nsession.  This approach provides a richer framework for\nauthorization,
    as well as allow greater privacy for users of an\nidentity system.\n\t "

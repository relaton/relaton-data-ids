  content: "In this note a number of PCE architectural and computational options \nare
    evaluated against a medium sized wavelength switched optical \nnetwork. The key
    performance measures of overall and backward \nblocking are reported under different
    dynamic traffic scenarios. The \ncorresponding reduction in connection blocking
    probabilities and \ncomputational advantages enabled by these architectural alternatives
    \nstrongly warrant their inclusion in continuing PCE WSON work.\n\t "

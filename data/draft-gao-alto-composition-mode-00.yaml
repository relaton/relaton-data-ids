  content: "   This document introduces an extension to the Application-Layer\n   Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol, which enables announcements of\n   the composition
    modes of multiple cost map services.  Specifically,\n   the composition mode defines
    how the results of multiple cost map\n   services are combined to get the final
    prediction between two network\n   endpoints.  This extension allows ALTO servers
    to improve the\n   accuracy of the prediction model at similar map sizes, and
    to\n   efficiently enable differentiated services.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft provides a number of extensions to the Hierarchical MIPv4\nmodel
    in [1] as well as a new Hierarchical MIPv6 model. A number of\nadditions are made
    to Regional Tunnel Management in terms of Fast\nHandoffs and the avoidance of
    triangle routing within the hierarchical\ndomain. A few extensions were also made
    for MIPv6 and neighbour\ndiscovery to allow for the introduction of a hierarchical
    MIPv6 mobility\nmanagement model. The proposed hierarchical mobility management
    for\nMIPv6 will improve the performance of MIPv6 in terms of handoff speed\nand
    is well-suited to implement access control and handoffs between \ndifferent access
    technologies.\n\n\t "

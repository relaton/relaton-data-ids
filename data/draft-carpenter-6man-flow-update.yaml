abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Various published proposals for use of the IPv6 flow label are\nincompatible
    with its existing specification in RFC 3697.\nFurthermore, very little practical
    use is made of the flow label,\npartly due to some uncertainties about the correct
    interpretation of\nthe specification.  This document proposes changes to the\nspecification
    in order to clarify it, making it clear what types of\nusage are possible, and
    to introduce some additional flexibility.\n\t "

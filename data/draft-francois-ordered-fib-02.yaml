  content: "   This draft describes a mechanism for use in conjunction with link\n
    \  state routing protocols which prevents the transient loops which\n   would
    otherwise occur during topology changes.  It does this by\n   correctly sequencing
    the FIB updates on the routers.\n\n   This mechanism can be used in the case of
    non-urgent link or node\n   shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes.  It
    can also be used\n   in conjunction with a FRR mechanism which converts a sudden
    link or\n   node failure into a non-urgent topology change.  This is possible\n
    \  where a complete repair path is provided for all affected\n   destinations.\n\n
    \  After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that\n   defines
    the time at which it can safely update its FIB.  A method for\n   accelerating
    this loop-free convergence process by the use of\n   completion messages is also
    described.\n\n\t "

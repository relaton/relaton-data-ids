abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "To date, the HTTP access authentication framework, as described in \n[RFC2617]
    and as used in [SIPbis05], has permitted limited SIP \nmessage authentication
    from UAC to Proxy/UAS, Proxy to Proxy, and \nProxy to UAS. This draft addresses
    some of the shortcomings of SIP \nusage of Digest for message authentication between
    a SIP User Agent \nand a Proxy one hop away (e.g., an outbound Proxy). For the
    messages \nexchanged between the UA and a Proxy one hop away, the Service \nProvider
    may want to provide a different level of protection than \nthat possible for the
    same messages end-to-end.\n\t "

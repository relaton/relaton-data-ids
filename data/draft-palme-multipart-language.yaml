  content: "This memo describes an investigation of how some common mailers\n(Eudora,
    Pine, Hotmail, Outlook Express, Netscape, First Class, KOM\n2000) handled the
    use of multipart/alternative with different languages\nin the different body parts.\n\nNone
    of the mailers handled this very well. It seems as if none of the\nmailers can
    actually choose the part in the language preferred by the\nuser. Some of them
    displayed all language parts, some arbitrarily chose\nto display only one part.\n\nThe
    study compares different methods of specifying language translation\nin e-mail,
    but finds that no format seems to give satisfactory results\nwith all the tested
    mailers.\n\n\n\t "

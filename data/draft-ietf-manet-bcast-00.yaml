  content: "An ad hoc mobile network is a collection of nodes, each of which\ncommunicates
    over wireless channels and is capable of movement.\nNodes participating in such
    an ad hoc network communicate on\na peer-to-peer basis.  Flooding is often a desired
    form of\ncommunication in these networks, as it can enable both the\ndissemination
    of control information and the delivery of data\npackets.  This document describes
    a method for sending packets to\nevery node in an d hoc networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo presents a method for allowing an HTTP server to gather\n
    \  relevant performace data from compliant user-agents.  Though the HTML\n   5
    standard supplies Nav-Timings there is no standard way for that\n   data to be
    communicated back to an origin.  The intention of this\n   document is to describe
    a method in which that can be done cleanly\n   and scalably.\n\n\t "

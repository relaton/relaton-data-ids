  content: "   As Internet of Things (IoT) deployments increase steadily the need\n
    \  for a better user experience for handling the authentication and\n   authorization
    tasks in constrained environments increases.\n\n   While several technologies
    have been developed already that allow\n   federated access to protected resource
    the nature of IoT deployments\n   requires care with the limited resources available
    on many of these\n   devices.\n\n   This document defines a new OAuth 2.0 authorization
    grant for the\n   interaction between constrained clients and resource servers
    to\n   obtain access tokens for access to protected resources.  It does so\n   by
    leveraging prior work on OAuth 2.0, CoAP, and DTLS.\n\n\t "

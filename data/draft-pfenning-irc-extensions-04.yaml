  content: "This document describes IRCX, a set of extensions to the\n             Internet
    Relay Chat (IRC) protocol defined in RFC 1459[1].\n             Only client-server
    interactions  are defined. The added\n             functionality includes user
    authentication for multiple\n             security providers, support  for  UNICODE[2]
    \ characters,\n             multilayer  security,  and  a unified property mechanism.\n
    \            Chat server implementations can support channel or server\n             services
    with full  control over all messages and events.\n             These services
    communicate with the core server over an\n             extended IRC connection.\n
    \n             All changes to the IRC protocol are designed such  that\n             existing
    clients  will continue to work against servers\n             implementing the
    extensions. Support for the extended protocol\n             can be queried by
    clients to take advantage of the added\n             functionality or to conform
    to the basic protocol as defined\n             in RFC1459.\n\t "

  content: "   When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be\n
    \  able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to\n   reduce
    sending traffic for some period of time.  Multiple mechanisms\n   have been proposed
    for transporting overload and load information.\n   While these proposals differ
    in many ways, they share similar data\n   requirements.  This document analyzes
    the data requirements of each\n   proposal with a view towards proposing a common
    set of of Diameter\n   Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).\n\n\t "

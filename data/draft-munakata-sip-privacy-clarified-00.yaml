  content: "   This document defines the privacy mechanisms for the Session\n   Initiation
    Protocol (SIP).  Specifically, guidelines are provided for\n   the creation of
    messages that do not divulge personal identity\n   information.  A \"privacy service\"
    logical role for intermediaries is\n   defined to answer some privacy requirements
    that user agents cannot\n   satisfy themselves.  Finally, means are presented
    by which a user can\n   request particular functions from a privacy service.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS)\n
    \  described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support the\n   automount
    database.\n\n   The automount database schema SHALL be backwards compatible with
    the\n   Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries\n
    \  so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access\n   Protocol
    [RFC4510].\n\n   An automount database contains information about file system
    mount-\n   points that are to be mapped by the automounter.\n\n   This document
    describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-\n   mapping-00] for the automount
    database, and database entries\n   referenced by those maps.\n\t "

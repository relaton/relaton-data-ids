  content: "   Obtaining and maintaining PKI certificates for devices in a local\n
    \  domain network is difficult for both technical and human factors\n   reasons.
    \ This document describes an alternative approach to securely\n   identify and
    authenticate servers in the local domain using a HTTPS-\n   based trust anchor
    system, called a Referee.  The Referee allows\n   bootstrapping a network of devices
    by trusting only the Referee trust\n   anchor in the local domain.\n\n\t "

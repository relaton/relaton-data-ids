  content: "      This note describes the Service Allocation Profile scheme for\n
    \     differential service allocation within the Internet. The scheme is\n      based
    on a simple packet drop preference mechanism at interior\n      nodes, and highly
    flexible service profiles at edges and inter-\n      provider boundary points
    within the net. The service profiles\n      capture a wide variety of user requirements
    and expectations, and\n      allow different users to receive different levels
    of service from\n      the network in a scalable and efficient manner.\n\n      The
    note describes the basic form of the mechanism, discusses the\n      range of
    services that users and providers can obtain by employing\n      it, and gives
    a more detailed presentation of particular\n      technical, deployment, standardization,
    and economic issues\n      related to its use.\n\n\t "

  content: "The base WebDAV protocol [WebDAV] provides basic support for\ncollections.
    \ It defines a MKCOL method for creating collections and\nspecifies how other
    HTTP and WebDAV methods interact with collections.\nIt supports internal members
    of collections, which it defines as URIs\nthat are immediately relative to the
    URI of the collection.\n \nMany applications, however, need more powerful collections.
    \ There are\ntwo areas in particular where more powerful functionality is often\nneeded:
    referential resources and ordering.\n \nThis draft specifies extensions to the
    base WebDAV protocol to support\nthese more powerful collections.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a method to reduce the ARP broadcast in L2\n
    \  networks. There will be two MAC tables in the aggregation switches\n   which
    answer for the ARP responses and packet forwarding. Multicast\n   will take the
    place of broadcast for ARP request in this document\n   which will lead to the
    reduction of the numbers of ARP broadcast\n   packets in L2 networks.\n\n\t "

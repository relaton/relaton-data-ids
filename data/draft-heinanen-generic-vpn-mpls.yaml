  content: "This document describes a set of generic mechanisms which can be used\n
    \  to set up network based Virtual Private Networks (VPN) across IP\n   networks.
    In particular,  it describes how these mechanisms can be\n   mapped into a network
    running the Multi-Protocol Label Switching\n   (MPLS) specification.  The mechanisms
    described, however, can apply\n   to any type of IP network running various forms
    of IP tunneling\n   mechanisms, and are not solely restricted to MPLS networks.
    \ This\n   Draft serves to introduce these generic mechanisms, which are part
    of\n   the broader VPN framework which will be described more fully in\n   forthcoming
    Drafts.\n\t "

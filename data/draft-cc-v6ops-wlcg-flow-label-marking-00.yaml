  content: "   This document describes an experimentally deployed approach currently\n
    \  used within the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (WLCG)\n   to
    mark packets with their project (experiment) and application.  The\n   marking
    uses the 20-bit IPv6 Flow Label in each packet, with 15 bits\n   used for semantics
    and 5 bits for entropy.  Alternatives, in\n   particular use of IPv6 Extension
    Headers (EH), were considered but\n   found to not be practical.  The WLCG is
    one of the largest worldwide\n   research communities and has adopted IPv6 heavily
    for movement of\n   many tens of PB of data annually, with the ultimate goal of
    running\n   IPv6 only.\n\n\t "

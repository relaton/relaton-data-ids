  content: "   This document describes a mechanism for extending ICE candidates with\n
    \  an optional parameter which can be used to negotiate the usage of\n   bundled
    media, which refers to the usage of a single 5-tuple for\n   multiple RTP streams.
    \ In a scenario where a party initiating the\n   negotiation supports ICE [RFC5245]
    this mechanism provides the\n   ability to provide an SDP offer which is both
    backwards compatible\n   and able to fully specify the use of bundled media.  Therefore,
    this\n   mechanism allows bundled and non-bundled media to be negotiated in a\n
    \  single offer/answer exchange when both parties support ICE and this\n   extension.
    \ The mechanism complements the procedures described in\n   [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].\n\n\t "

  content: "The memo [9], which has been approved by the IESG to be published as\nan
    Informational RFC, enumerates a number of objectives that the\nSMIng language
    is expected to fulfill.  This memo describes the\ncompliance of a proposal based
    on former IRTF NMRG [8] work and\npublished in [10] and companion I-Ds for each
    of the strived\nobjectives.  This is done by including the whole list of objectives\nwithout
    any changes, but adding a compliance section for each of the\nobjectives, so that
    reading is as easy as possible.\n\t "

  content: "   Sending on QUIC streams can only be aborted early by the sender with\n
    \  a RESET_STREAM frame.  This document describes how a receiver can\n   indicate
    when the data they have received is enough, allowing the\n   sender to reliably
    deliver some data, but abort sending for anything\n   more than the indicated
    amount.\n\n\t "

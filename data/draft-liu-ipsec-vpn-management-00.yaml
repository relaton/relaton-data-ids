  content: "This document defines a common interface format for describing the\n   configuration
    of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in the context of\n   IPSec and equipment from
    different vendors. The configuration\n   format would be both importable and exportable
    by various vendors of\n   VPN equipment and software that is IPSec compliant,
    facilitating an\n   uniform and perhaps automated method of interoperability (creating\n
    \  a VPN) between VPN products from different vendors.\n \n   This document will
    only discuss the proposed configuration format.\n   The mechanism by which the
    file is propagated is beyond the scope of\n   this document and will not be discussed.\n
    \n   A security association is not mandatory between two management\n   stations
    from different vendors wishing to employ this method of VPN\n   configuration,
    as this configuration format can easily be packaged in\n   a file and propagated
    out of band.\n\t "

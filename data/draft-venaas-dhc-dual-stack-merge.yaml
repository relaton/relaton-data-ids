  content: "   A node may have support for communications using both IPv4 and IPv6\n
    \  protocols.  Such a node may wish to obtain both IPv4 and IPv6\n   configuration
    settings via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n   (DHCP).  This can be
    done by using the IPv4 and the IPv6 DHC\n   protocols respectively.  This document
    considers mechanisms that\n   allow such a node to make use of the configuration
    data from both\n   protocols to obtain the desired common configuration.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Many small inexpensive computing devices like home routers, Rasberry\n
    \  Pi etc. do not have a battery thus the systems have no idea what the\n   current
    time is upon boot.  Number of modern services take Time\n   Synchronization for
    granted, but operating systems do not allow the\n   start of these services to
    be deferred until after accurate clock has\n   been confirmed.\n\n   NTP provides
    accurate fine grain clock synchronization but in order\n   for NTP to succeed
    DNS needs work.  DNSSEC resolvers will fail if\n   system clock is off by more
    than little bit.  This draft proposes a\n   mechanism to offer \"reasonable\"
    current time to devices upon boot via\n   DHCP .\n\n\t "

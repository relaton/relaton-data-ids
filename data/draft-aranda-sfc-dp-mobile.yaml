  content: "   The evolution of the network towards 5G implies a challenge for the\n
    \  infrastructure.  The targeted services and the full deployment of\n   virtualization
    in all segments of the network will be possible and\n   necessary to provide some
    traffic-specific services near the next\n   generation base stations where the
    radio is processed.  Thus, service\n   function chains that currently reside in
    the infrastructure of the\n   Network operator (like, e.g. the Expeded Packet
    Gateway(EPG)) will be\n   extended to the radio access network (RAN).\n\n   In
    this draft we provide a non-exhaustive but representative list of\n   service
    functions in 4G and 5G networks, and explore different\n   scenarios for service-aware
    orchestration.\n\n   We base on the problem statement [RFC7498] and architecture
    framework\n   [RFC7665]  of the SFC working group, as well on the existing mobile\n
    \  networks use cases [I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility]  and the\n   requirement
    gathering process of the ITU-R IMT 2020 [1] and different\n   initiatives in Europe
    [2], Korea [3] and China [4] to anticipate\n   network elements that will be needed
    in 5G networks.\n\n   We then explore service-aware orchestration scenarios identifying\n
    \  where different network functions can be deployed in a fully\n   virtualised
    future network, where both the core and the edge provide\n   advanced virtualisation
    capabilities.\n\n\t "

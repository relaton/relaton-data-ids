  script: Latn
  content: "IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support\n   ASON
    routing requirements in [RFC5787].  No extensions were defined\n   for bandwidth
    advertisement as the Interface Switching Capability\n   Descriptor may optionally
    be included for each layer of a multi-layer\n   link [RFC4202].  However, for
    some types SONET/SDH links there can be\n   several data plane layers supported
    by a single link, and as a \n   result a need to carry several copies of the ISCD.\n\n
    \  This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for\n   SONET/SDH
    that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD\n   sub-TLV and has
    been designed to be consistent with advertisement\n   of bandwidth for OTN.\n\t "

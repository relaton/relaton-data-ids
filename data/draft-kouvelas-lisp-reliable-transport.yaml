  script: Latn
  content: "   The communication between LISP ETRs and Map-Servers is based on\n   unreliable
    UDP message exchange coupled with periodic message\n   transmission in order to
    maintain soft state.  The drawback of\n   periodic messaging is the constant load
    imposed on both the ETR and\n   the Map-Server.  New use cases for LISP have increased
    the amount of\n   state that needs to be communicated with requirements that are
    not\n   satisfied by the current mechanism.  This document introduces the use\n
    \  of a reliable transport for ETR to Map-Server communication in order\n   to
    eliminate the periodic messaging overhead, while providing\n   reliability, flow-control
    and endpoint liveness detection.\n\n\t "

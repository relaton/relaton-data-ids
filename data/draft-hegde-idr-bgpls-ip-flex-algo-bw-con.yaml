  content: "   Flexible Algorithm is a mechanism that allows Link state routing\n
    \  protocols (viz.  OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network\n   based
    on user-defined (and hence, flexible) constraints and metrics.\n   The computation
    is performed by routers participating in the specific\n   network in a distributed
    manner using a Flexible Algorithm\n   definition.  This definition provisioned
    on one or more routers and\n   propagated (viz.  OSPF and IS- IS flooding) through
    the network.  IP\n   Flex-algo enables these constraint based paths to be built
    in a\n   network which is purely IP and does not support MPLS or SRv6\n   forwarding
    plane.  BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection of\n   various topology
    information from the network.  This draft defines\n   extensions to BGP- LS address-family
    to advertise bandwidth, delay\n   and metric related constraints in Flexible algorithm
    definition.  It\n   also defines BGP-LS extensions required to advertise IP flexible\n
    \  algorithm related extensions in BGP-LS.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft attempts to identify potential impacts associated with\n
    \  new, extensible metadata facilities in Internet protocols, and\n   suggests
    possible mitigations.  Its goal is to have the discussion of\n   these tradeoffs
    up-front, rather than after the development of such\n   mechanisms.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: '<p>This document proposes a mechanism for authoritative DNS servers to
    signal their support for alternative transport protocols (e.g., DNS over TLS (DoT),
    DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over QUIC (DoQ)). This signaling may either be provided
    within the Additional section of authoritative DNS responses or be the result
    of direct DNS queries. The former, "opportunistic mode" is hint-based and aims
    to enable resolvers to discover alternative transports efficiently and then opportunistically
    upgrade connections to the authoritative, thereby improving privacy, security,
    and performance for subsequent interactions. The mechanism is designed to not
    require any protocol change or additional queries. It is safe, backward-compatible,
    and effective even when DNSSEC validation of the hint is not possible or desired.
    In certain circumstances and with additional overhead it is also possible to use
    direct queries to securely obtain authentication information for the authoritative
    that can then be used to authenticate an encrypted connection. It is also possible
    to establish a "validated mode" where the communication between the resolver and
    the authoritative server is provably both secure and authentic. Validated mode
    may not always be possible, depending on whether the resolver is able to DNSSEC
    validate the signal or not. When Validated mode is possible it does provide a
    stronger and more trustworthy connection. This document proposes an improvement
    to the opportunistic (but blind) testing of alternative transports suggested in
    RFC9539 by providing a mechanism by which a responding authoritative server may
    signal what alternative transports it supports. TO BE REMOVED: This document is
    being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-dnsop-transport-signaling
    (https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-dnsop-transport-signaling). The most
    recent working version of the document, open issues, etc, should all be available
    there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>'

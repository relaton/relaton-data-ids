  content: "   This document proposes a mechanism for authoritative DNS servers to\n
    \  signal their support for alternative transport protocols (e.g., DNS\n   over
    TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over QUIC (DoQ)).  This\n   signaling
    may either be provided within the Additional section of\n   authoritative DNS
    responses or be the result of direct DNS queries.\n\n   The former, \"opportunistic
    mode\" is hint-based and aims to enable\n   resolvers to discover alternative
    transports efficiently and then\n   opportunistically upgrade connections to the
    authoritative, thereby\n   improving privacy, security, and performance for subsequent\n
    \  interactions.  The mechanism is designed to not require any protocol\n   change
    or additional queries.  It is safe, backward-compatible, and\n   effective even
    when DNSSEC validation of the hint is not possible or\n   desired.\n\n   In certain
    circumstances and with additional overhead it is also\n   possible to use direct
    queries to securely obtain authentication\n   information for the authoritative
    that can then be used to\n   authenticate an encrypted connection.\n\n   It is
    also possible to establish a \"validated mode\" where the\n   communication between
    the resolver and the authoritative server is\n   provably both secure and authentic.
    \ Validated mode may not always be\n   possible, depending on whether the resolver
    is able to DNSSEC\n   validate the signal or not.  When Validated mode is possible
    it does\n   provide a stronger and more trustworthy connection.\n\n   This document
    proposes an improvement to the opportunistic (but\n   blind) testing of alternative
    transports suggested in RFC9539 by\n   providing a mechanism by which a responding
    authoritative server may\n   signal what alternative transports it supports.\n\n

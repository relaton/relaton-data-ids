  content: "   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol (BFD) is used to\n
    \  detect loss of connectivity between two forwarding elements,\n   typically
    with low latency.  BFD is leveraged by routing protocols,\n   including the Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP), to use that detection of\n   loss of connectivity to bring
    down the protocol connections faster\n   than the native protocol timers.\n\n
    \  This document defines a Subcode for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION\n   message
    for when a BGP connection is being closed due to a BFD\n   session going down.\n\n\n\t "

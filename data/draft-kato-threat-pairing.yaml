  content: "   Pairing is a special map from two elliptic curves that called\n   Pairing-friendly
    curves to a finite field and is useful mathematical\n   tools for constructing
    cryptographic primitives.\n\n   At CRYPTO 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed an
    efficient number field\n   sieve algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem
    in a finite field.\n   The security of pairing-based cryptography is based on
    the difficulty\n   in solving the DLP.  Hence, it has become necessary to shift
    the\n   parameters that the DLP is computationally infeasible against the\n   efficient
    number field sieve algorithms.\n\n   This memo introduce Optimal Ate Pairing and
    two pairing-friendly\n   curves with parameters of pairing against efficient number
    field\n   sieve algorithms.\n\n\t "

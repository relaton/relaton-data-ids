  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a simple protocol designed\n
    \ to enable the invitation of users to multimedia sessions. This\n  document is
    a companion draft to draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-04.txt, which\n  defines SIP but doesn't
    specify any security mechanisms other than\n  possible protection by lower-level
    security mechanisms such as SSL.\n  This leaves SIP transactions vulnerable to
    attack and this document\n  aims to extend the SIP protocol to address such security\n
    \ considerations.  This document is a product of the Multiparty\n  Multimedia
    Session Control (MMUSIC) working group of the Internet\n  Engineering Task Force
    Comments are solicited and should be addressed\n  to the working group's mailing
    list at confctrl@isi.edu and/or the\n  authors.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>SSL and TLS renegotiation are vulnerable to an attack in which the
    attacker forms a TLS connection with the target server, injects content of his
    choice, and then splices in a new TLS connection from a client. The server treats
    the client's initial TLS handshake as a renegotiation and thus believes that the
    initial data transmitted by the attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent
    client data. This draft defines a TLS extension to cryptographically tie renegotiations
    to the TLS connections they are being performed over, thus preventing this attack.</p>"

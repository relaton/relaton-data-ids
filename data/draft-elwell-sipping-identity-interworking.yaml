  content: "This document examines means of identifying or naming users of \ntelephony
    services within an enterprise. Numeric names (numbers) are \nused in traditional
    Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs) \nusing QSIG as the network signalling
    protocol. They are also used for \nexternal communication, e.g., with a public
    Integrated Services \nDigital Network (ISDN). Names need not be numeric in Internet
    \nProtocol (IP) networks employing signalling protocols such as the \nSession
    Initiation Protocol (SIP). This document therefore looks at \nnaming schemes that
    are appropriate within enterprise IP networks, in \nparticular enterprise IP networks
    employing SIP as the signalling \nprotocol. It also investigates naming schemes
    that are appropriate in \na mixed QSIG/SIP enterprise network and the treatment
    of names at an \ninterworking point. It details the use of names not only for
    \nselecting a user to participate in a call, but also as a means of \nidentifying
    a user in a call to other users in that call. ENUM and \nprivate ENUM-like services
    are also examined. \n\n\t "

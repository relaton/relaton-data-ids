  content: "   An SDF specification can describe the definition of a Things, i.e.,\n
    \  physical objects and their associated interactions and express the\n   various
    information that be exchanged for the interactions.\n   Therefore, the SDF format
    can be used to define the behaviour of an\n   object and its associated data model
    and interaction model in a\n   digital twin system that has an object as a component.
    \ In a digital\n   twin system, interactions between physical and virtual objects,
    as\n   well as interactions of objects existing in the different digital\n   twin
    systems, are performed over a network, which is important to\n   provide location
    information of objects during interactions.  This\n   document specifies the extension
    information of SDF to represent the\n   location information of an objects.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document suggests a method for delivering alarm information over
    the Internet.  All communication shall use an encryption algorithm for transmission
    of the data.  An immediate response from the host will be used for verification
    of receipt of the message.                           This transmission method
    may be use as a backup transmission method to traditional dial-up or leased line
    methods, or as a primary transmission method with traditional methods becomming
    the backup.                      Due to the required security of the data being
    transmitted, the encryption algorithm used will only be released on a need to
    know basis to software developers in the Alarm/Security Industry.  A non-disclosure
    agreement will be required.  Terms and conditions of the licensing will depend
    on the intended purpose for use and may require a non-competition agreement or
    licensing fees.                                                         The Internet
    Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned port 1733 for the registered use
    of SIIPAT transmissions.\n\t "

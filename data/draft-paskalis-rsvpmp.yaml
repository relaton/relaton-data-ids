  content: "Mobility management and QoS provision have been research topics in\nthe
    past years.  Mobile IP is the dominant protocol for mobility\nmanagement, whereas
    RSVP is a well established protocol for QoS\nprovision.  These protocols when
    deployed separately can work quite\nefficiently.  However, their interworking
    has been widely recognized\nto be problematic.  We propose a new approach that
    limits mobility\nand QoS related network modifications inside the domain in which
    a\nuser moves.\n\n\t "

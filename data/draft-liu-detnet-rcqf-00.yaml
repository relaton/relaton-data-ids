  content: "   The document proposes a solution called Resilient Cycle Queuing and\n
    \  Forwarding (RCQF) for DetNet extremely low data loss rates, bounded\n   latency
    and minimal jitter. RCQF is a technological advancement built\n   upon Cycle Queuing
    and Forwarding (CQF), designed to provide a\n   capability for the delivery of
    end-to-end DetNet flows. RCQF extends\n   the capabilities of CQF and makes it
    suitable for large scaling\n   networks. The elasticity of RCQF includes adaptive
    bonded latency,\n   minimal jitter, high bandwidth, large packet size, interface
    speed,\n   and only requires frequency synchronization. This document aims to\n
    \  introduce the concept of RCQF and its potential in providing\n   resilient
    and adaptable solutions for Deterministic Networks.\n\n\t "

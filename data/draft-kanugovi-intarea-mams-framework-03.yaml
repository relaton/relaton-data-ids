  content: "   In multiconnectivity scenarios, the end-user devices can\n   simultaneously
    connect to multiple networks based on different access\n   technologies and network
    architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL.  Both the\n   quality of experience of the
    users and the overall network\n   utilization and efficiency may be improved through
    the smart\n   selection and combination of access and core network paths that
    can\n   dynamically adapt to changing network conditions.  This document\n   presents
    a unified problem statement and introduces a solution for\n   managing multiconnectivity.
    \ The solution has been developed by the\n   authors based on their experiences
    in multiple standards bodies\n   including the IETF and 3GPP, but is not an Internet
    Standard and does\n   not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF.  This document\n
    \  describes the requirements, solution principles, and an architectural\n   framework
    that aims to provide best performance while being easy to\n   implement in a wide
    variety of multiconnectivity deployments.  It\n   specifies the protocol multi-access
    management to: 1) flexibly select\n   the best combination of access and core
    network paths for uplink and\n   downlink; as well as 2) determine the user plane
    treatment and\n   traffic distribution over the selected links ensuring network\n
    \  efficiency and application performance.\n\n\t "

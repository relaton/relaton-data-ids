  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data\n
    \  format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n   code
    size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need for version
    negotiation.\n\n   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR
    tags.\n   RFC 8949's original edition, RFC 7049, defined a basic set of 16 tags\n
    \  as well as a registry that can be used to contribute additional tag\n   definitions
    [IANA.cbor-tags].  Since RFC 7049 was published, at the\n   time of writing some
    190 definitions of tags and ranges of tags have\n   been added to that registry.\n\n
    \  The present document provides a roadmap to a large subset of these\n   tag
    definitions.  Where applicable, it points to an IETF standards or\n   standard
    development document that specifies the tag.  Where no such\n   document exists,
    the intention is to collect specification\n   information from the sources of
    the registrations.  After some more\n   development, the present document is intended
    to be useful as a\n   reference document for the IANA registrations of the CBOR
    tags the\n   definitions of which have been collected.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Messaging Layer Security provides strong end-to-end security\n   guarantees
    for group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and\n   Post-Compromise Security
    (PCS).  However, MLS requires a Delivery\n   Service (DS) to facilitate agreement
    between group members on the\n   order of Commit messages.  In decentralized settings
    the only way to\n   implement a functional DS is to require group members to retain
    key\n   material so they can process commits out-of-order.  Retaining key\n   material
    this way is in violation of the MLS deletion schedule and\n   significantly reduces
    the FS of the protocol.  This draft specifies\n   Decentralized MLS, based on
    the the Fork-Resilient Continuous Group\n   Key Agreement protocol FREEK proposed
    by Alwen et al.  [FRCGKA].  In\n   essence, DMLS extends MLS such that key material
    can be retained to\n   process Commits out-of-order with minimal losses to FS,
    thus allowing\n   safer deployment in decentralized environments.\n\n\t "

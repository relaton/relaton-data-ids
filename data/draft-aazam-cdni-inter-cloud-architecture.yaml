  content: "   With the rapid rise in digital content, cloud computing has become\n
    \  the focus of academia and industry. Cloud computing comes with\n   sophisticated
    technologies for data storage, management, and\n   distribution. Ubiquitous access
    facility and pay-as-you-go billing\n   features are additional advantages associated
    with this paradigm.\n   However, the massive digital content, more importantly
    multimedia,\n   has to be managed in a more effective way. Heterogeneous cloud\n
    \  customers, accessing different customized services, with more advanced\n   access
    networks and devices available today, makes it tough at times\n   for solitary
    clouds to fulfill the needs. In such cases, different\n   clouds have to interoperate
    and federate their resources. This\n   scenario is called inter-cloud computing
    of cloud federation. Since\n   the concept of inter-cloud computing is still very
    new, it lacks\n   standard architecture. This document focuses on presenting architectural\n
    \  fundamentals and key concerns associated with inter-cloud computing.\n\n\t "

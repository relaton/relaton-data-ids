  content: "This Internet Draft discusses Reliable UDP (RUDP).  RUDP is a simple\npacket
    based transport protocol.  RUDP is based on RFCs 1151 and 908 -\nReliable Data
    Protocol.  RUDP is layered on the UDP/IP Protocols and\nprovides reliable in-order
    delivery (up to a maximum number of\nretransmissions) for virtual connections.
    \ RUDP has a very flexible\ndesign that would make it suitable for a variety of
    transport uses.\nOne such use would be to transport telecommunication signaling\nprotocols.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)\n
    \  for IPv4 and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it\n   is
    based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and\n   in \"Virtual
    Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6\".  VRRP specifies an\n   election protocol
    that dynamically assigns responsibility for a\n   virtual router to one of the
    VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router\n   controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es)
    associated with a virtual\n   router is called the VRRP Active Router, and it
    forwards packets sent\n   to these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  VRRP Active Routers
    are configured\n   with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup Routers
    infer\n   the address family of the virtual addresses being carried based on\n
    \  the transport protocol.  Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers in\n   each
    of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are a domain unto\n   themselves and do
    not overlap.  The election process provides dynamic\n   failover in the forwarding
    responsibility should the Active Router\n   become unavailable.  For IPv4, the
    advantage gained from using VRRP\n   is a higher-availability default path without
    requiring configuration\n   of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on
    every end-host.\n   For IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is
    a quicker\n   switchover to Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard
    IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.\n\n   The VRRP terminology has been updated
    conform to inclusive language\n   guidelines for IETF technologies.  This document
    obsoletes VRRP\n   Version 3 [RFC5798].\n\n\t "

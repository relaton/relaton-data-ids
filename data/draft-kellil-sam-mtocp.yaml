  content: "To cope with the lack of IP multicast support in today's Internet, a \n
    \  multiparty transport overlay architecture is presented in this \n   document.
    The goal behind placing the overlay paradigm at the \n   transport layer is to
    support both multicast-capable and non-\n   multicast IP networks while providing
    an application-agnostic \n   delivery service for group communications. In particular,
    this \n   document specifies the Multiparty Transport Overlay Control Protocol
    \n   (MTOCP) used to create, update and remove multiparty transport trees \n   in
    an IP network. \n\n\t "

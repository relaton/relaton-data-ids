abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, transferring the signaling of mobile network over IP attracts
    lots of attention from people. Telephone number based on E.164 or E.214 or SP
    is the traditional routing address for mobile network, but actually, E.164, E.214
    and SP is not supported by MP-BGP protocol. This document presents a new way to
    support for routing the phone number based on E.164, E.214 or SP though MP-BGP,
    by extending the MP-BGP for the Phone Number Routing. It can bring optimizing
    for the network architecture and improving efficiency.</p>"

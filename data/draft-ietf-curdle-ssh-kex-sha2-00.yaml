  script: Latn
  content: "   This document deprecates some previously specified Key Exchange\n   Method
    algorithm names as well as defining a few added Modular\n   Exponential (MODP)
    Groups for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.  It\n   also updates [RFC4253], [RFC4419],
    [RFC4462], and [RFC5656] by\n   specifying the set key exchange algorithms that
    currently exist and\n   which ones MUST, SHOULD, MAY, and SHOULD NOT be implemented.
    \ New key\n   exchange methods use the SHA-2 family of hashes.\n\n\t "

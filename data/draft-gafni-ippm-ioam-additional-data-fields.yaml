    \  operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet\n   traverses
    a path between two points in the network.  This document\n   discusses additional
    data fields and associated data types to be\n   added to the IOAM data fileds
    described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].\n   In-situ OAM data fields can be encapsulated
    into a variety of\n   protocols such as NSH, Segment Routing, Geneve, IPv6 (via

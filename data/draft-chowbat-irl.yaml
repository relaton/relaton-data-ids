  content: "   Many people learn technical concepts best in a hands-on environment,\n
    \  and Internet protocols and standards are no exception. Internet\n   Research
    Labs (IRL) will facilitate a platform and encourage the\n   technical community
    (seasoned professionals and newcomers alike) to\n   discuss, collaborate, design
    and develop utilities, ideas, sample\n   code and solutions that show practical
    implementations (Proof of\n   Concept) of existing IETF standards. These labs
    may also be used by\n   the IETF Mentoring Program and/or EDU teams for hands-on
    training to\n   mentees or newcomers. This base draft intends to provide a high-level\n
    \  overview of the concept of Internet Research Labs in terms of\n   objectives,
    requirements, challenges and deliverables without going\n   into details of a
    specific lab, technology or an IETF Working Group\n   (WG). After this draft matures
    and gains traction within the IETF\n   community, we foresee more and more Internet
    drafts for the specific\n   labs.\n\n\n\t "

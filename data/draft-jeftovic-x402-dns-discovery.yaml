abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a DNS-based discovery mechanism for locating
    x402 payment resources associated with a domain. Domains publish one or more _x402
    TXT records containing URLs where x402-compatible clients can obtain resource
    manifests and metadata over HTTPS. The goal is to provide a lightweight, cache-friendly
    discovery vector that enables automated payment negotiation using the x402 protocol
    while keeping DNS records static and non-sensitive.</p>"

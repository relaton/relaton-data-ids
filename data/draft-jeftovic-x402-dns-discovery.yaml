  content: "   This document defines a DNS-based discovery mechanism for locating\n
    \  x402 payment resources associated with a domain.\n\n   Domains publish one
    or more _x402 TXT records containing URLs where\n   x402-compatible clients can
    obtain resource manifests and metadata\n   over HTTPS.\n\n   The goal is to provide
    a lightweight, cache-friendly discovery vector\n   that enables automated payment
    negotiation using the x402 protocol\n   while keeping DNS records static and non-sensitive.\n\n\t "

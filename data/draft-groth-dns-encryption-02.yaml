  content: "This document requests IANA registration of a new DNS OpCode and\nErrorCode
    type in facilitating encryption of DNS requests and\nreplies and feed back to
    the client if plain text requests are not\nacceptable. Once this OpCode is seen
    the DNS server attempts to\ndecrypt the request using its private OpenPGP key.
    Inside the\nencrypted packet is the AES key which the client expects to be used\nwhen
    the server encrypts a response. A server may advertise that it\nis capable of
    DNS encryption by returning OpenPGP fingerprints in\nTXT records using a similar
    format to Public Key Association (PKA).\nThe full pubic keys are returned from
    DNS servers by using a CERT\nrequest against the host name(s) of the domain's
    NS records or via\nOpenPGP key servers.\n\t "

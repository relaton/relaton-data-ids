  content: "The Efficient Protocol Independent Compression [EPIC] scheme is a \ngeneral
    mechanism for providing additional profiles for use within \nthe [ROHC8] framework.
    The EPIC inputset is a list of fields from the \nprotocol stack to be compressed,
    and for each field a choice of \nencoding techniques together with the probabilities
    that they will be \nused. The output of EPIC is a set of optimally efficient compressed
    \nheader formats for the chosen protocol stack, and an automatic \nmechanism for
    translating between compressed and uncompressed packet \nformats. \n\n\t "

  content: "   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network\n
    \  nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate\n   incipient
    congestion to the end-points.  Receivers with an ECN-\n   capable transport protocol
    feed back this information to the sender.\n   ECN was originally specified for
    TCP in such a way that only one\n   feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip
    Time (RTT).  Recent\n   new TCP mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data
    Center TCP\n   (DCTCP) or Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) need
    more\n   accurate ECN feedback information whenever more than one marking is\n
    \  received in one RTT.  This document updates the original ECN\n   specification
    to specify a scheme to provide more than one feedback\n   signal per RTT in the
    TCP header.  Given TCP header space is scarce,\n   it allocates a reserved header
    bit previously assigned to the ECN-\n   Nonce.  It also overloads the two existing
    ECN flags in the TCP\n   header.  The resulting extra space is exploited to feed
    back the IP-\n   ECN field received during the 3-way handshake as well.  Supplementary\n
    \  feedback information can optionally be provided in a new TCP option,\n   which
    is never used on the TCP SYN.  The document also specifies the\n   treatment of
    this updated TCP wire protocol by middleboxes, updating\n   BCP 69 with respect
    to ACK filtering.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Security Considerations sections of many Internet Drafts say, in effect,
    \"just use IPsec\".  While this is sometimes correct, more often it will leave
    users without real, interoperable security mechanisms.  This memo offers some
    guidance on when IPsec Version 2 should and should not be specified.  This document
    specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

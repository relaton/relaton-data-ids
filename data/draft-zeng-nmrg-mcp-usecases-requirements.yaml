abstract:
- content: "<p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents is reshaping
    how network operators interact with infrastructure. However, current network management
    systems lack a standardized, secure, and intent-driven interface that enables
    AI agents to discover, invoke, and reason over network capabilities. This document
    presents a problem statement for integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
    into network management, outlines key use cases—including troubleshooting, measurement,
    security, and optimization—and specifies functional, security, and interoperability
    requirements for MCP-based network management architectures.</p>"

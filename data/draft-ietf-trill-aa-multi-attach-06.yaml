  content: "TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) active-active service
    provides end stations with flow-level load balance and resilience against link
    failures at the edge of TRILL campuses, as described in RFC 7379.\n\n This document
    specifies a method by which member RBridges (also referred to as Routing Bridges
    or TRILL switches) in an active-active edge RBridge group use their own nicknames
    as ingress RBridge nicknames to encapsulate frames from attached end systems.
    Thus, remote edge RBridges (who are not in the group) will see one host Media
    Access Control (MAC) address being associated with the multiple RBridges in the
    group. Such remote edge RBridges are required to maintain all those associations
    (i.e., MAC attachments) and to not flip-flop among them (as would occur prior
    to the implementation of this specification). The design goals of this specification
    are discussed herein.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document makes the argument that to support the centralized\n
    \  control of a substantial number of forwarding devices (as Software\n   Defined
    Networking (SDN) proposes) that the scale, speed, cost and\n   general quality
    of such a solution will be improved by reducing\n   the state needed to be distributed
    into the network of devices by\n   the controller(s). To this end we re-visit
    forms of Source Routing\n   (SR), in particular Strict Link Source Routing (SLSR)
    and suggest\n   that light weight SLSR could allow substantial reduction in\n
    \  controller burden while potentially reducing the costs/complexity\n   on forwarding
    devices. We discuss some simulation results that\n   demonstrate these advantages
    and how the advantages grow\n   substantially as the network diameter grows. We
    also look at\n   various implementation possibilities including existing IPV4,
    V6,\n   MPLS, new/modified MPLS vs. something brand new that could\n   possibly
    be implemented with new SDN technology like Protocol\n   Oblivious Forwarding-POF.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a\nlink-layer
    agnostic transport for Extensible Authentication Protocol\n(EAP) to enable network
    access authentication between clients and\naccess networks.\n\nPANA framework
    defines two types of security associations which can\nbe bootstrapped as a consequence
    of PANA execution: IP layer security\nis established with IPsec by using IKE and
    link-layer security with\nWPA/IEEE 802.11i in PSK mode.\n\nThis document is focused
    on how PANA can bootstrap link layer\nsecurity through IEEE 802.11i and exposes
    issues which can be raised\nas a consequence of this interaction.\n\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "   The objective of the Footprint and Capability Interface of CDNi is
    to\n   allow a dCDN to expose information to a uCDN so that the uCDN can\n   select
    a set of dCDN(s) to delivery contents for content publishers.\n   In this draft,
    we propose a flexible approach for a dCDN to expose\n   its footprint and capabilities
    based on a generic concept called\n   Service Access or Anchor Point.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides requirements for security services based on\n
    \  software-defined networking (SDN) with two representative use cases:\n   (i)
    centralized firewall system for intra-domain networks and (ii)\n   centralized
    DDoS-attack mitigation system between inter-domain\n   networks.  For the centralized
    firewall system, this document raises\n   challenging issues in existing firewalls
    and a use case of\n   centralized firewall system based on SDN.  For the centralized
    DDoS-\n   attack mitigation system, this document also raises challenging\n   issues
    in existing DDoS-attack mitigation techniques and a use case\n   of centralized
    DDoS-attack mitigation system based on SDN.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the \"Bump-In-the-Host\" (BIH), a host based\nprotocol
    translation mechanism that allows a subset of applications\nsupporting only one
    IP address family to communicate with peers that\nare reachable or supporting
    only the other address family.\n\nThis specification addresses scenarios where
    a host is provided dual\nstack or IPv6 only network connectivity.  In the dual
    stack network\ncase, single address family applications in the host sometime will\ncommunicate
    directly with other hosts using the different address\nfamily.  In the case of
    IPv6 only network or IPv6 only destination,\nIPv4 originated communications have
    to be translated into IPv6.  The\nBIH makes the IPv4 applications think they talk
    to IPv4 peers and\nhence hides the IPv6 from those applications.\n\nAcknowledgement
    of previous work\n\nThis document is an update to and directly derivative from
    Kazuaki\nTSHUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI, and Yoshifumi ATARASHI [RFC2767] and\nfrom
    Seungyun Lee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, and\nErik Nordmark's
    [RFC3338], which similarly provides a dual stack host\nmeans to communicate with
    other IPv6 host using existing IPv4\nappliations.  This document combines and
    updates both [RFC2767] and\n[RFC3338].\n\nThe changes in this document reflect
    five components\n\n\n1.  Supporting IPv6 only network connections\n\n\n2.  IPv4
    address pool use private address instead of the\n\nunassigned IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.1
    - 0.0.0.255)\n\n\n3.  Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently\n\n\n4.
    \ Adding an alternative way to implement the ENR\n\n5.  Going for standards track
    instead of experimental/\n\ninformational\n\t "

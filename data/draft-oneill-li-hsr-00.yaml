  content: "This memo overviews the need for intra-domain Host specific routing \n(HSR)
    in the Internet. Host Specific Routing provides a number of \nbenefits if route
    entry and look-up scalability issues can be \nadequately addressed. These benefits
    are the enabling of flat \nrouting domains that eliminate the need for hierarchy
    and associated \nconfiguration, and the potential to support rapid movement of
    IP \naddresses through the routing fabric. This draft describes some of \nthe
    current work in this area, including TORA and Wireless Internet \nProtocol (WIP),
    and the as yet unresolved research issues associated \nwith large-scale host routing.
    This draft requires and makes no \ntopological assumptions for HSR. Specifically
    it does not require a \nstrict tree, as implied by CIP and HAWAII. These micro-mobility
    \nprotocols do however share many of the scalability and inter-\nprotocol issues
    associated with host specific routes. \n\n\t "

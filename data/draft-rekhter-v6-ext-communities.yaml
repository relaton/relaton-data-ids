  content: "Current specifications of BGP Extended Communities [BGP-EXTCOMM]\n   support
    IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, but do not support\n   IPv6 Address
    Specific Extended Community. The lack of IPv6 Address\n   Specific Extended Community
    may be a problem when an application uses\n   IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community,
    and one wants to use this\n   application in a pure IPv6 environment. This document
    defines a new\n   BGP attribute, IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community that\n
    \  addresses this problem. The IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community\n   is
    similar to the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, except\n   that it carries
    an IPv6 address rather than an IPv4 address.\n\t "

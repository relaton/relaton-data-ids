- language: en

  content: "This document describes a new document series intended for use as a repository
    for IETF operations documents, which should be more ephemeral than RFCs, but more
    referenceable than Internet-Drafts, and with more clear handling procedures than
    a random Web page.\n\n It proposes to establish this series as an RFC 3933 process
    experiment. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

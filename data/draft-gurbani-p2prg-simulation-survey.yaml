- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols, like all distributed protocols, are\ncomplex,
    and therefore harder to debug and study in the wild.  This\nis more true of existing
    p2p protocols, where changing the behaviour\nof the protocol --- however minor
    the change may be --- may result in\nunknown manifestations on the dynamics of
    the swarm using that\nprotocol.  In lieu of the unintended consequences of perturbing
    a\nlive swarm, researchers have resorted to simulation frameworks.\nHowever, simulation
    results obtained from one simulator are often\nhard to reproduce when using another
    simulation framework.  This\ndocument surveys existing simulator frameworks prevalent
    in\nsimulating p2p protocols today in order to quantify any assumptions\nand characteristics
    inherent in the simulator.  This, we hope, will\naid future researchers in choosing
    the right simulation framework for\ntheir abstraction.\n\t "

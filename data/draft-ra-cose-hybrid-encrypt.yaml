- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms\n
    \  simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing\n   security
    even if all but one of the component algorithms is broken.\n   It is motivated
    by transition to post-quantum cryptography.  This\n   document provides a construction
    for hybrid key exchange in JOSE and\n   COSE.  It defines the use of traditional
    and PQC algorithms, a hybrid\n   post-quantum KEM, for JOSE and COSE.\n\n\t "

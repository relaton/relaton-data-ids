  content: "The draft describes, analyzes, and recommends traffic engineering (TE)\nmethods
    which control a network's response to traffic demands and other\nstimuli, such
    as link failures or node failures.  These TE methods include:\n*traffic management
    through control of routing functions, which\ninclude call routing (number/name
    translation to routing address),\nconnection routing, QoS resource management,
    routing table management, and dynamic transport routing.\n*capacity management
    through control of network design.\n*TE operational requirements for traffic management
    and capacity\nmanagement, including forecasting, performance monitoring, and short-term
    network adjustment.\nThese TE methods are recommended for application across network
    types based on established practice and experience.\n\n\n\t "

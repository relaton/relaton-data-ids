  content: "          This document presents a framework for in-network caching in\n
    \         LTE mobile networks. The purpose of the framework is to\n          provide
    an overall picture of the problem space of in-network\n          caching and to
    describe the relationships among the various\n          components of mobile networks
    and the newly added entities,\n          such as content nodes and content controller.
    The framework\n          requires the specification of interfaces and mechanisms
    to\n          address issues such as content placement, request routing\n          and
    content catalog maintenance. The intent of this document\n          is to outline
    what each interface needs to accomplish and to\n          describe how these interfaces
    and mechanisms fit together,\n          while leaving their detailed specification
    to other documents.\n\n\t "

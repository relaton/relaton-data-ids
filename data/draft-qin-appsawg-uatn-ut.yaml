  content: "   Moving data center closer to end users can provide numerous benefits\n
    \  for pre-uploaded content: lower latency, increased robustness of\n   delivery,
    and improved quality of user experience.  For these\n   reasons, many Online Storage
    Service Providers(OSSPs),Photos Sharing\n   Service Providers (PSSPs), and Videos
    Sharing Service\n   Providers(VSSPs), etc., are scaling up their infrastructure,
    and many\n   above Upload Service Providers(USPs)are also deploying their own\n
    \  cloud platforms to improve data upload rate.  It is generally\n   desirable
    that a given content item generated by end users can be\n   quickly and robustly
    delivered to the destination regardless of that\n   end user's location or attachment
    network.  This is the motivation\n   for deploying Upload Acceleration Transport
    Network(UATN) so it can\n   propose an open content delivery infrastructure for
    the end-to-end\n   delivery of content from end users to the destination(data
    center or\n   another end user, etc.).  However, no standards or open\n   specifications
    currently exist to facilitate such an upload\n   acceleration mechanism.\n\n   The
    goal of this document is to explain the proposed UATN in detail\n   for providing
    public upload acceleration service and interconnect\n   existing upload acceleration
    systems as an open content delivery\n   infrastructur.\n\n\t "

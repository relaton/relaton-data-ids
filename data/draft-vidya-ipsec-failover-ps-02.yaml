  content: "Recovering from failure of IPsec gateways maintaining large numbers\n
    \  of SAs may take several minutes, if they need to re-establish the\n   IPsec
    SAs by re-running the key management protocol, IKEv2.  A\n   similar problem arises
    in the event of a network outage resulting in\n   the failure of several gateways
    and servers.  The latency involved in\n   this approach is significant, leading
    to a need for a faster and yet\n   secure failover solution.  This document describes
    the problem\n   statement and the goals for an IPsec/IKEv2 gateway failover/\n
    \  redundancy solution.\n\t "

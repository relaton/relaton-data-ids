  content: "One of the basic limitations of the ATMARP service model specified in
    RFC 1577 [LAUB94] is the requirement that only one ATMARP server be utilized to
    provide the address resolution service for a given LIS.  Besides introducing a
    single-point-of-failure into a LIS, this model also presents obvious scaling issues.
    A proposal was put forth in 'Classical IP and ARP over ATM Update' [LAUB95] to
    resolve these shortcomings through the introduction of a model supporting multiple
    ATMARP servers that maintain fully-replicated, synchronized address resolution
    databases. This model necessitates a certain amount of complexity introduced by
    the addition of a server database synchronization protocol. This synchronization
    protocol also requires additional packet types and formats as well as associated
    semantics.  It is felt, however, that a fully-replicated, synchronized database
    scheme is not required to provide a reasonably robust ATMARP service that addresses
    the limitations of the basic model.\n\t "

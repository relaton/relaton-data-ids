  content: "   The aim of this draft is to define an MPLS-TP OAM mechanism to meet
    \n   the requirements for proactive Continuity Check and Connectivity \n   Verification
    functionality as defined in [3]. \n\n   Note: this version of the draft is focused
    on analyzing possible \n   solutions and evaluating their pros&cons as well as
    issues. In the \n   next version of the draft the solution to be standardized

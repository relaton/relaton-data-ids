  content: "Many of today’s networks use PPP as a means of providing access \nlinks
    to remote users. In case a PPP user is mobile and performs a \nsubnet handover,
    it needs to tear down and re-establish of its PPP \nlink with the network. PPP
    link re-establishment is an elaborate \nprocedure (as explained in a later section
    of this document) \ninvolving multiple messages. This will lead in an extended
    service \ndisruption as due to the round trip time involved in the messaging \nas
    well extensive radio bandwidth usage. Of this reason, we \nconsider PPP to be
    a prime candidate for context transfer [1-3]. \nThe proposal in this document
    can reduce the number of PPP \nestablishment messages by 50%-100. Furthermore,
    it will save \nsignificant amount of time in PPP state machine transitions, due
    \nto the multiphase nature of PPP. Reliability and timing issues of \nPPP context
    transfer are also discussed. \n\t "

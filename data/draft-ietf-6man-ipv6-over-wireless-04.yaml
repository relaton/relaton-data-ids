  content: "   This document presents an architecture for IPv6 access networks that\n
    \  decouples the network-layer concepts of Links, Interface, and Subnets\n   from
    the link-layer concepts of links, ports, and broadcast domains,\n   and limits
    the reliance on link-layer broadcasts.  This architecture\n   is suitable for
    IPv6 over any network, including non-broadcast\n   networks, which is typically
    the case for intangible media such as\n   wireless and overlays.  A study of the
    issues with IPv6 ND over\n   intangible media is presented, and a framework to
    solve those issues\n   within the new architecture is proposed.\n\n\t "

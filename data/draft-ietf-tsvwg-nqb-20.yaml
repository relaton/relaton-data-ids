  content: "   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non-\n
    \  Queue-Building Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The NQB PHB provides a\n   shallow-buffered,
    best-effort service as a complement to a Default\n   deep-buffered best-effort
    service for Internet services.  The purpose\n   of this NQB PHB is to provide
    a separate queue that enables smooth\n   (i.e. non-bursty), low-data-rate, application-limited
    traffic\n   microflows, which would ordinarily share a queue with bursty and\n
    \  capacity-seeking traffic, to avoid the latency, latency variation and\n   loss
    caused by such traffic.  This PHB is implemented without\n   prioritization and
    can be implemented without rate policing, making\n   it suitable for environments
    where the use of these features is\n   restricted.  The NQB PHB has been developed
    primarily for use by\n   access network segments, where queuing delays and queuing
    loss caused\n   by Queue-Building protocols are manifested, but its use is not\n
    \  limited to such segments.  In particular, applications to cable\n   broadband
    links, Wi-Fi links, and mobile network radio and core\n   segments are discussed.
    \ This document recommends a specific\n   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
    to identify Non-Queue-\n   Building microflows.\n\n   [NOTE (to be removed by
    RFC-Editor): This document references an ISE\n   submission draft (I-D.briscoe-docsis-q-protection)
    that is approved\n   for publication as an RFC.  This draft should be held for
    publication\n   until the queue protection RFC can be referenced.]\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo focuses on the evolving networking technology within and\n
    \  among relatively small \"residential home\" networks.  The goal of this\n   memo
    is to define the architecture for IPv6-based home networking\n   that supports
    the demands placed on it.  This architecture shows how\n   standard IPv6 mechanisms
    and addressing can be employed in home\n   networking, and outlines the need for
    specific protocol extensions\n   for certain additional functionality.\n\n\t "

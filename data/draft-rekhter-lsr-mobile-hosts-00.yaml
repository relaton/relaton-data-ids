abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memo describes an approach to transparent mobile internetworking,
    meaning that unchanged hosts can move among networks in a fashion transparent
    to protocols above IP, while at the same time providing steady state optimal routing
    between either a pair of moving hosts or between a moving host and a stationary
    host.                                         The approach rests upon the existence
    of a limited set of entities, called Base Access Stations (BAS) and Mobile Routers
    (MR) that coordinate forwarding among mobile hosts (MH).\n\t "

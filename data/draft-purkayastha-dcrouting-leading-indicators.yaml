  content: "   This document describes a few use cases to illustrate the\n   expectations
    on today's network.  Based on those expectations, it\n   describes how the network
    architecture and network requirements are\n   changing.  The new requirements
    are impacting data center\n   architecture.  The way data centers are evolving,
    such as central\n   data centers to smaller data centers, a single deployment
    to multiple\n   deployments, is described.  With this new data center model, areas\n
    \  such as routing inside the data center and outside the data center is\n   impacted.
    \ The document describes this impact and summarizes few\n   features for these
    new data center model.\n\n\t "

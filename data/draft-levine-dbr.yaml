  content: "Domains can authenticate their outgoing mail using DKIM or other\ntechniques.
    \ In some cases where miscreants frequently use a domain\nwithout authorization
    in the Author address in e-mail messages, it\nmay be prudent for recipient mail
    systems to discard unauthenticated\nmail as likely to be fraudulent.  This specification
    defines an\nextension to Vouch by Reference (VBR) that allows a certifier to\nidentify
    such domains, and that recipients can use either in\nconjunction with or independently
    of VBR.\n\t "

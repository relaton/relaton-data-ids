abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) preference expressions
    are bound to signaling and media protocols used for real- time, session-based
    communications such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and associated Session
    Description Protocol (SDP) offers. It specifies a reusable binding model, concrete
    SIP header field conventions, and SDP attributes that allow endpoints, intermediary
    services, and AI assistants to advertise, negotiate, and enforce requirements
    about AI-driven processing of session metadata, media control events, and telemetry.
    The goal is to align real-time protocol behavior with the AI Preferences (AIPREF)
    vocabulary without disrupting existing call control semantics.</p>"

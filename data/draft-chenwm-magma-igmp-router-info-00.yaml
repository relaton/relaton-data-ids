  content: "   IGMP is used by IPv4 system to report their multicast group\n   memberships
    to multicast routers.\n   \n   This document adds support for router annoucing
    information, that\n   is, the ability for a multicast router to annouce information
    about a\n   group to host. For example, some hosts may send reports to join a\n
    \  group that do not exist, so the router would send some message to\n   inform
    the hosts.\n\t "

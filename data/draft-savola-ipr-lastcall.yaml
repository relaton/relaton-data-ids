  content: "This memo describes an additional policy with last calls regarding\nIntellectual
    Property Rights (IPR) disclosures or other knowledge of\nIPR.  The existence and
    the pointer to the IPR disclosures or an\nindication of non-existence of knowledge
    of such disclosures must be\nmentioned in all IETF last calls and should be mentioned
    in working\ngroup last calls.  Additionally, all documents under the IETF change\ncontrol
    for which a last call prior to the approval was not required\nand IPR disclosures
    are known, must now be either last-called or\nrejected.  This memo updates RFC
    2026 and RFC 2418.\n\t "

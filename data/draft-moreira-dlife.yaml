  content: "   This document is written in the context of the Delay Tolerant\n   Networking
    Research Group and will be presented for reviewing by that\n   group. This document
    defines dLife, an opportunistic routing protocol\n   that takes advantage of time-evolving
    social structures. dLife\n   belongs to the family of social-aware opportunistic
    routing protocols\n   for intermittently connected networks. dLife operates based
    on a\n   representation of the dynamics of social structures as a weighted\n   contact
    graph, where the weights (i.e., social strengths) express how\n   long a pair
    of nodes is in contact over different periods of time. It\n   considers two complementary
    utility functions: Time-Evolving Contact\n   Duration (TECD) that captures the
    evolution of social interaction\n   among pairs of users in the same daily period
    of time, over\n   consecutive days; and TECD Importance (TECDi) that captures
    the\n   evolution of user's importance, based on its node degree and the\n   social
    strength towards its neighbors, in different periods of time.\n   It is intended
    for use in wireless networks where there is no\n   guarantee that a fully connected
    path between any source -\n   destination pair exists at any time, a scenario
    where traditional\n   routing protocols are unable to deliver bundles. Such networks
    can be\n   sparse mesh, in which case intermittent connectivity is due to lack\n
    \  of physical connections, or dense mesh, in which case intermittent\n   connectivity
    may be due to high interference or shadowing. In any\n   case, intermittent connectivity
    can also be due to the availability\n   of devices (e.g., unavailable due to power
    saving rules). The\n   document presents an architectural overview followed by
    the protocol\n   specification.\n\n\t "

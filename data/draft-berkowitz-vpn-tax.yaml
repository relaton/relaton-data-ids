  content: "Most useful networking ideas involve some level of abstraction.\nVirtual
    private networks (VPN) map an abstraction of an user-defined\ninterface onto an
    infrastructure. Multihoming strategies are\nvirtualizations in the infrastructure
    [Berkowitz multihome]\nthat should be invisible to the VPN. Proprietary definitions
    of VPNs\nproliferate in the marketplace, to the confusion of end users. This memorandum
    proposes a taxonomy which can describe a variety of VPN models.\nIt does not recommend
    any specific model, but suggests a consistent\nway of describing specific VPNs.
    This document differs from some\nother working papers that go more deeply into
    the VPN mechanisms.\nIn contrast, this document is focused on user requirments.\n\t "

  content: "   Network equipment are often configured by a variety of network\n   management
    systems (NMS), protocols, and teams.  If a network issue\n   arises (e.g., because
    of a wrong configuration change), it is\n   important to quickly identify the
    root cause and obtain the reason\n   for pushing that modification.  Another potential
    network issue can\n   stem from concurrent NMSes with overlapping intents, each
    having\n   their own tasks to perform.  In such a case, it is important to map\n
    \  the respective modifications to its originating NMS.\n\n   This document specifies
    a NETCONF mechanism to automatically map the\n   configuration modifications to
    their source, up to a specific NMS\n   change request.  Such a mechanism is required,
    in particular, for\n   autonomous networks to trace the source of a particular
    configuration\n   change that led to an anomaly detection.  This mechanism facilitates\n
    \  the troubleshooting, the post-mortem analysis, and in the end the\n   closed
    loop automation required for self-healing networks.  The\n   specification also
    includes a YANG module that is meant to map a\n   local configuration change to
    the corresponding trace id, up to the\n   controller or even the orchestrator.\n\n\t "

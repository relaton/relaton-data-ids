  content: "   This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet\n
    \  applications to achieve Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable\n   throughput
    (L4S), while coexisting on shared network bottlenecks with\n   existing Internet
    applications that are not built to take advantage\n   of this new technology.\n\n
    \  In traditional bottleneck links that utilize a single, shared egress\n   queue,
    a variety of application traffic flows can share the\n   bottleneck queue simultaneously.
    \ As a result, each sender's behavior\n   and its response to the congestion signals
    (delay, packet drop, ECN\n   marking) provided by the queue can impact the performance
    of all\n   other applications that share the link.  Furthermore, it is\n   considered
    important that new protocols coexist in a reasonably fair\n   manner with existing
    protocols (most notably TCP and QUIC).  As a\n   result, senders tend to normalize
    on behaviors that are not\n   significantly different than those in use by the
    majority of the\n   existing senders.  For many years, the majority of traffic
    on the\n   Internet has used either the Reno AIMD congestion controller or the\n
    \  Cubic algorithm, and as a result any newly proposed congestion\n   controller
    needs to demonstrate that it provides reasonable fairness\n   when sharing a bottleneck
    with flows that use Reno or Cubic.  This\n   has led to an ossification in congestion
    control, where improved\n   congestion controllers cannot easily be deployed on
    the Internet.\n\n   It is well known that the common existing congestion controllers\n
    \  (e.g.  Reno and Cubic) increase their congestion window (the amount\n   of
    data in flight) until they induce congestion, and they respond to\n   the congestion
    signals of packet loss (or equivalently ECN marks) by\n   significantly reducing
    their congestion window.  This leads to a\n   large sawtooth of the congestion
    window that manifests itself as a\n   combination of queue delay and/or link underutilization.\n\n
    \  Meanwhile, in closed network environments, such as data centres, new\n   congestion
    controllers (e.g.  DCTCP [RFC8257]) have been deployed\n   that significantly
    outperform Reno and Cubic in terms of queue delay\n   and link utilization across
    a much wider range of network conditions.\n\n   The L4S architecture provides
    an approach that allows for the\n   deployment of next generation congestion controllers
    while preserving\n   reasonably fair coexistence with Reno and Cubic.\n\n   The
    L4S architecture consists of three components: network support to\n   isolate
    L4S traffic from other traffic and to provide appropriate\n   congestion signaling
    to both types; protocol features that allow\n   network elements to identify L4S
    traffic and allow for communication\n   of congestion signaling; and host support
    for immediate congestion\n   signaling and an appropriate congestion response
    that enables\n   scalable performance.\n\n\t "

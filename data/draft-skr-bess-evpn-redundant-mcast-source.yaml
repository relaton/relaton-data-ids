  content: "   EVPN supports intra and inter-subnet IP multicast forwarding.\n   However,
    EVPN (or conventional IP multicast techniques for that\n   matter) do not have
    a solution for the case where: a) a given\n   multicast group carries more than
    one flow (i.e., more than one\n   source), and b) it is desired that each receiver
    gets only one of the\n   several flows.  Existing multicast techniques assume
    there are no\n   redundant sources sending the same flow to the same IP multicast\n
    \  group, and, in case there were redundant sources, the receiver's\n   application
    would deal with the received duplicated packets.  This\n   document extends the
    existing EVPN specifications and assumes that IP\n   Multicast source redundancy
    may exist.  It also assumes that, in case\n   two or more sources send the same
    IP Multicast flows into the tenant\n   domain, the EVPN PEs need to avoid that
    the receivers get packet\n   duplication by following the described procedures.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft proposes a new fast handover scheme for Mobile IPv6 based\n
    \  wireless networks. To implement the proposed scheme, the beacon \n   message
    used in L2 is defined newly  by adding a specific subfield to \n   the capability
    information field. In addition, Router Information \n   Request/Reply messages
    used in L3 are defined newly. The proposed \n   scheme provides the faster acquisition
    of new access router's network\n   information than the existing one, which might
    be advantageous for \n   the low handover latency. In addition, the proposed scheme
    might \n   reduce amount of traffic in comparison with the existing one, which
    \n   might be remarkable when there are many mobile nodes that are now \n   connecting
    to current access router. Moreover, in the proposed \n   scheme, a mobile node
    can know whether it changes access router or \n   access point, which can remove
    redundant traffic of the existing one.\n\t "

  content: "   The purpose of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only networks, hosts and\n
    \  applications.  It passes IPv6 frames over UDP between IPv4 sites.\n   Peers
    connected over 6bed4 can switch to direct routes over UDP/IPv4\n   after deducing
    that this will be reliable.\n\n   6bed4 lets peer-to-peer applications benefit
    from transparant\n   addressing in IPv6 and delegates NAPT concerns to 6bed4.
    \ It is\n   possible to use 6bed4 as a fallback for IPv6, or as an additional\n
    \  route.  Servers can be setup as IPv6-only servers with NAT64 for\n   IPv4-only
    customers who only need client-server facilities, and add a\n   6bed4router to
    also facilitate reliable peer-to-peer protocols.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a DPU-based bare metal management solution to\n
    \  address inefficiencies in management and resource utilization\n   associated
    with traditional bare metal deployments.  The core idea of\n   this solution is
    to leverage the DPU's high-performance processing\n   and network acceleration
    capabilities, transforming traditional\n   network/resource management into a
    DPU-centric control model.  This\n   not only simplifies bare-metal operations
    but achieves unified\n   management across virtualized and physical environments
    through a\n   consolidated framework.\n\n\t "

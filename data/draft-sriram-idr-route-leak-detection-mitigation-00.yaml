abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have\n
    \  provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated\n   several
    types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine\n   which of those route-leak
    types are detected and mitigated by the\n   existing origin validation [RFC 6811]
    and BGPSEC path validation [I-\n   D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  Where the current
    BGPSEC protocol\n   doesn't offer a solution, this document suggests an enhancement
    that\n   would extend the route-leak detection and mitigation capability of\n
    \  BGPSEC.  The solution can be implemented in BGP without necessarily\n   tying
    it to BGPSEC.  Incorporating the solution in BGPSEC is one way\n   of implementing
    it in a secure way.  We do not claim to have provided\n   a solution for all possible
    types of route leaks, but the solution\n   covers several, especially considering
    some significant route-leak\n   attacks or occurrences that have been observed
    in recent years.  The\n   document also includes a stopgap method for detection
    and mitigation\n   of route leaks for the phase when BGPSEC (path validation)
    is not yet\n   deployed but only origin validation is deployed.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a solution for point-to-multipoint (P2MP)\n
    \  Traffic Engineering (TE) which extends 'RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP\n   for
    LSP Tunnels', RFC 3209, and 'Generalized Multi-Protocol Label\n   Switching (GMPLS)
    Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic\n   Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions',
    RFC 3473, to support P2MP TE LSPs.\n   A P2MP TE LSP is established by setting
    up multiple standard point-\n   to-point (P2P) TE LSPs from a sender node and
    all the downstream\n   branch nodes along the P2P TE LSP to one of the leaf nodes
    of the\n   P2MP TE LSP.  A branched LSP is associated with original trunk LSP
    by\n   newly defined Association object so that the P2MP LSP tunnel is\n   established
    over the P2MP path. Because only a single standard LSP\n   will be present on
    any given link along the P2MP LSP, the defined\n   approach realizes maximum compatibility
    with existing\n   implementations. The solution supports standard tree operations:\n
    \  setup, graft/join, and prune/leave.  As the (G)MPLS signaling is\n   used,
    the P2MP TE LSP can be built using any switching technology\n   supported by GMPLS.
    This includes non-packet technologies.\n\n\t "

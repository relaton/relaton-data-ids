- language: en

  content: "This document describes the traffic problems due to randomly\n   distributed
    data storage in P2PSIP overlay, identifies the traffic\n   localization requirements,
    and then proposes an overlay construction\n   and data storage mechanism to implement
    traffic localization for\n   REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD). Specifically,
    it's proposed\n   to add location indicator to the Peer node ID, for example,
    the\n   beginning 5 bit hash ID stands for the peer location, and user data\n
    \  with the location indication shall be possible to be stored in local\n   peer,
    thus to achieve traffic localization, reduce backbone network\n   traffic, and
    improve the efficiency and QoS of the whole network.\n\n\t "

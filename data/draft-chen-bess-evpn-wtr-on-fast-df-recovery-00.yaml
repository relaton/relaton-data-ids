  script: Latn
  content: "   The non-DF of a Single-Active Ethernet Segment (SA-ES) can filter\n
    \  both unicast traffic and BUM traffic.  In such case, when a specific\n   Single-Active
    ES performs fast DF recovery, the corresponding\n   revertive FRR switching should
    be performed on the ingress PEs that\n   are not adjacent to this ES.  This revertive
    FRR switching needs to\n   be performed immediately after the A-D per EVI route
    with the \"P=1\"\n   is received from the new DF node.  In other words, the revertive
    FRR\n   switching cannot perform the WTR procedures, otherwise unicast\n   traffic
    will be dropped on the new NDF node during the WTR.\n\n   In this draft, the SCT-EC
    is extended to the A-D per EVI routes, so\n   that the ingress PEs can perform
    the revertive FRR switching based on\n   the time specified by the SCT-EC for
    the non-adjacent ESes that\n   support the fast DF recovery.\n\n\t "

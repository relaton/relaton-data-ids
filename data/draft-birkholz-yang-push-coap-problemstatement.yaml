- language: en

  content: "   This document provides a problem statement, derives an initial gap\n
    \  analysis and illustrates a first set of solution approaches in regard\n   to
    augmenting YANG data stores based on the CoAP Management Interface\n   with YANG
    Push capabilities.  A binary transfer mechanism for YANG\n   Subscribed Notifications
    addresses both the requirements of\n   constrained-node networks and the need
    for semantic interoperability\n   via self-descriptiveness of the corresponding
    data in motion.\n\n\t "

  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or\n
    \  green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-\n   BGP)now
    plays an important role in the transition of their Provider\n   (P) core network
    as well as Provider Edge (PE) Inter-AS peering\n   network from IPv4 to IPv6.
    \ Operators must be able to continue to\n   support IPv4 customers when both the
    Core and Edge networks are\n   IPv6-Only.\n\n   This document details an important
    External BGP (eBGP) PE-PE Inter-AS\n   IPv6-Only peering design that leverages
    the MP-BGP capability\n   exchange by using IPv6 peering as pure transport, allowing
    all and\n   any IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and IPv6\n
    \  Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over the\n   same
    (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session for all Address Family\n   Identifiers
    (AFI) and Subsequent Address Family Identifiers(SAFI).\n   The design change provides
    the same Dual Stacking functionality that\n   exists today with separate IPv4
    and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have\n   today.  With this IPv6-Only PE Design, IPv4
    address MUST not be\n   configured on the the Provider Edge (PE) - Customer Edge
    (CE), or\n   Inter-AS ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router) to ASBR (Autonomous\n
    \  System Boundary Router) PE-PE Provider Edge (PE) - Provider Edge\n   (PE).
    \ From a control plane perspective a single IPv6-Only peer is\n   required for
    both IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates and from a data plane\n   forwarindg perspective
    an IPv6 address need only be configured on the\n   PE to PE Inter-AS peering interface
    for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet\n   forwarding.  This document defines the IPv6-Only
    PE Design as a new\n   PE-CE Edge and ASBR-ASBR PE-PE Inter-AS BGP peering Standard
    which is\n   described in the POC testing document\n   [I-D.ietf-bess-ipv6-only-pe-design]
    which is now extended to support\n   to all AFI/SAFI ubiquitously.  As service
    providers migrate to\n   Segment Routing architecture SR-MPLS and SRv6, VPN overlay
    exsits as\n   well, and thus Inter-AS options Option-A, Option-B, Option-AB and\n
    \  Option-C are still applicable and thus this extension of IPv6-Only\n   peering
    architecure extension to Inter-AS peering is very relevant to\n   Segment Routing
    as well.\n\n\t "

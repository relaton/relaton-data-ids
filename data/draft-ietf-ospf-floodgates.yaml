  content: "This memo describes an option to the OSPF Version 2 specification\nwhich
    allows the partial suppression of flooding between neighboring\nrouters. This
    suppression acts much like a floodgate, opening and\nclosing automatically when
    triggered by the proper conditions. Two\ntypes of flooding suppression are described,
    1-Way and 2-Way. The\noption applies to standard areas, stub areas, and NSSAs.
    It works\nover any OSPF interface. Routers with this option configured are\nbackward
    compatible with routers running an OSPFv2 compliant\nimplementation as defined
    in RFC 2328, and can be restricted to a\nsubset of the OSPF routing domain. This
    option is applied only\nbetween neighboring OSPF routers.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the framework and operational procedure for\n
    \  deterministic networking that guarantees maximum and minimum end-to-\n   end
    latency bounds to flows.  The solution has non-periodic,\n   asynchronous, flow-level,
    non-work conserving, on-time, and rate-\n   based functional characteristics,
    according to the taxonomy suggested\n   by [draft-ietf-detnet-dataplane-taxonomy-03].\n\n
    \  The packets are stored in the queue in ascending order of the ideal\n   service
    start time, called Eligible Time (ET), and the ideal service\n   completion time,
    called Finish Time (FT).  The queued packets were\n   forwarded between ET and
    FT in a non-work conserving manner.  The ET\n   and FT are calculated at the entrance
    node according to the packet\n   size and rate of the flow.  All subsequent core
    nodes are stateless\n   and asynchronously compute ET and FT based on metadata
    received via\n   packet headers.  This mechanism is called non-work-preserving\n
    \  stateless fair queuing, which guarantees both E2E latency upper and\n   lower
    bounds.\n\n\t "

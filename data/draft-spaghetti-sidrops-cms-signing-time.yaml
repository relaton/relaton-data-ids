  content: "   RFC 6488 standardized a template for specifying Signed Objects that\n
    \  can be validated using the RPKI.  Since the publication of that\n   document,
    a new additional protocol for distribution of RPKI\n   repositories was developed
    (RFC 8182), and new insights arose with\n   respect to querying and combining
    the different distribution\n   mechanisms.  This document describes how Publishers
    and Relying\n   Parties can use the CMS signing-time attribute to optimize seamless\n
    \  transitions from RRDP to RSYNC.  Additionally, this document updates\n   RFC
    6488 by mandating the presence of the CMS signing-time attribute\n   and disallowing
    the binary-signing-time attribute.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   RTP has always been a protocol that supports multiple participants\n
    \  each sending their own media streams in an RTP session.\n   Unfortunately many
    implementations aimed only at point to point voice\n   over IP with a single source
    in each end-point.  Even client\n   implementations aimed at video conferences
    have often been built with\n   the assumption around central mixers that only
    deliver a single media\n   stream per media type.  Thus any application that wants
    to allow for\n   more advance usage where multiple media streams are sent and
    received\n   by an end-point has a problem with legacy.  This issue is analyzed,\n
    \  and RTP clarifications and signalling extensions are proposed to\n   handle
    this issue.  A related issue is how to perform simulcast, in\n   the meaning of
    sending multiple encodings or representations of the\n   same media source, when
    using RTP for media transport.  This is\n   further analyzed and possible solutions
    discussed and we arrive at a\n   conclusion for session multiplexing of simulcast
    versions.  We also\n   found a number of related issues when having multiple streams
    and\n   simulcast.\n\n\t "

  content: "While conventional wisdom has it that wireless Access Points are\nstrictly
    Layer 2 bridges, such devices today perform some higher\nfunctions that are performed
    by routers or switches in wired networks\nin addition to bridging between wired
    and wireless networks.  For\nexample, in 802.11 networks, Access Points can function
    as Network\nAccess Servers.  For this reason, Access Points have IP addresses
    and\ncan function as IP devices.\n\t "

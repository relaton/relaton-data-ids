  content: "   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol \n
    \  (DHC) Option for client requesting and/or receiving a Public Safety \n   Answering
    Point (PSAP) or Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) \n   URI to be used by
    higher layer protocols during emergency calling.  \n   In some network models,
    an ESRP URI and a PSAP URI will be \n   equivalent from the client's point of
    view, therefore this document \n   purposely vague differentiating between the
    two, as the difference \n   does not matter to DHCP.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines multicast VPN extensions and procedures that\n
    \  allow fast failover for upstream failures, by allowing downstream PEs\n   to
    take into account the status of Provider-Tunnels (P-tunnels) when\n   selecting
    the upstream PE for a VPN multicast flow, and extending BGP\n   MVPN routing so
    that a C-multicast route can be advertized toward a\n   standby upstream PE.\n\n\n\t "

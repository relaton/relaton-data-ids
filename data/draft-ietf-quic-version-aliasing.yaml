  content: "   The QUIC transport protocol [QUIC-TRANSPORT] preserves its future\n
    \  extensibility partly by specifying its version number.  There will be\n   a
    relatively small number of published version numbers for the\n   foreseeable future.
    \ This document provides a method for clients and\n   servers to negotiate the
    use of other version numbers in subsequent\n   connections.  If a sizeable subset
    of QUIC connections use this\n   mechanism, this should prevent middlebox ossification
    around the\n   current set of published version numbers and the contents of QUIC\n
    \  Initial packets.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Many people have expressed a desire to extract material from IETF\n
    \  RFCs for use in documentation, textbooks, on-line help systems, and\n   for
    similar uses. In addition, some IETF RFCs contain MIBs and other\n   types of
    program code that could be compiled. This document proposes\n   an update to RFC
    RFC3978 to explicitly permit extracting material for\n   a wide range of uses.\n\t "

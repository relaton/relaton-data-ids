  script: Latn
  content: "   A large amount of email is non-personal, automated communication,\n
    \  such as newsletters, confirmations and legitimate advertisements.\n   These
    are often tagged as spam by content filters.  This type of\n   correspondence
    is usually initiated by a transaction over the web,\n   such as a purchase or
    signing up for a service.  Therefore, we\n   propose a new HTTP header to carry
    the addresses that may be used by\n   the provider to correspond with the user.
    \ These may be email\n   addresses, or those used in other protocols, such as
    SIP.  This will\n   facilitate the automatic inclusion of these addresses in whitelists\n
    \  used for spam prevention.\n\n\t "

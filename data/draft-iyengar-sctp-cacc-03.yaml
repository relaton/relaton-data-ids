  script: Latn
  content: "SCTP [RFC2960] supports IP multihoming at the transport layer. SCTP\nallows
    an association to span multiple local and peer IP addresses,\nand allows the application
    to dynamically change the primary\ndestination during an active association. We
    present a problem in the\ncurrent SCTP specification that results in unnecessary
    retransmissions\nand \"TCP-unfriendly\" growth of the sender's congestion window
    during\ncertain changeover conditions. We present the problem and propose an\nalgorithm
    called the Split Fast Retransmit Changeover Aware Congestion\nControl algorithm
    (SFR-CACC) as a solution. We recommend the addition\nof SFR-CACC to the SCTP specification
    [RFC2960].\n\t "

  content: "   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provide a mobile\n
    \  node(MN) which requires no additional modification to MN with IP\n   mobility.
    \ Fast Handover for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FHPMIPv6), specified\n   in[RFC5949], proposed
    two modes of fast handover, both of them use\n   single interface to transmate
    packets during handover, which requires\n   it to buffer packets in MAGs when
    interface performs handover.\n   Buffer packets in MAGs result in additional overhead,
    and increase\n   packets transmission delay.  Unlike FHPMIPv6, this document proposed\n
    \  a seamless handover scheme for multi-access mobile node with IP\n   mobility
    when one of MN's network interface performs handover from\n   one MAG to another.
    \ This scheme uses some other interface of the\n   multi-access mobile node to
    help process packets while handovering.\n\n\t "

  content: "This note discusses a proposed embedding for uncompressed video and audio
    within an RTP stream.  Whilst this is not a finished document, and although it
    was not written with wider distribution in mind, I think it may be useful as a
    'straw man' proposal to provoke further discussion of the use of RTP for professional
    media.\n\t "

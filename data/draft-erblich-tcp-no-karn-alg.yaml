  content: "Karn's algorithm specifies acknowledgements that are the\nresult of segment
    retransmits should be ignored, not timed,\nand should not contribute to the smoothed
    round-trip-time\n(SRTT) because they are considered \"ambiguous\".  It is also\nstated
    in Karn's paper that \"If an acknowledgement arrives\nafter the RTO has expired,
    it is highly likely to come very\nshortly after wards.\" In time, we have added
    the \"fast retransmit\"\nfunctionality, so we are not solely dependent on RTO
    for\nretransmits.  Common sense dictates that if we receive an\nacknowledgement
    \"very shortly after wards\", that those\nacknowledgments should not be considered
    \"ambiguous\". These\nnon-ambiguous acknowledgments should be added to the SRTT
    and\ntrigger us to return to our previous non-congestion behavior.\n\n\t "

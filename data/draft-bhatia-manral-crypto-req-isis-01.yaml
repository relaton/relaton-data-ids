  content: "   IS-IS currently defines two different kinds of authentication \n   schemes:
    Clear Text password and HMAC-MD5. There has been recently a \n   new draft submitted
    that adds support for a generic cryptographic \n   authentication scheme, which
    can make use of different cryptographic \n   algorithms in order to authenticate
    the IS-IS PDUs.  \n    \n   To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations,
    it is \n   imperative that we specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms
    \n   to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all \n   implementations
    will have available.   \n    \n   This document defines the current set of mandatory-to-implement
    \n   algorithms to be used for the cryptographic authentication for IS-IS    as
    well as specifying the algorithms that should be implemented \n   because they
    may be promoted to mandatory at some future time. \n\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft presents a summary of issues related to transmission of\nIP
    packets over optical networks.  This is a compilation of many\ndrafts presented
    so far in IETF.  The goal is to create a common\ndocument, which by including
    all the views and proposals will serve\nas a better reference point for further
    discussion.  The novelty of\nthis draft is that we try to cover all the main areas
    of integration\nand deployment of IP and optical networks including architecture,\nrouting,
    signaling, management, and survivability.\n\t "

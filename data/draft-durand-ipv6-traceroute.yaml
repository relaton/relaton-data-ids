  content: "    The traceroute program has proven very useful and has been\n    extensively
    used in the Internet for measurement and debugging\n    purposes. However, it
    only shows the originator to target path\n    and gives no indication on the reverse
    path. Source routing may\n    sometimes be used to find it, but it's very often
    disable by\n    intermediary routers.\n    Another problem occurs when packets
    do not follow the same routes:\n    traceroute outputs are very difficult to read.\n
    \n    Other solutions has been proposed to record the route taken by\n    an IPv4
    packet. Originally, IPv4 contains an option in which every\n    intermediary router
    can add its address [RFC791]. Unfortunately,\n    the limitation in size imposed
    by the options design of IPv4 limits\n    its use to 9 routers.\n \n    In [RFC1393]
    another strategy was proposed. An new IPv4 option was\n    created. When a router
    receives a packet containing this option,\n    it generates a ICMP Echo message
    to the source. This technique\n    couldn't be widely deployed in IPv4 because
    it needed a change\n    in every single router to be efficient.\n \n    These
    two methods create less traffic on the network and are more\n    accurate, since
    they give the real route taken by packets and are\n    less sensitive to fluttering.
    The IPv6 deployment could be the\n    opportunity to widely deploy a new traceroute
    mechanism based on\n    those two methods.\n \n    We propose to combine the two
    previous methods by defining a new\n    hop-by-hop option and a new ICMP message
    type to record the direct\n    path from the originator to the target and the
    reverse path from\n    the target to the originator.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   YANG and SDF are two languages for modelling the interaction with and\n
    \  the data interchanged with devices in the network.  As their areas of\n   application
    (network management, IoT, resp.) overlap, it is useful to\n   be able to translate
    between the two.\n\n   The present specification provides information about how
    models in\n   one of the two languages can be translated into the other.  This\n
    \  specification is not intended to be normative, but to help with\n   creating
    translators.\n\n\t "

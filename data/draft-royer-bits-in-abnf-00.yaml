  content: "   This is an extension to the ABNF specification to allow for bits\n
    \  definitions to be defined.\n\n   When interacting with hardware or bit oriented
    over the wire\n   protocols ABNF is not currently the choice.  This specification\n
    \  describes a method to add boolean and narrow bit values in order to\n   fix
    that limitation.\n\n   And this note while in in draft status: A new Open Source
    XDR\n   [RFC4506] and ABNF generation tool is being developed [xdrgen] which\n
    \  generates code from ABNF and XDR.  It can also generate ABNF from\n   XDR.
    \ And it can generate XDR from ABNF.  Both also can produce C++\n   source and
    header files.\n\n\t "

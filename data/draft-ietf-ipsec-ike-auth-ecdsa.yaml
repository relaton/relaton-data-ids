  content: "This document describes how the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
    (ECDSA) may be used as the authentication method within the Internet Key Exchange
    (IKE) and Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocols.  ECDSA may provide
    benefits including computational efficiency, small signature sizes, and minimal
    bandwidth compared to other available digital signature methods.  This document
    adds ECDSA capability to IKE and IKEv2 without introducing any changes to existing
    IKE operation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

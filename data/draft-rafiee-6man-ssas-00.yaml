abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The default method for IPv6 address generation uses two unique\n   manufacturer
    IDs that are assigned by the IEEE Standards Association\n   [1] (section 2.5.1
    RFC-4291) [RFC4291]. This means that a node will\n   always have the same Interface
    ID (IID) whenever it connects to a new\n   network. Because the node's IP address
    does not change, the node is\n   vulnerable to privacy related attacks. To address
    this issue, there\n   are currently two mechanisms in use to randomize the IID,\n
    \  Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and Privacy\n   Extension
    [RFC4941]. The problem with the former approach is the\n   computational cost
    involved for the IID generation. The problem with\n   the latter approach is that
    it lacks security. This document offers a\n   new algorithm for use in the generation
    of the IID while, at the same\n   time, securing the node against some types of
    attack, such as IP\n   spoofing. These attacks are prevented with the addition
    of a\n   signature to the Neighbor Discovery messages (NDP).\n\n\n\n\t "

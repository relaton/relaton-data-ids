  content: "   This document outlines the use cases and requirements for\n   implementing
    lossless data transmission techniques in Wide Area\n   Networks (WANs), motivated
    by the increasing demand for high-\n   bandwidth and reliable data transport in
    applications such as high-\n   performance computing (HPC), genetic sequencing,
    multimedia content\n   production and distributed training.  The challenges associated
    with\n   existing data transport protocols in WAN environments are discussed,\n
    \  along with the proposal of requirements for enhancing lossless\n   transmission
    capabilities to support emerging data-intensive\n   applications.\n\n\t "

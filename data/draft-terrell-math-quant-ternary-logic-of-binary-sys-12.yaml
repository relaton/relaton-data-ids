  content: "\n   This paper, opening with the historical that documents the source\n
    \  of the Binary Enumeration Error, utilizes the proof of 'Fermat's\n   Last Theorem'
    (Normative References - [1], [2] and [3]), the\n   Mathematics of Quantification,
    and the Logic of Set Theory, to\n   prove that the Binary System represents a
    'Closed and Finite'\n   Alternate Mathematical Field. That is, using the Elementary
    Laws\n   of Algebra, with the Basic Principles from Analytic Geometry,\n   provides
    the final clarification simplifying the proof for the\n   correction of the Counting
    Errors and the Logical Foundation for\n   the New Binary System. And more importantly,
    this also establishes\n   the basic foundational principles for 3 State Ternary
    Logic. In\n   other words, using an askew, or mathematically incorrect Binary\n
    \  System, defined as the misinterpretation of ZERO, sustains the\n   Counting
    Error (an Accumulating Propagation) levying a substantial\n   loss of IP Addresses
    in the IPv4 IP Specification, affecting as\n   well the Address Pool Total for
    the IPv6 Specification. Hence,\n   from the foregoing foundation an unquestionable
    proof concludes;\n   the Elementary Mathematical 'Resolution of the Counting Error
    in\n   the Binary System’ & the 'Fall of Differential Calculus' -\n   [4. IANA
    Considerations].\n\n\t "

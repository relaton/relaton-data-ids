  content: "   Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n
    \  (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store\n   information
    about users and other network entities.  One such use is\n   to store information
    on groups.  There are LDAP standards established\n   for this purpose, e.g. the
    groupOfUniqueNames [3].  However,\n   currently there are no standards for a very
    important use of Groups,\n   as SMTP Mailing Lists or Aliases.\n\n   This document
    discusses how we at Netscape have made this extension,\n   with the intent of
    providing useful information towards perhaps\n   creating standards for this important
    use of LDAP.\n\t "

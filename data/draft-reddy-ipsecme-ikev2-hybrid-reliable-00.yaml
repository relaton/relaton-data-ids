abstract:
- content: "<p>The eventual transition to post-quantum key exchange will require elimination
    of traditional key exchange for reduced protocol complexity and efficiency. IKEv2
    therefore requires a mechanism that can operate in a PQC-only environment, without
    depending on traditional key exchange algorithms (e.g., MODP DH or ECDH). As IKEv2
    permits arbitrary combinations of algorithms, unnecessary complexity and insecure
    hybrid constructions are easily implemented. This document defines PQ/T hybrid
    composite key exchange algorithms for IKEv2 and a single combined KE payload that
    carries both the traditional and post-quantum components. It also leverages the
    existing IKEv2 reliable transport mechanism so that large PQC key exchange messages
    can be reliably exchanged over TCP. Together, these mechanisms enable secure and
    efficient PQ/T hybrid deployments today and provide a clear path for IKEv2 to
    operate in environments where traditional algorithms have been replaced by PQC
    algorithms.</p>"

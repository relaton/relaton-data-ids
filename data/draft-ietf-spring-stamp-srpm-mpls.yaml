abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable
    to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This
    document describes the procedures for Performance Measurement in SR-MPLS networks
    using the Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP), as defined in RFC
    8762, along with its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 and further augmented
    in RFC 9503. The described procedure is used for SR-MPLS paths (including SR-MPLS
    Policies, SR-MPLS IGP best paths, and SR- MPLS IGP Flexible Algorithm paths),
    as well as Layer-3 and Layer-2 services over the SR-MPLS paths.</p>"

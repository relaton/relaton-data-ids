  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is\n
    \  applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6\n   (SRv6)
    data planes.  This document describes the procedures for\n   Performance Measurement
    in SR-MPLS networks using the Simple Two-Way\n   Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP),
    as defined in RFC 8762, along\n   with its optional extensions defined in RFC
    8972 and further\n   augmented in RFC 9503.  The described procedure is used for
    SR-MPLS\n   paths (including SR-MPLS Policies, SR-MPLS IGP best paths, and SR-\n
    \  MPLS IGP Flexible Algorithm paths), as well as Layer-3 and Layer-2\n   services
    over the SR-MPLS paths.\n\n\t "

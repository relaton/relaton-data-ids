  content: "   Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which\n
    \  both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers\n   typically
    operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and\n   energy (battery
    power).  Their interconnects are characterized by\n   high loss rates, low data
    rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised\n   of anything from a few dozen to
    thousands of routers.  Supported\n   traffic flows include point-to-point (between
    devices inside the\n   LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point
    to a subset\n   of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices\n
    \  inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document\n   specifies
    the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks\n   (RPL), which provides
    a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic\n   from devices inside the LLN
    towards a central control point as well\n   as point-to-multipoint traffic from
    the central control point to the\n   devices inside the LLN are supported.  Support
    for point-to-point\n   traffic is also available.\n\n\t "

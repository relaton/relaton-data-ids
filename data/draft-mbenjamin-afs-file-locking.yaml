  content: "The AFS-3 protocol supports file locks, but only on whole \nfiles, only
    in advisory mode. Efficient support for byte-range \nfile locking, together with
    the stronger semantics with which \nthey are associated, are required to improve
    the suitability of \nAFS as a LAN file-sharing protocol for both Unix and Windows
    \nclients. Applications on the Windows platform, in particular \n(e.g., Microsoft
    Office), actually require byte-range locking \nto function correctly. Emulation
    in the client has alleviated \nmost serious problems, albeit, with reduced semantics.
    We \npropose protocol enhancements facilitating server-coordinated \nbyte-range
    locks, atomic lock up/down-grade support, improved \nsemantics for files under
    byte-range lock control, protocol \nsupport for wait-on-lock with fairness, and
    mandatory lock \nenforcement for clients on request. The delegation proposal,
    \nincluded within this document in previous drafts, has been \nsplit out into
    a separate proposal, based on feedback from \nreviewers.\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes the Finger user information protocol.  This is a simple
    protocol which provides an interface to a user information server.  Based on RFC
    742, the original memo on the Finger protocol, this memo attempts to clarify the
    expected communication between the two ends of a Finger connection.  It also tries
    not to invalidate the many existing implementations or add unnecessary restrictions
    to the original protocol definition.                                                                This
    edition updates RFC 1288.\n\t "

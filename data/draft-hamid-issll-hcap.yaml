  content: "The DCLASS object is proposed in [DCLASS] to represent and carry \nDiffrentiated
    Services Code Points (DSCPs) within RSVP messages. \nThe principle use of the
    DCLASS object is to carry DSCP information\nbetween a DS network and upstream
    nodes that may wish to mark packets\nwith DSCP values. A network element in the
    DS network determines the \nvalue for DSCP which is further carried as a DCLASS
    object in RSVP \nRESV message to the sender host.\n\t "

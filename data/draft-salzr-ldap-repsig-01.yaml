  content: "In many environments the final step of certificate issuance is \npublishing
    the certificate to a repository. Unfortunately, there \nis no way for a Certification
    Authority (CA) to have a secure \napplication-level acknowledgement that the proper
    repository \ndid, in fact, receive the certificate. This issue is of greater \nconcern
    when considering the publication of Certificate \nRevocation Lists (CRLs) -- if
    an adversary manages to interpose \nitself between the CA and its intended repository,
    then clients \ncould end up relying on outdated revocation lists.\nThis document
    defines a set of controls so that an LDAP client, \nsuch as a CA, can receive
    a cryptographically secure \nacknowledgement that an LDAP server has received
    a request, and \nthat the integrity of the server's reply has not been \ncompromised.\n
    \ \n    Whenever possible, the definitions here use mechanisms and \n    datatypes
    defined by the IETF PKIX working group. This document \n    references RFC 2459
    [RFC2459]. Knowledge of the RFC is required \n    for proper implementation of
    this document, although it should \n    be possible to understand this document
    without much knowledge \n    of that RFC.\n    \n    It is expected that future
    versions of this document will \n    reference 2459's successor(s).\n\n\t "

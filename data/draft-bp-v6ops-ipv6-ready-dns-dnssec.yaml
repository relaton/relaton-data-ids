  content: "   This document defines the timing for implementing a worldwide\n   IPv6-Ready
    DNS and DNSSEC infrastructure, in order to facilitate the\n   global IPv6-only
    deployment.\n\n   A key issue for this, is the need for a global support of DNSSEC
    and\n   DNS64, which in some scenarios do not work well together.  This\n   document
    states that any DNSSEC signed resources records should\n   include a native IPv6
    resource record as the most complete and\n   expedient path to solve any deployment
    conflict with DNS64 and DNSSEC\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may  use\nan
    MPLS enabled IPv4 backbone to provide Virtual Private Networks for\nits IPv6 customers.
    This proposal makes use of the  method  to  build\nnetwork  based  VPNs  described
    \ in the Internet draft 'BGP/MPLS VPN'\n[2547bis]. In BGP/MPLS VPN, MPLS is used
    to forward packets over  the\nbackbone, and 'Multiprotocol BGP' is used for distributing
    VPN routes\nover the service provider backbone. This document defines an IPv6
    VPN\naddress  family  and  describes  the  route distribution and the MPLS\ntunnel
    selection.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document summarises a problem statement for an IP-based\n   autonomic
    network that is mainly based on distributed network\n   devices.  The document
    reviews the history and current status of\n   autonomic aspects of IP networks.
    \ It then reviews the current\n   network management style, which is still heavily
    depending on human\n   administrators.  Finally the document describes the general
    gaps\n   between the ideal autonomic network concept and the current network\n
    \  abilities.\n\n\t "

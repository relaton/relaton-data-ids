  content: "This document serves as input into the IETF SIGTRAN requirements \nprocess.
    It includes call setup delay requirements, derived from \nrelevant ISDN and SS7
    standards published by ITU-T (International \nTelecommunications Union--Telecommunications
    Standardization Sector) and \ngeneric requirements published by Telcordia Technologies
    (formerly \nBellcore). To gain user acceptance of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services
    and \nto enable interoperability between Switched Circuit Networks (SCNs) and
    \nVoIP systems, it is imperative that the VoIP signaling performance be \ncomparable
    to that of the current SCNs. The requirements given in this \nInternet Draft are
    intended to be the worst-case requirements, for at \nleast in the United States
    SCN calls are typically set up at a faster \nspeed than the derived requirements.
    At the end of the draft, several \nVoIP call connection scenarios based on the
    latest megaco protocol are \nanalyzed and compared with similar cases in the PSTN.
    It indicates the \nPDD performance of VoIP systems is somewhat worst but not by
    much. An\nimprovement in some network element can bring VoIP systems to have\ncomparable
    PDD performance as the PSTN.\n\t "

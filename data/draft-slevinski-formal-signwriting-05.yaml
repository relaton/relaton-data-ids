  content: "   Sutton SignWriting is the universal and complete solution for written\n
    \  sign language, ISO 15924 script code \"Sgnw\".  It has been applied by\n   a
    wide and deep international community of sign language users.\n   Sutton SignWriting
    is an international standard for writing sign\n   languages by hand or with computers.
    \ From education to research,\n   from entertainment to religion, SignWriting
    has proven useful because\n   people are using it to write signed languages.\n\n
    \  Formal SignWriting is one particular computerized design for Sutton\n   SignWriting
    that envisions a sign as a two part word.  Each word is\n   written as a string
    of characters that can be recognized and\n   processed by regular expressions.
    \ The design has been optimized for\n   display, searching, sorting, text flow,
    and other character\n   processing.\n\n   Where as American Sign Language is a
    natural language, Formal\n   SignWriting is a formal language.  A formal language
    is useful in\n   mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.\n\n   This memo
    defines a conceptual character encoding map for the\n   Internet community.  It
    is published for reference, examination,\n   implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution
    of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes a new generic session setup attribute to make it
    possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image size.  A possible
    use case is to make it possible for a \\%low-end \\%hand- held terminal to display
    video without the need to rescale the image, something that may consume large
    amounts of memory and processing power.  The document also helps to maintain an
    optimal bitrate for video as only the image size that is desired by the receiver
    is transmitted. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

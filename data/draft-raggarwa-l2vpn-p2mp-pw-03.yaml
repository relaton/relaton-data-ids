  content: "A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) is a mechanism that\nemulates
    the essential attributes of a unidirectional P2MP\nTelecommunications service
    such as P2MP ATM over a Packet Switched\nNetwork (PSN). One of the applicabilities
    of a P2MP PW is to deliver\na Layer 2 multicast service, that carries multicast
    frames (encoded\nusing Layer 2 or IP mechanisms) from a multicast source to one
    or\nmore multicast receivers.\n\n[RFC4664] describes a number of different ways
    in which sets of PWs\nmay be combined together into \"Provider Provisioned Layer
    2 VPNs\" (L2\nPPVPNs, or L2VPNs), resulting in a number of different kinds of\nL2VPN.
    P2MP PWs enable a L2VPN to provide a Virtual Private Multicast\nService (VPMS),
    which may be in addition to the Virtual Private Wire\nService (VPWS) offered by
    the L2VPN. A VPMS is a L2VPN service that\nprovides point-to-multipoint connectivity
    traffic to customers.\n\nVPMS framework and requirements are described in [VPLS-REQ].
    \ One of\nthe VPMS requirements is auto-discovery. This document describes how\nprocedures
    outlined in [VPLS-MCAST] can be used for auto-discovery\n(A-D) in VPMS using BGP.
    This document also describes BGP based\nprocedures for P2MP PW signaling for VPMS
    that may be used when BGP\nis used for VPMS auto-discovery.\n\t "

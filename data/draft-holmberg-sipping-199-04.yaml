  content: "This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog\nTerminated,
    which a SIP entity can use to indicate upstream that an\nearly dialog has been
    terminated.  The response code can be used by a\nSIP entity, normally a forking
    SIP proxy, to allow the UAC to know\nthat an early dialog has been terminated
    before it a final response\nis sent to the request.\n\t "

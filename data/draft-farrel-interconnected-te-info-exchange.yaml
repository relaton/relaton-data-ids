  content: "   In Traffic Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to\n
    \  establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as\n   bandwidth)
    across one or more network from a source to a destination.\n   TE information
    is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is\n   used in the process of
    selecting a TE path.  The availability of TE\n   information is usually limited
    to within a network (such as an IGP\n   area) often referred to as a domain.\n\n
    \  In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a\n   series
    of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a\n   certain amount
    of TE information about each network.  This need not\n   be the full set of TE
    information available within each network, but\n   does need to express the potential
    of providing TE connectivity. This\n   subset of TE information is called TE reachability
    information.\n\n   This document sets out the problem statement and architecture
    for the\n   exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in\n
    \  support of end-to-end TE path establishment.  For reasons that are\n   explained
    in the document, this work is limited to simple TE\n   constraints and information
    that determine TE reachability.\n\n\t "

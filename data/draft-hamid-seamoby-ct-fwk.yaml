  content: "This document proposes a framework for context transfer between the\naccess
    routers. The framework identifies the various functional\nelements that participate
    in the process of context transfer and the\nprotocols required to exchange information
    between the functional\nentities. Included are a few samples of context transfer
    scenarios\nto assist in explaining the interactions of the entities in the\nframework.\n\t "

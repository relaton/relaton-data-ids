  content: "   At the first meeting of the proposed Path Aware Networking Research\n
    \  Group, Oliver Bonaventure led a discussion of our mostly-unsuccessful\n   attempts
    to exploit Path Awareness to achieve a variety of goals,\n   over the past decade.
    \ At the end of that discussion, the research\n   group agreed to catalog and
    analyze these ideas, to extract lessons\n   for network researchers.\n\n   This
    document contains that catalog and analysis.\n\n\t "

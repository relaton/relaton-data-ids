abstract:
- content: "<p>SRv6 is being rapidly deployed and is currently primarily used in trusted-domain
    backbone networks. However, we have also observed that SRv6 is beginning to extend
    toward customer site devices, e.g., SD-WAN and enterprise network deployments.
    Both of the scenarios can be deployed in third-party clouds or at customer sites.
    This introduces certain security risks, such as packet injection and path manipulation
    attacks. Section 6 of [I-D.draft-ietf-spring-srv6-security] identifies these risks
    as well, including Section 6.2.1 on Modification Attacks and Section 6.2.3 on
    Packet Insertion. This proposal mitigates these risks by enhancing the HMAC mechanism
    defined in [RFC8754].</p>"

  content: "   SRv6 is being rapidly deployed and is currently primarily used in\n
    \  trusted-domain backbone networks.  However, we have also observed\n   that
    SRv6 is beginning to extend toward end-user devices, e.g., in\n   SD-WAN deployments.
    \ SD-WAN can be deployed in third-party clouds or\n   at customer sites, causing
    the physical boundary of SRv6 to become\n   blurred.  This introduces certain
    security risks, such as packet\n   injection and path manipulation attacks.  Section
    6 of\n   [I-D.draft-ietf-spring-srv6-security] identifies these risks as well,\n
    \  including Section 6.2.1 on Modification Attacks and Section 6.2.3 on\n   Packet
    Insertion.  This proposal mitigates these risks by enhancing\n   the HMAC mechanism
    defined in [RFC8754].\n\n\t "

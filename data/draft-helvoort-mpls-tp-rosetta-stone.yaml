  content: "MPLS-TP is based on a profile of the MPLS and PW procedures as \n   specified
    in the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW architectures developed by the \n   IETF.  The ITU-T
    has specified a Transport Network architecture. \n\n   This document provides
    a thesaurus for the interpretation of MPLS-TP \n   terminology within the context
    of the ITU-T Transport Network \n   recommendations. \n\n   It is important to
    note that MPLS-TP is applicable in a wider set of \n   contexts than just Transport
    Networks.  The definitions presented in \n   this document do not provide exclusive
    nor complete interpretations \n   of MPLS-TP concepts.  This document simply allows
    the MPLS-TP terms \n   to be applied within the Transport Network context.\n\t "

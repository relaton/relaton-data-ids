  script: Latn
  content: "   Is the concept of Domain Names owned by the DNS protocol or does the\n
    \  DNS protocol exist to support the concept of Domain Names?  This\n   question
    has become pertinent in light of proposals to use Domain\n   Names in protocols
    in ways incompatible with the DNS protocol and the\n   operational environment
    built to run the protocol.\n\n   This document is intended to help answer this
    question by presenting\n   a look into the recorded history of relevant Requests
    for Comments.\n   This document comprises the research and views of the author
    and has\n   benefited from review and input from many IETF experts, but it does\n
    \  not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF.\n\n\t "

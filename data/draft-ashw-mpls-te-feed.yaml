  content: "One key component of traffic engineering is a concept known as\nconstraint
    based routing. In constraint based routing a topology\ndatabase is maintained
    on all participating nodes. This database\ncontains a complete list of all the
    links in the network that\nparticipate in traffic engineering and for each of
    these links a set\nof constraints which those links can meet. Bandwidth, for example,\nis
    one essential constraint. Since the bandwidth available changes\nas new LSPs are
    established and terminated the topology database\nwill develop inconsistencies
    with respect to the real network. It is\nnot possible to increase the flooding
    rates arbitrarily to keep the\ndatabase discrepancies from growing. We propose
    a new mechanism\nwhereby a source node can learn about the successes or failures
    of\nits path selections by receiving feedback from the paths it is\nattempting.
    This fed-back information can be incorporated into\nsubsequent route computations,
    which greatly improves the accuracy\nof the overall routing solution by significantly
    reducing the\ndatabase discrepancies.\n\t "

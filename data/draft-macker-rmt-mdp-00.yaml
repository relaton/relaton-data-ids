  content: "The Multicast Dissemination Protocol (MDP) is a protocol framework\ndesigned
    to provide reliable multicast data and file delivery ser-\nvices on top of the
    generic UDP/IP multicast transport [1].  MDP is\nwell suited for reliable multicast
    bulk transfer of data across a\nheterogeneous internetwork.  Further enhancements
    made to the pro-\ntocol are suitable for a range of network environments, including\nwireless
    internetwork environments.  At its core, MDP is an effi-\ncient negative acknowledgement
    (NACK) based reliable multicast pro-\ntocol that leverages erasure-based coding
    in ways to improve  pro-\ntocol efficiency and robustness.  MDP also includes
    an optional\nadaptive end-to-end rate-based congestion control mode that is to\noperate
    with competing flows (e.g., TCP sessions or other conges-\ntion aware flows).
    \ This document describes the protocol messages,\nbuilding blocks, general operation,
    and optional modes of the pre-\nsent MDP instantiation and implementation.\n\n\n\t "

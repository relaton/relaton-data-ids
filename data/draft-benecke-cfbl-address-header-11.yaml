  content: "   This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to\n
    \  specify a complaint feedback loop (FBL) address as a message header\n   field.
    \ Also, it defines the rules for processing and forwarding such\n   a complaint.
    \ The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a\n   standardized and
    automated way to provide Mailbox Providers with an\n   address for a complaint
    feedback loop.  Currently, providing and\n   maintaining such an address is a
    manual and time-consuming process\n   for Message Originators and Mailbox Providers.\n\n
    \  The mechanism specified in this document is being published as an\n   experiment,
    to gauge interest of, and gather feedback from\n   implementers and deployers.
    \ This document is produced through the\n   Independent RFC stream and was not
    subject to the IETF's approval\n   process.\n\n\t "

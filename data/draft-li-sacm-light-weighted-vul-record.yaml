  content: "   Vulnerability information will be recorded in risk detection and\n
    \  scanning.  If a vulnerability is detected in a host during one scan,\n   a
    record will be generated and added to the database, together with a\n   time-stamp
    when the vulnerability is detected.  If risk detection is\n   carried out periodically,
    a series of records will be generated for\n   each detection, until vulnerability
    is fixed.  At present, a common\n   way to record vulnerabilities is a vulnerability--a
    detection--a\n   record, a vulnerability--N detections--N records(N>1).In this
    way,\n   the number of vulnerability records is related to the rounds of\n   detection.
    \ In the case that the number of existing vulnerabilities\n   remains unchanged,
    more frequent vulnerabilities are scanned, more\n   records are recorded In this
    document, a light weighted vulnerability\n   recording method is proposed.  To
    make that, in the whole life cycle\n   of a vulnerability, only one record is
    generated after multiple\n   detections.\n\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "IPsec, when used with IKE [RFC2409],  provides for authentication of\nendpoints
    from the device level to the user level. However, there has\nbeen movement within
    the IPsec development community to provide\nadditional support for legacy user-level
    authentication mechanisms\nsuch as those supported by RADIUS [RFC2138]. At least
    2 approaches to\nthis problem have been proposed thus far,  both using the same
    basic\nunderlying framework, but that underlying framework relies upon\nextending
    IKE in ways that may not be prudent.  This document\nproposes an alternative approach
    which provides much of the same\nfunctionality without requiring any modification
    to the existing\nIPsec framework.\n\t "

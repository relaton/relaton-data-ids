  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or\n
    \  green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-\n   BGP)now
    plays an important role in the transition of their Provider\n   (P) core network
    as well as Provider Edge (PE) Inter-AS peering\n   network from IPv4 to IPv6.
    \ Operators must be able to continue to\n   support IPv4 customers when both the
    Core and Edge networks are\n   IPv6-Only.\n\n   This document details an important
    External BGP (eBGP) PE-PE Inter-AS\n   IPv6-Only peering design that leverages
    the MP-BGP capability\n   exchange by using IPv6 peering as pure transport, allowing
    both IPv4\n   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer\n
    \  Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over the same (Border\n   Gateway
    Protocol) BGP TCP session for all Address Family Identifiers\n   (AFI) and Subsequent
    Address Family Identifiers(SAFI).  The design\n   change provides the same Dual
    Stacking functionality that exists\n   today with separate IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions
    as we have today.\n   With this design change from a control plane perspective
    a single\n   IPv6-Only peer is required for both IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates
    and\n   from a data plane forwarindg perspective an IPv6 address need only be\n
    \  configured on the PE to PE Inter-AS peering interface for both IPv4\n   and
    IPv6 packet forwarding.  This document extends the IPv6-Only PE-\n   CE peering
    architecture defined in\n   [I-D.ietf-bess-ipv6-only-pe-design] to PE-PE inter-as
    peering\n   architecture where the 4to6 softwire is now extended to Inter-AS L3\n
    \  VPN options Option-A, Option-AB and Option-C and now applies to all\n   AFI/SAFI
    ubiquitously.  As service providers migrate to Segment\n   Routing architecture
    SR-MPLS and SRv6, VPN overlay exsits as well,\n   and thus Inter-AS options Option-A,
    Option-AB and Option-C are still\n   applicable and thus this extension of IPv6-Only
    peering architecure\n   extension to Inter-AS peering is very relevant to Segment
    Routing as\n   well.\n\n\t "

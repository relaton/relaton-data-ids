  content: "   Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting up\n   networks
    so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does\n   not rely on centralized
    deployed anchors to provide IP mobility\n   support.\n\n   There are many different
    approaches to address Distributed Mobility\n   Management, as for example extending
    network-based mobility protocols\n   (like Proxy Mobile IPv6), or client-based
    mobility protocols (as\n   Mobile IPv6), among others.  This document follows
    the former\n   approach, and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in
    which\n   mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called\n   mobility
    anchor and access router).  The mobility anchor and access\n   router is an enhanced
    access router which is also able to operate as\n   local mobility anchor or mobility
    access gateway, on a per prefix\n   basis.  The document focuses on the required
    extensions to\n   effectively support simultaneously anchoring several flows at\n
    \  different distributed gateways.\n\n   This document introduces the concept
    of distributed logical\n   interface, which is a software construct that allows
    to easily hide\n   the change of anchor from the mobile node.\n\n\n\t "

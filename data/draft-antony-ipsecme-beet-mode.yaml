abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a new mode for IPsec ESP, known as Bound End-\n
    \  to-End Tunnel (BEET) mode.  This mode complements the existing ESP\n   tunnel
    and transport modes, while enhancing end-to-end IPsec usage.\n   It offers the
    characteristics of the tunnel mode but without its\n   usual overhead.  The BEET
    mode is designed to accommodate evolving\n   applications of ESP, such as minimalist
    end-to-end tunnel, mobility\n   and multi-address multi-homing.  Additionally,
    this document proposes\n   a new Notify Message, USE_BEET_MODE, for the Internet
    Key Exchange\n   Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) specified in [RFC7296], to facilitate
    BEET\n   mode Security Association negotiation.\n\n\t "

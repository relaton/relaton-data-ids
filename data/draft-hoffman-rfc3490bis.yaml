  content: "Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names to use\ncharacters
    outside the ASCII repertoire.  This document defines\ninternationalized domain
    names (IDNs) and a mechanism called\nInternationalizing Domain Names in Applications
    (IDNA) for handling\nthem in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn from
    a large\nrepertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to be\nrepresented
    using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-\ncalled host names today.
    \ This backward-compatible representation is\nrequired in existing protocols like
    DNS, so that IDNs can be\nintroduced with no changes to the existing infrastructure.
    \ IDNA is\nonly meant for processing domain names, not free text.\n\t "

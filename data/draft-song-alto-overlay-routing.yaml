  content: "   This document describes an ALTO protocol extension for overlay\n   routing.
    \ It considers three different methods to route traffic from\n   a data source
    to a data receiver, which are direct Internet routing,\n   VPN tunnel, and overlay
    routing via intermediate/relay node(s),\n   analyze their use cases in real world
    and then proposes an extension\n   to ALTO protocol so as to support a ALTO client
    to get cost value\n   between hosts via these different routing methods.\n\n\t "

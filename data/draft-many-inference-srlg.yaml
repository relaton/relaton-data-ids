  content: "The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame]\nis
    considered as one of the most important criteria concerning the\nconstrained-based
    path computation of optical channel routes. By\napplying the SRLG constraint criteria
    to the constrained-based path\ncomputation, one can select a route taking into
    account resource and\nlogical structure disjointness that implies a lower probability
    of\nsimultaneous lightpath failure.\n\t "

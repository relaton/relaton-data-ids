  content: "   Due to the exhaustion of global IPv4 address space, there are demands\n
    \  arising for IPv4 address sharing between end users.  In such context,\n   different
    users can employ the same address, but different ports.\n   This document defines
    two DHCP options for assigning a set of ports\n   to a device.  One is used for
    allocating continuous port set, while\n   the other is designed for non-continuous
    port set allocation.\n\n\t "

  content: "Spurious retransmission timeouts cause suboptimal TCP performance because
    they often result in unnecessary retransmission of the last window of data.  This
    document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm for detecting spurious TCP retransmission
    timeouts.  F-RTO is a TCP sender-only algorithm that does not require any TCP
    options to operate.  After retransmitting the first unacknowledged segment triggered
    by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP sender monitors the incoming acknowledgments
    to determine whether the timeout was spurious.  It then decides whether to send
    new segments or retransmit unacknowledged segments.  The algorithm effectively
    helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCP
    performance in the case of a spurious timeout.  The F-RTO algorithm can also be
    applied to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts\n
    \  to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models\n   in
    the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for\n   use in the
    development of the One Data Model liaison organization\n   (OneDM) definitions.
    \ Tools convert this format to database formats\n   and other serializations as
    needed.\n\n   An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects and their\n
    \  associated interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the\n   Data
    types for the information exchanged in those interactions.\n\n   A JSON format
    representation of SDF 1.0 was defined in the previous\n   (-00) version of this
    document.  SDF 1.1 is expected to be defined in\n   a future version; the present
    document represents a draft on the way\n   from 1.0 to 1.1.  Hence, this is not
    an implementation draft.\n\n\t "

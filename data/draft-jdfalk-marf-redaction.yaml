  content: "Email messages often contain information which might be considered\n   private
    or sensitive, per either regulation or social norms.  When\n   such a message
    becomes the subject of a report intended to be shared\n   with other entities,
    the report generator may wish to redact or elide\n   the sensitive portions of
    the message.  This memo suggests one method\n   for doing so effectively.\n\n\t "

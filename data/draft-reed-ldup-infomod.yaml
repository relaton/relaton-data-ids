  content: "[LDUP Model] describes the architectural approach to replication of\nLDAP
    directory contents.  This document describes the information\nmodel and schema
    elements which support LDAP Replication Services\nwhich conform to [LDUP Model].\n
    \nDirectory schema is extended to provide object classes, subentries,\nand attributes
    to describe areas of the namespace which are under\ncommon administrative authority,
    units of replication (ie, subtrees,\nor partitions of the namespace, which are
    replicated), servers which\nhold replicas of various types for the various partitions
    of the\nnamespace, which namespaces are held on given servers, and the\nprogress
    of various namespace management and replication operations.\nAmong other things,
    this knowledge of where directory content is\nlocated will provide the basis for
    dynamic generation of LDAP\nreferrals for clients who can follow them.\n \nThe
    controlling framework by which the relationships, types, and\nhealth of replicas
    of the directory content will be defined so that,\nas much as possible, directory
    content is itself used to monitor and\ncontrol the environment.\n \nSecurity information,
    including access control policy identifiers and\ninformation will be treated as
    directory content by the replication\nprotocols when specified by the LDAPEXT
    group.\n \nThe information model will describe required and optional house-\nkeeping
    duties for compliant systems to implement, such as garbage\ncollection of deleted
    objects, reconciliation of moved and renamed\nobjects, update sequencing and transaction
    bracketing of changes, etc.\n\n\t "

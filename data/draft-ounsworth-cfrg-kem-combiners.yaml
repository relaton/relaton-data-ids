- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The migration to post-quantum cryptography often calls for performing\n
    \  multiple key encapsulations in parallel and then combining their\n   outputs
    to derive a single shared secret.\n\n   This document defines a comprehensible
    and easy to implement Keccak-\n   based KEM combiner to join an arbitrary number
    of key shares, that is\n   compatible with NIST SP 800-56Cr2 [SP800-56C] when
    viewed as a key\n   derivation function.  The combiners defined here are practical
    split-\n   key PRFs and are CCA-secure as long as at least one of the ingredient\n
    \  KEMs is.\n\n\t "

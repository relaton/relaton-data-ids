abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration to post-quantum cryptography often calls for performing
    multiple key encapsulations in parallel and then combining their outputs to derive
    a single shared secret. This document defines a flexible multi-share KEM combiner
    to join an arbitrary number of key shares, that is a multi-PRF compatible with
    NIST SP 800-56Cr2 [SP800-56C].</p>"

  content: "   The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced
    a\n   set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation\n   Element
    as a tool to help MPLS-TE, GMPLS LSP tunnels and Segment\n   Routing paths placement.
    \ This also include the ability to compute\n   inter-domain LSPs or Segment Routing
    path following a distributed or\n   hierarchical approach.  In complement to the
    original stateless mode,\n   a stateful mode has been added.  In particular, the
    new PCInitiate\n   message allows a PCE to directly ask a PCC to setup an MPLS-TE,
    GMPLS\n   LSP tunnels or a Segment Routing path.  However, once computed, the\n
    \  inter-domain LSPs or Segment Routing path are hard to setup in the\n   underlying
    network.  Especially, in operational network, RSVP-TE\n   signaling is not enable
    between BGP border routers.  But, such RSVP-\n   TE signaling is mandatory to
    setup contiguous LSP tunnels or to\n   stitch or nest independent LSP tunnels
    to form the end-to-end inter-\n   domain LSP tunnels.  This draft propose to combine
    a Backward\n   Recursive method with PCInitiate message to setup independent LSP\n
    \  tunnels per domain and stitch or nest the different LSP tunnels to\n   setup
    end-to-end inter-domain LSP tunnels without the need of inter-\n   domain signaling
    between BGP border routers.  A new Stitching Label\n   definition and new LSP-TYPE
    code points are proposed for that\n   purpose.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   From time to time, networking protocols need to be able to name\n   things
    used within the protocol, and resolve the names created or\n   referenced.  It's
    common for protocol designers to attempt to use\n   domain names as the starting
    point for their systems of names, and\n   the DNS protocol as the starting point
    for name resolution.  Such re-\n   use of DNS naming and resolution conventions
    can cause issues if not\n   carefully defined and handled, as applications and
    infrastructure in\n   the modern Internet tend to assume that a \"domain name\"
    is an\n   identifier that follows certain composition and allocation rules and\n
    \  is to be resolved by DNS protocol in the global default scope.\n\n   This document
    acknowledges this class of extensions to the shared\n   domain namespace and considers
    a framework for the properties a\n   naming and resolution convention should have
    in the internet protocol\n   environment, including the avoidance of collision
    with other uses of\n   the namespace.  Depending to the answers to the suggested
    questions,\n   the answer may be that domain names will not meet the constraints
    at\n   hand.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides gap analysis and requirements for the problems\n
    \  and use cases that champion the joint optimization of both network\n   and
    computing resources as outlined in[I-D.liu-dyncast-ps-usecases].\n   It also identifies
    the key engineering investigation areas which\n   require adequate architectures
    and protocols to achieve balanced\n   computing and networking resource utilization
    among facilities\n   providing the services.\n\n\t "

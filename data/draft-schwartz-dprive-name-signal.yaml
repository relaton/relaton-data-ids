  content: "   Some recent proposals to the DPRIVE working group rely on the use of\n
    \  SVCB records to provide instructions about how to reach an\n   authoritative
    nameserver over an encrypted transport.  These\n   proposals will be difficult
    to deploy until the parent domain's\n   delegation software has been modified
    to support these records.  As\n   an interim solution for these domains, this
    draft proposes encoding\n   relevant signals in the child's NS-name.\n\n\t "

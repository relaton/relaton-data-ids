  content: "   When a sensor node roams within a very large and distributed wireless\n
    \  sensor network, which consists of numerous sensor nodes, its routing\n   path
    and neighborhood keep changing.  In order to provide a high\n   level of security
    in this environment, the moving sensor node needs\n   to be authenticated to new
    neighboring nodes as well as to establish\n   a key for secure communication.
    \ The document proposes an efficient\n   and scalable protocol to establish and
    update the secure key in a\n   dynamic wireless sensor network environment.  The
    protocol guarantees\n   that two sensor nodes share at least one key with probability
    1\n   (100%) with less memory and energy cost, while not causing\n   considerable
    communication overhead.\n\n\t "

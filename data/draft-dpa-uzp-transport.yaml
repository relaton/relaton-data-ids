  content: "   The Universal Zero-Port Transport Protocol (UZP) defines an identity-\n
    \  addressed, encrypted-by-default transport for the Universal Zero-Port\n   Interconnect
    Framework (UZPIF; [UZPIF]).  Instead of exposing IP:port\n   listeners, both endpoints
    establish outbound, identity-bound sessions\n   to one or more Rendezvous Nodes
    (RNs).  The RN performs flow\n   stitching but never terminates end-to-end cryptography
    or holds long-\n   term secrets.  All application data is carried over an authenticated\n
    \  encryption (AEAD) channel keyed by a handshake based on modern and\n   post-quantum-capable
    primitives.  Reliability is expressed at the\n   block level, rather than at the
    TCP segment or stream level, enabling\n   selective retransmission and deterministic
    pacing.  This document\n   specifies the UZP wire format, handshake, cryptographic
    negotiation,\n   exporter interface, 0-RTT rules, replay model, and RN behaviour,
    and\n   its relationship to UZPIF ([UZPIF]), QUIC ([RFC9000]), HIP\n   ([RFC7401]),
    and TLS 1.3 ([RFC8446]).\n\n\t "

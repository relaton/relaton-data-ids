abstract:
- content: "<p>The Universal Zero-Port Transport Protocol (UZP) defines an identity-
    addressed, encrypted-by-default transport for the Universal Zero-Port Interconnect
    Framework (UZPIF; [UZPIF]). Instead of exposing IP:port listeners, both endpoints
    establish outbound, identity-bound sessions to one or more Rendezvous Nodes (RNs).
    The RN performs flow stitching but never terminates end-to-end cryptography or
    holds long- term secrets. All application data is carried over an authenticated
    encryption (AEAD) channel keyed by a handshake based on modern and post-quantum-capable
    primitives. Reliability is expressed at the block level, rather than at the TCP
    segment or stream level, enabling selective retransmission and deterministic pacing.
    This document specifies the UZP wire format, handshake, cryptographic negotiation,
    exporter interface, 0-RTT rules, replay model, and RN behaviour, and its relationship
    to UZPIF ([UZPIF]), QUIC ([RFC9000]), HIP ([RFC7401]), and TLS 1.3 ([RFC8446]).</p>"

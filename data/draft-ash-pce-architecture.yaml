  content: "Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for\ntraffic
    engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\nand Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Path\ncomputation in large, multi-domain,
    multi-region or multi-layers\nnetworks is highly complex and may require special
    computational\ncomponents and cooperation between the different network domains.\n\nThis
    document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element\n(PCE)-based
    model to address this problem space.\n\t "

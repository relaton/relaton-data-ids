- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In this note we will present a functional decomposition of the\n   multihomig
    protocol i.e. the protocol for preserving established\n   communications in multihomed
    environments.  We will do so by\n   describing a protocol walkthrough, presenting
    which functions have to\n   be performed at each stage and the messages required
    to accomplish\n   them.  The functional decomposition presented in this draft
    is based\n   on the general functional analysis of multihoming approaches\n   presented
    in [3].\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In many deployment configurations, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n
    \  clients are capable of initiating connection requests towards their\n   SIP
    server, but the SIP server cannot open connections towards the\n   client.  Specifications
    have been developed which allow for a client-\n   initiated connection to be used
    for incoming requests towards the\n   client.  This outbound connection involves
    the use of a SIP proxy,\n   called an outbound proxy, that the client connects
    to.  However, the\n   specification does not provide a means to discover the outbound\n
    \  proxy, nor does it support high availability for failures of the\n   outbound
    proxy mid-dialog.  This specification fills those gaps.  The\n   resulting mechanism
    additionally provides solutions for inter-proxy\n   connection reuse and usage
    of certificates with SIP.\n\n\n\t "

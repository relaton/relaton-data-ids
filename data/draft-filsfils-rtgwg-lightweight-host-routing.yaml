  content: "   Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is widely deployed today for\n
    \  discovery of information across network elements like routers,\n   switches,
    and hosts.  This document extends LLDP to allow hosts to\n   advertise their IP
    prefixes to their attached routers which can then\n   propagate the reachability
    of these host prefixes into routing\n   protocols for enabling network-wide connectivity.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "In a strong password-based protocol, the only thing the client needs\nto
    know is the user's password, and an eavesdropper, or someone\nimpersonating either
    end, cannot do off-line password-guessing\nattacks.  This sort of protocol can
    be used for credentials download,\nor for mutual authentication. Although password-based
    mutual\nauthentication protocols can be used for credentials download, they\nare
    designed with some properties (such as not storing a password-\nequivalent at
    the server) that are not important in a credentials-\ndownload protocol. Therefore,
    a protocol designed specifically for\ncredentials download can be fewer messages,
    higher performance at the\nserver, and allow the server to operate in a stateless
    manner.\nTherefore it is possible, even likely, that different protocols might\nbe
    preferable in one case (credentials download) than another.\n\t "

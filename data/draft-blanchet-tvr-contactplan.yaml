  content: "   Some networks, such as in space, have links that are up and down\n
    \  based on a known schedule.  The links characteristics, such as\n   latency
    and bandwidth, are often also known in advance and are\n   important information
    for routing decisions.  This document describes\n   a YANG data model, also known
    as contact plan.  This specification\n   applies to the Bundle Protocol.\n\n\t "

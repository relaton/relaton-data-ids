  script: Latn
  content: "   Segment routing (SR) leverages the source routing mechanism.  It\n
    \  allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within IGP\n   topologies
    by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths\n   which are called segments.
    \ These segments are advertised by the\n   link-state routing protocols (IS-IS
    and OSPF).  Unlike the MPLS, SR\n   does not have the specific path construction
    signaling so that it\n   cannot support the Path MTU.  This draft provides the
    necessary IS-IS\n   and OSPF extensions about the Path MTU that need to be used
    on SR.\n   Here, the term \"OSPF\" means both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.\n\n\n\t "

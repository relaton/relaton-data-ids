  content: "   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides\n
    \  mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n   computation
    in response to a Path Computation Client (PCC) request.\n   The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) using PCEP.\n\n   A Path Computation Client
    (PCC) can synchronize an LSP state\n   information to a Stateful Path Computation
    Element (PCE).  The\n   stateful PCE extension allows a redundancy scenario where
    a PCC can\n   have redundant PCEP sessions towards multiple PCEs.  In such a case,\n
    \  a PCC gives control of a LSP to only a single PCE, and only one PCE\n   is
    responsible for path computation for this delegated LSP.\n\n   There are some
    use cases, where an inter-PCE stateful communication\n   can bring additional
    resiliency in the design, for instance when some\n   PCC-PCE session fails.  The
    inter-PCE stateful communication may also\n   provide a faster update of the LSP
    states when such an event occurs.\n   Finally, when, in a redundant PCE scenario,
    there is a need to\n   compute a set of paths that are part of a group (so there
    is a\n   dependency between the paths), there may be some cases where the\n   computation
    of all paths in the group is not handled by the same PCE:\n   this situation is
    called a split-brain.  This split-brain scenario\n   may lead to computation loops
    between PCEs or suboptimal path\n   computation.\n\n   This document describes
    the procedures to allow a stateful\n   communication between PCEs for various
    use-cases and also the\n   procedures to prevent computations loops.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document assigns two BGP extended community types, one\n   transitive
    and one non-transitive.  It also defines two IANA\n   registries in order to allow
    the allocation of reserved transitive\n   and non-transitive extended communities.
    \ These are similar to the\n   existing reserved (formerly Well-known) BGP communities
    defined in\n   RFC 1997 but provides an easier control of inter-AS community\n
    \  advertissement as a community could be chosen as transitive or non-\n   transitive
    across ASes.\n\n\t "

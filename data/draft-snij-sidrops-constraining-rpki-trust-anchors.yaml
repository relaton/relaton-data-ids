abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach for Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) Relying Parties (RPs) to impose locally configured Constraints on cryptographic
    products subordinate to Trust Anchors (TAs). The ability to constrain a Trust
    Anchor operator's effective signing authority to a limited set of Internet Number
    Resources (INRs) allows Relying Parties to enjoy the potential benefits of assuming
    trust - within a bounded scope. The specified approach and configuration format
    allow RPKI operators to communicate efficiently about observations related to
    Trust Anchor operations.</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "A Timeout header is defined for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\nThis
    end-to-end header informs an origin server and any\nintermediaries of the maximum
    time that a client will await a\nresponse to its request.  A server can use this
    header to ensure that\na timely response is generated.  This also identifies requests
    as\nbeing potentially long-lived, and allows for better resource\nallocation for
    these requests.\n\nA Connection-Timeout header is defined for HTTP.  This hop-by-hop\nheader
    informs the entity at the other end of a connection of the\nmaximum time that
    an idle connection is kept open.  This header\nimproves reliability by providing
    better information about the idle\nconnection management policy of HTTP hosts.\n\nComments
    and feedback for this draft should be directed to the\nauthors and the Apps Discuss
    list (discuss@apps.ietf.org).\n\t "

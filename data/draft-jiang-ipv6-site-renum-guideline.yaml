  content: "This document analyzes the existing issues for IPv6 site renumbering.\nIt
    also analyzes the possible directions to solve these issues and\ngives recommendations.
    This document only takes the perspective of\nnetwork and network protocols. Renumbering
    in IPv4 networks, in the\ndual-stack network or in the IPv4/IPv6 transition networks
    are out of\nscope.\n\nThis document only takes the perspective of network and
    network\nprotocols. According to the different stages, these issues are\ndescribed
    in three categories: considerations during network design,\nconsiderations for
    routine network management, and considerations\nduring renumbering operation.
    Recommended solutions or strategies are\nalso described. Issues that still remain
    unsolvable are listed as the\nfourth category.\n\nAlthough we list a few non-network
    issues in this document, we\nconsider them as issues that ISPs or network providers
    cannot affect.\nSo, these issues are considered to be unsolvable and not explore\nfurther
    in these document, though they may be solved by OS\nimplementations or application
    implementations.\n\nWe summary the requests that need to extend current protocols
    as\nfurther works at the end of this document.\n\t "

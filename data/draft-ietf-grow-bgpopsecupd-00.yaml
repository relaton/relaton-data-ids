  content: "   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol almost exclusively\n
    \  used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network\n   domains.
    \ Due to this central nature, it is important to understand\n   the security and
    reliability measures that can and should be deployed\n   to prevent accidental
    or intentional routing disturbances.\n\n   Previously, security considerations
    for BGP have been described in\n   [RFC7454].  Since the publications of [RFC7454],
    several developments\n   and changes in operational practice took place that warrant
    an update\n   of these best current practices.\n\n   This document updates [RFC7454],
    reiterating the best practices for\n   BGP security from that document and adding
    new practices and\n   recommendations that emerged since the publication of [RFC7454].
    \ In\n   the current version, this document covers practices to protect the\n
    \  BGP sessions itself such as Time to Live (TTL), the TCP\n   Authentication
    Option (TCP-AO), and control-plane filtering.  It also\n   describes measures
    to better control the flow of routing information,\n   using prefix filtering
    and automation of prefix filters, max-prefix\n   filtering, Autonomous System(AS)
    path filtering, route flap\n   dampening, and BGP community scrubbing.\n\n   Newly
    added information and improvements include a unification of\n   terminology, orienting
    it in [RFC9234], changing recommendations\n   regarding IXP LAN prefixes to align
    with operational practice,\n   discussing ASPA and BGP roles, expanding on community
    scrubbing,\n   filter generation and evaluation practices to limit performance\n
    \  overhead, expanding on outbound and internal filtering for defense in\n   depth,
    global prefix limits, and community based filtering for\n   downstream prefixes.\n\n\t "

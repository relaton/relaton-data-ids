  content: "This document describes a mechanism for fast detection of MPLS LSP\nfailure
    when a link fails and scales to all LSPs affected by the\nfailure.  Fast detection
    enables ingress LERs to quickly recover\nonto backup LSPs.  A performance improvement
    in the reliability of\nLSPs is expected.  The mechanism described relies on a
    node and\nnetwork architecture that integrates L1/L2/L3 technology.\n\t "

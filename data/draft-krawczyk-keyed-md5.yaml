- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a keyed-MD5 mechanism for use as a message authentication
    code (MAC) (or, integrity check value -- ICV). It is mainly intended for integrity
    verification of information transmitted over open networks (e.g., Internet) between
    parties that share a common secret key. The proposed mechanism combines the (key-less)
    MD5 hash function [RFC-1321] with a shared secret key.  The description of keyed-MD5
    in this document is independent of its use in any particular protocol. An analogous
    mechanism can be used in combination with other iterative hash functions, e.g.,
    SHA.\n\t "

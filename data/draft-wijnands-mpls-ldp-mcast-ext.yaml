  content: "   Forwarding multicast packets efficiently over an MPLS core requires\n
    \  Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) or Multi-Point-to-Multi-Point (MP2MP)\n   LSP's
    between one or more Ingress routers and one or more Egress\n   routers.  For efficient
    forwarding core LSRs need to replicate\n   labeled multicast packets where the
    branches of the P2MP/MP2MP tree\n   diverge. This draft specifies LDP extensions
    that enable it to build\n   P2MP/MP2MP LSPs in a receiver initiated manner.\n\t "

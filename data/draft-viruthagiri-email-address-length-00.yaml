  content: "   This memo formally defines the overall email address maximum length\n
    \  to 254 characters (octets);\n\n   Relaxes local-part limitation set by RFC
    821/2821/5321;\n\n   Obsoletes domain-part limitation set by RFC 821/2821/5321;
    AND\n\n   Uses the mechanism described in RFC 1869 to define an extension with\n
    \  keyword \"EAML\" to the SMTP service whereby an SMTP server can declare\n   that
    it is capable of handling longer email addresses.\n\n\n\t "

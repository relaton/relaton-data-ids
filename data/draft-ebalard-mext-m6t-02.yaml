  content: "MIPv6 [RFC3775] protocol has been designed to work on IPv6 networks:\nnothing
    was initially provisioned in the specification to support\nmovement of Mobile
    Nodes to IPv4-only networks (with or without NAT)\nor the communication with IPv4
    peers.\n\nDSMIPv6 [RFC5555] is the official solution specified to address those\nneeds.
    \ It requires IPv4/NAT-awareness by the MIPv6 module, IKE\nmodule and IPsec stack.
    \ The global approach selected by DSMIPv6\nrequires changes to implementations
    and increases complexity.\n\nThis memo presents an alternative approach to support
    operations of\nMIPv6 mobile nodes from IPv4-only networks.  It does not require\nchanges
    to MIPv6 modules, IKE module and IPsec stack.\n\t "

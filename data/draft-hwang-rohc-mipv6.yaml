  script: Latn
  content: "The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC, RFC 3095, defines\na
    framework for header compression, along with compression protocols\n(profiles)
    for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP, IP/UDP, and also for uncompressed\npacket streams.  And
    another draft [IPPROFILE] posted by Jonsson\ndeals with the IP only profile.  However,
    no profile was defined for\ncompression of IP extension headers.  But in the coming
    wireless\napplications, mobile IP will play an important role.  In mobile IPv4,\nthere
    is no difference to the packet's IP header, so we don't have to\nmake a profile
    for mobile IPv4; while as to mobile IPv6[MIPV6], there\nis difference, since some
    specific IPv6 extension headers will be\nincluded in almost every packet in the
    mobile IPv6 packets.  The\nextension headers will also cost a lot of bandwidth,
    and we should do\ncompression over them.  This document addresses this issue and\ndefines
    a ROHC compression profile for mobile IPv6, which may work as\na complementarity
    to the profiles defined by RFC3095.\n\t "

  content: "   With advent of server virtualization technologies, a host is able to
    \n   support multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) in a single physical \n   machine.
    Data Centers can leverage these capabilities to instantiate \n   on the order
    of 10s to 100s of VMs in a single server with current \n   technology.  It is
    conceivable that this number can be much higher \n   in the future. Each VM operates
    as an independent IP host with a set \n   of Virtual Network Interface Cards (vNICs),
    each having its own MAC \n   address and mapping to a physical Ethernet interface.
    These physical \n   servers are typically installed in a rack with their Ethernet
    \n   interfaces connected to a top-of-the-rack (ToR) switch. The ToR \n   switches
    are interconnected through End-of-the-Row (EoR) or \n   aggregation switches which
    are in turn connected to core switches.  \n    \n   As discussed in [ARP-Problem]
    the host VMs use ARP broadcasts to \n   find other host VMs and use periodic (broadcast)
    Gratuitous ARPs to \n   refresh their IP to MAC address binding in other VM hosts.
    Such \n   broadcasts in a large data center with potentially thousands of VM \n
    \  hosts in a Layer 2 based topology can overwhelm the network. \n    \n   This
    memo proposes mechanisms to reduce the number of broadcasts \n   that are sent
    throughout the network. This is done by having the \n   ToRs intelligently process
    ARP and frames, rather than simply \n   broadcasting them throughout the broadcast
    domain.  \n    \n   While this document addresses ARP, the Neighbor Discovery
    mechanisms \n   used by the IPv6 hosts that make use of multicast rather than
    \n   broadcast also pose similar issues in the Data Center. The solutions \n   defined
    herein should be equally applicable to hosts running IPv6.  \n   The details will
    be specified in a subsequent revision. \n\n\t "

  content: "   High-Availability (HA) is a very important requirement throughout the\n
    \  history of carrier network, many technologies have emerged for it.\n   With
    the trend of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network\n   function are migrated
    from dedicated hardware to software running\n   over COTS servers, the same SLA
    of HA should be provided depending on\n   network service itself.  But some new
    challenges are brought by NFV,\n   one example is Virtualized Network Function
    (VNF) cluster caused by\n   the HA and performance limitation of individual VNF
    instance.  For\n   the VNF cluster, some gaps exist between with the available
    HA\n   technologies on issues of multi-homing, state synchronization, share-\n
    \  risk prevention and HA role election, especially in the network which\n   has
    a large scale deployment of NFV.\n\n   This document firstly identifies the challenges
    emerged within NFV\n   deployed networks.  Then, available HA technologies are
    reviewed and\n   the detailed gap analysis between them with the new challenges
    is\n   discussed in depth.  At last, the summary of these gaps is presented.\n\n\t "

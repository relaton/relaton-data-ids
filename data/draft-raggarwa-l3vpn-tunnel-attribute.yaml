  content: "   This document proposes a mechanism that allows a router to signal the\n
    \  identifiers of IP/MPLS Tunnels, for which it is the headend, using\n   Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP). One application of this mechanism is\n   multicast in
    BGP - Multi-Protocol-Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual\n   Private Networks (VPNs).
    \ This document also proposes a mechanism\n   that allows a router to signal its
    tunnel enapsulation/decapsulation\n   capabilities using BGP. One application
    of this is signaling MPLS\n   upstream label assignment capability when BGP is
    used to advertise\n   MPLS upstream assigned labels.\n\t "

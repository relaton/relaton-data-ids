  content: "The target of DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) is to\nprovide
    an open and standard in-network storage system for\napplications, primarily P2P
    applications, to store, retrieve and\nmanage their data.  This draft enumerates
    and explains requirements,\nnot only for store and retrieve, but also for data
    management, access\ncontrol and resource control, that should be considered during
    the\ndesign and implementation of a DECADE system.  These are requirements\non
    the entire system, some of the requirements may eventually be\nimplemented by
    an existing protocol with/without some extensions\n(e.g. the data transport level),
    but a user of DECADE as a complete\narchitecture would be guaranteed such functionality.\n\t "

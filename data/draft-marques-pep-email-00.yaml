  content: "   The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) propositions for email are based upon\n
    \  already existing email and encryption formats (i.e., PGP/MIME) and\n   designed
    to allow for easy implementable and interoperable\n   opportunistic encryption:
    this ranging from key distribution to\n   mechanisms of subject encryption.\n\n
    \  The goal of pEp for email is to automatize operations in order to\n   make
    email encryption usuable by a wider range of Internet users,\n   such that practices
    for confidentiality and privacy can be achieved\n   in reality.\n\n   In this
    document, basic operations of pEp's approach towards email\n   and two PGP/MIME
    formats (pEp Email Format 1 and 2) providing certain\n   security guarantees are
    described.\n\n   The proposed operations and and formats are targeted to Opportunistic\n
    \  Security scenarios and are already implemented in several\n   applications
    of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t "

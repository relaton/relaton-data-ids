  content: "   A Segment Routing (SR) policy is a set of candidate SR paths\n   consisting
    of one or more segment lists with necessary path\n   attributes.  For each SR
    path, it may also have its own path\n   attributes, and Path Segment is one of
    them.  A Path Segment is\n   defined to identify an SR path, which can be used
    for performance\n   measurement, path correlation, and end-2-end path protection.
    \ Path\n   Segment can be also used to correlate two unidirctional SR paths into\n
    \  a bidirectional SR path which is required in some scenarios, for\n   example,
    mobile backhaul transport network.\n\n   This document defines extensions to BGP
    to distribute SR policies\n   carrying Path Segment and bidirectional path information.\n\n\n\t "

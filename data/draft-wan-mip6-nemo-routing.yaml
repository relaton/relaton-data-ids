  content: "The current Mobile IPv6 and NEMO specification supports only IPv6.\nAs
    an extension, the DSMip6 protocol [v4traversal]defines how the\ndual-stack mobile
    node roams in the ipv4 network.  The dsmip6\nprotocol assumes that both home agent
    and mobile node supports mipv4\nand mipv6 protocol.  It also assumes that both
    the home agent and\nmobile node have a configured ipv4 address.  These assumptions
    do\nwork during many scenarios.  However, as the ipv4 address is a scarce\nresource
    in many counrties, some mobile nodes may not be able to get\nconfigured ipv4 home
    addresses from their home agents.  In this\nscenario, a temporary ipv4 home address
    is more useful.  This\ndocument will focuse on this scenario.\n\n\t "

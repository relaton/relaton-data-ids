  content: "This document specifies the MulTFRC congestion control mechanism.\nMulTFRC
    is derived from TFRC and can be implemented by carrying out a\nfew small and simple
    changes to the original mechanism.  Its behavior\ndiffers from TFRC in that it
    emulates a number of TFRC flows with\nmore flexibility than what would be practical
    or even possible using\nmultiple real TFRC flows.  Additionally, MulTFRC better
    preserves the\noriginal features of TFRC than multiple real TFRCs do.\n\t "

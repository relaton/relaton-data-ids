  content: "This memo specifies a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) binding to
    the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) core. A SOAP binding describes
    how SOAP messages are transmitted in the network.\n\n The SOAP is an XML-based
    (eXtensible Markup Language) messaging protocol used to implement a wide variety
    of distributed messaging models. It defines a message format and describes a variety
    of message patterns, including, but not limited to, Remote Procedure Calling (RPC),
    asynchronous event notification, unacknowledged messages, and forwarding via SOAP
    intermediaries. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "The IPv6 interim mechanism 6to4 [6TO4] uses automatic IPv6-over-IPv4\ntunneling
    to interconnect IPv6 networks.  The architecture includes\nRelay Routers and Routers,
    which accept and decapsulate IPv4 traffic\nfrom anywhere.  There aren't many constraints
    on the embedded IPv6\npackets, or where IPv4 traffic will be automatically tunneled
    to.\nThese could enable one to go around access controls, and more likely,\nbeing
    able to perform proxy Denial of Service attacks using Relays as\nreflectors.  This
    document discusses these issues and tries to\nsuggest enhancements to alleviate
    the problems.\n\t "

  content: "This contribution contains a study aimed at investigating the\npossible
    protocols for multimedia call management in 3GPP\nAll-IP networks, and at providing
    the shared technical background\nrequired to chose the most appropriate one. In
    this first version,\ncall flows are described for multimedia calls using H.248
    as the\ncall control protocol and for a basic call (voice call) over UMTS IP\nnetwork.\n\n
    \  Further versions of this document will investigate other protocols\n   among
    those selected by 3GPP (H.248, H.323, SIP), and the advantages\n   and drawbacks
    of each approach will be highlighted.\n\n   The network reference model is the
    same one proposed by 3GPP for an\n   all-IP UMTS Core Network.  [2]\n\n\t "

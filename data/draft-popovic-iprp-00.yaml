  script: Latn
  content: "   Reliable packet delivery within stringent delay-constraints is of\n
    \  paramount importance to industrial processes with hard real-time\n   constraints,
    such as electrical grid monitoring. Because\n   retransmission and coding techniques
    counteract the delay\n   requirements, reliability is achieved through replication
    over\n   multiple fail-independent paths. Existing solutions such as the\n   parallel
    redundancy protocol (PRP) replicate all packets at the MAC\n   layer over parallel
    paths. PRP works best in local area networks,\n   e.g., sub-station networks.
    However, it is not viable for IP-layer\n   wide-area networks which are key elements
    of emerging smart grids.\n   Such a limitation on scalability, coupled with lack
    of security, and\n   diagnostic inability, renders it unsuitable for reliable
    data-\n   delivery in smart grids. To address this issue, a transport-layer\n
    \  design: IP parallel redundancy protocol (iPRP) is presented.\n   Designing
    iPRP poses non-trivial challenges in the form of selective\n   packet-replication,
    soft-state and multicast support. In addition to\n   unicast, iPRP supports multicast,
    widely used in smart-grid networks.\n   It replicates only time-critical UDP traffic.
    iPRP only requires a\n   simple software installation on the end-devices. There
    are no other\n   modifications needed to the existing monitoring application,
    end-\n   device operating system or to the intermediate network devices. iPRP\n
    \  has a set of diagnostic tools for network debugging. With an\n   implementation
    of iPRP in Linux, it is shown that iPRP supports\n   multiple flows with minimal
    processing-and-delay overhead. It is\n   publicly available and is currently being
    installed in the EPFL\n   campus smart-grid.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

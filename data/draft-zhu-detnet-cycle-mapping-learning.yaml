  content: "   The scaling DetNet (Deterministic Networking) technology based on\n
    \  cyclic queuing and scheduling is expected to solve the scalability\n   problem
    of DetNet.  One of the key technologies is to accurately\n   obtain the cyclic
    mapping relationship between adjacent nodes and the\n   packets can achieve the
    end-to-end deterministic forwarding.  This\n   draft describes the method for
    nodes to learn the cycle mapping\n   relationship through sending learning messages.\n\n\t "

  content: "This I-D describes problems on accounting issues in multicasting.  \n
    \  General requirements for accounting capabilities including QoS \n   related
    issues are listed.  This I-D assumes that these capabilities \n   can be realized
    by appropriate functions implemented at edges of a \n   network based on IGMP
    or MLD.  Such functions would log in a \n   dedicated database information obtained
    from edge routers.  Finally, \n   a case for CDN services is described as an application
    example which \n   could benefit from multicasting with accounting capabilities.
    \ It is \n   proposed that this I-D be used as a starting point for further  \n
    \  discussion on these issues.\n\t "

  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) imposes a limit on the number\n
    \  of hops a request can transit on the way to its destination.  When\n   this
    limit is reached, a 483 (Too Many Hops) error response is\n   returned.  The present
    form of the 483 response does not provide\n   enough information for the UAC or
    proxy on the path to diagnose\n   failures whose symptom is that the hop limit
    is reached.  This\n   document specifies additional diagnostic information to
    be returned\n   in a 483 response.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document analyzes actions by or against a CA or independent\n
    \  repository manager in the RPKI that can adversely affect the Internet\n   Number
    Resources (INRs) associated with that CA or its subordinate\n   CAs.  The analysis
    is based on examination of the data items in the\n   RPKI repository, as controlled
    by a CA (or independent repository\n   manager) and fetched by Relying Parties
    (RPs).  The analysis is\n   performed from the perspective of an affected INR
    holder.  The\n   analysis does not purport to be comprehensive; it does represent
    an\n   orderly way to analyze a number of ways that errors by or attacks\n   against
    a CA or repository manager can affect the RPKI and routing\n   decisions based
    on RPKI data.\n\n\t "

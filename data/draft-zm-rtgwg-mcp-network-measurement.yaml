abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a framework for intelligent network measurement
    using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). By treating network devices as MCP servers,
    and treating network controllers, management systems, or network devices with
    LLM capability as MCP clients, this framework enables natural language-driven,
    AI-assisted network measurement operations. The framework leverages MCP's standardized
    communication protocol to provide real-time network performance monitoring, intelligent
    fault diagnosis, topology discovery, and automated measurement workflows. This
    document describes the architecture, use cases, and security considerations for
    implementing MCP-based network measurement systems.</p>"

  content: "RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols \nas a
    control plane. They combine several of the benefits of the \nlink layer with network
    layer routing benefits. RBridges use \nexisting link state routing to provide
    higher RBridge to RBridge \ncross-section bandwidth, fast convergence on reconfiguration,
    \nand more robustness under link interruption than an equivalent \nset of conventional
    bridges using existing spanning tree \nforwarding. They are intended to apply
    to similar L2 network \nsizes as conventional bridges and are intended to be backward
    \ncompatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress and \ntransit. They also
    attempt to retain as much 'plug and play' as \nis already available in existing
    bridges. This document proposes \nan RBridge system as a solution to the TRILL
    problem. It also \ndefines the RBridge architecture, defines its terminology,
    and \ndescribes basic components and desired behavior. One or more \nseparate
    documents specify the protocols and mechanisms that \nsatisfy the architecture
    presented herein.\n\t "

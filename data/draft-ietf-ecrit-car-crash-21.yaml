  content: "   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n   mechanisms
    to support the next generation of emergency calls placed\n   by vehicles (automatically
    in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle
    occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the
    crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n
    \  (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\" (AACN), even in the\n   case
    of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers to the\n   ability to carry
    a richer set of data.\n\n   This document also registers a MIME media type and
    Emergency Call\n   Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location
    data\n   (often referred to as \"crash data\" even though there is not\n   necessarily
    a crash) and a SIP INFO package to enable carrying this\n   and related data in
    SIP INFO requests.  An external specification for\n   the data format, contents,
    and structure are referenced in this\n   document.\n\n   This document reuses
    the technical aspects of next-generation pan-\n   European eCall (a mandated and
    standardized system for emergency\n   calls by in-vehicle systems within Europe
    and other regions).\n   However, this document specifies use of a different set
    of vehicle\n   (crash) data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS)\n
    \  rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is an\n   extension
    of the IETF eCall document, with the primary differences\n   being that this document
    makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS\n   mandatory, and adds attribute values
    to the metadata/control object\n   to permit greater functionality.  This document
    registers a new SIP\n   INFO package (identical to that registered for eCall but
    with the\n   addition of the VEDS MIME type).  This document also describes legacy\n
    \  (circuit-switched) ACN systems and their migration to next-generation\n   emergency
    calling, to provide background information and context.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a tunneling protocol that can be encapsulated\n
    \  in any other protocol. Using authentication tokens multiple tunnels\n   can
    be created from behind the same NAT. The tokens allow one to\n   identify the
    sender of the packet thus making it possible to\n   automatically switch over
    the endpoint. This protocol is intended as\n   an alternative to the proto-41
    protocol in use for tunneling IPv6\n   over IPv4 packets over the internet. Due
    to the authentication this\n   protocol is especially useful for dynamic non-24/7
    endnodes which are\n   located\tbehind NATs and want to use for instance a IPv6
    Tunnel\n   Broker. The protocol can carry any payload and thus is not limited
    to\n   only IPv6 over IPv4 but can also be used for IPv4 over IPv6 and many\n
    \  other combinations of protocols.\n\t "

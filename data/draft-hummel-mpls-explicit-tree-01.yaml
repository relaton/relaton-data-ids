- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes the TREE ROUTE TLV that encodes a tree structured\nroute
    \ which  can  be used to carry explicit routing information.  It\nalso specifies
    the progression of the TLV from the root of  the  tree\nto  the  leaf  nodes.
    \  Every  node  that  the  TLV  traversed has to\ndecode/process the TLV in such
    a way that  the  correct  child  link/\nnodes  are  determined  as  well  as  the
    \ respective  subtree  route\ninformation. Individual Information targetted for
    any  specific  node\ncan also be packed into this TREE ROUTE TLV.\n \n   The draft
    also presents the benefits of using TREE ROUTE TLV in MPLS.\n \n   The   applications
    \  include   constrain   based   routing,   traffic\n   engineering,  VPN  installations
    \ and  static  multicast  tree.   The\n   capability  of  carrying targetted information
    for individual node in\n   the tree is very powerful in MPLS. This allows different
    nodes in the\n   tree route to use the same tree route for different FECs.\n \n
    \  The application of this  TLV  is  not  mpls-specific.  Other  Working\n   Groups
    may consider the proposed TLV as well.\n\t "

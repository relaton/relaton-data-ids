abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a procedure that allows receivers to compute\n
    \  the congestion from the received congestion information and to\n   communicate
    this information back to the sender using non-TCP based\n   protocols. The main
    advantage of this approach is that\n   applications that are not using the TCP
    protocol as transport\n   protocol could also apply the Conex concept to rely
    congestion\n   experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network.\n\n\n\n\t "

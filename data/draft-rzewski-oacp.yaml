  content: "The goal of 'content peering' is to logically connect content-based\nnetworks
    together to allow content providers increased control of\ncontent presentation
    in remote networks and to receive detailed\ninformation on the utilization of
    their content. The Origin/Access\nContent Peering (OACP) implementation provides
    a scalable mechanism\nfor content providers to originate this control and also
    to receive\nutilization data.\n\t "

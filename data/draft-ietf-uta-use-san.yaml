  content: "   In the decade since [RFC6125] was published, the\n   subjectAlternativeName
    extension (SAN), as defined in [RFC5280] has\n   become ubiquitous.  This document
    updates [RFC6125] to specify that\n   the fall-back techniques of using the commonName
    attribute to\n   identify the service must not be used.  This document also places\n
    \  some limitations on the use of wildcards in SAN fields.\n\n   The original
    context of [RFC6125] using X.509 certificates for server\n   identity with Transport
    Layer Security (TLS), is not changed.\n\n\t "

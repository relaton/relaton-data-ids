  content: "The IS-IS routing protocol (ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols at\nthe
    link layer for point-to-point links. As a result, it does not use\na three-way
    handshake when establishing adjacencies on point-to-point\nmedia. This paper defines
    an backward-compatible extension to the\nprotocol that provides for a three-way
    handshake. It is fully\ninteroperable with systems that do not support the extension.\nAdditionally,
    the extension allows the robust operation of more than\n256 point-to-point links
    on a single router.\nThis extension has been implemented by multiple router vendors;
    \ this\npaper is provided as information to the Internet community in order\nto
    allow interoperable implementations to be built by other vendors.\n\t "

  content: "   The proposed pretty Easy privacy (pEp) protocols for email are based\n
    \  upon already existing email and encryption formats (as PGP/MIME) and\n   designed
    to allow for easily implementable and interoperable\n   opportunistic encryption.
    \ The protocols range from key distribution,\n   secret key synchronization between
    own devices, to mechanisms of\n   metadata and content protection.  The metadata
    and content protection\n   is achieved by moving the whole message (not only the
    body part) into\n   the PGP/MIME encrypted part.  The proposed pEp Email Formats
    not only\n   achieve simple forms of metadata protection (like subject\n   encryption),
    but also allow for sending email messages through a\n   mixnet.  Such enhanced
    forms of metadata protection are explicitly\n   discussed within the scope of
    this document.\n\n   The purpose of pEp for email is to simplify and automate
    operations\n   in order to make usage of email encryption a viability for a wider\n
    \  range of Internet users, with the goal of achieving widespread\n   implementation
    of data confidentiality and privacy practices in the\n   real world.\n\n   The
    proposed operations and formats are targeted towards to\n   Opportunistic Security
    scenarios and are already implemented in\n   several applications of pretty Easy
    privacy (pEp).\n\n\t "

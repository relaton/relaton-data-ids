abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines two CBOR serializations: "ordinary serialization"
    and "deterministic serialization." It also introduces the term "general serialization"
    to name the full, variable set of serialization options defined in [STD94]. Together,
    these three form a complete set of serializations that cover the majority of CBOR
    serialization use cases. These serializations are largely compatible with those
    widely implemented by the CBOR community.</p>'

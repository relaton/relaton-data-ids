  content: "This document specifies the procedure for creating bindings between a\nstateless
    address (including Stateless Autoconfiguration Address,\nmanually configured non-static
    address, etc) and an anchor (refer to\n[SAVI-framework]) on SAVI (Source Address
    Validation Improvements)\ndevice. The bindings can be used to filter packets generated
    on the\nlocal link with forged IP addresses. Different from other proposed\nsolution
    for stateless address (e.g., SAVI-FCFS), this solution\nfollows RFC4862 to arbitrate
    the ownership of address. Supplemental\nbinding processes are also specified to
    cover conditions that cannot\nbe handled by control packet snooping.\n\t "

  content: "   The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to\n   facilitate
    the high-quality and persistent identification of\n   information objects.  A
    founding principle of the ARK is that\n   persistence is purely a matter of service
    and is neither inherent in\n   an object nor conferred on it by a particular naming
    syntax.  The\n   best that an identifier can do is to lead users to the services
    that\n   support robust reference.  The term ARK itself refers both to the\n   scheme
    and to any single identifier that conforms to it.  An ARK has\n   five components:\n\n
    \  [https://NMA/]ark:[/]NAAN/Name[Qualifier]\n\n   an optional and mutable Name
    Mapping Authority (usually a hostname),\n   the \"ark:\" label, the Name Assigning
    Authority Number (NAAN), the\n   assigned Name, and an optional and possibly mutable
    Qualifier\n   supported by the NMA.  The NAAN and Name together form the immutable\n
    \  persistent identifier for the object independent of the URL hostname.\n   An
    ARK is a special kind of URL that connects users to three things:\n   the named
    object, its metadata, and the provider's promise about its\n   persistence.  When
    entered into the location field of a Web browser,\n   the ARK leads the user to
    the named object.  That same ARK, inflected\n   by appending `?info', returns
    a metadata record that is both human-\n   and machine-readable.  The returned
    record contains core metadata and\n   a commitment statement from the current
    provider.  Tools exist for\n   minting, binding, and resolving ARKs.\n\n\t "

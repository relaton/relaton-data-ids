  content: "This specification defines a service that manages a type of disposable
    Internet mail address known as a proxy address.  Proxy addresses conform to the
    standard addressing scheme [RFC 822] and exist in the same address space, but
    act as aliases for regular, fixed addresses.  Users may own many at a time and
    allocate and deallocate them at will.\n \nThe service also defines a distinct
    command-response interface for use between client and server implementations to
    conduct management chores.\n\t "

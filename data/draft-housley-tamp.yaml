  content: "This document describes a transport independent, request-response\nprotocol
    for the management of trust anchors and community\nidentifiers stored in a device.
    \ The protocol makes use of the\nCryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), and a digital
    signature is used\nto provide integrity protection and data origin authentication.
    \ Each\ntrust anchor is associated with a list of functions within devices\nthat
    make use of digital signature mechanisms.  Digital signatures\ncan be validated
    directly with the public key associated with the\ntrust anchor, or they can be
    validated with a certified public key\nwhose X.509 certification path terminates
    with the trust anchor\npublic key.\n\t "

  content: "There is some known misbehavior of DNS authoritative servers when\nthey
    are queried for AAAA resource records.  Such behavior can block\nIPv4 communication
    which should actually be available, cause a\nsignificant delay in name resolution,
    or even make a denial of\nservice attack.  This memo describes details of the
    known cases and\ndiscusses the effect.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 8806 (often called \"LocalRoot\") defines a mechanism whereby a\n
    \  recursive resolver can fetch the contents of an entire zone and place\n   this
    information into the resolver's cache.\n\n   This has several benefits, including
    increased reliability, increased\n   performance, improved privacy, and decreased
    or mitigating the effect\n   of some types of DoS attacks.\n\n   While the majority
    of DNS resolver implementations natively support\n   RFC 8806, it remains tricky
    to configure and maintain.  This document\n   recommends that DNS resolver software
    simplify this configuration,\n   and further suggests that configuration becomes
    the default.\n\n   This document updates Section 2 of RFC8806 by relaxing the\n
    \  requirement that implementations MUST run an authoritative service.\n\n   /*

  content: "This memo suggests a pragmatic specification for defining the 20-bit\nFlow
    Label field using a hybrid approach that includes options to\nprovide IntServ
    as well as DiffServ based support for IPv6 Quality of\nService. It also compares
    various suggested approaches for defining\nthe 20-bit Flow Label field in IPv6
    Base Header based on RFC 2460\n(December 1998) and few other drafts. Addressing
    the IPv6-Multicast-\nQoS issues also becomes possible as a consequence. This draft
    clearly\nspecifies exactly when and how various options are to be used; and in\ncase
    of the MFC, exactly how a specific action might be taken by the\nsuggested implementation.
    Thus the resultant mechanism is fully\nimplementable and unambiguous as even the
    lower-level details have been\nworked out as may be required for actual implementations.
    The draft\nalso has a pointer to an experimental QoS scheme called MultServ.\n\n\t "

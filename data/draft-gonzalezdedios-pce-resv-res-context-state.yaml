  content: "The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n   functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   A limited form of statefulness is
    useful to improve PCE functionality\n   in situations in which the local TED might
    not be up to date, or in\n   the case of concurrent requests where most of the
    LSPs are computed\n   before the end of the set-up of the LSPs when the TED is
    updated.\n   The PCE can retain some context from the resources assigned to Path\n
    \  Requests during a certain period of time, so that it avoids\n   suggesting
    the use of the same resources for subsequent TE LSPs.\n\n   This document proposes
    an extension to the PCEP protocol to allow the\n   PCC to request the PCE to block
    or reserve the resources computed in\n   a path request of a TE LSP for subsequent
    requests for a certain\n   time.\n\t "

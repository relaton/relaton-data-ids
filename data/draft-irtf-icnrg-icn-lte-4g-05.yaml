  content: "   LTE, 4G mobile networks use IP-based transport for control plane to\n
    \  establish the data session and user plane for actual data delivery.\n   In
    existing architecture, IP transport used in the user plane is not\n   optimized
    for data transport, which leads to an inefficient data\n   delivery.  IP unicast
    routing from server to clients is used for\n   delivery of multimedia content
    to User Equipment (UE), where each\n   user gets a separate stream.  From a bandwidth
    and routing\n   perspective, this approach is inefficient.  Multicast and broadcast\n
    \  technologies have emerged recently for mobile networks, but their\n   deployments
    are very limited or at an experimental stage due to\n   complex architecture and
    radio spectrum issues.  ICN is a rapidly\n   emerging technology with built-in
    features for efficient multimedia\n   data delivery.  However much of the work
    is focused on fixed\n   networks.  The focus of this draft is on native deployment
    of ICN in\n   cellular mobile networks by using ICN in a 3GPP protocol stack.
    \ ICN\n   has an inherent capability for multicast, anchorless mobility and\n
    \  security, and it is optimized for data delivery using local caching\n   at
    the edge.  The proposed approaches in this draft allow ICN to be\n   enabled natively
    over the current LTE stack comprising PDCP/RLC/MAC/\n   PHY, or in a dual stack
    mode (along with IP).  These approaches can\n   help optimize the mobile networks
    by leveraging the inherent benefits\n   of ICN.\n\n\t "

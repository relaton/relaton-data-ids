  content: "This document specifies a variant of the Mobility Support in IPv6\nprotocol
    [1], mainly intended for mobile hosts that do not need to\nor want to use any
    explicit home agent.  However, portions of the\nprotocol may be beneficial for
    other hosts as well, including\nnon-mobile hosts, since it reduces the average
    header sizes for\npackets flowing between two mobile hosts or between a mobile
    and a\nnon-mobile host.  It may also be beneficial to multi-homed hosts or\nsites,
    since it allows migration of connections from one IP address\nto another.\n\t "

  content: "  The Diameter of Things (DoT) protocol is intended to provide a real-\n
    \ time metering framework for IoT applications in resource-constraint\n  gateways.
    Respecting resource capacity constraints on edge devices\n  establishes a firm
    requirement for a lightweight protocol in support\n  of fine-grained telemetry
    of IoT deployment units. Such metering\n  capability is needed when lack of resources
    among competing\n  applications dictates our schedule and credit allocation. In
    response\n  to these findings, the authors offer the DoT protocol that can be\n
    \ incorporated to implement real-time metering of IoT services for\n  prepaid
    subscribers as well as Pay-per-use economic models. The DoT\n  employs mechanisms
    to handle the composite application resource usage\n  units consumed/charged against
    a single user balance. Such charging\n  methods come in two models of time-based
    and event-based patterns. The\n  former is used for scenarios where the charged
    units are continuously\n  consumed while the latter is typically used when units
    are implicit\n  invocation events. The DoT-enabled platform performs a chained\n
    \ metering transaction on a graph of dependent IoT microservices,\n  collects
    the emitted usage data, then generates billable artifacts\n  from the chain of
    metering tokens. Finally it permits micropayments to\n  take place in parallel.\n\n\t "

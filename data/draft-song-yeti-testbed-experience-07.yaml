  content: "   The Internet's Domain Name System is designed and built on a single\n
    \  root, known as the Root Server System.\n\n   Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production
    root server testbed that\n   provides an environment where technical and operational
    experiments\n   can safely be performed without risk to production root server\n
    \  infrastructure.This testbed has been used by a broad community of\n   participants
    to perform experiments that aim to inform operations and\n   future development
    of the production DNS.  Yeti DNS is an\n   independently-coordinated project and
    is not affiliated with ICANN,\n   IANA or any Root Server Operator.\n\n   The
    Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes various novel and\n   experimental components
    including IPv6-only transport, independent,\n   autonomous Zone Signing Key management,
    large cryptographic keys and\n   a large number of Yeti-Root Servers names.  These
    differences from\n   the Root Server System have operational consequences such
    as large\n   responses to priming queries and the coordination of a large pool
    of\n   independent operators; by deploying such a system globally but\n   outside
    the production DNS system, the Yeti DNS project provides an\n   opportunity to
    gain insight into those consequences without\n   threatening the stability of
    the DNS.\n\n   This document neither addresses the relevant policies under which
    the\n   Root Server System is operated nor makes any proposal for changing\n   any
    aspect of its implementation or operation.  This document aims\n   solely to document
    the technical and operational experience of\n   deploying a system which is similar
    to but different from the Root\n   Server System.\n\n\t "

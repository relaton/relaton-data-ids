- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   TCP is often used as a proxying or tunneling protocol.  QUIC is a\n
    \  new, emerging transport protocol and there is a similar expectation\n   that
    it too will be used as a substrate once it is widely deployed.\n   Using QUIC
    instead of TCP in existing scenarios will allow proxying\n   and tunneling services
    to maintain the benefits of QUIC natively,\n   without degrading the performance
    and security characteristics.  QUIC\n   also opens up new opportunities for these
    services to have lower\n   latency and better multistreaming support.  This document
    summarizes\n   current and future usage scenarios to derive requirements for QUIC\n
    \  and to provide additional protocol considerations.\n\n\t "

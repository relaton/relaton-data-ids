  content: "   The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This\n
    \  openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but\n   it
    can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by\n   certain
    parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms\n   to limit the
    extent and impact of abusive or objectionable\n   communications.  Recently, there
    has been an increasing emphasis on\n   \"blocking\" and \"filtering,\" the active
    prevention of such\n   communications.  This document examines several technical
    approaches\n   to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment
    with\n   the overall Internet architecture.  In general, the approach to\n   blocking
    and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet\n   architecture is to inform
    endpoints about potentially undesirable\n   services, so that the communicants
    can avoid engaging in abusive or\n   objectionable communications.\n\n\t "

  content: "Discovering overlay networks and the resources found within in them\npresents
    a number of bootstrapping problems.  While those hard\nproblems are under discussion,
    this draft proposes a small set of\nmechanisms which are intended to be generically
    useful for\nproviding pointers to peer-to-peer overlay networks in web pages,\nemail
    messages, and other textual media.  While the mechanisms\ndescribed below each
    meet similar needs, they are not mutually\nexclusive; it is expected that each
    will find some useful\ndeployment during the early days of peer-to-peer overlay\ndeployment.\n\t "

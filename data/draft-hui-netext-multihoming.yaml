  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 is standardized to provide network-based mobility\nmanagement
    for a regular IPv6 mobile node, the Binding Cache Entry is\nbuilt based on the
    HNP. If the MN is a multiple interfaces MN, these\ninterfaces will get the different
    HNPs from the LMA and several BCEs\nare built for one MN. This will cause the
    invalidation of multihoming.\nThis document introduces an extension to Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 for\nmultihoming MN. Through extending the binding relationship between\nHNP
    and MAG in BCE, and synchronizing this information between LMA\nand MAGs, LMA
    can deliver data through multiple MAGs. Thus the MN\nattaching in a PMIPv6 domain
    can receive data packets with the same\ndestination through its multiple network
    interfaces attaching to\ndifferent MAGs simultaneously.\n\t "

  content: "   Most of firewalls deployed today are Mobile IPv6 unaware.  Widespread\n
    \  Mobile IPv6 deployment is not possible unless Mobile IPv6 messages\n   can
    pass through these firewalls.  In this memo, policy servers are\n   used to communicate
    with firewalls and instruct them to bypass Mobile\n   IPv6 messages.  To achieve
    the goal, Network Access Identifier (NAI)\n   and authentication information are
    included in Mobile IPv6 control\n   signalling or data packets.  Firewalls extract
    these information and\n   send them to a policy server, and the policy server
    then installs\n   corresponding states in firewalls based on authentication result
    and\n   user's predefined policy.  The new defined IPv6 extension header and\n
    \  the policy-based frame can also facilitate dynamic configuration in\n   any
    application firewall traversal.\n\n\t "

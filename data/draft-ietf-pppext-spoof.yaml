  content: "The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for transporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.           This document describes
    a Network Control Protocol which will allow the  two ends of a connection to agree
    to carry out protocol spoofing when an idle link is temporarily disconnected in
    order to save on connection charges.                                                                   This
    work was originally motivated by the desire to exploit the fast call setup capability
    of ISDN, but is equally applicable in any situation in which a PPP connection
    is made over a link which can  be temporarily suspended for whatever reason.\n\t "

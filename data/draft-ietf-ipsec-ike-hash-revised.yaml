  content: "This document defines new method of calculating the authentication HASH\nof
    the IKE [RFC-2409] protocol. It fixes known problems with the IKE.\nThe way the
    HASH is currently defined in the [RFC-2409] does not authen-\nticate the ISAKMP
    [RFC-2408] packet header, nor does it authenticate any\nextra ISAKMP payloads
    inside phase 1 ISAKMP packets. This causes a secu-\nrity problem when using extra
    ISAKMP payloads as already defined in the\nIKE and DOI [RFC-2407] (vendor ID payload,
    INITIAL-CONTACT notification\netc).  There is also suggestion how to fix the Phase
    2 authentication\nhashes so that they will also authenticate the ISAKMP packet
    header.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)  \nworking
    group is developing protocol for authenticating clients to  \nthe access network
    using IP based protocols.  The PANA protocol  \nauthenticates the client and also
    establishes a PANA security  \nassociation between the PANA client and PANA authentication
    agent at  \nthe end of a successful authentication. But it does not specify any
    \ \nmechanism for preventing service theft. This document discusses the  \ndetails
    for establishing an IPsec security association for securing \nthe link between
    PANA client and the enforcement point, which can be  \nused to prevent service
    theft.   \n\t "

  content: "   Internet mail defines the From: field to indicate the author of the\n
    \  message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who initially\n   handled
    the message, on the author's behalf.  The Sender: field is\n   optional, if it
    has the same information as the From: field.  This\n   was not a problem, until
    development of stringent protections on use\n   of the From: field.  It has prompted
    Mediators, such as mailing\n   lists, to modify the From: field, to circumvent
    mail rejection caused\n   by those protections.  In effect, the From: field has
    become\n   dominated by its role as a handling identifier.  The current\n   specification
    augments the altered use of the From: field, by\n   specifying the Author: field,
    which ensures identification of the\n   original author of the message and is
    not subject to modification by\n   Mediators.\n\n\t "

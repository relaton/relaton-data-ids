  content: "   Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be\n   identified
    by an authenticated domain.  Unfortunately many hope to\n   use DKIM as an alternative,
    but it is independent of intended\n   recipients and domains accountable for having
    sent the message.  This\n   means DKIM is poorly suited at establishing abuse
    assessments of\n   unsolicited commercial email otherwise known as SPAM, nor was
    this\n   initially DKIM's intent.  DKIM lacks message context essential to\n   ensure
    fair assessment and to ensure this assessment is not poisoned\n   (Who initiated
    the transaction and to whom).\n\n   DKIM was instead intended to establish increased
    levels of trust\n   based upon valid DKIM signatures controlling acceptance and
    what a\n   user sees within the FROM header field.  But DKIM failed to guard\n
    \  against pre-pended header fields where any acceptance based on valid\n   DKIM
    signatures is sure to exclude header field spoofing, especially\n   that of the
    FROM.  This weakness allows malefactors to exploit DKIM\n   signature acceptance
    established by high-volume DKIM domains to spoof\n   ANY other domain, even when
    prohibited within the Signer's network.\n\n\n\t "

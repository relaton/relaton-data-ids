  content: "Pre-congestion notification (PCN) gives early warning of congestion\nby
    metering and marking packets in order to protect the quality of\nservice of inelastic
    flows.  PCN traffic load is divide into three\npre-congestion states by two rates
    that [I-D.ietf.pcn.architecture]\ndefines per link: PCN-admissible- and PCN-supportable-rates.
    \ PCN\nadmission control and flow termination mechanisms operate in\naccordance
    with these three states.  [I-D.ietf.pcn.baseline.encoding]\ndefines two PCN encoding
    states.  This document proposes an algorithm\nfor marking and metering by using
    PCN baseline encoding for both flow\nadmission and flow termination.  The ratio
    of marked packets\ndetermines the three link states: no packets marked, some packets\nmarked,
    and all packets marked.  To achieve this marking behaviour,\nwe use two token
    buckets.  One is not used for marking but for a\nmarking switch; the other is
    used for marking.  The token bucket for\nmarking has two thresholds.  One is TBthreshold.threshold,
    already\ndefined in [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour], and the other is a new\nthreshold,
    which is set to be the number of bits of a metered-packet\nsmaller than the token
    bucket size.  Therefore, the new threshold is\nlarger than TBthreshold.threshold.
    \ If the amount of tokens is less\nthan TBthreshold.threshold, all the packets
    are marked as defined in\n[I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour].  If the amount of
    tokens is less\nthan the new threshold and greater than TBthreshold.threshold,
    one-\nNth packets are marked.  We evaluated the performance of admission\ncontrol
    and flow termination using a simulation.  For admission\ncontrol, the results
    show that the performance of the algorithm was\nalmost the same as, but slightly
    inferior to, that of CL\n[draft-briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb-03].  For flow termination,
    the\nperformance of the algorithm was almost the same as CL when the load\nwas
    1.2 times the supportable rate, but it was superior to CL when\nthe load was high
    (two times the supportable rate).  Furthermore, in\nthe algorithm, over termination
    percentages of all the bottleneck\nlinks are almost the same in the case of multi-bottleneck.
    \ In CL,\nthe over termination percentages of all the bottleneck links are\ndifferent
    and those at upstream bottleneck links are higher than\nthose at downstream bottleneck
    links because of accumulation of\nmarked packets.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) to\n
    \  enable direct client access to file data on storage, bypassing the\n   NFSv4
    server.  This can increase both performance and parallelism,\n   but requires
    additional client functionality, some of which depends\n   upon the type of storage
    used.  The pNFS specification for block\n   storage (RFC 5663) describes how clients
    can identify the volumes\n   used for pNFS, but this mechanism requires communication
    with the\n   NFSv4 server.  This document adds a mechanism to RFC 5663 that\n
    \  enables identification of block storage devices used by pNFS file\n   systems
    without communicating with the server.  This enables clients\n   to control access
    to pNFS block devices when the client initially\n   boots, as opposed to waiting
    until the client can communicate with\n   the NFSv4 server.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a cryptographically protected message format
    \n   and transaction protocol for managing network-enabled devices.  The \n   message
    format consists of a header, content and trailers.  The \n   message header uniquely
    identifies the message type.  The message \n   content is afforded (i) authentication
    by means of a digital \n   signature trailer and (ii) confidentiality by means
    of encryption \n   trailer; and the whole message (header, content, trailers)
    is \n   afforded integrity by means of a trusted time stamp trailer.  All \n   message
    structures are defined using ASN.1 and all cryptographic \n   structures use CMS.
    \ The transaction protocol consists of request \n   messages, response messages,
    acknowledgement messages, and \n   notification messages. \n\n\n\t "

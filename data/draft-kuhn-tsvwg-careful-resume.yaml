abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses careful convergence of Congestion Control (CC)
    in QUIC, providing a cautious method that enables fast startup in a wide range
    of connections: reconnections using previous transport security credentials (0-RTT
    context), reconnections between 2 peers (prior knowledge of transport context),
    application-limited traffic. The method provides QUIC with transport services
    that resemble those currently available in TCP, such as TCP Control Block (TCB)
    [RFC9040] caching or updates to support application-limited traffic. The method
    reuses a set of computed CC parameters that are based on the previously observed
    path characteristics between the the same pair of transport endpoints, such as
    the bottleneck bandwidth, available capacity, or the RTT. These parameters are
    stored, allowing then to be later used to modify the CC behavior of a subsequent
    connection. The document also discusses assumptions and defines requirements around
    how a sender utilizes these parameters to provide opportunities for a new connection
    to more quickly get up to speed (i.e. utilize the available capacity). It discusses
    how these changes impact the capacity at a shared network bottleneck and the safe
    response that is needed after any indication that the new rate is inappropriate.</p>"

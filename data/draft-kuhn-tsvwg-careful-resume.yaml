  content: "   This document specifies careful convergence of Congestion Control\n
    \  (CC), providing a cautious method that enables fast startup for a\n   wide
    range of connections or reconnections.\n\n   The method reuses a set of computed
    CC parameters that are based on\n   the previously observed path characteristics
    between the same pair of\n   transport endpoints, such as the bottleneck bandwidth,
    available\n   capacity, or the RTT.  These parameters are stored, allowing them
    to\n   be later used to modify the CC behavior of a subsequent connection.\n   The
    document also discusses assumptions and defines requirements\n   around how a
    sender utilizes these parameters to provide\n   opportunities for a connection
    to more quickly get up to speed (i.e.\n   utilize the available capacity).  It
    discusses how these changes\n   impact the capacity at a shared network bottleneck
    and the safe\n   response that is needed after any indication that the new rate
    is\n   inappropriate.  The method is expected to be appropriate to IETF\n   transports.\n\n\t "

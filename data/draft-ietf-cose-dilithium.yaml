abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes JSON and CBOR serializations for CRYSTALS Dilithium,
    a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) based suite. This document does not define any
    new cryptography, only seralizations of existing cryptographic systems. This document
    registers key types for JOSE and COSE, specifically LWE. Key types in this document
    are specified by the cryptographic algorithm family in use by a particular algorithm
    as discussed in RFC7517. This document registers signature algorithms types for
    JOSE and COSE, specifically CRYDI3 and others as required for use of various parameterizations
    of the post-quantum signature scheme CRYSTALS Dilithium.</p>"

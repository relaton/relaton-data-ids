  content: "   DNS over TCP and traditional HTTP are both stream-oriented, client-\n
    \  speaks-first protocols.  They can both be run over a stream-based\n   security
    protocol like TLS.  A server accepting a stream-based client\n   can distinguish
    between a valid stream of DNS queries and valid\n   stream of HTTP requests by
    simple observation of the first few octets\n   sent by the client.  This can be
    done without any external\n   demultiplexing mechanism like TCP port number or
    ALPN.\n\n   Implicit multiplexing of the two protocols over a single listening\n
    \  port can be useful for obscuring the presence of DNS queries from a\n   network
    observer, which makes it relevant for DNS privacy.\n\n   Widespread adoption of
    the described approach could constrain future\n   evolution of the stream-based
    variants of both DNS ([RFC1035]) and\n   HTTP ([RFC7230] and [RFC7540]) by ossifying
    existing distinguishing\n   bit patterns in early octets sent by the client.\n\n\t "

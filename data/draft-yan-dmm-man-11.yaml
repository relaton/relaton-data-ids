  content: "   Mobile peers exchange signals with networks, for both IP and wireless\n
    \  domains, to negotiate capabilities for mobile registration,\n   connection
    management, session establishment, service provisioning,\n   etc.  Generally,
    mobility capabilities include the supported and\n   provisioned resources along
    with associated protocols for certain\n   mobility management scenarios.  While
    devices in the mobile IP domain\n   would mostly focus on the IP-related negotiation,
    devices in the\n   wireless domain, e.g., the 5G system (5GS), embrace both mobile
    IP-\n   related resources as well as wireless-specific capabilities.\n   Regarding
    both the mobile-IP and wireless domains, we have\n   generalized two protocol
    categories for mobility capability\n   negotiation & management, i.e., the host-initiated
    category that\n   involves the direct & active engagement of mobile end devices
    vs. the\n   network-based category over which mobile endpoints play almost no\n
    \  role in the process.  The classification and then the application of\n   the
    two categories help us analyze the mobility capability\n   negotiation for both
    the mobile IPv6 and the 3GPP 5G system.  The\n   comparison of the capability
    negotiation under both the Home-Routed\n   (HR) and the Local BreakOut (LBO) roaming
    cases in 5GS further\n   reflects the feasibility of the protocol dichotomy.\n\n\t "

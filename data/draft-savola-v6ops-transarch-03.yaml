  content: "The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 and co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 is\na
    subject of much debate.  However, the big picture of the transition\ndoesn't seem
    to have been discussed sufficiently.  Therefore,\ndifferent people have different
    assumptions on the process, which\nmakes planning the transition architecture
    very difficult.  This memo\ntries to point out some issues that will need consideration
    in the\ntransition architecture.\n\t "

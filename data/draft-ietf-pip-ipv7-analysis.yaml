  content: "This document describes how the IPv7 proposal called EIPIP (Extended IP
    using PIP) meets the evaluation criteria established by the Internet Engineering
    Steering Group and described in 'RFC-1380 IESG Deliberations on Routing and Addressing'.
    \ EIPIP is currently developed to be both a transition mechanism for a new IP
    protocol (PIP), and the new IP protocol. This document also includes how EIPIP
    meets the criteria described by Partridge/Kastenholz in their Internet Draft 'Criteria
    for Choosing IP Version 7 (IPv7)'.\n\t "

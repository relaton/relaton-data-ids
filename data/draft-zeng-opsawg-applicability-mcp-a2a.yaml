abstract:
- content: "<p>NETCONF provides robust configuration transactions and YANG-based data
    models, but falls short in scenarios requiring AI-driven semantic translation,
    long-lived cross-domain orchestration, multi- agent consensus, rapid DevOps iteration,
    or delivery of large non- configuration artifacts. This document systematically
    analyzes the functional gaps and presents Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-
    to-Agent (A2A) as complementary solutions. Implementation guidance and coexistence
    models are also provided.</p>"

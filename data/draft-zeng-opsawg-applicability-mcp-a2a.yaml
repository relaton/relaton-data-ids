  content: "   NETCONF provides robust configuration transactions and YANG-based\n
    \  data models, but falls short in scenarios requiring AI-driven\n   semantic
    translation, long-lived cross-domain orchestration, multi-\n   agent consensus,
    rapid DevOps iteration, or delivery of large non-\n   configuration artifacts.
    \ This document systematically analyzes the\n   functional gaps and presents Model
    Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-\n   to-Agent (A2A) as complementary solutions.
    \ Implementation guidance\n   and coexistence models are also provided.\n\n\t "

  content: "Elliptic curve cryptography is rapidly gaining acceptance and is being
    \nincreasingly used in applications that are constrained in memory and \nbandwidth.
    \ Efforts are underway to standardize the use of elliptic \ncurves for authentication
    [ECDSA], [X962] and key agreement [ISO15946], \n[P1363], [X963].  However, none
    of these efforts describe the Elliptic \nCurve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) method in
    a form suitable for inclusion in \nSPKM [RFC2025].  This document will define
    a new OID and \nAlgorithmIdentifier which is suitable for use in SPKM and describe
    how \nthe ECDH algorithm is to be used in SPKM.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Multicast Receiver Access Control must be enforced at both the\n   application
    level and at the network level.  The control at the two\n   levels must be correlated,
    to ensure that only a legitimate group\n   member at the application level is
    permitted to join group at the\n   network level.  We assume that authentication
    and authorization at\n   the application level are provided by Extensible Authentication\n
    \  Protocol (EAP) exchanges.  We describe how to use Protocol for\n   carrying
    Authentication for Network Access (PANA) to transport the\n   EAP packets in such
    a way that authententication and authorization\n   can be easily achieved at the
    network level and that the necessary\n   coordination is achieved.\n\n\t "

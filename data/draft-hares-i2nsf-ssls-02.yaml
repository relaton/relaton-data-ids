abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Each I2NSF agent and I2NSF client needs to provide application level\n
    \  support for management traffic during periods of DDoS and network\n   security
    attacks to deal with congestion (burst and/or continuous),\n   high error rates
    and packet loss due to the attacks, and the\n   inability to utilize a transport
    protocol (E.g.  TCP) due to a\n   specific protocol attack.  This application
    level support needs to be\n   able to select the key management system and provide
    \"chunking\" of\n   data (in order to fit in reduced effective MTUs), compression
    of data\n   (in order to fit into reduced bandwidth), small security envelope
    )in\n   order to maximize room for management payload), and fragmentation and\n
    \  reassembly at the application layer for those protocols which do not\n   support
    fragmentation/reassembly (E.g.  UDP or SMS).\n\n   These Secure Session Layer
    services may only be deployed on a the few\n   management ports which need to
    be protected during DDoS attacks or\n   network security attacks, and turned on/off
    based on need.  The\n   application and the network instrumentation need to cooperate
    to\n   determine if this service needs to be turned on or off.  This draft\n   specifies
    a security session layer services(SSLs) which provide these\n   features in terms
    of APIs (North-Bound and South-bound), and the\n   component features (interface
    to key management systems, data\n   compression, chunking of data, secure session
    envelope (SSE) to send\n   data, and fragmentation and reassembly, and ability
    to detect\n   existence of attack).\n\n\t "

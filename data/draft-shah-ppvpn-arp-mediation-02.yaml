  content: "The VPWS service [L2VPN Framework] provides point-to-point \n    connections
    between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices.  It does \n    so by binding two
    Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device \n    with a Provider Edge, PE,
    device) to a Pseudowire (connecting the \n    two PEs).  In general, the Attachment
    Circuits must be of the same \n    technology (e.g., both ethernet, both ATM),
    and the Pseudowire must \n    carry the frames of that technology.  However, if
    it is known that \n    the frames' payload consists solely of IP datagrams, it
    is possible \n    to provide a point-to-point connection in which the Pseudowire
    \n    connects Attachment Circuits of different technologies.  This \n    requires
    the PEs to perform a function known as 'ARP Mediation'.  \n    This document specifies
    the ARP Mediation function, and specifies \n                 draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-03.txt
    \n  \n    the encapsulation used to carry the IP datagrams on the Pseudowires
    \n    when ARP mediation is used.\n\t "

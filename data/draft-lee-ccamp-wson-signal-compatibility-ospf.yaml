  content: "This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support\nsignal
    compatibility constraints associated with WSON network\nelements. These routing
    enhancements are required in common optical\nor hybrid electro-optical networks
    where not all of the optical\nsignals in the network are compatible with all network
    elements\nparticipating in the network.\n\nThis compatibility constraint model
    is applicable to common optical\nor hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO
    switches, regenerators,\nand wavelength converters since such systems can be limited
    to\nprocessing only certain types of WSON signals.\n\nConventions used in this
    document\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL
    NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].\n\t "

  content: "   This document offers an approach to encrypt DNS queries and responses\n
    \  between the stub resolver and the recursive server over UDP to\n   protect
    user privacy.  The public key of the recursive server is\n   distributed to the
    stub resolver through the Certificate Authority\n   infrastructure, and the public
    key of the stub resolver is sent to\n   the recursive server together with the
    DNS query where the public key\n   is inserted to the additional section of the
    DNS query.  Then the\n   recursive server encrypts the DNS responses sent to the
    stub resolver\n   with the public key of that stub resolver, and similarly the
    DNS\n   query sent to the recursive server is encrypted by the stub resolver\n
    \  with the public key of that recursive server and thus the user\n   privacy
    is protected.\n\n\t "

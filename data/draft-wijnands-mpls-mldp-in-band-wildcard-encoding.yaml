  content: "   There are scenarios in which an IP multicast tree traverses an MPLS\n
    \  domain.  In these scenarios, it can be desirable to convert the IP\n   multicast
    tree \"seamlessly\" to an MPLS multipoint label switched path\n   (MP-LSP) when
    it enters the MPLS domain, and then to convert it back\n   to an IP multicast
    tree when it exits the MPLS domain.  Previous\n   documents specify procedures
    that allow certain kinds of IP multicast\n   trees (either \"Source-Specific Multicast\"
    trees or \"Bidirectional\n   Multicast\" trees) to be attached to an MPLS Multipoint
    Label Switched\n   Path (MP-LSP).  However, the previous documents do not specify\n
    \  procedures for attaching IP \"Any Source Multicast\" trees to MP-LSPs,\n   nor
    do they specify procedures for aggregating multiple IP multicast\n   trees onto
    a single MP-LSP.  This document specifies the procedures\n   to support these
    functions.  It does so by defining \"wildcard\"\n   encodings that make it possible
    to specify, when setting up an MP-\n   LSP, that a set of IP multicast trees,
    or a shared IP multicast tree,\n   should be attached to that MP-LSP.  Support
    for non-bidirectional IP\n   \"Any Source Multicast\" trees is subject to certain
    applicability\n   restrictions that are discussed in this document.\n\n\t "

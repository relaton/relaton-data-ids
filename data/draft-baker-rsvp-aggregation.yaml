  content: "A key problem in the design of RSVP version 1 is, as noted in\nits applicability
    statement, that it lacks facilities for\naggregation of individual reserved sessions
    into a common\nclass. The use of such aggregation is recommended in the paper\nby
    Clark, Shenker, and Zhang in SIGCOMM '92, and required for\nscalability.\nThis
    document describes the use of a single RSVP reservation\nto aggregate other RSVP
    reservations across a transit routing\nregion, in a manner conceptually similar
    to the use of Virtual\nPaths in an ATM network. It proposes a way to dynamically\ncreate
    the aggregate reservation, classify the traffic for\nwhich the aggregate reservation
    applies, determine how much\nbandwidth is needed to achieve the requirement, and
    recover\nthe bandwidth when the sub-reservations are no longer\nrequired. It also
    contains recommendations concerning\nalgorithms and policies for predictive reservations.\n\t "

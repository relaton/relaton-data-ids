  content: "   This Internet Draft introduces the concept of a Resource Helper in\n
    \  OAuth 2.0.  A Resource Helper is a modular component that assists the\n   Authorization
    Server in managing fine-grained authorization\n   processes.  The Resource Helper,
    associated with a specific Resource\n   Server, handles scope selection and resource-specific
    details,\n   providing the user-interface for the Resource Owner to approve or\n
    \  refine access requests.  By offloading scope-related user interaction\n   to
    the Resource Helper, the Authorization Server remains generic and\n   stable while
    the Resource Helper evolves alongside the Resource\n   Server's requirements.
    \ This specification defines the protocol,\n   interfaces, and flow between the
    Authorization Server and the\n   Resource Helper.  Introducing a Resource Helper
    does not affect the\n   OAuth client or the interaction between the OAuth client
    and the\n   Resource Server.\n\n\t "

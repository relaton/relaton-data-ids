  content: "This draft defines a signaling mechanism based on RSVP-TE ([2]) to \nsupport
    an Optical User Network Interface (UNI).  This effort is in \npart driven by work
    in the OIF as well as the recent draft on \nsignaling requirements for the optical
    UNI ([3]), and is consistent \nwith recent work on Generalized MPLS (see [4],
    [5], [6], and [7]) in \nIETF.  The main function of this draft is to identify
    the relevant \nmechanisms in RSVP-TE (including further extensions) to satisfy
    \nfunctional requirements for an Optical UNI.\n\t "

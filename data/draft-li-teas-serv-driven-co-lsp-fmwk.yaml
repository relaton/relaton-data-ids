  content: "   MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) has been widely deployed to satifisfy\n
    \  all kinds of requirements of traffic engineering for transport of\n   services.
    \ Complexity of configuration has much negative effect on\n   the MPLS TE deployment
    in the large-scale network.  The document\n   identifies the configuration issues
    for MPLS TE deployment and\n   proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven mechanism,
    by which the\n   setup of co-routed MPLS Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched Paths(TE\n
    \  LSPs) is triggered by the bidirectional service.  Then the document\n   proposes
    the framework for setting up service-driven co-routed MPLS\n   TE LSP for L2VPN
    and L3VPN.\n\n\n\t "

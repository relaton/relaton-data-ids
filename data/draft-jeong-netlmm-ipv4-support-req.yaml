  content: "   The IETF NetLMM WG is developing standards of network-based mobility\n
    \  management in a localized domain.  PMIPv6 architecture enables mobile\n   nodes
    to roam without host-side mobility management protocol stack.\n   Current PMIPv6
    protocols mainly consider IPv6 and dual stack mobile\n   nodes.  It also states
    deployment scenario of PMIPv6 in IPv6\n   infrastructure.  However, localized
    mobility management in IPv4\n   network is also problematic.  Also, there still
    exist a lot of IPv4\n   MNs and these IPv4 MNs may visit PMIPv6 domain.  This
    document\n   discusses a few scenarios of IPv4 support in PMIPv6 domain and\n
    \  describes goals and requirements for IPv4 support in PMIPv6.\n\n\t "

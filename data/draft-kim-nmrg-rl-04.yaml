  content: "   This document presents intelligent network management scenarios based\n
    \  on reinforcement-learning approaches.  Nowadays, a heterogeneous\n   network
    should usually provide real-time connectivity, the type of\n   network management
    with the quality of real-time data, and\n   transmission services generated by
    the operating system for an\n   application service.  With that reason intelligent
    management system\n   is needed to support real-time connection and protection
    through\n   efficient management of interfering network traffic for high-quality\n
    \  network data transmission in the both cloud and IoE network systems.\n   Reinforcement-learning
    is one of the machine learning algorithms that\n   can intelligently and autonomously
    provide to management systems over\n   a communication network.  Reinforcement-learning
    has developed and\n   expanded with deep learning technique based on model-driven
    or data-\n   driven technical approaches so that these trendy techniques have
    been\n   widely to intelligently attempt an adaptive networking models with\n
    \  effective strategies in environmental disturbances over variety of\n   networking
    areas.\n\n\t "

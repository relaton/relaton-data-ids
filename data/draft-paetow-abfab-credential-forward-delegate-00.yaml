  content: "   A core use case of ABFAB-based authentication is access to remote\n
    \  systems.  In this and other use cases it is preferable that the same\n   identity
    initially used to gain access to the remote system is used\n   for further authentication
    sessions from the initial system onwards.\n   The current architecture and UI
    considerations require the use of\n   secure storage local to the system for any
    identities from that\n   system onwards.  This document aims to explore alternate
    proposals\n   for the reuse of an identity configured on the initial ABFAB-enabled\n
    \  client device by the use of credential forwarding or delegation in a\n   similar
    fashion to those used by other GSS-API mechanisms.\n\n\t "

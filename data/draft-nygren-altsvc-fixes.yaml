  content: "   HTTP Alternative Services has become the primary mechanism for HTTP/3\n
    \  upgrade, but overlaps with and disagrees with other developing\n   standards,
    such as the HTTPS resource record in DNS.  This document\n   explores a set of
    potential fixes and/or additional features for Alt-\n   Svc. It is used to record
    and share thoughts, and is not expected to\n   progress on its own.\n\n\t "

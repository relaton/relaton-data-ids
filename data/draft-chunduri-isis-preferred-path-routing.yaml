  content: "   This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR) mechanism to\n
    \  simplify the path description of data plane traffic in Segment\n   Routing
    (SR) deployments.  PPR aims to mitigate the MTU and data\n   plane processing
    issues that may result from SR packet overheads; and\n   also supports traffic
    measurement, accounting statistics and further\n   attribute extensions along
    the paths.  Preferred Path Routing is\n   achieved through the addition of descriptions
    to IS-IS advertised\n   prefixes, and mapping those to a PPR data-plane identifier.\n\n\n\t "

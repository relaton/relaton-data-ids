- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP, wherein the \npacket
    header is at least 40 bytes, while the voice payload is typically \nno more than
    30 bytes.  VoIP header compression can significantly reduce \nthe VoIP overhead
    through various compression mechanisms.  This is \nimportant on access links where
    bandwidth is scarce, and can be \nimportant on backbone facilities, especially
    where costs are high (e.g., \nsome global cross-sections).  In this draft we propose
    to re-use the \nmethods in cRTP to determine the header compression context and
    to use \nthe cRTP session context ID to route a compressed packet between the
    \ningress and egress routers.\n\t "

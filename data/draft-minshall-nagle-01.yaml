abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Nagle algorithm is one of the primary mechanisms which protects\nthe
    internet from poorly designed and/or implemented applications.\nHowever, for a
    certain class of applications (notably,\nrequest-response protocols) the Nagle
    algorithm interacts poorly\nwith delayed acknowledgements to give these applications
    poorer\nperformance.\n\nThis draft is NOT suggesting that these applications should
    disable\nthe Nagle algorithm.\n\n   This draft suggests a fairly small and simple
    modification to the\n   Nagle algorithm to preserve Nagle as a means of protecting
    the\n   internet while at the same time giving better performance to a\n   wider
    class of applications.\n\t "

  content: "The connection model in MGCP grew from a half-connection model, to, more\nrecently,
    a model that allows a second edgepoint to be specified [3]. In\nthis document,
    we have taken the connection model a step further, making\nit symmetrical, identifying
    the difference between external connections\nand an MG- connection, allowing signalling
    related commands to be asso-\nciated with either edgepoint, or with both edgepoints
    in an MG. While\nthe half-connection model may work best for the simple case of
    MGs with\nan external IP connection on one side, the proposed more general connec-\ntion
    model adapts easily when the MG is for packet to packet connec-\ntions, when the
    MG is TDM on one side and IP on the other, as well as\nwhen the external connections
    are ATM on either side of an MG.\n\n\t "

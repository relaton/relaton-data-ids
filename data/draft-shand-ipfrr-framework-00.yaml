- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document provides a framework for the development of IP fast re-\n
    \  route mechanisms which provide protection against link or router\n   failure
    by invoking locally determined repair paths. Unlike MPLS\n   Fast-reroute, the
    mechanisms are applicable to a network employing\n   conventional IP routing and
    forwarding. An essential part of such\n   mechanisms is the prevention of packet
    loss caused by the loops which\n   normally occur during the re-convergence of
    the network following a\n   failure.\n\t "

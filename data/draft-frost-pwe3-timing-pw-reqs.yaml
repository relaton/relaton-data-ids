  content: "This document describes the requirements for the transmission of \nnetwork
    timing and synchronization across packet-switched networks \nusing pseudo-wires.
    \ Such services enable the function of real-time, \nsynchronous applications across
    the asynchronous packet switched \nnetwork.  In particular, it complements the
    emulation of TDM bit \nstreams over the packet switched network.\n\t "

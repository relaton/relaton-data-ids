  content: "   The Russian Federal standard for electronic encryption, decryption,\n
    \  and message authentication algorithms (GOST 28147-89), which is one\n   of
    the Russian cryptographic standard algorithms is described in RFC\n   5830.  Since
    its publication, an update to the Russian Federal\n   standard was published as
    GOST R 34.12-2015 that includes the\n   specification of the block cipher known
    as \"Kuznyechik\" which has\n   been described in RFC7801.\n\n   GOST R 34.12-2015
    also includes an updated version of the block\n   cipher with block length of
    n=64 bits and key length k=256 bits,\n   which is also referred as \"Magma\".
    \ This document is intended to be a\n   source of information about the updated
    version of 64-bit cipher.  It\n   may facilitate the use of the block cipher in
    Internet applications\n   by providing information for developers and users of
    GOST 64-bit\n   cipherwith the revised version of the cipherfor encryption and\n
    \  decryption.\n\n   Unlike RFC 5830 (GOST 28147-89) and like RFC 7801 this specification\n
    \  does not define exact block modes which should be used together with\n   updated
    Magma cipher.  One is free to select block modes depending on\n   the protocol
    and necessity.\n\n\t "

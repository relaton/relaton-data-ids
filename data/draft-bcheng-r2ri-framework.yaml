  content: "   In highly dynamic, heterogeneous radio MANET environments where links\n
    \  are constantly changing, standardizing information exchange between\n   the
    radio and router such that routers can make informed  routing\n   decision based
    on link layer information over heterogeneous link\n   types becomes a key area
    to address. This document defines the basic\n   framework for radio-to-router
    interface communications as well as\n   requirements and considerations for evaluating
    radio-to-router\n   interface technologies for use in MANETs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the experiences creating independent\n   implementations
    of the Babel routing protocol [RFC6126], based on the\n   two independent implementations
    currently available.\n\n   The Babel routing protocol is easy to implement, and
    it is quite\n   feasible for someone with no prior experience with routing protocols\n
    \  to create a working implementation.  The few issues that needed\n   clarification
    during the independent implementation work are\n   documented, with the hope of
    aiding others seeking to implement\n   Babel.\n\n\t "

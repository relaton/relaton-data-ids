  content: Delegated Credentials to Host Encrypted DNS Forwarders on CPEs

  content: "   An encrypted DNS server is authenticated by a certificate signed by
    a\n   Certificate Authority (CA).  However, for typical encrypted DNS\n   server
    deployments on Customer Premise Equipment (CPEs), the\n   signature cannot be
    obtained or requires excessive interactions with\n   a Certificate Authority.\n\n
    \  This document explores the use of TLS delegated credentials for a DNS\n   server
    deployed on a CPE.  This approach is meant to ease operating\n   DNS forwarders
    in CPEs while allowing to make use of encrypted DNS\n   capabilities.\n\n\t "

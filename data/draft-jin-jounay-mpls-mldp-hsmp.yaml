  content: "   This draft introduces a hub & spoke multipoint LSP (short for HSMP\n
    \  LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP\n   and
    also leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path.  That means\n   traffic entering
    the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root\n   node travels downstream,
    exactly as if it was traveling downstream\n   along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node,
    and traffic entering the HSMP LSP\n   at any leaf node travels upstream along
    the tree to the root.  A\n   packet traveling upstream should be thought of as
    being unicast to\n   the root, except that it follows the path of the tree rather
    than\n   ordinary unicast path.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the use cases and requirements for simulcast\n
    \  and layered video coding support in WebRTC.  These techniques\n   simplify
    the implementation of video stream adaptation to different\n   participants in
    centralized conferencing solutions.  This document\n   also includes a proposal
    to expose these capabilities in the existing\n   PeerConnection API by defining
    new media constraint properties.\n\n\t "

  content: "OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP\nnetworks.
    Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via Hello\nsubprotocol. Hello
    OSPF packets are also used to ensure two-way\nconnectivity within time. When a
    router restarts its OSPF software,\nit may not know its neighbors. If such a router
    sends a hello packet\non an interface, its neighbors are going to reset the adjacency,\nwhich
    may not be desirable in certain conditions. This memo provides\na mechanism that
    allows OSPF routers to inform their neighbors about\nthe restart process. Note
    that this mechanism requires support from\nneighboring routers.\n\t "

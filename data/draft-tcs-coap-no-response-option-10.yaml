abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There can be M2M scenarios where responses from server against\n   requests
    from client might be considered redundant. This kind of\n   open-loop exchange
    (with no response path from the server to the\n   client) may be desired to minimize
    resource consumption in\n   constrained systems while simultaneously updating
    a bulk of\n   resources or updating a resource with a very high frequency. CoAP\n
    \  already provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of message exchange\n   where
    the server end-point does not respond with ACK. However,\n   obeying the request/response
    semantics, the server end-point\n   responds back with a status code indicating
    \"the result of the\n   attempt to understand and satisfy the request\".\n\n   This
    draft introduces a header option for CoAP called 'No-Response'.\n   Using this
    option the client explicitly tells the server to suppress\n   responses against
    the particular request. This option also provides\n   granular control to enable
    suppression of a particular class or a\n   combination of response-classes. This
    option may be effective for\n   both unicast and multicast requests. Present draft
    also discusses\n   few exemplary applications which benefit from this option.\n\n\t "

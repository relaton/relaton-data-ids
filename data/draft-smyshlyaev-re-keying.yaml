- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification presents an approach to increase the security of\n
    \  block cipher operation modes based on re-keying (with no additional\n   keys
    needed) during each separate message processing.  It provides an\n   internal
    re-keying mechanism called ACPKM.  This mechanism doesn't\n   require additional
    secret parameters or complicated transforms - for\n   key update only the base
    encryption function is used.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\n
    \  can be secured by means of Group Object Security for Constrained\n   RESTful
    Environments (Group OSCORE).  At deployment time, devices may\n   not know the
    exact OSCORE groups to join, the respective Group\n   Manager, or other information
    required to perform the joining\n   process.  This document describes how a CoAP
    endpoint can use\n   descriptions and links of resources registered at the CoRE
    Resource\n   Directory to discover OSCORE groups and to acquire information for\n
    \  joining them through the respective Group Manager.  A given OSCORE\n   group
    may protect multiple application groups, which are separately\n   announced in
    the Resource Directory as sets of endpoints sharing a\n   pool of resources.  This
    approach is consistent with, but not limited\n   to, the joining of OSCORE groups
    based on the ACE framework for\n   Authentication and Authorization in constrained
    environments.\n\n\t "

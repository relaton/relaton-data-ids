  content: "This document defines an extension block for use with the Delay- Tolerant
    Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol.  This Previous-Hop Insertion Block (PHIB) extension
    block is designed to be inserted by a forwarding node to provide the endpoint
    identifier (EID) of an endpoint of which the forwarding node is a member so that
    this EID may be conveyed to the next-hop receiving node.  Knowledge of an EID
    of an endpoint of which a previous-hop node is a member may be required in some
    circumstances to support certain routing protocols (e.g., flood routing).  If
    this EID cannot be provided by the convergence layer or other means, the PHIB
    defines the mechanism whereby the EID can be provided with the bundle.  Each PHIB
    is always removed from the bundle by the receiving node so that its presence within
    the bundle is limited to exactly one hop.  This document defines the format and
    processing of this PHIB.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking
    Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication
    as an RFC were raised.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

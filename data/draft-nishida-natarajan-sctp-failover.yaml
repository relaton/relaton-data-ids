  content: "   One of the major advantages in SCTP is supporting multi-homing\n   communication.
    \ If an multi-homed end-point has redundant network\n   connections, sctp sessions
    can have a good chance to survive from\n   network failures by migrating inactive
    network to active one.\n   However, if we follow the SCTP standard, there can
    be significant\n   delay for the network migration.  During this migration period,
    SCTP\n   cannot transmit much data to the destination.  This issue drastically\n
    \  impairs the usability of SCTP in some situations.  This memo\n   describes
    the issue of SCTP failover mechanism and discuss its\n   solutions which require
    minimal modification to the current standard.\n\t "

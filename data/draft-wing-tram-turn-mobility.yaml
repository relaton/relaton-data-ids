- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   It is desirable to minimize traffic disruption caused by changing IP\n
    \  address during a mobility event.  One mechanism to minimize\n   disruption
    is to expose a shorter network path to the mobility event\n   so only the local
    network elements are aware of the changed IP\n   address but the remote peer is
    unaware of the changed IP address.\n\n   This draft provides such an IP address
    mobility solution using\n   Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN).  This is
    achieved by\n   allowing a client to retain an allocation on the TURN server when
    the\n   IP address of the client changes.\n\n\t "

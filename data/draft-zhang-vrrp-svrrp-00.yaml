    Management Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol October 2009 \n  \n\n In this document,
    we propose a simplified VRRP protocol called the \n Slave Virtual Router Redundancy
    Protocol (SVRRP).The design \n objective of SVRRP is to specify an election protocol
    that \n dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of \n the
    SVRRP routers on a LAN, which is exactly as same as that of VRRP. \n However,
    SVRRP executions do not exchange signaling packets and need \n the assistance
    of VRRP to perform their functionality appropriately. \n This approach can be
    used to improve the efficiency of VRRP routers \n in certain scenarios.  \n\n
    Conventions used in this document \n\n The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \n document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [RFC2119].\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The JOSE set of standards established JSON-based container formats\n
    \  for signatures (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7515/) over a\n   content
    payload using established algorithms\n   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7518/).\n\n
    \  Newer algorithms are emerging which allow for additional operations\n   on
    content, such as a party (other than the signer) choosing not to\n   disclose
    some of the integrity-protected content.  However, these\n   algorithms often
    support granularity at the individual message level,\n   creating a need to define
    a way to support expressing multiple\n   content payloads as part of a single
    message.\n\n   This document defines a new operational mode for JSON Web Signatures\n
    \  that operates on a protected header and multiple binary content\n   payloads
    to provide the expressivity needed for this class of\n   algorithm.  It also describes
    how multiple content payloads can be\n   expressed in a manner compatible with
    pre-existing algorithms, albeit\n   without the operational capabilities of newer
    algorithms.\n\n\t "

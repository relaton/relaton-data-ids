  content: "   This document introduces an information model for network policies.\n
    \  This model operates as policy model that can be linked to other\n   information
    model such as the I2RS RIB information model.\n\n   Some applications that utilize
    the services of I2RS client may\n   require specific set of data in response to
    network events or\n   conditions based on pre-established rules.  In order to
    reduce the\n   data flow through the network, the I2RS client needs to signal
    the\n   I2RS agent to filter some of the collected data or events prior to\n   transmission,
    or group the data prior to transmission to the i2rs\n   client.  This functionality
    is necessary to meet the requirements\n   i2rs enabled services which include
    service-layer routing\n   improvements, and control of traffic flows and exit
    points.\n\n   The information model is based on extensible information model for\n
    \  representing policies, for example, the Policy Core Information Model\n   (PCIM)
    (RFC3060), and an extension to this model to address the need\n   for QoS management,
    called the Quality of Service (QoS) Policy\n   Information Model (QPIM)(RFC3644).\n\n\t "

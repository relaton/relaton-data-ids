abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment Header\n
    \  without the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces.\n   Such
    packets typically result from hosts that have received an ICMPv6\n   \"Packet
    Too Big\" error message that advertises a \"Next-Hop MTU\"\n   smaller than 1280
    bytes, and are currently processed by some\n   implementations as \"fragmented
    traffic\".  Thus, by forging ICMPv6\n   \"Packet Too Big\" error messages an attacker
    can cause hosts to employ\n   \"atomic fragments\", and then launch any fragmentation-based
    attacks\n   against such traffic.  This document discusses the generation of the\n
    \  aforementioned \"atomic fragments\", the corresponding security\n   implications,
    and formally updates RFC 2460 and RFC 5722 such that\n   fragmentation-based attack
    vectors against traffic employing \"atomic\n   fragments\" are completely eliminated.\n\n\t "

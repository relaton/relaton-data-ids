  content: "This document describes a new application of the Telephony Routing\nover
    IP (TRIP) protocol. TRIP was engineered as a tool for inter-\ndomain exchange
    of telephone routing information. However, it can\nalso be used as a means for
    gateways and soft switches to export\ntheir routing information to a Location
    Server (LS), which may be\nco-resident with a proxy or gatekeeper. This LS can
    then manage those\ngateway resources. We discuss the motivations for this application,\nthe
    reasons why other mechanims, such as the SIP REGISTER method, are\nnot appropriate,
    and then show how a minimal subset of TRIP is needed\nfor this application.\n\t "

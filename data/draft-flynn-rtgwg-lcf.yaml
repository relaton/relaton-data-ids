  content: "   This Internet Draft describes the Limited Core Fix (LCF) multicast
    t \n   protocol for IP multicast routing.  Since the existing multicast \n   protocols
    rely on RFC 1112 as their foundation, multicast is \n   characterized by a host
    join attribute not involving knowledge by the \n   source.  Evolving uses of multicast
    may be seen to require joins on a \n   more qualified basis and may require knowledge
    of such joins by the \n   source.  An example,  is IP wireless multicast in which
    the source \n   (i.e., service provider) will want to charge for specific channels
    \n   (in the TV sense) and limit transmission to those hosts paying for \n   the
    service.  Other qualifications may be needed in providing high \n   quality broadband
    service.  Other examples for which a qualification-\n   based multicast could
    be developed include bandwidth needs, jitter or\n   latency requirements, or restrictions
    on who gets particular \n   transmissions.  In order to accommodate these requirements,
    or a \n   dynamic group membership for collaboration activities.  The \n   qualification-based
    multicast described in LCF uses a depth-first-\n   search technique to find new
    routes to a multicast source when \n   needed, an attribute that minimizes transmission
    bandwidth to update \n   the tree and utilizes tables significantly smaller than
    those of \n   normal multicast.  The draft discusses the notion of qualification-\n
    \  based multicast as a generalization of Quality-of-Service (QoS) \n   routing
    for multicast.  LCF can be used to build multicast trees in a \n   sparse-mode
    fashion and implements receiver-initiated multicast \n   repair for damaged multicast
    trees. \n\t "

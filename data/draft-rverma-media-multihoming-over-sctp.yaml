  content: "This document discusses the requirements and procedures to achieve the\nmultihoming
    of media for voice over IP sessions using the transport layer\nprotocol as signaling
    Control Transmission Protocol.\n\nMedia is an essential part of any voice over
    IP session. SIP (RFC 3261)\nis a text based signaling protocol and Multihoming
    using SIP can be\nachieved by using the SCTP as a transport protocol (RFC 4168),\ntherefore
    the application level resiliency can be guaranteed even in\ncase of any middle
    node or terminal failures. But any voice over IP or\nmultimedia session is nearly
    insignificant, if the media path is broken\nduring a call and is waiting for a
    timeout which further shall lead to a\ncall drop.A complete solution to Multihoming
    can be achieved if a system\nis capable of a performing the failovers  at both
    application and media\nplane and still maintaining the session irrespective of
    the application\nor media path failures or at least to detect a signaling or media
    path\nfailure and terminate the session rather than waiting for timeouts. The\nrequirement
    of Multihoming in media can also be derived from the fact\nthat in any voice,
    video or data session, the signaling and call setup\ntime use to be incomparably
    short than that of real media session at\nmedia plane. Therefore providing the
    resiliency at the signaling level\ndoes not provide the guaranteed and best effort
    service from a media\nsession point of view as not only signaling but media is
    an integral\npart of it.\n\n\t "

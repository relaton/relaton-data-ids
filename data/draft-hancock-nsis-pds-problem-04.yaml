abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The NSIS working group is currently developing a protocol suite for\n
    \  signalling which manipulates network state related to data flows.\n   The protocol
    design incorporates the constraint that the signalling\n   protocol will be processed
    on the nodes which also handle the data\n   flows themselves (\"path-coupled signalling\").
    \ This document\n   discusses a particular deployment mode for GIST (the common
    lower\n   layer of the NSIS protocol suite) which relaxes this constraint,\n   allowing
    the signalling and data paths to be partially decoupled,\n   without sacrificing
    the integration with routing (e.g. sensitivity to\n   route changes) which is
    intrinsically provided by the baseline path-\n   coupled solution.\n\n\t "

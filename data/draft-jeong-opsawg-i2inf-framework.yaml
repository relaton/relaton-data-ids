  content: "   This document specifies a framework to define Interface to In-Network\n
    \  Functions (I2INF) for user services both on the network-level and\n   application-level.
    \ In-Network Functions (INF) include In-Network\n   Computing Functions (INCF),
    defined in the context of Network\n   Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN).\n   INF also includes In-Network Application Functions (INAF)
    which\n   appear in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices, Software-\n
    \  Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).  This\n   document
    describes an I2INF framework, which includes components and\n   interfaces to
    configure and monitor the INFs that implement\n   applications and services.\n\n\t "

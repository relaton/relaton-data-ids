  content: "   This document proposes a fast authentication protocol called FPANA.\n
    \  A combination of PANA (for node authentication) and FMIP (for fast\n   handover),
    it offers fast node authentication upon intra-domain\n   handover of a mobile
    node.  Since FPANA makes use of context transfer\n   of the PANA session from
    the previous access router to the new access\n   router by the HI message of FMIPv6,
    the PANA session can be set\n   between the mobile node and the new access router
    prior to the mobile\n   node moving to the new access router.  Thus, the mobile
    node can\n   continue authenticated communication upon intra-domain fast handover.\n\t "

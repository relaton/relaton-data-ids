  content: "   The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [1] specifies a\n   mechanism
    that allows a source station (e.g., a host or a router) on\n   an NBMA subnetwork
    to find the NBMA subnetwork address address of a\n   destination station when
    the destination station is connected to the\n   NBMA subnetwork. For the case
    where the destination station is off\n   the NBMA subnetwork the mechanism described
    in [1] allows to\n   determine the NBMA subnetwork address of an egress router
    from the\n   NBMA subnetwork that is ``nearest'' to the destination station.  If\n
    \  used to locate an egress router wherein the destination station is\n   directly
    behind the egress router, the currently document NHRP\n   behaviors are sufficient.
    \ However, as documented elsewhere [2],\n   there are cases where if used between
    routers for generalized\n   transit, NHRP can produce loops.\n \n   This document
    describes extensions to the NBMA Next Hop Resolution\n   Protocol (NHRP) [1] that
    allow to acquire and maintain the\n   information about the egress router without
    constraining the\n   destination(s) to be directly connected to the egress router.\n\n\t "

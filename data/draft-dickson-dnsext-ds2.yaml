  content: "The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the DS\nresource
    record (RR) for authentication of zone delegations.  This\ndocument introduces
    an alternative resource record, DS2, which\nsimilarly provides authentication
    of zone delegations.  However, DS2\nprovides a canonical signer name, for zones
    whose content may be\nduplicated with multiple owner names.  The zone is signed
    by the\ncanonical signer, and the DS2 record allows for validation using this\nsigner
    name.\n\nAuthor's Note\n\t "

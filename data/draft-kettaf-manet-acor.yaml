  content: "   The Admission Control enabled On-demand Routing (ACOR) protocol is\n
    \  intended for use by MANETs.  It is a reactive routing protocol\n   designed
    to support quality of service (QoS) on the end to end route.\n   ACOR is based
    on simple local cost functions at each node, and global\n   cost function to represent
    the end-to-end cost of a route, in\n   addition to a simple admission control
    mechanism for implicit\n   resource reservation adapted to frequent changing of
    network\n   topology.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the DNSNR Resource Record (RR) for the\n   Non-Repudiation
    (NR) of Existence service in the context of the DNS\n   Security Extensions (DNSSEC).
    \ The DNSNR is an alternative to NSEC or\n   \"Authenticated Denial of Existence\"
    Resource Records.\n\n   A signed DNSNR RR protects security-aware DNS components
    against\n   false denial of existence of RRsets by providing the RR types that\n
    \  exist for its ownername, which optionally includes a\n   non-authoritative
    delegation point NS RR type.  Labels in the\n   ownername and the RDATA may be
    a hash-value as a defense against zone\n   traversal.\n\t "

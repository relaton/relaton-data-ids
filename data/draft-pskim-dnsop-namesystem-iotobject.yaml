  content: "   This draft suggests an object-centric naming system including name\n
    \  space and name resolution system for the IOT environment. A name\n   space
    is defined to cover diverse IOT objects. To consider\n   scalability and distributed
    architecture, the format of the name\n   space consists of object category, local
    name, domain name, and\n   parameters. Then, registries and servers are introduced
    to manage\n   mapping between identifier and object names with one-to-many\n   relationship.
    Then, name registration and resolution using these\n   registries and servers
    are described.\n\n\t "

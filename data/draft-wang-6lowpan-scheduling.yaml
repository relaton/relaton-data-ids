  content: "   These years, wireless technologies, including the application of\n
    \  6LoWPAN protocol, are more and more been applied in industrial\n   environment
    to improve productivity and safety of the plants. In\n   spite of the fact that
    [RFC4944] has introduced the methods of\n   transmitting IPv6 packets over IEEE
    802.15.4 networks, industrial\n   automation field, either process automation
    or factory automation,\n   has its special characteristics and requirements. If
    6LoWPAN is been\n   used in industrial environment, some change SHOULD be made
    in the\n   adaption layer. This document defines a Scheduling Header, to make\n
    \  the adaption layer meet the requirements of industrial scheduling for\n   transmission
    of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.\n   Additionally, this document also
    provides an application example of\n   Scheduling Header.\n\n\t "

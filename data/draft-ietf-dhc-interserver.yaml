- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The DHCP protocol is designed to allow for multiple DHCP servers, so that
    reliability of DHCP service can be improved through the use of redundant servers.
    \ To provide redundant service, multiple DHCP servers must carry the same information
    about assigned IP addresses and parameters; i.e., the servers must be configured
    with the same bindings.  Because DHCP servers may dynamically assign new addresses
    or configuration parameters, or extend the lease on an existing address assignment,
    the bindings on some servers may become out of date.  The DHCP inter-server protocol
    provides an automatic mechanism for synchronization of the bindings stored on
    a set of cooperating DHCP servers.  The underlying capabilities of the DHCP inter-server
    protocol required for multiple server cache replications are based upon the Server
    Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP).\n\t "

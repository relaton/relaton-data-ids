  content: "   Multicast communication can be enabled in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains\n
    \  by deploying MLD Proxy functions at Mobile Access Gateways and\n   multicast
    routing functions at Local Mobility Anchors, or by\n   additional route optimization
    schemes.  This document describes the\n   support of mobile multicast senders
    in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains that\n   is provided by this base deployment scenario,
    as well as in settings\n   of further optimization.  Mobile sources remain agnostic
    of multicast\n   mobility operations.\n\n\n\t "

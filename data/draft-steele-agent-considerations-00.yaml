  content: "   IETF specifications provide the basis for technical implementation
    in\n   several programming languages.  An IETF specification that provides\n   appropriate
    guidance to artificial intelligence (AI) agents, can\n   enable such agents to
    consume specifiction and generate code from it.\n   This documents defines the
    use of an Agent Consideration section that\n   is in support of code generation
    including the use of agentcards,\n   guidance on authorship, examples and their
    annotation for code\n   generation, as well as language specific guidance for
    the production\n   of media-types.  The Agent Consideration defined in this document
    can\n   be added to any Internet-Draft that includes normative language and\n
    \  sufficiant expressive examples derived from an included data model\n   and
    protocol interaction defintions.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Anecdotally, every IESG complains about the Area Director (AD)\n   workload,
    and says that it takes the first full term to understand\n   the job.  Empirically,
    the AD workload is high sometimes causing\n   backlogs in processing of Internet-Drafts
    and stressing the ADs.\n\n   After some discussions in the GENDISPATCH working
    group and arising\n   from an Internet-Draft postulating changes that might reduce
    the AD\n   workload, several ADs reported some data on how they spent their time\n
    \  in a few weeks chosen at random.  This document collates that data\n   and
    presents it for information.\n\n   This document does not attempt to draw any
    conclusions from the\n   limited data currently available, and there is no intention
    to\n   publish this document as an RFC.\n\n\t "

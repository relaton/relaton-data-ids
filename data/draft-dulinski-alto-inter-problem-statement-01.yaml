  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft considers an approach to the optimization of the traffic\n
    \  generated by the overlay (peer-to-peer) applications, where some\n   information
    on inter-AS (Autonomous System) paths is obtained with\n   the usage of dedicated
    communication scheme known as inter-ALTO\n   communication.\n\n   The large amount
    of network traffic generated by overlay applications\n   requires effective management.
    \ This traffic traverses inter-AS links\n   and thus generates substantial costs
    for the operators and poses\n   problems with overload on the external and internal
    links.  The\n   traffic is not time-stable as the peers connect and disconnect
    very\n   often.  Additionally, when the overlay traffic is observed on\n   inter-AS
    links, it can be seen that sources and destinations change\n   in a very short
    period of time.  The ALTO (Application-Layer Traffic\n   Optimization) service
    provides the information that enables more\n   efficient management of the overlay
    traffic.  Such applications can\n   use the information to perform better-than-random
    peer selection.\n   The ALTO servers are responsible for a pre-selection procedure;
    the\n   final selection is done by overlay clients and then the ALTO protocol\n
    \  conveys network information to applications.  To be credible, this\n   information
    should be as close to real network situation as possible.\n   However, some types
    of data are not hold by an operator, but they\n   should be gained on the basis
    of the additional information exchange\n   with other AS operators.  This document
    presents rationale for the\n   need of introduction of the inter-ALTO communication.\n\n\t "

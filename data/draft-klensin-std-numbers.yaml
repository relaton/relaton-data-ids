  content: "   STD numbers are assigned to IETF Standards Track specifications in\n
    \  order to provide a stable reference even when RFCs are revised and\n   the
    underlying documents change.  However, the numbers are only\n   assigned when
    the specifications reach Full Standard maturity level,\n   significantly reducing
    their utility in the contemporary world in\n   which few specifications advance
    beyond the first standardization\n   maturity level.  For that reason, one recent
    proposal suggested\n   eliminating the numbers entirely.  This document argues
    that stable\n   references for Standards Track specifications are actually useful
    and\n   that the solution is not to abolish the numbers but to change the\n   point
    at which they are assigned.\n\n\t "

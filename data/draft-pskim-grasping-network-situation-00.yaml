  content: "   In this draft, a mechanism to grasp the network situation is proposed\n
    \  for improving end-to-end path throughput. The proposed mechanism is\n   based
    on the active packet-train probing based estimation. The\n   proposed mechanism
    defines three cases of the difference between the\n   average output gap and the
    input gap, and then reflects fully them.\n   Since three cases are handled respectively
    by appropriate\n   corresponding manners, the proposed mechanism can be expected
    to\n   reduce the detection error for the turning point. Therefore, through\n
    \  the proposed mechanism, the available bandwidth can be estimated more\n   reliably.\n\n\t "

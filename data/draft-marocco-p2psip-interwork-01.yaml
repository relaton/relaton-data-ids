  content: "   This document describes how user agents registered in P2PSIP overlay\n
    \  networks can interwork with those in conventional SIP networks.\n   Communications
    between any two user agents will happen through the\n   SIP protocol and the location
    of SIP servers will follow the usual\n   procedures.  However, interworking in
    some environments may require\n   the support of additional elements; this document
    also describes such\n   elements and how to locate them in P2PSIP overlays.\n\n\t "

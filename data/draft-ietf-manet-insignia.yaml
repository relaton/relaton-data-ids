  content: "This document specifies INSIGNIA, an in-band signaling system for\nsupporting
    quality of service (QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. The\nterm `in-band signaling`
    refers to the fact that control information\nis carried along with data in IP
    packets. We argue that in-band\nsignaling is more suitable than explicit out-of-band
    approaches\n(e.g., RSVP) when supporting end-to-end quality of service in highly\ndynamic
    environments such as mobile ad hoc networks where network\ntopology, node connectivity
    and end-to-end quality of service are\nstrongly time-varying. INSIGNIA is designed
    to support the delivery\nof adaptive real-time services and includes fast\nsession/flow/microflow
    reservation, restoration and adaptation\nalgorithms between source/destination
    pairs. In this memo we discuss\nhow INSIGNIA fits into our broader vision of a
    wireless flow\nmanagement model for mobile ad hoc networks and how it interfaces
    to\nthe proposed MANET Working Group routing algorithm.\n\n\t "

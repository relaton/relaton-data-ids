  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a mechanism, the 4rd address mapping, for\n
    \  service providers to offer residual deployment of the IPv4 service\n   across
    IPv6-only domains.  Ease of operation and scalability are due\n   to this address
    mapping being stateless (no per customer states).\n   IPv4 address sharing is
    based on exclusive port sets assigned to\n   customers, these sets being algorithmically
    derived from bits used as\n   port-set identifiers.  Features include support
    of shared IPv4\n   addresses, same routes for IPv4 as for IPv6, and compatibility
    with\n   both provider aggregatable and provider-independent IPv4 prefixes.\n
    \  The whole 4rd address mapping or part of it can be used combined with\n   various
    tunneling and double-translation methods.  It can also be\n   used either alone
    or in parallel with stateful mechanisms used for\n   their flexibility where necessary.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Many real world problems require implementing and deploying\n   cryptography
    as part of the solution.  In general, there is no single\n   standard or set of
    requirements by which applications determine what\n   type of cryptographic solution
    is best for their problem.  Different\n   applications and deployments can lead
    to varying tradeoffs in\n   computation, memory, network, and bandwidth properties
    of a solution.\n   Moreover, practical aspects of modern software engineering,\n
    \  especially around long-term maintenance costs, may influence what\n   type
    of cryptographic solutions are deployed in practice.  This\n   document attempts
    to cover different factors that influence what type\n   of cryptography is deployed
    in practice with the goal of helping\n   cryptographic researchers navigate the
    tradeoffs and assumptions made\n   in new and emerging work.\n\n\t "

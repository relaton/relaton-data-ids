  content: "   Solely technical measures advertised to allow for the age\n   verification
    of minors online face fundamental challenges on a\n   conceptual and implementation
    level.  Organizational measures, on the\n   other hand, have been established
    as best practices by peer groups\n   who are both high risk and digitally savvy,
    which exists to protect\n   minors.  These approaches can be strengthened via
    technical measures,\n   and two such candidates are the Qualified Website Authentication\n
    \  Certificates (QWACS), introduced by the EU as part of eIDAS 2.0\n   [QWACS]
    and potentially the work of IETF's digital emblems working\n   group [DIEM].\n\n
    \  Based on early analysis of the use and abuse cases as well as privacy\n   and
    security considerations, we provide arguments why non-scaling\n   organizational
    measures are a necessity and strengthening these with\n   technical measures is
    a way to enable the security for minors online.\n\n\t "

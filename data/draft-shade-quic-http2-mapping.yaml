abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable\n
    \  in a transport for HTTP/2, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream\n   flow
    control, and low-latency connection establishment.  This\n   document describes
    a mapping of HTTP/2 semantics over QUIC.\n   Specifically, this document identifies
    HTTP/2 features that are\n   subsumed by QUIC, and describes how the other features
    can be\n   implemented atop QUIC.\n\n\t "

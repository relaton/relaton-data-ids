- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The IETF's Transport and Services Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized\n
    \  experimental RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput\n   (L4S)
    and new Non-Queue-Building (NQB) per hop behavior.  These\n   documents describe
    a new architecture and protocol for deploying low\n   latency networking.  Since
    deployment decisions are left to\n   implementers, this document explores some
    of the implications of\n   those decisions and makes suggestions that can help
    drive adoption\n   and acceptance of L4S and NQB based on observations from the
    world's\n   first large scale deployment.\n\n\t "

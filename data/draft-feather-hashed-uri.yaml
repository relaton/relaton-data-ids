  content: "There are situations where it is desirable to determine whether two\nURIs
    are identical without revealing the value of one or the other if\nthey are not.
    For example, the publisher of filtering software may want\nto provide a set of
    URLs to be filtered without identifying the actual\nresources in question.\n\nThis
    problem has traditionally been done using cryptographically\nsecure hashes. The
    two items are both hashed and the resulting values\nthen compared. If they are
    equal it can be assumed that the two original\nitems were equal as well; if not,
    the hash does not reveal anything\nabout the original item. This technique is
    eminently suitable for this\nsituation.\n\nThis document describes a 'hashed'
    URI naming scheme for representing\nthe hashed form of a URI [RFC2396] as another
    URI.\n\n\t "

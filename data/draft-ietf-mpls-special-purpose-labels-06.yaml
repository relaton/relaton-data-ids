  script: Latn
  content: "Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes. A block of
    labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end; these labels are commonly called
    \"reserved labels\". They will be called \"special-purpose labels\" in this document.\n\n
    As there are only 16 of these special-purpose labels, caution is needed in the
    allocation of new special-purpose labels; yet, at the same time, forward progress
    should be allowed when one is called for.\n\n This memo defines new procedures
    for the allocation and retirement of special-purpose labels, as well as a method
    to extend the special-purpose label space and a description of how to handle extended
    special-purpose labels in the data plane. Finally, this memo renames the IANA
    registry for special-purpose labels to \"Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\" and
    creates a new registry called the \"Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\"
    registry.\n\n This document updates a number of previous RFCs that use the term
    \"reserved label\". Specifically, this document updates RFCs 3032, 3038, 3209,
    3811, 4182, 4928, 5331, 5586, 5921, 5960, 6391, 6478, and 6790.\n\t "

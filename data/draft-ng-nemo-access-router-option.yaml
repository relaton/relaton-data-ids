  content: "Through the establishment of bi-directional tunnels between a mobile \nrouter
    and home agent, global connectivity can be extended to nodes \nwithin a network
    in motion.  However, the multiple levels of bi-\ndirectional tunnels in nested
    mobile networks lead to undesirable \neffects.  This memo proposes using a new
    mobility header option \ncalled the Access Router Option to allow a mobile router
    to inform \nits home agent the home-address of the access router it is currently
    \nattached to.  From there, this memo lays out a mechanism that allows \nmobile
    routers to securely achieve nested tunnels optimization.\n\t "

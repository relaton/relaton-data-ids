  content: "This mechanism is useful in SIP networks that provide layer 2/layer \n\n3
    connectivity through different access technologies.  \n\nThis document defines
    the private SIP extension header P-Access-\n\nNetwork-Info. SIP User Agents may
    use this header to relay \n\ninformation about the access technology to serving
    proxies in their \n\nhome network. The serving proxy may then use this information
    to \n\noptimize services for the UA. For example, a 3GPP terminal uses this \n\nheader
    to pass information about the access network such as radio \n\naccess technology
    and cell ID to its home service provider.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>With the rapid development of large model technologies in the AI field,
    it has become possible to develop more intelligent assistant software, which is
    currently referred to as AI Agents in the industry. These agents may come from
    different manufacturers and be deployed on different cloud platforms and regions.
    They need to communicate and collaborate with each other through the Internet,
    which is called Internet of Agents (IoA). Different interactions of AI agents
    have varying task requirements, which also lead to different demands on the network.
    This requires network providing various fine granular services for the interactions
    of AI agents. This document proposes the application of the APN framework in the
    IoA scenario and analyzes its necessity.</p>"

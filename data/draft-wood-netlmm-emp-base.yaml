  content: "This document specifies a protocol for localized mobility management \nwhich
    allows the mobile node to keep using the same IP address while \nit is in the
    same localized mobility management domain. The protocol \nenables the edge mobility
    anchor point to manage the routing path for \nthe mobile node in the domain, so
    that the packet form the \ncorrespondent node can be delivered to the access router
    of MN \ncurrently connecting. For routing path management, the protocol also \nspecifies
    the functionality of the access router to provide the MN's \nIP address, MN identifier
    to edge mobility anchor point. The protocol \ndoes not require the mobile node
    to involve in the mobility \nmanagement if link layer technology can provide MN
    related \ninformation necessary for this protocol.  \n\t "

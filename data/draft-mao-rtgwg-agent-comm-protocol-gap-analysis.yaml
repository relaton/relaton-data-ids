abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of large language models (LLM), AI Agent software
    continues to emerge. AI agents deployed on different network devices need to collaborate
    to accomplish some complex tasks, such as network measurement and network troubleshooting.
    This collaboration requires cross-device communication between AI agents. The
    cross-device communication framework is defined in [I-D.mzsg-rtgwg-agent-cross-device-comm-framework].
    This document describes whether some classical protocols in networking area, and
    some popular ones in AI Agent area can be used for the cross-device interaction
    of the AI agents in network devices, and analyzes the gaps.</p>"

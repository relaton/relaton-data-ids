  content: "   With the development of large language models (LLM), AI Agent\n   software
    continues to emerge.  AI agents deployed on different\n   network devices need
    to collaborate to accomplish some complex tasks,\n   such as network measurement
    and network troubleshooting.  This\n   collaboration requires cross-device communication
    between AI agents.\n   The cross-device communication framework is defined in\n
    \  [I-D.mzsg-rtgwg-agent-cross-device-comm-framework].\n\n   This document describes
    whether some classical protocols in\n   networking area, and some popular ones
    in AI Agent area can be used\n   for the cross-device interaction of the AI agents
    in network devices,\n   and analyzes the gaps.\n\n\t "

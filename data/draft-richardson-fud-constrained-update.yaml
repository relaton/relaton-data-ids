- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document details the problems of upgrading small devices that\n
    \  need complete firmware replacements, but which do not have enough\n   storage
    to keep an entire copy of the replacement image.  In addition\n   to detailing
    the specific challenge, a conceptual architecture for a\n   solution is posited
    involving use of DTLS session resumption tickets\n   with CoAP Block Transfer
    mode.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the Elliptic Curve Data Protocol (ECDP), a\n
    \  peer-to-peer (P2P) communication protocol tailored for decentralized\n   networks.
    \ ECDP utilizes elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for\n   encryption, employs
    the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\n   (ECDSA) for message authentication,
    and leverages the Diffie-Hellman\n   key exchange using elliptic curves for secure
    session initialization.\n   The protocol supports a variety of elliptic curves
    (e.g., secp256k1,\n   secp384r1) with varying key sizes, and is designed to operate
    over\n   both TCP and UDP.  Additionally, it utilizes SHA-256 or SHA-512 for\n
    \  cryptographic hash verification to ensure message integrity.\n\n\t "

  content: "RObust Header Compression (ROHC), RFC 3095, defines a framework for \nheader
    compression, along with a number of compression protocols \n(profiles). This document
    seeks to add support for two issues to basic \nRoHC profiles, (a) the ability
    to handle reordering and (b) avoid extra \nheader overhead when IP-ID is a constant
    value. The first issue can be \nsupported by making the value of p (which is part
    of the RoHC \ninterpretation interval) configurable. The second issue is already
    \nsupported in the IP Profile of RoHC (RFC 3843). The discussion of this \nIP-ID
    issue in the current document merely replicates the discussion in\nRFC 3843 regarding
    constant IP-ID.\n\t "

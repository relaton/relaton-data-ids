  content: "   This document describes the control plane of the path-aware, inter-\n
    \  domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and\n   Isolation
    On Next-generation networks).  One of the basic\n   characteristics of SCION is
    that it gives path control to SCION-\n   capable endpoints.  In fact, endpoints
    can choose between multiple\n   path options, enabling the optimization of network
    paths.  The SCION\n   control plane is responsible for discovering these paths
    and making\n   them available to the endpoints.\n\n   The main goal of SCION's
    control plane is to create and manage path\n   segments, which can then be combined
    into forwarding paths to\n   transmit packets in the data plane.  This document
    first discusses\n   how path exploration is realized through beaconing and how
    path\n   segments are created and registered.  Each SCION autonomous system\n
    \  (AS) can register segments according to its own policy - it is free\n   to
    specify which path properties and algorithm(s) to use in the\n   selection procedure.
    \ The document then describes the path lookup\n   process, where endpoints obtain
    path segments - a fundamental\n   building block for the construction of end-to-end
    paths.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the applicability of Fast Handovers for  \nMobile
    IPv6 in 802.11 networks. Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 \nproposes a set of protocol
    enhancements to reduce handover latency \ndue to IP protocol operations as small
    as possible by the help of L2    \ninformation. 802.11 networks are considered
    as a popular wireless   \ninfrastructure to meet broadband network service requirement
    in the   \nfuture. If Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 is applied to wireless   \nnetwork,
    802.11 might be a practicable target for deployment. At   \nthis point some Fast
    Handover methods for Mobile IPv6 are thought to \nbe directly applicable to 802.11
    networks and some others are not. \n   \n\t "

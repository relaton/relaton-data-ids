  content: "   The IETF specifies several algorithms operating in the data plane of\n
    \  a network node, including liveliness detection, congestion control,\n   network
    measurement, security, and load balancing.  Such algorithms\n   are commonly specified
    using English or flow charts.  As an\n   alternative, this document proposes that
    P4 programs can be used to\n   specify some data plane algorithms.  P4 is a programming
    language\n   created in 2014 to program the data plane of network nodes such as\n
    \  switches, routers, smartNICs, and generic compute targets.\n\n\t "

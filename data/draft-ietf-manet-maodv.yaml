  content: "The multicast operation of the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector\n(AODV)
    routing protocol (MAODV) is intended for use by mobile nodes\nin an ad hoc network.
    \ It offers quick adaptation to dynamic link\nconditions, low processing and memory
    overhead, and low network\nutilization.  It creates bi-directional shared multicast
    trees\nconnecting multicast sources and receivers.  These multicast trees\nare
    maintained as long as group members exist within the connected\nportion of the
    network.  Each multicast group has a group leader\nwhose responsibility is maintaining
    the group sequence number, which\nis used to ensure freshness of routing information.\n\n\n\n\t "

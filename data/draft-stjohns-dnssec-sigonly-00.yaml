  content: "\n   Work on the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)( [RFC4033] et al) has\n
    \  been in progress for close to 15 years and DNSSEC is still not\n   \"mature\"
    enough to be considered complete.  A substantial issue is\n   the complexity of
    the system.  This document describes a simplified\n   version of DNSSEC that can
    co-exist with the current protocols, but\n   with characteristics such that the
    author believes it can be\n   implemented and deployed with much less effort.\n\n\t "

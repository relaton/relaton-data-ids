  content: "   Multihoming to upstream ISPs is a requirement today for most networks\n
    \  in the Internet. The most common motivation to multihome is for\n   reliable,
    non-stop access to the Internet. However, Multihoming\n   creates scaling problems
    for the global routing infrastructure by\n   making route aggregation more difficult
    for multihomed networks.\n   Multihoming also complicates the addressing scheme
    used by the\n   network. Another requirement for multihomed networks is the ability\n
    \  to load balance traffic between the multiple links to upstream ISPs.\n   This
    requirement is difficult to fulfill for traffic flow in both\n   directions as
    the multihomed network has no control over the return\n   path of the packet.\n\n\t "

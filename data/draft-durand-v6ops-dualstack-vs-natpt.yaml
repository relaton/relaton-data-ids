- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Outside of the IETF community, lot of people think that IPv4 to IPv6\ntransition
    consist merely at solving the problem of how does a v4 box\ncommunicate with a
    v6 box and vice versa.  Within the IETF, the dual\nstack approach has long been
    defined.  There is an ongoing discussion\nto understand if translation with tools
    like [NAT-PT] is absolutly\nneeded to enable IPv6 nodes to communicate with an
    IPv4 node or if we\ncan/should mandate IPv6 nodes to also deploy an IPv4 stack
    if/when\nthey needs to communicate with IPv4 nodes.  This draft is aimed at\nclarifying
    the discussion without taking side by studying in 3 cases\nthe implications of
    mandating a dual-stack versus the implications of\ndeploying a translation device.\n\t "

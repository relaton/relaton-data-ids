  content: "Summoning emergency help by the public is a core feature of telephone\n
    \  networks.  This document describes a framework of how various IETF\n   protocols
    are combined to place emergency calls.  This includes how\n   these calls are
    routed to the correct Public Safety Answering Point\n   (PSAP) based on the physical
    location of the caller, while providing\n   the call taker the necessary information
    to dispatch a first\n   responder to that location.  This document explains how
    location\n   mapping, call identification and end system behavior are combined
    to\n   allow multimedia emergency calls.  It describes at a high level how\n   the
    pieces (recognizing a call as an emergency call, marking it as\n   such, determining
    the location of the caller, routing the call based\n   on location) go together,
    and references the Internet standards that\n   define the details of these mechanisms.\n\t "

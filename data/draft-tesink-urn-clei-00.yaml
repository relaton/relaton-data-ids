  content: "This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace (RFC 3406)
    for the assignment of the Common Language Equipment Identifier (CLEI) code, which
    is used in messages standardized by ANSI.  The URN namespace is managed by Telcordia
    Technologies, Inc., as the maintenance agent for ANSI T1.213.  The CLEI code is
    a globally unique, ten-character alphanumeric intelligent code assigned by Telcordia
    Technologies at the request of equipment suppliers.  The CLEI code identifies
    communications equipment by specifying product type and features.  There is a
    one-to-one relationship between a CLEI code and supplier's product ID (the manufacturer's
    name and the part number along with its version number).  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   GMPLS protocol enabled network operator to setup optical path network\n
    \  rapidly and dynamically.  Recently, WSON [8] is standardized to\n   achieve
    WDM core network.  However, it is difficult that all network\n   equipment supports
    WSON protocol.  Therefore, interoperability\n   between WSON and non-WSON nodes
    is needed to construct path network.\n\n   This document describes requirement
    for interoperability between WSON\n   node and non-WSON nodes and functions that
    routing and signaling\n   protocol should support.\n\n\t "

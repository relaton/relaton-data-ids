abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes how the Internet arrived at its current connectivity
    equilibrium. It does not propose new mechanisms or assign fault, but instead examines
    a series of historically contingent, locally rational adaptations (particularly
    the adoption of default-deny security boundaries alongside the pressures of global
    scaling) that collectively shaped today's reliance on higher-layer compensatory
    mechanisms. It clarifies how sustained operational triage and successful adaptation
    deferred reconsideration of endpoint semantics, and why the accumulated effects
    of those decisions are now observable at Internet scale.</p>"

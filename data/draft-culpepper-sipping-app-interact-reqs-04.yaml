  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines the high level requirements for a framework \nand/or
    one or more mechanisms that support user interaction, via \nSIP-based user agents,
    with applications residing on remote network \nservers.  The requirements in this
    document address the overall \nfeatures of such a system, without regard to its
    architecture. \n    \nSIP currently supports media-based application interactions
    using \nmethods such as speech, video and end-to-end telephony-related \ntones;
    however, it is desired that more general application \ninteraction models are
    defined, especially those that are not \nrestricted to the media plane.  In addition,
    it is desired that an \napplication be able to present the user with application-specific
    \nuser interfaces and information.  The user agent should also be able \nto generate
    activity indications back to an application to \ncommunicate actions on physical
    or logical user interfaces.  The \ndocument also defines a number of topic-related
    terms to assist in \ndisambiguating discussions of the issues. \n\t "

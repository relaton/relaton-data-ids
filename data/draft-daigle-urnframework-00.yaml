  script: Latn
  content: "The main purpose of URNs is to serve as persistent resource identifiers,
    where each URN may potentially need to be usable for several decades.  A primary
    goal of the URN framework is to provide a mechanism whereby a URN can be resolvable
    for many decades, while still allowing the resolution services for that URN to
    be provided by the parties responsible for maintenance of the information about
    that URN.  The Uniform Resource Name framework abstract description is proposed
    as a means of handling URN identifiers in modular layers of information management.
    \ From the standpoint of the bearer of a URN, this means that much of the underlying
    support for a given URN or collection may change without disrupting the identification
    capacities of the URN.\n\t "

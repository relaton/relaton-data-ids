  content: "This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation \nProtocol
    (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks \n(also known as enterprise
    networks) for calls that undergo diversion. \nSIP is an Internet application-layer
    control (signalling) protocol \nfor creating, modifying, and terminating sessions
    with one or more\nparticipants. These sessions include, in particular, telephone
    calls. \nQSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating
    \ncircuit-switched calls, in particular telephone calls, within Private \nIntegrated
    Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number \nof Ecma Standards and
    published also as ISO/IEC standards. \n\t "

  content: "Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private\nnetworking
    capabilities. One very popular use of VPNs is to provide\ntele-commuter access
    to the corporate Intranet.  Today NATs are widely\ndeployed in home gateways,
    as well as in other locations likely to be\nused by tele-commuters, such as hotels.
    The result is that IPsec-NAT\nincompatibilities have become a major barrier to
    deployment of IPsec in\none of its principal uses. This draft describes known
    incompatibilities\nbetween NAT and IPsec, and describes the requirements for addressing\nthem.\n\t "

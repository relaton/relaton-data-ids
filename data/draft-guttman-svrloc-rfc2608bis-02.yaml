  content: "The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the\ndiscovery
    and selection of network services.  Using this protocol,\ncomputers using the
    Internet need little or no static configuration\nof network services for network
    based applications.  This is\nespecially important as computers become more portable,
    and users\nless tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system\nadministration.
    \ This document updates SLPv2, adding clarifications\nand removing features which
    were neither widely implemented or deemed\nuseful.\n\t "

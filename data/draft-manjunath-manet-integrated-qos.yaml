  content: "Meeting the agreed service quality in a mobile ad hoc network \nis tough
    and addressed in [RFC1677]. A mechanism is provided \nin [RFC2501]. In this draft,
    usage of an integrated algorithm \nis described. The fading RF channels introduce
    the harmful \nself-similarity in to the traffic. To counter the same, another
    \nself-similar controlling mechanism may be inserted for the better \nwireless
    network performance and optimal resource utilization. \n\t "

  content: "   Today, a BGP speaker can advertise one nexthop for a set of NLRIs in\n
    \  an Update.  This nexthop can be encoded in either the BGP-Nexthop\n   attribute
    (code 3), or inside the MP_REACH attribute (code 14).\n\n   For cases where multiple
    nexthops need to be advertised, BGP-Addpath\n   is used.  Though Addpath allows
    basic ability to advertise multiple-\n   nexthops, it does not allow the sender
    to specify desired\n   relationship between the multiple nexthops being advertised
    e.g.,\n   relative-preference, type of load-balancing.  These are local\n   decisions
    at the receiving speaker based on local configuration and\n   path-selection between
    the various additional-paths, which may tie-\n   break on some arbitrary step
    like Router-Id or BGP nexthop address.\n\n   Some scenarios with a BGP-free core
    may benefit from having a\n   mechanism, where egress-node can signal multiple-nexthops
    along with\n   their relationship, in one BGP route, to ingress nodes.  This\n
    \  document defines a new BGP attribute \"MultiNexthop (MNH)\" that can be\n   used
    for this purpose.\n\n   This attribute can be used for both labeled and unlabled
    BGP\n   families.  The MNH can be used to advertise MPLS label along with\n   nexthop
    for unlabeled families (e.g.  Inet Unicast, Inet6 Unicast).\n   Such that, mechanisms
    at the transport layer can work uniformly on\n   labeled and unlabled BGP families.
    \ Service route scale can be\n   confined closer to the service edge nodes, making
    the transport layer\n   nodes light and nimble.  They dont have any service route
    state, only\n   have service end-point state.\n\n   The MNH plays different role
    in \"downstream allocation\" scenario than\n   \"upstream allocation\" scenario.
    \ E.g. for [RFC8277] families that\n   advertise downstream allocated labels,
    the MNH can play the \"Label\n   Descriptor\" role, describing the forwarding
    semantics of the label\n   being advertised.  This can be useful in network visualization
    and\n   controller based traffic engineering (e.g.  EPE).\n\n\n\t "

  content: "20\n  This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet\n21\n
    \ electronic mail transport.  It consolidates, updates, and clarifies\n22\n  several
    previous documents, making all or parts of most of them\n23\n  obsolete.  It covers
    the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices\n24\n  for the contemporary Internet,
    but does not provide details about\n25\n  particular extensions.  Although SMTP
    was designed as a mail\n26\n  transport and delivery protocol, this specification
    also contains\n27\n  information that is important to its use as a \"mail submission\"\n28\n
    \ protocol for \"split-UA\" (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile\n29\n
    \ environments.\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n58  Internet-Draft\n\n

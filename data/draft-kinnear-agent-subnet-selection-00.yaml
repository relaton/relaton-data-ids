  content: "In RFC2131, the giaddr specifies both the subnet on which a DHCP\nclient
    resides as well as an IP address which can be used to\ncommunicate with the relay
    agent.  The subnet selection option allows\nthese functions of the giaddr to be
    split so that when one entity is\nperforming as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the
    subnet from which to\nallocate an IP address which is different from the IP address
    with\nwhich it desires to communicate with the DHCP server.\n\t "

  content: "   Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that\n
    \  are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service\n   provider.
    \ Often, these sets of resources are referred to as \"Web\n   Services\" or \"Web
    APIs\".  This specification defines link relations\n   for representing relationships
    from those resources to ones that\n   provide documentation or descriptions of
    the Web services.  The\n   difference between these concepts is that documentation
    is primarily\n   intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily\n
    \  intended for automated consumers.  It also defines a link relation to\n   identify
    a status resource that is used to represent operational\n   information about
    a service's status.\n\n\t "

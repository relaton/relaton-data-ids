  content: "   IPsec/ESP has been designed to secure IP packets exchanged between\n
    \  two nodes.  IPsec implements security at the IP layer which makes\n   security
    transparent to the applications, as opposed to TLS or DTLS\n   that requires application
    to implement TLS/DTLS.  As a result, IPsec\n   enable to define the security rules
    in a similar way one establishes\n   firewall rules.\n\n   One of the IPsec's
    drawbacks is that implementing security on a per\n   packet basis adds overhead
    to each IP packet.  Considering IoT\n   devices, the data transmitted over an
    IP packet is expected to be\n   rather small, and the cost of sending extra bytes
    is so high that\n   IPsec/ESP can hardly be used for IoT as it is currently defined
    in\n   RFC 4303.\n\n   This document defines Diet-ESP, a protocol that compress
    and reduce\n   the ESP overhead of IPsec/ESP so that it can fit security and energy\n
    \  efficient IoT requirements.  Diet-ESP use already existing mechanism\n   like
    IKEv2 to negotiate the compression format.  Furthermore a lot of\n   information,
    already existing for an IPsec Security Association, are\n   reused to offer light
    negotiation in addition to maximum compression.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a method to detect link failures which relies\n
    \  solely on Ethernet data plane.  An ordinary Ethernet frame can be\n   modified
    and sent back to sender to signal a loss of connection.  No\n   control plane
    protocol is utilized in the process which makes the\n   method very simple and
    fast to react.\n\n\t "

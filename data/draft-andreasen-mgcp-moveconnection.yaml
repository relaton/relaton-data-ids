  content: "This document defines a Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) \npackage
    containing the MoveConnection command which was originally \nproposed in RFC 2705
    [4]. The MoveConnection command can move an \nMGCP connection from one endpoint
    in a media gateway to another \nendpoint in the same gateway. This can be very
    useful in order to \nsupport redirection of media streams across endpoints in
    a media \ngateway. \n\t "

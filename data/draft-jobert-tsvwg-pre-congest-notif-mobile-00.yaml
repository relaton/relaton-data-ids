  content: "   Mobile networks may be divided into two main segments: the radio\n
    \  segment, and the wireline segment. This document highlights that the\n   algorithms
    leading to pre-congestion notification (e.g. ECN marking)\n   are usually significantly
    different for these two segments, and not\n   defined or documented in general
    over the radio segment. It also\n   explains that using ECN bits leads to having
    a unique signal for\n   notifying a pre-congestion related to two separate segments
    with\n   very different notification algorithms. Some consequences are\n   questioned,
    as well as the potential benefits of being able to\n   identify where the congestion
    comes from. This document finally\n   discusses the possibility to take into account
    the radio conditions\n   of the terminals when counting the volume of congestion
    over the\n   radio segment.\n\n\t "

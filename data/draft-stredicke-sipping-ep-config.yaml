  content: "Mass deployment of SIP compliant devices requires a simple mechanism \nfor
    configuring and maintaining them. For the economical success of \nSIP based devices
    on a large scale, a platform independent mechanism \nfor finding and exchanging
    the required information is vital. The \ngoal of this draft is to reduce the amount
    of effort required for \nadministrators to provision devices. This draft focuses
    on defining \na common data set to configure SIP end points. The mechanism for
    \nproviding and maintaining the configuration data to the end point is \ndefined
    elsewhere [7].\n\t "

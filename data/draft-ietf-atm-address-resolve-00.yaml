  content: "This memo describes a method  (called Partial Resolution Method) for resolving
    IP addresses to ATM addresses.  It does not specify a particular Address Resolution
    Protocol.  In fact, any server-based address resolution protocol can be used in
    conjunction with the method described in this document.  The Partial Resolution
    Method attempts to reduce the number of round trips needed for ATM address resolution
    and subsequent connection establishment by taking advantage of the ATM signalling
    protocol.\n\t "

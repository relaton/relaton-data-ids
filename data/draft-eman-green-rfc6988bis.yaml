  content: "   This document defines requirements for standards specifications for\n
    \  Energy Management, taking RFC6988 as a starting point.  Eleven years\n   after
    the RFC 6988 publication, this document re-evaluates the\n   requirements.  The
    requirements defined in this document are\n   concerned with discovery f unctions,
    monitoring functions as well as\n   control functions.  Discovery functions include
    identifying energy-\n   managed network, devices and their components, discovery
    of inventory\n   of power components capabilities, optimization control capabilities,\n
    \  nominal condition use.  Monitoring functions include monitoring their\n   Power
    States, Power Attributes, energy consumption, network\n   performance, energy
    efficiency metrics.  Control functions include\n   such functions as controlling
    energy saving and optimization\n   functions and Power State of energy-managed
    devices and their\n   components.\n\n   This document does not specify the features
    that must be implemented\n   by compliant implementations but rather lists features
    that must be\n   supported by standards for Energy efficiency Management.\n\n

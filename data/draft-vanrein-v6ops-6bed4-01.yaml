  content: "   The intention of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications, even on\n
    \  IPv4-only networks.  A specific area of concern is that of peer-to-\n   peer
    protocols such as SIP or document exchange during a chat\n   session.  Such protocols
    are designed to run in any environment,\n   which means that they cannot rely
    on IPv6 for themselves, or their\n   peers.  The 6bed4 tunnel mechanism ensures
    that IPv6 can be assumed\n   on all peers, without a need to configure it explicitly.\n\n
    \  The 6bed4 mechanism is meant as a fallback mechanism for IPv6\n   connectivity
    on networks that do not support it natively, by running\n   a tunnel over UDP
    and IPv4.  The IPv4 address is used to support\n   traceability of the traffic
    originator, which means that no user\n   account or other configuration is needed.\n\n
    \  The tunnel mechanism builds on existing IPv6 mechanisms; it employs\n   Stateless
    Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to setup an IPv6\n   address on a 6bed4 Peer,
    and Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] to find the\n   most direct route to a remote
    6bed4 Peer.\n\n\n\t "

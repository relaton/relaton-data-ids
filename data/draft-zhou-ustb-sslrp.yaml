  content: "The Secure and Scalable Location Routing Protocol (SSLRP) is a secure\n
    \ and distributed routing protocol designed for ad hoc networks of\n  mobile nodes
    with location information. Commonly, each node\n  acquires its own geographic
    position using a mechanism such as the\n  Global Position System (GPS).\n  \n
    \ The SSLRP addresses each node using the hybrid of its multi-level\n  hierarchical
    address and unique identifier at the moment of network \n  initialization.\n  \n
    \ Certain measures were adopted to ensure security of the network.\n\t "

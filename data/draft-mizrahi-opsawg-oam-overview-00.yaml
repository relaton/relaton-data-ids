  content: "Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term\nthat
    refers to detecting and reporting link failures. OAM mechanisms\nhave been defined
    for various layers in the protocol stack, and are\nused with a variety of protocols.\n\nThis
    document presents an overview of the OAM mechanisms that have\nbeen defined and
    are currently being defined by the IETF, as well as\na comparison to other OAM
    mechanisms that have been defined by the\nIEEE and ITU-T.\n\t "

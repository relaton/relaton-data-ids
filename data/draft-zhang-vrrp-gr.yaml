  content: "Many existing routers enable their data planes to keep forwarding\ndata
    packets during the restart of their control plains.  This\nfunctionality is called
    \"graceful restart\" or \"non-stop forwarding\".\nA router supporting graceful
    restart is able to provide more reliable\npacket forwarding service during system
    maintaining procedures and\nsoftware-error recoveries.  This informational document
    analyzes the\nissues with enhancing VRRP to support graceful restart and introduces\nseveral
    candidate solutions.\n\t "

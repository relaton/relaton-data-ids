  content: "   This document defines DomainAuth, a protocol to attribute digital\n
    \  signatures to domain names in such a way that verification can occur\n   entirely
    offline without a prior distribution of public keys.\n\n   Each signature is distributed
    as part of a self-contained \"signature\n   bundle\" that encapsulates a complete
    chain of trust comprising: (1) a\n   DNSSEC chain from the root zone to a TXT
    record containing a public\n   key or its digest, (2) an X.509 certificate chain
    from the key\n   specified in the TXT record to the final signing key, and (3)
    the\n   digital signature in the form of a CMS SignedData structure.\n\n   Finally,
    signatures can be attributed to the domain name itself (e.g.\n   \"example.com\")
    or specific users (e.g. \"alice\" of \"example.com\").\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks (also known as enterprise
    networks).  SIP is an Internet application-layer control (signalling) protocol
    for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants.
    \ These sessions include, in particular, telephone calls.  QSIG is a signalling
    protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating circuit-switched calls (in particular,
    telephone calls) within Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs).  QSIG is
    specified in a number of Ecma Standards and published also as ISO/IEC standards.
    \ This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a header compression scheme for IPv6, IPv6/\n
    \  UDP based on static contexts.  This technique is especially tailored\n   for
    LPWA networks and could be extended to other protocol stacks.\n\n   During the
    IETF history several compression mechanisms have been\n   proposed.  First mechanisms,
    such as RoHC, are using a context to\n   store header field values and send smaller
    incremental differences on\n   the link.  Values in the context evolve dynamically
    with information\n   contained in the compressed header.  The challenge is to
    maintain\n   sender's and receiver's contexts synchronized even with packet\n
    \  losses.  Based on the fact that IPv6 contains only static fields,\n   6LoWPAN
    developed an efficient context-free compression mechanisms,\n   allowing better
    flexibility and performance.\n\n   The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
    combines the advantages\n   of RoHC context which offers a great level of flexibility
    in the\n   processing of fields, and 6LoWPAN behavior to elide fields that are\n
    \  known from the other side.  Static context means that values in the\n   context
    field do not change during the transmission, avoiding complex\n   resynchronization
    mechanisms, incompatible with LPWA characteristics.\n   In most of the cases,
    IPv6/UDP headers are reduced to a small\n   identifier.\n\n   This document focuses
    on IPv6/UDP headers compression, but the\n   mechanism can be applied to other
    protocols such as CoAP.  It will be\n   described in a separate document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The IETF's CAPWAP working group has documented various product\n   architectures
    and has categorized the Centralized WLAN Architectures\n   into two main buckets:
    Split and Local MAC.  While the document\n   contains very relevant and useful
    information, what it does is list\n   the architectural variants of these two
    buckets, but does not\n   unambiguously define either the Split MAC or Local MAC
    architectures.\n   In order for CAPWAP to be successful, it is crucial for the
    protocol\n   evaluation team, and the working group, to agree on unambiguous\n
    \  terminology to describe these architectures.\n\n   This document proposes terminology
    to unambiguously describe the\n   relevant architectures found in the taxonomy
    document, for the\n   purpose of initiating a discussion within the working group
    and to\n   allow the protocol evaluation work to come to a fruitful conclusion.\n
    \  We conclude in this document that the architectures are very similar\n   and
    could be supported via a single protocol.\n\t "

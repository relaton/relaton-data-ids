  content: "NFSv4 [RFC3530] contains within it a mechanism for the delegation of\nfile
    data to a client.  The intent of this feature is to reduce the\nnecessary interaction
    between a client and server such that overall\nperformance is improved.  The same
    type of mechanism does not exist\nfor directory contents and to determine validity
    of cached directory\ncontents an NFSv4 client is left with polling the server
    to determine\nif updates have occurred.\nThe proposal described here is for an
    NFSv4 minor version that would\nallow a client to register interest in a directory
    and to receive a\ncallback RPC upon update of that directory.  This type of interaction\nwould
    reduce or eliminate the polling that occurs between client and\nserver and improve
    scalability of the server's resources along with\nimproved performance for the
    client's directory content caching.\n\n\t "

  content: "MultiProtocol-BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of Network Layer\nprotocols
    to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may\nbelong is determined by
    the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the\nSubsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI).  The current AFI/SAFI\ndefinitions for the IPv4 address family only have
    provisions for\nadvertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol
    when\nadvertising an IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or\na
    VPN-IPv4 NLRI.  This document specifies the extensions necessary to\nallow advertising
    an IPv4 NLRI or a VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop\naddress that belongs to the IPv6
    protocol.  This comprises an\nextension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the
    address of the\nNext Hop for an IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the
    IPv6\nprotocol, the encoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which of\nthe
    protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP\nCapability allowing
    MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they\ncan exchange IPv4 NLRI and
    VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   [RFC4379] describes the LSP Ping mechanism to detect data plane\n   failures.
    \ In some deployment scenario for the LSP traceroute, a\n   replying LSR may not
    have the available route to the initiator, and\n   the echo reply message sent
    to the initiator would be discarded.\n   Thus, the basic idea of traceroute procedure
    to localize fault could\n   not be achieved.  This document describes extensions
    to LSP Ping\n   mechanism to enable the replying LSR to have the capability to
    relay\n   the echo reply by a set of routable intermediate nodes to the\n   initiator.\n\n\t "

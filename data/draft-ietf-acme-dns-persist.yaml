  content: "   This document specifies \"dns-persist-01\", a new validation method
    for\n   the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol.\n   This
    method allows a Certification Authority (CA) to verify control\n   over a domain
    by confirming the presence of a persistent DNS TXT\n   record containing CA and
    account identification information.  This\n   method is particularly suited for
    environments where traditional\n   challenge methods are impractical, such as
    IoT deployments, multi-\n   tenant platforms, and scenarios requiring batch certificate\n
    \  operations.  The validation method is designed with a strong focus on\n   security
    and robustness, incorporating widely adopted industry best\n   practices for persistent
    domain control validation.  This design aims\n   to make it suitable for Certification
    Authorities operating under\n   various policy environments, including those that
    align with the CA/\n   Browser Forum Baseline Requirements.\n\n\t "

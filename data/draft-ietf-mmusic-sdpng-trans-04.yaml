  content: "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is today widely used in the\nInternet
    to announce as well as negotiate multimedia sessions and\nexchange capabilities.
    \ Having originally been designed for session\nannouncements only, as opposed
    to announcements and capabilities\nnegotiation announcements, native SDP lacks
    numerous features to be\napplicable in many session scenarios.  Numerous extensions
    have been\ndeveloped to circumvent SDP's shortcomings -- but they have also\nrepeatedly
    shown its inherent limitations.  A successor protocol --\ntermed 'SDPng' for the
    time being -- is developed to address the\naforementioned needs of Internet applications
    in a more structured\nmanner.  With the huge installed base of SDP-based applications,
    a\nmigration path needs to be developed to move from SDP to SDPng over\ntime.
    \ This document outlines how this migration can be achieved: in\ngeneral as well
    as for the various IETF control protocols that\npotentially make use of SDP and
    SDPng.\n\t "

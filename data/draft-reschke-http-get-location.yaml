abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Several hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) extensions use methods\nother
    than GET to expose information.  This has the drawback that\nthis kind of information
    is harder to identify (missing a URL to\nwhich a GET request could be applied)
    and to cache.\n\nThis document specifies a simple extension header through which
    a\nserver can advertise a substitute URL that an HTTP client\nsubsequently can
    use with the GET method.\n\t "

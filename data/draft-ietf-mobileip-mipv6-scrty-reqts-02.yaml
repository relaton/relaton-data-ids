  content: "The IESG returned the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) draft to the working group\ndue
    to concerns about the security and scalability of binding updates\n(BUs) sent
    to correspondent nodes and the associated IPsec processing\nthat is specified
    in the draft. Since that time discussions have\ncontinued to attempt to define
    what is really needed to make binding\nupdates secure while taking into consideration
    the aspect of\nscalability as well as the fact that IPsec may not be the most\nsuitable
    security mechanism for securing BUs between MNs and CNs.\n\t "

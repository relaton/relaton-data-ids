  content: "   One of the main questions posed during recent discussions on\n   distributed
    mobility architectures is if the distributed architecture\n   can have advantages
    in terms of costs with respect to a centralized\n   one.\n\n   This draft describes
    a general method to calculate the costs of the\n   centralized and distributed
    scenarios.  Even if a simplified model\n   has been used, some information can
    be earned.  Each operator can use\n   this model and his own costs to discover
    the optimal architecture\n   based on traffic observed in the network.\n\n\t "

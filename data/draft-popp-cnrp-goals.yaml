  content: "This document establishes the context and goals for a Common Name\nResolution
    Protocol. It defines the terminology used concerning a\n'Common Name' and how
    one might be 'resolved', and establishes the\ndistinction between 'resolution'
    and more elaborate search\nmechanisms. It establishes some expected contexts for
    use of Common\nName Resolution, and the criteria for evaluating a successful\nprotocol.
    It also analyzes the various motivations that would cause\nservices to provide
    Common Name resolution for both public, private\nand commercial use.\n\t "

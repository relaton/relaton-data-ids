  content: "The purpose of this document is to propose a protocol called Telephony\nTunneling
    Protocol (TTP) to tunnel one or more plain old telephone\nsystem (POTS) connections
    between two Internet hosts.  The hosts may\nhave one or more telephones connected
    directly to them or may receive\ncalls from the local Public Switched Telephone
    Network (PSTN).  The\nInternet hosts are connected via two or more TCP connections
    (one for\ncontrol and each of the others for one channel of voice traffic).\nThis
    document makes no specification for sending Signaling System 7\n(SS7) or other
    PSTN control commands through the control connection,\nthough such commands may
    be outlined in other documents.\nComments are solicited and should be sent to
    the author, Michael Ross\n<rossmi@attbi.com>\n\t "

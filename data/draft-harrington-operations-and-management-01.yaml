  content: "   New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with due\n   consideration
    of operations and management issues related to the\n   protocol.  Retrofitting
    operations and management recommendations to\n   protocols is sub-optimal.  The
    purpose of this document is to provide\n   guidance to authors of protocol documents
    about aspects to consider\n   related to the operations and management that should
    be considered\n   for inclusion in documents defining requirements or functionality
    of\n   new protocols or protocol extensions.\n\n\t "

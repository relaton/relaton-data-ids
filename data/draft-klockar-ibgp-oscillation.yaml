  content: "   This memo presents a technique for preventing oscillations in I-BGP.\n
    \  The idea is to utilize already known data in routers to stop\n   oscillation.
    \ This builds on the fact that routers can send implicit\n   and explicit withdrawals.
    \ Implicit withdrawals are redefined to mean\n   that the route still exist and
    explicit withdrawal to mean that the\n   route has disappeared.  The router can
    detect and avoid oscillation\n   by storing the implicit withdrawn routes and
    using them to rule out\n   other routes.  The cost is more cheap memory for the
    RIB-In but no\n   extra expensive memory is needed in the forwarding table.\n\t "

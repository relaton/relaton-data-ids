    manufacturers whose products have built-in location-\n   tracking capabilities.
    \ By following these requirements and\n   recommendations, a location-tracking
    accessory will be compatible\n   with unwanted tracking detection and alerts on
    mobile platforms.\n   This is an important capability for improving the privacy
    and safety\n   of individuals in the circumstance that those accessories are used
    to\n   track their location without their knowledge or consent.\n\n\t "

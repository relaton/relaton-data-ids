  content: "   In this memo we describe a simple scheme for configuration and\n   provisioning
    of an 802.16 network so that it emulates a broadcast\n   network that uses the
    802.3 packet format.  We briefly describe how\n   this network supports IPv4 and
    IPv6 services in a manner similar to\n   other broadcast media (eg. ethernet).
    \ Finally, we review some\n   architectural issues behind the choice of broadcast
    network emulation\n   and examine alternative approaches to supporting IP over
    802.16.  We\n   additionally describe some possible system optimizations to reduce\n
    \  consumption of air resources.\n\t "

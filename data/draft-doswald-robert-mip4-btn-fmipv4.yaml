- language: en

  content: "Proposed fast handover solutions for Mobile IPv4 depend on the\npresence
    of Foreign Agents (FA) in the networks between which the\nMobile Node (MN) moves
    to ensure their operation.  However, in many\nsituations the MN moves into networks
    without FAs.  This document\nproposes a solution that includes fast handover mechanisms
    involving\na direct connection to the Home Agent (HA).  This solution is not a\nfull
    fledged fast handover proposal, but rather a complement to RFC\n4881: Low-Latency
    Handovers in Mobile IPv4, and RFC 4988: Mobile IPv4\nFast Handover.\n\t "

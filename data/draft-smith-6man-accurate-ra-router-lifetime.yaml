  content: "   IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) have a \"Router Lifetime\" field,\n
    \  which specifies how long the advertising router will act as a default\n   router
    for the receiving hosts, unless refreshed with another\n   advertisement.  The
    field name \"Router Lifetime\" is quite general,\n   and could easily be misunderstood
    to mean the bounded lifetime of all\n   of the information contained in the RA.
    \ This memo more accurately\n   renames this field \"Default Router Lifetime\".\n\n\t "

  content: "In the year following the publication of the PPPoE protocol much\noperational
    experience and customer feedback was gathered. One\nproblem that access providers
    usually mention is that when PPPoE \nServer needs to send IP multicast packets
    or broadcast packets to \nPPPoE Clients in a same Ethernet, it has to send these
    packets to \neach PPPoE Client over each PPPoE link. Because the PPPoE Clients
    \nare all in a Ethernet, this multiplication of packets affects \nperformance
    and wastes the net's resource.\n\n\n\t "

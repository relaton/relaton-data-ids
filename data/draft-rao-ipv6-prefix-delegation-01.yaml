  content: "   The currently proposed solution for IPv6 Prefix Delegation is based\n
    \  on DHCPv6 protocol.  We believe that in certain network topologies\n   and
    configurations where the CPE routers may not be capable or\n   configured to use
    DHCPv6 and hence can not utilize the currently\n   proposed DHCPv6 based ipv6
    prefix delegation procedure.  Therefore an\n   alternate ipv6 prefix delegation
    procedure that does not require or\n   depend on the DHCPv6 protocol is needed.\n\n
    \  This document proposes an ICMPv6 based prefix delegation (PD)\n   mechanism
    which is in conformance with RFC 3769 that describes the\n   requirements for
    IPv6 prefix delegation.  This proposal involves\n   using the Router Solicitation
    (RS) message for the prefix request and\n   the Router Advertisement(RA) message
    for the prefix delegation.\n\n   A new flag called P-flag (bit 0 of the reserved
    field) is defined to\n   indicate that the RS message includes a PD request.  RS
    messages with\n   PD request can now include PIO option(s) to carry PD information
    such\n   as prefix preference(s) or PD parameters such as lease etc.\n\n   It
    also proposes defining a new flag called D-flag (reserved bit 26)\n   of the PIO
    option to indicate the presence of PD specific PIO in RS\n   and RA messages.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes several examples of applications requiring\nauthorization.
    \ Each application is described in terms of a\nconsistent framework, and specific
    authorization requirements of each\napplication are given.  This material was
    not contributed by the\nworking groups responsible for the applications and should
    not be\nconsidered prescriptive for how the applications will meet their\nauthorization
    needs.  Rather the intent is to explore the fundamental\nneeds of a variety of
    different applications with the view of\ncompiling a set of requirements that
    an authorization protocol will\nneed to meet in order to be generally useful.\n\t "

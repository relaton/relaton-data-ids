  content: "   A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses local forwarding\n
    \  table to select the upstream PIM neighbor towards the source or\n   Rendezvous
    Point (RP).  A router need to choose one upstream PIM\n   neighbor from the list
    of PIM neighbors if the route for a source or\n   RP is an Equal Cost Multipath
    (ECMP) route.  Currently PIM routers\n   use vendor specific algorithm to choose
    one neighbor.  This may lead\n   to unnecessary wastage of network resources.
    \ This draft first\n   explains the need for a standard algorithm to select a
    PIM neighbor\n   with ECMP route and then suggest such an algorithm.\n\n\n\t "

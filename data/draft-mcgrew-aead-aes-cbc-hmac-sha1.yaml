  content: "This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption with\nadditional
    authenticated data (AEAD) that are based on the\ncomposition of the Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) in the Cipher\nBlock Chaining (CBC) mode of operation for encryption,
    and the HMAC-\nSHA1 message authentication code (MAC).  It also separately defines
    a\ngeneric composition method that can be used with other MACs and\nrandomized
    ciphers (that is, ciphers that use random initialization\nvectors).\n\nThese algorithms
    are randomized, and thus are suitable for use with\napplications that cannot provide
    distinct nonces to each invocation\nof the AEAD encrypt operation.\n\t "

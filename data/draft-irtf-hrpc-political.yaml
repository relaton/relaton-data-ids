  content: "   The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be used on\n
    \  networks, but the standards development process in the IETF does have\n   an
    impact on society through its normative standards setting process.\n   This document
    aims to bring about a better understanding on the\n   political nature of standards
    and protocols.  Among other things, the\n   IETF's work affects what is perceived
    as technologically possible and\n   useful where networking technologies are being
    deployed, and its\n   standards reflect what is considered by the technical community
    to be\n   feasible and good practice.  Whereas there might not be agreement\n
    \  among the Internet protocol community on the specific political\n   nature
    of the technological development process and its outputs, it\n   is generally
    agreed that standards and protocols are both products of\n   a political process,
    and they can also be used for political means.\n\n\t "

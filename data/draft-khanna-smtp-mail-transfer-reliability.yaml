  content: "This draft discusses the issue which makes the data tranfer in SMTP \nprotocol
    highly vulnerable to a 'resend' in case of a network \ndisruption. We then discuss
    a means by which such a 'resend' can be \navoided, by tranferring mail data only
    from the point of disruption.\n\n\t "

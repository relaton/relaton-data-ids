  content: "   A nanogrid is a very small electricity domain that is distinct from\n
    \  any other grid it is connected to in voltage, reliability, quality,\n   or
    price.  Nanogrids could form the basis of a future electricity\n   system built
    on a bottom-up, decentralized, and distributed network\n   model rather than the
    top-down centralized grid we have today in most\n   parts of the world.  This
    document introduces the idea of a nanogrid\n   to the IETF community for two purposes
    -- to inform the work on\n   energy management presently underway in the EMAN
    working group, and\n   to describe how future communications within and between
    grids could\n   be accomplished with protocols that are the product of the IETF.\n
    \  There appears to be no fundamental conflict between the nanogrid\n   concept
    and the current drafts in the EMAN working group.\n\n\t "

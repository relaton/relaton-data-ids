abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight protocol
    designed to be used in machine-to-machine applications. This memo describes challenges
    associated with securing CoAP and proposes a new security model that the authors
    believe is suitable for these environments. The model requires minimal amount
    of configuration, but still provides strong security and is a natural fit with
    the typical communication practices smart object networking environments. This
    memo also proposes JSON payload format extensions to support the architecture.</p>"

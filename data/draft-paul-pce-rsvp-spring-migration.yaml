  content: "   In a SDN environment, path computation element protocol(PCEP)\n   (RFC
    5440) is used between a controller and the network devices,\n   using which controller
    can setup and tear down Resource ReserVation\n   Protocol (RSVP) based label switched
    paths(LSPs) in the network\n   having Path Computation Client (PCC) as Label Switched
    Router (LSR).\n   Draft draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing extends PCEP specification\n
    \  in order to support setup and teardown of Segment Routing(SR) Label\n   Switched
    Path(LSR). In a mixed environment where some of the LSPs are\n   setup using PCEP
    use RSVP and some LSPs are based on Segment\n   routing(SR). The specifications
    lacks a method to advertise the\n   LSP preferenace to use one type of LSP over
    other when those are\n   setup using PCEP. This draft defines a method to advertise
    the\n   preference for any LSP which is setup using PCEP.\n\n   This document
    proposes new optional TLV that can be used to announce\n   the preference of LSP
    which is being setup using PCEP.\n\n\t "

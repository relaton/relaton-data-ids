  content: "EAP is a lower layer dependant protocol that has 802.1X and PANA to\ncarry
    it over link layer and network layer respectively. 802.1X\ncannot go through any
    nodes, while PANA can carry EAP through the\nnetwork over network layer. 802.1X
    is popular on legacy terminals,\nbut it is painful to upgrade all these terminals
    to support PANA.\nThis document introduces a PANA interworking function that enables\nlegacy
    802.1X terminals get authentication and access to PANA network\nwithout upgrading
    its software or hardware.\n\t "

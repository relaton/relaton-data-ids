  content: "The Source Routing-based Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is designed to \nprovide
    multicast functionality in mobile ad hoc networks. It applies\nthe source routing
    mechanism defined by the Dynamic Source Routing \n(DSR) [1] in a modified manner
    decreasing the size of the packet\nheader. SRMP obtains multicast routes on-demand
    through constructing\na mesh (an arbitrary subnet) to connect group members providing
    \nrobustness against mobility.\n\t "

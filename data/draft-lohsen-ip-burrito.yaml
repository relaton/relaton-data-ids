  content: "   IP over Burrito Carriers describes an experimental method for the \n
    \  creation of edible data packets. This standard is intended to be \n   implemented
    in metropolitan area networks due to the preexisting\n   burrito delivery infrastructure.
    While currently only flour tortillas\n   have been found acceptable for encapsulating
    the data contained in \n   the packet, tests are underway to determine the viability
    of using \n   corn tortillas. One must be wary of disreputable IP over Burrito
    \n   service providers as packet corruption and bad data handling can \n   result
    in damage to the receiving unit and may result in an extremely\n   messy packet
    rejection. Conveniently, there is a rating system \n   already in place. While
    the rating by the health department doesn't \n   ensure proper data encapsulation,
    it does allow the end user to \n   determine if the service provider's quality
    to cost ratio is \n   adequate. This is an experimental standard, not a recommended
    \n   standard.\n\t "

  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation,\nmodification,
    and termination of media sessions between user agents.\nThese sessions are managed
    by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIP\nrelationship between a pair of user agents.
    Because dialogs are\nbetween pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party\ncommunications
    (such as a phone call), is obvious. Communications\nsessions with multiple participants,
    generally known as conferencing,\nare more complicated. This document defines
    a framework for how such\nconferencing can occur. This framework describes the
    overall\narchitecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for multi-\nparty
    conferencing.\n\n\t "

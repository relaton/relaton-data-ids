- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   With 4K technology, we can get more details compared to traditional\n
    \  HD screens of the same size.  However, 4K content increases the\n   demand
    for higher network throughput, which poses a big challenge for\n   delivering
    4K content by TCP.  This document proposes a target\n   throughput based method
    for increasing TCP's congestion window\n   (cwnd).  Experimental results show
    that the proposed method can reach\n   the required throughput much more rapidly
    than traditional TCP\n   congestion algorithms, such as Reno, Cubic.  Moreover,
    this method\n   prevents cwnd from increasing when cwnd reaching to the required\n
    \  throughput.\n\n\n\t "

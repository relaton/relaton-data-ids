  content: "   Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused on \n   environments
    covering Circuit oriented LSPs (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.) \n   and IP/MPLS Packet
    switched networks. However, there is minimal \n   documentation on GMPLS support
    of Layer-2 Label Switched Paths (L2 \n   LSPs), e.g. native Ethernet LSPs, Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode (ATM) \n   LSPs and Frame Relay (FR) LSPs. This document provides
    a framework \n   for GMPLS in support of L2 LSPs in several network environments,
    in \n   particular, Ethernet.  \n\t "

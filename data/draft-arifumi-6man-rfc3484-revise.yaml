  content: "RFC 3484 has several known issues to be fixed.  Deprecation of IPv6\nsite-local
    unicast address and the coming of ULA brought some\npreferable changes to the
    rules.  Additionally, the rule 9 of the\ndestination address selection rules,
    namely the longest matching\nrule, is known for its adverse effect on the round
    robin DNS\ntechnique.  This document covers these points to be fixed and\nproposes
    possible useful changes to be included in the revision of\nRFC 3484.\n\t "

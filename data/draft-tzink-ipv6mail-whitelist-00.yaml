  content: "   This document contains a plan for how providers of email services\n
    \  can manage the problem of email abuse over IPv6. Spammers can\n   send mail
    from a very large range of IPv6 addresses, and this will\n   make current antispam
    technology less effective.  This is because\n   email receivers will have to maintain
    excessively large lists\n   of IP blocklists which either consume too many resources,
    or will\n   become stale and therefore ineffective as spammers quickly\n   discard
    one IP and move onto the next one.  This document recommends\n   that during the
    interim  transition of email from IPv4 to IPv6,\n   email receivers implement
    a whitelisting option where they only\n   allow email from permitted senders over
    IPv6 and reject mail\n   from everyone else sending email over IPv6.\n\n\n\t "

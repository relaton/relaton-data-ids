  content: "   There is a need, for relatively simple and scaleable methods of\n   providing
    \ differentiated classes of service for IP traffic over\n   various WAN media,
    to support different types of applications and\n   specific business requirements.
    The Differentiated Services approach\n   to providing quality of service (QoS)
    in Networks, employs a small,\n   well-defined set of building blocks from which
    a variety of services\n   may be built. A small bit-pattern in each packet in
    the IPv4 ''TOS\n   octet'' or in the IPv6 ''Traffic Class octet'' is used to mark
    a  packet\n   to receive a differentiated forwarding treatment or per-hop behavior\n
    \  at each network node. IETF Working Groups will standardize a common\n   layout
    for both octets, called the ''DS byte'' superseding the IPv4 TOS\n   octet definitions
    or RFC 1349 [1].\n \n   The goal of this contribution is to suggest how the Next
    Hop\n   Resolution Protocol (NHRP) may be extended and deployed in\n   conjunction
    with the IP ToS octet (DS-Byte) to create both\n   differentiated forwarding and
    differentiated class of service over\n   an NBMA network such as ATM or Frame-Relay.\n\n
    \  In the proposed solution, any SVC created between the same two points\n   in
    an NBMA network will be used bi-directionally by traffic with the\n   same class
    of service.  This is achieved by extending the scope of\n   the existing NHRP
    protocol to include QoS information in the\n   extensions part of both the NHRP
    resolution request and resolution\n   reply, and by implementing a NBMA addressing
    scheme that dynamically\n   maps CoS, to subaddresses that are unique within the
    NBMA network.\n \n   The proposal is compliant with the NHRP specifications, and
    every\n   effort is made by the proposal to build on the work currently\n   underway
    within the IETF that is attempting to standardize on the\n   use of the ToS octet
    (DS-byte) within the IP datagram.\n\n\t "

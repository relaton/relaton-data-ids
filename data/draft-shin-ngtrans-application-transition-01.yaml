  content: "The document specifies application aspects of IPv6 transition. As\nIPv6
    is deployed, there are some problems that the application\ndevelopers and the
    administrators face.  This draft clarifies the\nproblems occurred in transition
    periods between IPv4 applications\nand IPv6 applications. It also propose guidelines
    to implement and\nchoose the suitable application under the various transition\nenvironments.
    \ This document does not try to define any new\nprotocol.  The proposals contained
    in this document are based on\nthe work of the Ngtrans working group.\n\n\n\t "

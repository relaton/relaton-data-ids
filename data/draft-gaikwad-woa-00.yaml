  content: "   This document defines the Web of Agents (WoA), a minimal JSON based\n
    \  description format and invocation convention that allows HTTP hosts\n   to
    advertise AI agents and for clients to invoke those agents in a\n   uniform way.
    \ A WoA document is typically served from a well known\n   location on an HTTP
    origin and uses JSON Schema to describe agent\n   inputs and outputs.  WoA does
    not define a discovery protocol itself\n   but is designed to be used as a host
    level primitive by higher level\n   discovery systems.\n\n\t "

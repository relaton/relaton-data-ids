  content: "   Ultra-Low Latency is a highly desired property for many types of\n
    \  services, such as 5G MTC (Machine Type Communication) requiring\n   E2E connection
    for V2V to be less than 2ms, AR/VR requiring delay\n   less than 5ms, V2X less
    than 20ms, etc.\n\n   This draft examines the E2E latency from architectural\n
    \  perspective, from studying how different OSI layers contribute to\n   E2E latency,
    how different domains, which can be different\n   operators' domains or administrative
    domains, contribute to E2E\n   latency, to analyzing the gaps of recent technology
    advancement\n   in reducing latency.\n\n   By studying the contributing factors
    to E2E latency from various\n   angles, the draft identifies some gaps of recent
    technology\n   advancement for E2E services traversing multiple domains and\n
    \  involving multiple layers. The discussion might touch upon\n   multiple IETF
    areas.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for\nmultiple
    authentication methods.  One such method is Generic Token\nCard (EAP-GTC) which,
    despite its name, is commonly used to support\nauthentication using cleartext
    passwords in tunneled EAP methods.\nEAP-GTC does not provide the ability to change
    a password (for\nexample, an expired password), however.  This document defines
    the\nPassWord Change EAP method (EAP-PWC) in order to fill that void in\nfunctionality.\n\t "

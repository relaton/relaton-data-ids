abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a normative framework for evaluating the admissibility
    of speech acts produced by autonomous agents in goal- directed activity. The framework
    establishes rules for determining whether an agent's statement is admissible based
    on its modality (assertive, conditional, refusal, descriptive) and its grounding
    state, independent of semantic truth. This framework enables deterministic, auditable
    evaluation of agent contributions without requiring truth verification or semantic
    interpretation.</p>"

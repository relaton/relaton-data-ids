  content: "   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected\n
    \  content type for Forwarding Commitments (FCs) objects used in\n   Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  An FC is a digitally\n   signed object that
    provides a means of verifying whether an IP\n   address block is received from
    AS a to AS b and announced from AS b\n   to AS c.  When validated, an FC's eContent
    can be used for the\n   detection and mitigation of route hijacking, especially
    providing\n   protection for the AS_PATH attribute in BGP-UPDATE.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a framework for the use of the Certificate\n
    \  Transparency (CT) protocol for publicly logging the existence of\n   Secure
    Telephone Identity (STI) certificates as they are issued or\n   observed, in a
    manner that allows anyone to audit STI certification\n   authority (CA) activity
    and notice the issuance of suspect\n   certificates as well as to audit the certificate
    logs themselves.\n   The intent is establish a level of trust in the STI eco-system
    that\n   verification of calls would required and refuse to honor STI\n   certificates
    that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing STI CAs\n   to add all issued
    certificates to the logs, establishing trust that\n   STI certificates are unique
    to the authorized provider or assignee of\n   a telephone number resource.  The
    primary role of certificate\n   transparency in the STI ecosystem is the avoidance
    of issuance of\n   unauthorized or duplicate provider level certificates or, of\n
    \  particular importance, telephone number level delegate certificates.\n   This
    provides a robust mechanism for the detection of unauthorized\n   creation of
    certificate credentials for illegitimate spoofing of\n   telephone numbers.\n\n\t "

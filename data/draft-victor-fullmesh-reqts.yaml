    using baseline Session Initiation Protocol. Primary \nrequirement is to advertise
    conference members’ addresses to new \nparticipants by concatenating multiple
    SDP session descriptions \ntogether. This particular requirement can solve several
    well-known \nproblems, including disjoint meshes and race conditions, that are
    \nlingering in full-mesh conferencing for a while now. \n\t "

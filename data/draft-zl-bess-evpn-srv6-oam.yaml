abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 9489 describes Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
    mechanisms for detecting data plane failures using Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping
    in MPLS-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) networks. However, there is no effective OAM
    mechanism for detecting data plane failures in SRv6-based EVPN networks. This
    document proposals OAM mechanisms for SRv6-based EVPN networks.</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 9489 describes Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)\n
    \  mechanisms for detecting data plane failures using Label Switched\n   Path
    (LSP) Ping in MPLS-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) networks.  However,\n   there is
    no effective OAM mechanism for detecting data plane failures\n   in SRv6-based
    EVPN networks.  This document proposals OAM mechanisms\n   for SRv6-based EVPN
    networks.\n\n\t "

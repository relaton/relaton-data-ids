  content: "   This document specifies an extension to the JSON Meta Application\n
    \  Protocol (JMAP) for Mail to enable sharing of mailboxes between\n   users.
    \ Building upon the JMAP Sharing framework defined in\n   [RFC9670], this specification
    extends the Mailbox data type defined\n   in [RFC8621] with properties necessary
    to configure and manage access\n   permissions for shared mailboxes.  The extension
    introduces a new\n   capability that indicates server support for mailbox sharing
    and\n   defines the additional properties required to share mailboxes with\n   other
    principals, including the ability to control which users may\n   access a mailbox
    and what permissions they possess.\n\n\t "

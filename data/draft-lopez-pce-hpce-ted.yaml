  content: "   The PCE architecture is well-defined and may be used to compute the\n
    \  optimal path for LSPS across domains in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks.\n   The
    Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) [RFC6805] was\n   developed to provide
    an optimal path when the sequence of domains is\n   not known in advance.  The
    procedure and mechanism for populating the\n   Traffic Engineering Database (TED)
    with domain topology and link\n   information used in H-PCE-based path computations
    is open to\n   interpretation.  This informational document describes how topology\n
    \  dissemination mechanisms may be used to provide TE information\n   between
    Parent and Child PCEs (within the H-PCE context).  In\n   particular, it describes
    how BGP-LS might be used to provide inter-\n   domain connectivity.  This document
    is not intended to define new\n   extensions, it demonstrates how existing procedures
    and mechanisms\n   may be used.\n\n\t "

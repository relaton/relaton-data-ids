  content: "Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the\nestablishment
    of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\nIn that role, they define
    and impact policies on call routing,\nrendezvous, and other call features. However,
    there is no standard\nmeans by which network elements can have any influence on
    session\npolicies, such as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc and\nnon-conformant
    techniques have been deployed to allow for such\nsession policy mechanisms. In
    this document, we discuss a complete\nand standards-based mechanism for session
    policies.\n\t "

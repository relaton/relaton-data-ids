  content: "In this document we consider the problem of key management in a\nmobile
    wireless networking environment, such as a dynamic, dis-\ntributed setting in
    which command and control nodes move along with\nindividual users.  In this scenario,
    data must be securely multicast\nfrom one source to many users, requiring that
    users be properly\nkeyed.\n\t "

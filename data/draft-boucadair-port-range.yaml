  content: "This memo proposes a solution, based on fractional addresses, to face\nthe
    IPv4 public address exhaustion.  It details the solution and\npresents a mock-up
    implementation, with the results of tests that\nvalidate the concept.  It also
    describes architectures and how\nfractional addresses are used to overcome the
    IPv4 address shortage.\nA comparison with the alternative Carrier-Grade NAT (CG-NAT)\nsolutions
    is also elaborated in the document.  The IPv6 variant of\nthis solution is described
    in a companion draft.\n\t "

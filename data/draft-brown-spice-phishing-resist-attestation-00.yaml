abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces a phishing-resistant phone number attestation
    mechanism for multi-factor authentication (MFA). Conceptually similar to WebAuthn,
    it uses origin-bound cryptographic challenges to ensure that users only attest
    ownership of their phone numbers to legitimate relying parties. The protocol leverages
    network-operator- issued verifiable credentials (VCs) that cryptographically bind
    phone number ownership to a user's device. Applications present origin- scoped
    challenges that users sign using their VC, ensuring secure, domain-specific authentication
    and mitigating replay, relay, and phishing attacks- without relying on SMS-based
    one-time passwords (OTPs).</p>"

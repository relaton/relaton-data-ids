abstract:
- content: "<p>As requested in the Beijing meeting, this is an individual draft that
    expands on the usage tier/volume use case from [McDysan]. The feedback recorded
    in the Beijing conex meeting minutes was that a number of people were potentially
    interested in this use case, but that it was out of scope of the current charter,
    and/or could potentially be built out of the conex abstract mechanism.</p>"

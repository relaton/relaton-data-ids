  content: "   This document describes a notional research agenda for collaborative\n
    \  multi-stakeholder research related to a future post-quantum DNSSEC\n   ecosystem.
    \ It is inspired by the anticipation that adoption of Post-\n   Quantum signature
    algorithms will have enough operational impact on\n   DNSSEC that either DNS protocol
    enhancements will be needed, or DNS\n   will move away from UDP as the prevalent
    DNS transport, or a\n   combination of both will be needed.  Some members of the
    DNS\n   technical community have even suggested evaluating alternatives to\n   DNSSEC
    and potentially adopting an alternative protocol or practices\n   to assure the
    integrity of DNS responses.  Given the potential impact\n   of such changes on
    the DNS ecosystem, the authors believe\n   collaborative multi-stakeholder research
    into the impact of proposed\n   changes should be performed to inform adoption
    and standardization\n   activities.\n\n\t "

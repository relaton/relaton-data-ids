- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Dynamic Policy Controllers like resource and admission control\n   systems
    need to be able to locate media receivers in each segment of\n   the network to
    determine the path of the media flows prior to\n   allowing or rejecting the session
    setup.  This is fine as long as\n   this is handled within an operator's network
    but limited when\n   extending this to home network.  Current definitions of SDP
    are not\n   clear about conveying a local identifier (e.g., a private IP address)\n
    \  of the client that is destined to receive media streams after\n   successful
    SDP negotiation.  In this draft we outline the need for\n   carrying such information
    over SDP and discuss a set of possible\n   solutions in a scenario with a home
    network and a operator network\n   domain.\n\n\t "

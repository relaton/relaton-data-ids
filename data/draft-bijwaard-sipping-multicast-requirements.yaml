  content: "   Multicast support in the Offer/Answer Model for SDP is mainly\n   focussed
    on receiving and not on sending multicast streams, it\n   assumes usage of the
    service announcement protocol for multicast\n   sessions which is hardly in use.
    \ In this document requirements are\n   described to enable multicast sessions
    with a group of users,\n   switching session parts between unicast and multicast,
    and sessions\n   containing both unicast and multicast streams.\n\n\t "

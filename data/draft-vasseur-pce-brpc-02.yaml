  content: "The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering (TE)\nLabel
    Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\nand Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (where\na domain is referred to
    as a collection of network elements within a\ncommon sphere of address management
    or path computational\nresponsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems)
    has been\nidentified as a key requirement .  This document specifies a\nprocedure
    relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements\n(PCEs) in order to compute
    such inter-domain shortest constraint\npaths along a determined sequence of domains,
    using a backward\nrecursive path computation technique while preserving confidentiality\nacross
    domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed\nby different Service
    Providers.\n\t "

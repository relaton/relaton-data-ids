  content: "This document defines a trivial, machine-parsable Uniform Resource Citiation
    (URC) syntax that can be returned from the resolution of Uniform Resource Names
    (URNs). The syntax, called urc0, is also appropriate for any program that can
    return URCs. More sophisticated URC schemes will be developed later. urc0 is intended
    to be the simplest possible machine-parsable representation of a URC.                                  This
    document does not cover any specific resolution schemes or the syntax for URNs.
    It is expected that these issues (and other URN-related topics) will be covered
    in different Internet Drafts submitted to the IETF URI Working Group.\n\t "

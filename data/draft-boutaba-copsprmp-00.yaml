  content: "In COPS-PR, the (clients of the) PEPs use special structures, called\nPolicy
    Information Bases (PIBs) that store the policies that are\nsent by the PDPs. PIBs
    are well-defined structures that are not\nmeant to be modified to adapt to the
    needs of each network. This\nmakes COPS-PR PEPs rigid and inflexible. This document
    describes an\nextension of the COPS-PR protocol that allows the PEPs to store\nmeta-policies
    that control the content of their PIBs. The set of\nmeta-policies that the PEPs
    can store is not predefined and\ncustomized policies can be supported. The use
    of meta-policies\npushes intelligence towards the PEPs and makes them more self-\ndependent.
    In this way, the model becomes more distributed, scalable\nand fault-tolerant,
    while the bandwidth consumption and the (real-\ntime) processing load of the PDP
    are reduced.\n\n\t "

  content: "  This memo defines a way for SSH server applications to send additional\n
    \ information to clients as part of authentication failure. A mechanism\n  to
    relay such information can reduce the need for end user support in\n  situations
    where a client would successfully authenticate, but cannot\n  log in for a policy
    reason, such as password age or public key size.\n\n\t "

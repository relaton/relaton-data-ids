  content: "   This draft proposes a novel mitigation scheme to protect the inter-\n
    \  domain data delivery during false routing announcements. A new path\n   attribute
    is defined to Decouple propagation of a path and adoption\n   of a path for data
    forwarding in BGP (DBGP). DBGP does not use\n   suspicious paths for data forwarding,
    but still propagates them in\n   the routing system to facilitate attack detection.
    It can extensively\n   protect data delivery from routing announcements of false
    sub-\n   prefixes, false origins, false nodes and false links, and works well\n
    \  with ongoing attack detection and prevention systems.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The IETF is well on its way to protecting connection metadata with\n
    \  protocols such as DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS, and work-in-\n   progress
    towards encrypting the TLS SNI.  However, more work is\n   needed to protect traffic
    metadata, especially in the context of web\n   traffic.  In this document, we
    survey Website Fingerprinting attacks,\n   which are a class of attacks that use
    machine learning techniques to\n   attack web privacy, and highlight metadata
    leaks used by said\n   attacks.  We also survey proposed mitigations for such
    leakage and\n   discuss their applicability to IETF protocols such as TLS, QUIC,
    and\n   HTTP.  We endeavor to show that Website Fingerprinting attacks are a\n
    \  serious problem that affect all Internet users, and we pose open\n   problems
    and directions for future research in this area.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator may receive ICMPv6 packets\n   containing
    non IPv4-translatable addresses as the source that should\n   be passed across
    the translator as an ICMP packet directed to the the\n   IPv4-translatable destination.
    \ This document discusses the\n   considerations and the stateless address mapping
    algorithms for\n   source address translation in ICMPv6 headers for such cases.\n\n\t "

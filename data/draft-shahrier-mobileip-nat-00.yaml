  content: "In this draft, we propose an Internet architecture consisting \nof large
    number private networks, individually connected to the \nInternet backbone via
    NAT-routers. Hosts within the same private \nnetwork can communicate with one
    another locally, and also with \nhosts in other networks via the Internet backbone.
    The routers in \neach private network maintain their own local routing state and
    \nrouters in the backbone maintain their own external routing state. \nMore specifically,
    the routers within a particular domain are not \ncognizant of routes outside that
    domain.\n\t "

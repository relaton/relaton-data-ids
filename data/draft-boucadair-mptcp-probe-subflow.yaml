  content: "   This document specifies an extension to Multipath TCP (MPTCP) that
    is\n   meant to assess whether a path used to establish a given subflow is\n   MPTCP-friendly,
    i.e., intermediate nodes involved in that path do not\n   alter nor strip MPTCP
    options, which would prevent the establishment\n   of MPTCP communications along
    that path.  A new flag bit, called\n   Probe Flag (P-flag) is defined for this
    purpose.\n\n   This document updates RFC6824.\n\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document argues that security functions should be implemented
    on\n   each layer as needed.  Especially security functions should not be\n   separated
    in its own layer.  Having security scoped to the needs of\n   each layer makes
    it possible to separate different functions\n   correctly without the risk of
    impacting security on another layer.\n   Note that this does not mean that each
    layer needs to maintain and\n   negotiate it's on security context.\n\n\t "

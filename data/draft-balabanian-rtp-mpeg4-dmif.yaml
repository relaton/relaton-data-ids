- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft technical proposal  describes how RTP carrying MPEG-4\npayloads
    interacts with the MPEG-4 Sync layer through the MPEG\n(Delivery Multimedia Integration
    Framework) DMIF. Single or multiple\nMPEG-4 streams can be carried over one RTP
    session. MPEG-4 information\nessential for the efficient packing and unpacking
    of MPEG-4 streams\ninto/from RTP is identified.\n \nThe DMIF end-to-end signaling
    protocol is applied to identify the MPEG-4\nRTP payload types and ensure stack
    compatibility at both sender and\nreceiver locations. DMIF also interprets the
    RTCP reports by comparing\nits statistics to the requested MPEG-4 media based
    QoS. If the\nstatistics fail to meet the requested QoS then action is taken to
    either\ncontinue with the impaired performance, upgrade the network service\nclass,
    scale down the stream or delete the stream. This action is apart\nfrom scalability
    using the stream back-channel flow control which may\nbe present between an encoder
    and its decoder.\n \nThis is an update of the draft-ietf-avt-rtp-mpeg4-dmif-00.
    It reflects\nthe latest MPEG-4 specs. In addition some clarifications are included\nand
    an open issues section is established based on feedback received.\n\t "

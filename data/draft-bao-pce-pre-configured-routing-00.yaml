  content: "Pre-configured routing is a routing scheme that except primary route\noperator
    configures one or multiple routes which will be used as\nrecovery route when the
    primary route fails for a service previously.\nThis document improves this traditional
    routing shceme, and PCE (Paht\nComputation Element) is applied for pre-configured
    routing.\nFurthermore, this document also presents a detailed set of PCC-PCE\n(Path
    Computation Client) communication protocol requirements and\ndefines PCEP (Path
    Computation Element Communication Protocol)\nextensions for PCEP.\n\t "

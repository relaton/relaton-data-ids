  content: "\n    Traffic engineering using MPLS within a single IGP area has become\n
    \   quite prevalent in networks today.  This gives a network operator\n    several
    advantages, including better traffic measurement\n    capabilities, faster restoration
    times, and of course the ability\n    to better manage congestion points within
    their network.  However,\n    the current uses have been limited to one IGP area.
    \ OSPF based\n    networks usually do traffic engineering only in their backbone\n
    \   area, and many ISIS networks still operate at a single level.  It\n    would
    be useful to be able to extend these capabilities across\n    hierarchical areas
    within a single IGP, as well as to be able to\n    extend across AS boundaries
    if it is found to be useful and\n    possible.  This document first considers
    current applications of\n    MPLS traffic engineering (TE), and then it addresses
    how these\n    might be used (or precluded) across IGP areas.  For the purposes\n
    \   of this document, IGP areas refers both to OSPF areas and ISIS\n    multi-level
    hierarchies.  Requirements for Inter-AS TE can be\n    found in [INTER-AS-TE].\n\n

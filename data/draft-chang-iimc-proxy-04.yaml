  content: "This document is intended to facilitate the use of the ISO/CCITT Common
    Management Information Protocol (CMIP) for integrated management of networks via
    proxy management of TCP/IP networks that are managed using Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).  This document describes an ISO/CCITT to Internet 'proxy' which
    allows interworking between CMIP-based managers and SNMP-based agents.  The proxy
    emulates CMIS service requests by mapping between corresponding ISO/CCITT GDMO
    and Internet MIB definitions, and generating SNMP message(s) needed to emulate
    the service. The proxy also emulates CMIS service responses and notifications
    by converting incoming SNMP response and trap message(s) in a similar fashion.
    \ Thus, the proxy appears as a CMIP-based agent to the manager, and as an SNMP-based
    manager to the agent.  The proxy depends on the availability of corresponding
    MIB definitions translated as described in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].\n\t "

  content: "Recently broadband Voice over IP (VoIP) has a clear trend to\nsubstitute
    for traditional telephone services such as wire telephone,\nwireless telephone
    and mobile telephone service, it has become\nincreasingly clear that VoIP services
    will be expected to provide\nLawful Intercept to the same level experienced in
    the Public Switched\nTelephone Network(PSTN)[7].  In an effort to provide lawful\ninterception
    for broadband VoIP, an architecture using session border\ncontroller was proposed,
    and a prototype implementation of the\nbroadband VoIP lawful interception was
    created and basic performance\nevaluation was conducted on this prototype system.
    \ This document\nreports on the prototype implementation and the test results.\n\t "

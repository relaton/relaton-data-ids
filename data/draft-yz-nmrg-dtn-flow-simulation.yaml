  content: "   Some important application scenarios of digital twin network, such
    as\n   network new technology experiment, network configuration\n   verification,
    network performance optimization, etc., all require the\n   virtual traffic in
    the twin network to accurately simulate the real\n   traffic in the physical network.The
    real traffic in the physical\n   network is called the physical traffic, and the
    virtual traffic in\n   the twin network is called the twin traffic.  In order
    to realize the\n   high-fidelity simulation of the physical traffic by the twin
    traffic,\n   this paper proposes that the twin traffic and the physical traffic\n
    \  should satisfy three consistent characteristics, and an\n   implementation
    method of twin flow is introduced.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines a proposed new service class for the  internet\n
    \  which  is  intended to provide for some small proportion of the total\n   traffic
    on  each  link,  a  quantifiable,  low-delay  service  having\n   essentially
    \ no  packet-loss. We call this proposed service, Bounded-\n   delay (BD). The
    approach is  consistent  with  the  architecture  and\n   philosophy  of  diff-serv,
    \ and  could  potentially  make  use of the\n   proposed EF PHB. BD is similar
    in many respects  to  Premium  service\n   which  has  been  described  previously
    \ [Twobit],  except that BD is\n   intended specifically to allow  control  of
    \ end-to-end  delay  in  a\n   quantifiable manner.\n\t "

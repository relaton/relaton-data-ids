  content: "This document describes Whois++, an extension to the trivial WHOIS\n   service
    described in RFC 954 to permit WHOIS-like servers to make\n   available more structured
    information to the Internet.  We describe\n   an extension to the simple WHOIS
    data model and query protocol and a\n   companion extensible, distributed indexing
    service.  A number of\n   options have also been added such as the use of multiple
    languages\n   and character sets, more advanced search expressions, structured
    data\n   and a number of other useful features.  An optional authentication\n
    \  mechanism for protecting all or part of the associated Whois++\n   information
    database from unauthorized access is also described.\n\t "

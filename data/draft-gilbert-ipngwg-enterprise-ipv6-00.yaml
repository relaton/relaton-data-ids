  content: "This document is not meant to be a primer on IPv6 [IPv6] or supply any
    technical information about the protocol, it is meant to give network engineers
    a place to start and to get ideas as to what to prepare for when thinking about
    implementing IPv6, and also some changes that need to be made when thinking about
    the addressing schema.\nIPv6 brings some useful features that will help in making
    the transition as painless as possible, things like auto-configuration and renumbering.
    Particularly useful is the fact that both IPv4 and IPv6 can run concurrently on
    the network, on the same router interface and on the same PC.  This affords an
    evolutionary approach rather that a revolutionary introduction of IPv6 technology.
    \nFor the purpose of this document the terms router and layer3 switch are used
    interchangeably\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>There are situations following Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) session
    establishment where it would be useful for an LDP speaker to know when its peer
    has advertised all of its labels. The LDP specification provides no mechanism
    for an LDP speaker to notify a peer when it has completed its initial label advertisements
    to that peer. This document specifies means for an LDP speaker to signal completion
    of its initial label advertisements following session establishment. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"

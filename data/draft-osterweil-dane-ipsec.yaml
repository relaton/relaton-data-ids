  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a new Domain Name System (DNS) resource record\n
    \  type called the IPSECA RR that is used to associate an X.509\n   certificate
    or a public key to an Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)\n   gateway in a similar
    manner TLSA RR is used in the DNS-based\n   Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)
    protocol does that for\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS) in order to make the
    credential\n   discovery easier through DNS and to allow credential discovery
    to be\n   performed in a secure manner leveraging DNS Security Extensions\n   (DNSSEC).
    \ Among the issues addressed in this draft is the danger of\n   IP address spoofing
    that can be a liability to IPsec endpoints.  It\n   is important to note that
    the \"right destination\" in this document is\n   strictly defined by the response
    of the DNS and does not attest to\n   the identity of the organization or the
    ownership of the IP address\n   space.  The identity of the organization shall
    be attested in an\n   X.509 certificate issued by a certification authority if
    desired and\n   the ownership of the IP address space shall be attested by other\n
    \  mechanisms such as Towards A Secure Routing System (TASRS)\n   architecture
    or Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Practice has shown that there are a number of zones all full service\n
    \  resolvers should, unless configured otherwise, automatically serve.\n   RFC4193
    already specifies that this should occur for D.F.IP6.ARPA.\n   This document extends
    the practice to cover the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones\n   for RFC1918 address space and
    other well known zones with similar\n   usage constraints.\n\n\t "

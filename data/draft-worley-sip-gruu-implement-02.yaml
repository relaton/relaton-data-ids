  content: "   Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require\n
    \  a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used\n   by
    anyone on the Internet to route a request to that specific UA\n   instance.  A
    URI which routes to a specific UA instance is called a\n   Globally Routable UA
    URI (GRUU).  An Internet-Draft is progressing\n   toward standardization that
    specifies procedures for proxies and UAs\n   by which proxies can construct and
    delver GRUUs to UAs that request\n   them.  This document summarizes for UA implementors
    how to obtain\n   \"public\" GRUUs and gives guidance on effectively using public
    GRUUs.\n\n\t "

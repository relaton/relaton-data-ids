  content: "   In a public WLAN hotspot, we need to have an easy and secure way to\n
    \  authenticate users. We have to find also mobility solutions, given \n   by
    providers, to perform well the roaming. A roaming mobile terminal\n   MT may be
    within radio range of more than one access point AP.\n   Therefore, we need to
    make an intelligent network selection decision\n   after receiving some roaming
    information. Currently, the information\n   is typically provisioned on the MTs
    as static roaming tables. But,\n   this approach is not scalable when there is
    a large number of access\n   points.\n\n   In this draft, we propose our solution
    called OSFR, Optimized Network\n   Selection for Fast Roaming to improve association
    speed and\n   scalability. \n\t "

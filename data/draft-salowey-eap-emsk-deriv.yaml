  content: "An Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) is a cryptographic key\n   generated
    from an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) exchange\n   reserved solely
    for the purpose of deriving master keys for one or\n\n   more purposes identified
    as usage definitions.  This document\n   specifies a mechanism for deriving cryptographically
    separate root\n   keys from the EMSK, called usage specific root Keys (USRK).
    \ The\n   document provides a set of requirements for avoiding conflicts\n   between
    usage definitions to ensure this cryptographic separation.\n   The USRK is used
    according to the usage definition defined for a\n   specific purpose.\n\t "

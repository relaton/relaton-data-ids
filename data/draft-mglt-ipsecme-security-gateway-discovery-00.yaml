  content: "   Modern Virtual Private Network (VPN) services are typically deployed\n
    \  using several security gateways and are frequently accessed over a\n   wireless
    network.  There are several reasons for such a deployment\n   ranging from enhancing
    system resilience to improving performance.\n\n   For example, in order to handle
    traffic efficiently and reduce the\n   burden in the core network, the VPN service
    may be implemented in a\n   distributed manner using multiple Security Gateways.
    \ A mobile VPN\n   End User is attached to one of them using a WLAN interface
    and over\n   time is likely to change its Security Gateway of attachment.  In
    this\n   case, in order to optimize the overall user Quality of Experience\n   (QoE),
    a VPN End User should select the next most appropriate\n   Security Gateway based
    on the characteristics of the available\n   Security Gateways.  This draft specifies
    how a VPN End User can\n   securely collect information about Security Gateways
    in its network\n   neighborhood in order to optimize its VPN experience.\n\n\t "

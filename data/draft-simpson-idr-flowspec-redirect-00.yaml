abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Flowspec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination of\n
    \  traffic flow specifications. This has several applications, but one\n   of
    key interest to many network operators is network-wide\n   distribution of traffic
    filtering rules as part of a threat\n   mitigation strategy.\n\n   Every flowspec
    route is effectively a rule, consisting of a matching\n   part (encoded in the
    NLRI field) and an action part. The current\n   standards support common filter
    actions including discard, rate\n   limit, sample, etc. and all of these actions
    are encoded in BGP\n   extended communities. For policy-based forwarding the current\n
    \  standards also define a redirect-to-VRF action (again encoded in a\n   BGP
    extended community), but for some flowspec applications this can\n   be complex
    to implement, particularly in networks where L3 VPNs are\n   not prevalent.\n\n
    \  This draft proposes a generalized flowspec redirect action that\n   allows
    a more complete set of policy-based forwarding actions to be\n   signaled with
    a flowspec route. This generalized action is encoded in\n   a BGP path attribute
    and uses a TLV-style encoding for future\n   extensibility. Two redirect action
    TLVs are defined in this draft:\n   one for redirecting matched packets towards
    a remote IPv4 destination\n   and the other for redirecting matched packets towards
    a remote IPv6\n   destination. Many routers already support these filter actions
    in the\n   datapath and so the proposed flowspec extensions are simply filling
    a\n   control plane gap.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, RFC 8995) is\n
    \  an automated bootstrap protocol for unconfigured devices called\n   \"pledges\".
    \ Existing enrollment protocols in BRSKI are all based on\n   certificates, which
    are not suitable for constrained IoT devices.\n   This document defines a certificateless
    enrollment protocol in BRSKI\n   (BRSKI-CLE) for constrained IoT devices.  To
    achieve a lightweight\n   protocol, a credential based on public keys is designed
    to replace\n   the domain certificate used in BRSKI.  An authentication centre
    (AC)\n   replaced the certification authority (CA) is used to issue the\n   credential
    to the pledge.  A new mutual authentication protocol is\n   also designed to authenticate
    using the credentials.\n\n\t "

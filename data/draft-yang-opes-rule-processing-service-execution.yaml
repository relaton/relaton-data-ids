  content: "This document describes specific architectural components of the \nOpen
    Pluggable Edge Service (OPES) framework [1]. It defines the \nfunctionality of
    the OPES Administration Server and the OPES Service \nEngine and discusses the
    interaction with other OPES components. In \nparticular, the document defines
    the operational flow for \ndownloading rules and proxylets and the content flow
    for handling \nweb requests and responses. A list of protocols and interfaces
    to be \nspecified within the OPES framework is derived from the discussion.\n\t "

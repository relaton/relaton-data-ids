  content: "   Automated decision-making systems, including AI and algorithmic\n   systems
    in critical infrastructure, currently lack standardized\n   mechanisms for producing
    evidentiary-grade provenance records that\n   can withstand independent verification.
    \ Traditional logging\n   approaches fail to provide the cryptographic guarantees
    required for\n   regulatory compliance, forensic investigation, and cross-\n   organizational
    accountability.\n\n   This document describes the Verifiable AI Provenance Framework
    (VAP),\n   an architectural framework that defines requirements for producing\n
    \  verifiable decision trails using existing IETF security technologies.\n   VAP
    does not define new protocols or cryptographic primitives;\n   rather, it provides
    an architectural coordination layer that enables\n   domain-specific profiles
    to leverage Supply Chain Integrity,\n   Transparency and Trust (SCITT), Remote
    Attestation Procedures (RATS),\n   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE),
    and related IETF work in a\n   consistent manner.\n\n   This document is intended
    to frame the problem space and facilitate\n   discussion about whether architectural
    coordination work is needed in\n   this area.\n\n\t "

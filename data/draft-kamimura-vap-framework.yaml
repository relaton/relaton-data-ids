abstract:
- content: "<p>Automated decision-making systems, including AI and algorithmic systems
    in critical infrastructure, currently lack standardized mechanisms for producing
    evidentiary-grade provenance records that can withstand independent verification.
    Traditional logging approaches fail to provide the cryptographic guarantees required
    for regulatory compliance, forensic investigation, and cross- organizational accountability.
    This document describes the Verifiable AI Provenance Framework (VAP), an architectural
    framework that defines requirements for producing verifiable decision trails using
    existing IETF security technologies. VAP does not define new protocols or cryptographic
    primitives; rather, it provides an architectural coordination layer that enables
    domain-specific profiles to leverage Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency and
    Trust (SCITT), Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS), CBOR Object Signing and Encryption
    (COSE), and related IETF work in a consistent manner. This document is intended
    to frame the problem space and facilitate discussion about whether architectural
    coordination work is needed in this area.</p>"

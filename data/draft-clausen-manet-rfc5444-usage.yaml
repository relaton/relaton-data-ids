  content: "   This document updates the generalized MANET packet/message format,\n
    \  specified in RFC5444, by providing prescriptive guidelines for how\n   protocols
    can use that packet/message format.  In particular, these\n   mandatory guidelines
    prohibit a number of uses of RFC5444 that have\n   been suggested in various proposals,
    and which would have lead to\n   interoperability problems, to impediment of protocol
    extension\n   development, and to inability to use generic RFC5444 parsers.\n\n\t "

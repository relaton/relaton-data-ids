  content: "   The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment Header\n
    \  without the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces (we\n   refer
    to these packets as \"atomic fragments\").  Such packets\n   typically result
    from hosts that have received an ICMPv6 \"Packet Too\n   Big\" error message that
    advertises a \"Next-Hop MTU\" smaller than 1280\n   bytes, and are currently processed
    by some implementations as\n   \"fragmented traffic\".  Thus, by forging ICMPv6
    \"Packet Too Big\" error\n   messages an attacker can cause hosts to employ \"atomic
    fragments\",\n   and then launch any fragmentation-based attacks against such
    traffic.\n   This document discusses the generation of the aforementioned \"atomic\n
    \  fragments\", the corresponding security implications, and formally\n   updates
    RFC 2460 and RFC 5722 such that fragmentation-based attack\n   vectors against
    traffic employing \"atomic fragments\" are completely\n   eliminated.\n\n\t "

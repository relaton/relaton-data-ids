  script: Latn
  content: "   Mobile IPv6 Return Routability Procedure (RRP) is used to secure the\n
    \  Binding Updates between a Mobile Node and a Correspondent Node where\n   there
    is no pre-established security relationship between the two\n   parties.  This
    document puts forward a mechanism called ECC RRP,\n   which enhances the key management
    for Return Routability Procedure\n   with anonymous Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    (ECC) Key Agreement\n   Protocol.  The proposed procedure is not prone to attacks
    by nodes on\n   the route from correspondent node to home agent in way that the
    RRP\n   process described in RFC3775 is.  It also reduces the latency related\n
    \  to handovers that require new binding updates.\n\n\t "

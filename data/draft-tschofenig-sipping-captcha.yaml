  content: "A common approach to deal with unwanted communication attempts is to\nrely
    on some form of authorization policies, typically whitelists.\nIn order to populate
    the entries in such an access control list it is\nhelpful to have a way to challenge
    the entity willing to engage in a\nconversation (unless they are already pre-authorized).
    \ One reason\nwhy this is desired is to deal with robots that are aggressively\ndistributing
    messages.\n\nThis document describes how \"Completely Automated Public Turing
    Test\nto Tell Computers and Humans Apart\" (CAPTCHA) tests, which require\nhuman
    interaction, are applied to SIP.\n\t "

  content: "        The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method\n
    \       for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point\n        links\n
    \n        PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, which\n        allows
    negotiation of an Authentication Protocol for\n        authentication of its peer
    before allowing Network Layer\n        protocols to transmit over the link.\n
    \n        One of the Authentication protocols that can be negotiated is\n        the
    EAP.  The EAP can be used in any of a number of variants.\n        When the EAP
    is used in it's KEA variant, this results in mutual\n        authentication and
    key generation.  This key is available for\n        use during the PPP data transfer
    phase by an encryption\n        encapsulation.  The encryption encapsulation that
    is described\n        in this memo is one possible encapsulation that can use
    the\n        keying material generated by the EAP KEA protocol.\n\n\t "

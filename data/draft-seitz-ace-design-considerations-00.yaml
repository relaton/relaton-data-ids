abstract:
- content: "<p>Considerable effort has been spent on securing existing Internet standard
    authentication and authorization protocols such as TLS, Kerberos, and OAuth, among
    others. It would save a lot of effort if these protocols could be profiled to
    be feasible for constrained environments, with some easily obtainable security
    considerations. However, these protocols were typically not designed with constrained
    environments in mind, so profiling of an existing protocol may result in a far
    from optimal solution. Moreover they are not necessarily complying with their
    original design objectives outside their intended domain of application. This
    document examines the impact of typical characteristics of security protocols
    (e.g. cryptographic calculations, number and size of protocol messages) in a constrained
    environment. The goal is to provide decision support when different resource usage
    optimizations are possible in the adaptation of a security protocol for this setting.</p>"

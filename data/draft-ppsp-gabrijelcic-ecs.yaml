  content: "   The Enhanced Closed Swarm (ECS) protocol is a distributed access\n
    \  control mechanism suitable for usage in Peer-to-Peer content delivery\n   systems.
    \ The protocol provides coarse or fine grained authorization\n   of peers participating
    in content distribution.  As a result, only\n   authorized peers are allowed to
    communicate in a swarm.  The protocol\n   also provides data confidentiality,
    integrity and origin\n   authentication for application data exchanged among peers.
    \ The\n   protocol is simple but flexible enough to enable a range of usage\n
    \  scenarios.  In addition to the ECS protocol, this document also\n   describes
    its application in the IETF PPSPP.\n\n\t "

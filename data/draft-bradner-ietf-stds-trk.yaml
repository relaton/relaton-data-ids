  content: "   The discussion in the problem working group reached consensus that\n
    \  the current IETF 3-stage standards track, as implemented, is not\n   working.
    \ This is a proposal for an alternate, also 3-stage,\n   standards track that
    I feel better matches current reality.\n   This is a republication of an ID originally
    published in June 2003\n\t "

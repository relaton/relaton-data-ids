  script: Latn
  content: "   The classic 512-bytes UDP payload for transporting DNS messages is
    an\n   embedded dependence on IPv4.  As the Internet infrastructure is\n   evolving
    to IPv6, the very constraint stemming from IPv4 can be\n   removed by the virtue
    of that IPv6 mandates a MTU of 1280 bytes.\n   This document specifies a new minimum
    size of UDP packet to carry DNS\n   message, making DNS implementations going
    forward more adaptive to\n   both applications based on the Internet and infrastructures\n
    \  supporting the Internet.\n\n\t "

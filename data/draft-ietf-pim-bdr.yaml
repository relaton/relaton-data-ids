  script: Latn
  content: "   On a multi-access network, one of the PIM routers is elected as a\n
    \  Designated Router (DR).  On the last hop LAN, the PIM DR is\n   responsible
    for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding\n   traffic to these listeners
    if the group is operating in PIM-SM.  In\n   this document, we propose mechanisms
    to minimize traffic losses\n   during DR re-election.  This document introduces
    the concept of a\n   Backup Designated Router on a shared LAN and a procedure
    to perform\n   Delayed DR election.  A backup DR on LAN would be useful for faster\n
    \  convergence, whereas a Delayed DR election would be useful for\n   minimizing
    traffic losses when new routers join a LAN.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework supporting
    multiple types of authentication methods.  In systems where EAP is used for authentication,
    it is desirable to not repeat the entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.
    \ This document specifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support
    an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication between the
    peer and an EAP re-authentication server through any authenticator.  The re-authentication
    server may be in the home network or in the local network to which the peer is
    connecting. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

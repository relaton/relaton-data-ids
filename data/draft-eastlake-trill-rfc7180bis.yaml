  content: "   Since publication of the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots\n
    \  of Links) base protocol in 2011, active development of TRILL has\n   revealed
    errata in RFC 6325 and areas that could use clarifications\n   or updates. RFCs
    7177, 7357, and [rfc6439bis] provide clarifications\n   and updates with respect
    to Adjacency, the TRILL ESADI (End Station\n   Address Distribution Information)
    protocol, and Appointed Forwarders\n   respectively.  This document provides other
    known clarifications,\n   corrections, and updates. It obsoletes RFC 7180 (the
    previous TRILL\n   clarifications, corrections), updates RFC 7177, updates RFC
    7179, and\n   updates RFC 6325.\n\n\n\t "

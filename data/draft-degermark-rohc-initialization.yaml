  content: "This is an individual contribution to the IETF ROHC WG.  The document\nproposes
    a format for the initialization headers that establish the\nstatic (and dynamic)
    part of ROHC context.  The method is intended to\nbe general and extensible, and
    to deal well with IPv6 extension\nheaders, headers used by Mobile IP, and IPSEC
    headers. All these\nheaders must be dealt with according to the ROHC requirements,
    but\nare not handled by existing proposals.\nComments should be sent to the ROHC
    WG, rohc@cdt.luth.se\n\n\n\t "

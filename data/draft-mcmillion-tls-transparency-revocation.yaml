  content: "   This document describes reliable mechanisms for the publication and\n
    \  revocation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates.  This\n   reliability
    takes several forms.  First, it provides browsers a\n   strong guarantee that
    all certificates they accept are truly\n   published and unrevoked at the time
    they're accepted.  Second, it\n   allows operators to monitor for mis-issuances
    related to their\n   websites in a highly efficient way without relying on third-party\n
    \  services.  Third, it provides a high degree of operational redundancy\n   to
    minimize the risk of cascading outages.\n\n\t "

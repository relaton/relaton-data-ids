  content: "   This document specifies the \"SVCB\" and \"HTTPS\" DNS resource record\n
    \  (RR) types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make\n   connections
    for origin resources, such as for HTTPS URLs.  SVCB\n   records allow an origin
    to be served from multiple network locations,\n   each with associated parameters
    (such as transport protocol\n   configuration and keys for encrypting the TLS
    ClientHello).  They\n   also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible
    with\n   CNAME.  The HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for HTTPS and HTTP\n   origins.
    \ By providing more information to the client before it\n   attempts to establish
    a connection, these records offer potential\n   benefits to both performance and
    privacy.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This proposal is inspired by and based on recent
    DNS\n   usage proposals such as ALTSVC, ANAME, and ESNIKEYS (as well as long\n
    \  standing desires to have SRV or a functional equivalent implemented\n   for
    HTTP).  These proposals each provide an important function but\n   are potentially
    incompatible with each other, such as when an origin\n   is load-balanced across
    multiple hosting providers (multi-CDN).\n   Furthermore, these each add potential
    cases for adding additional\n   record lookups in addition to AAAA/A lookups.
    \ This design attempts\n   to provide a unified framework that encompasses the
    key functionality\n   of these proposals, as well as providing some extensibility
    for\n   addressing similar future challenges.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc
    [1].  The most recent\n   working version of the document, open issues, etc. should
    all be\n   available there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.\n\n\t "

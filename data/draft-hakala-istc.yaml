  content: "This document discusses how International Standard Text Work Codes \n(ISTCs;
    persistent and unique identifiers for textual works) can be \nsupported within
    the URN framework and the syntax for URNs defined in \nRFC 2141 [Moats]. Analysis
    is in part based on the ideas expressed in \nRFC 2288 [Lynch], which analysed
    the use of ISSN, ISBN and SICI as URNs. \nChapter 5 contains a URN namespace registration
    request modelled \naccording to the template in RFC 2611 [Daigle et al.].\n\t "

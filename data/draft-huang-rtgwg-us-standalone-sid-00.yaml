  content: "   More and more emerging applications have raised the demand for\n   establishing
    networking connections anywhere and anytime, alongside\n   the availability of
    highly distributive any-cloud services.  Such a\n   demand motivates the need
    to efficiently interconnect heterogeneous\n   entities, e.g., different domains
    of network and cloud owned by\n   different providers, with the goal of reducing
    cost, e.g., overheads\n   and end-to-end latency, while ensuring the overall performance\n
    \  satisfies the requirements of the applications.  Considering that\n   different
    network domains and cloud providers may adopt different\n   types of technologies,
    the key of interconnection and efficient\n   coordination is to employ a unified
    interface that can be understood\n   by heterogeneous parties which could derive
    the consistent\n   requirements of the same service and treat the service traffic\n
    \  appropriately by their proprietary policies and technologies.\n\n   This document
    provides use cases and problem statements from two main\n   Internet traffic categories:
    one is the traditional north-south\n   traffic which is defined from clients to
    entities (such as servers or\n   DCs), and the other is east-west traffic which
    refers to traffic\n   between entities (such as inter-server or inter-service).The\n
    \  requirements for a standalone Service ID are also derived.\n\n\t "

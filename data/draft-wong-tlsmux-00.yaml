  content: "   This document describes a multiplexing protocol that allows remote\n
    \  machines to access local services in a secure manner.  All clients\n   must
    connect to the multiplexer using TLS, allowing encrypted\n   network communications
    to normally cleartext protocols.\n \n   TLSMUX is an application level protocol
    that does not require a\n   kernel upgrade or extensions to existing protocols
    in order to\n   operate.  By offering a TLS connection to a multiplexer, current\n
    \  servers and protocols do not need to be modified to benefit from the\n   encryption
    features of TLSMUX.  Some clients may need to be updated\n   to support TLSMUX,
    although it is possible for some clients to use a\n   TLSMUX proxy without modification.\n\n\t "

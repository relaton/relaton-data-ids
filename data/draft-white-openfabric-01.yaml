  content: "   Spine and leaf topologies are widely used in hyperscale and cloud\n
    \  scale networks.  In most of these networks, configuration is\n   automated,
    but difficult, and topology information is extracted\n   through broad based connections.
    \ Policy is often integrated into the\n   control plane, as well, making configuration,
    management, and\n   troubleshooting difficult.  OpenFabric is an adaptation of
    an\n   existing, widely deployed link state protocol, Intermediate Sytem to\n
    \  Intermediate System (IS-IS) that is designed to:\n\n   o  Provide a full view
    of the topology from a single point in the\n      network to simplify operations\n\n
    \  o  Minimize configuration of each router (or switch) in the network\n\n   o
    \ Optimize the operation of IS-IS within a spine and leaf fabric to\n      enable
    scaling\n\n   This document begins with an overview of OpenFabric, including a\n
    \  description of what may be removed from IS-IS to enable scaling.  The\n   document
    then describes an optimized adjacency formation process; an\n   optimized flooding
    scheme; some thoughts on the operation of\n   OpenFabric, metrics, and aggregation;
    and finally a description of\n   the changes to the IS-IS protocol required for
    OpenFabric.\n\n\t "

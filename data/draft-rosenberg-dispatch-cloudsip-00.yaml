  content: "   Software making use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) faces\n
    \  challenges in achieving high availability, especially for call\n   stateful
    applications like softswitches, Session Border Controllers\n   (SBCs), and IP-based
    call centers applications.  The state maintained\n   in the SIP, SDP and SRTP
    layers changes frequently, and is difficult\n   to replicate.  For this reason,
    commercial systems have often relied\n   on complex active-standby configurations
    making use of IP address\n   takeover.  These solutions are also ill-suited for
    usage in modern\n   public cloud environments.  This document defines a SIP extension\n
    \  facilitating HA, including keeping calls active, which is optimized\n   for
    server-to-server communication where one or both sides are in\n   public cloud.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Service synchronisation for Television And Related devices (STAR) is\n
    \  a suite of application level protocols to enable network connected\n   devices
    to correlate events on a broadcast system with events outside\n   that broadcast
    system.  It is a generic suite of protocols, that\n   enables playback of content
    retrieved from over a network such that\n   it is synchronised to a broadcast
    source.  It also enables\n   correlation of non-broadcast events (such as conversations)
    to\n   broadcast events.\n\n   Key features of STAR include: 1) The broadcast
    system does not\n   require modification 2) It is designed to work with restricted\n
    \  clients limited to stream connections - such as web browsers 3) It is\n   content
    agnostic.\n\n   This specification describes the research implementation as it
    stands\n   today, and is published as a starting point for further discussion.\n\n\t "

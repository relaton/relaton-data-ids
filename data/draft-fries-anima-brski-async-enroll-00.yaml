  content: "   This document discusses the enhancement of automated bootstrapping
    of\n   a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) to operate in domains\n   featuring
    no or only timely limited connectivity to backend services\n   offering enrollment
    functionality like a Public Key Infrastructure\n   (PKI).  In the context of deploying
    new devices the design of BRSKI\n   allows for online (synchronous object exchange)
    and offline\n   interactions (asynchronous object exchange) with a manufacturer's\n
    \  authorization service.  It utilizes a self-contained voucher to\n   transport
    the domain credentials as a signed object to establish an\n   initial trust between
    the pledge and the deployment domain.  The\n   currently supported enrollment
    protocol for request and distribution\n   of deployment domain specific device
    certificates provides only\n   limited support for asynchronous PKI interactions.
    \ This memo\n   motivates support of self-contained objects also for certificate\n
    \  management by using an abstract notation to allow off-site operation\n   of
    PKI services, with only limited connectivity to the pledge\n   deployment domain.
    \ This addresses specifically scenarios, in which\n   the deployment domain of
    a pledge does not perform the final\n   authorization of a certification request
    and rather delegates this\n   decision to an operator backend.  The goal is to
    enable the usage of\n   existing and potentially new PKI protocols supporting
    self-\n   containment for certificate management.\n\n\t "

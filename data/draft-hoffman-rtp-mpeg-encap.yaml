  content: "This draft describes a packetization scheme for MPEG video and audio streams.
    \ The scheme proposed can be used to transport such a video or audio flow over
    the protocols used by RTP.  Two profiles are described. The first is designed
    to support maximum interoperability with MPEG-2 Systems environments.  The second
    is designed to maximize simplicity of implementation and to leverage other efforts
    within IETF.\n\t "

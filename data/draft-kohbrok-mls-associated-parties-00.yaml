  content: "   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol allows a group of clients\n
    \  to exchange symmetric keys, agree on group state and send application\n   messages.\n\n
    \  The main purpose of an MLS group is thus to facilitate agreement on\n   group
    state and key material between the members of the group.  In\n   some cases, however,
    it is useful to share agreement on the (public)\n   group state, as well as key
    material with another party that is not a\n   full member of the group.\n\n   This
    document describes a safe extension to do just that.\n\n\t "

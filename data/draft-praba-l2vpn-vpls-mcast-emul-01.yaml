  content: "In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), the PE devices provide a \n   logical
    interconnect such that CE devices belonging to a specific \n   VPLS instance appear
    to be connected by a single LAN.  A VPLS \n   solution performs replication for
    multicast traffic at the ingress \n   PE devices.  When replicated at the ingress
    PE, multicast traffic \n   wastes bandwidth when 1. Multicast traffic is sent
    to sites with no \n   members, and 2. Pseudo wires to different sites go through
    a shared \n   path. This document addresses the above cases by using LDP \n   signaling
    to emulate Multicast operation over VPLS with out using \n   IGMP and PIM snooping
    as described in [VPLS-MCAST].\n\t "

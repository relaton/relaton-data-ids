  content: "Longstanding work in the Mobile IP Working Group has been directed \nat
    enhancements to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 to reduce the amount \nof latency
    in binding updates sent to the Home Agent and, for route-\noptimization, Correspondent
    Nodes, upon Care of Address change. In \ncases where the Home Agent and Mobile
    Node are separated by \ncontinental or transcontinental distances, this latency
    can be \nrather high and can interfere with the Mobile Node receiving its \ntraffic
    upon Care of Address change when break-before-make handover \nis required. This
    draft discusses a solution that leverages the more \nrecent fast handover work
    and mechanisms already described in the \nprotocol specifications for Mobile IPv6
    and the route optimization \nextension of Mobile IPv4. This alternative has certain
    simplicity, \nscalability, and robustness advantages over a design that \nincorporates
    additional mobility agents, and requires no additional \nmechanism in the network
    or change to the Mobile Node beyond that \nrequired to support these protocols.

abstract:
- language: en

  content: "This document describes a payload format, which can be used for the\ntransport
    of both MPEG-4 Elementary Streams (ES) as well as MPEG-4\nSync Layer packet streams,
    in RTP [1] packets.  The payload format\nallows for protection against loss in
    a generic way, through frag-\nmentation, grouping and extension data mechanisms,
    which can dynamically adapt to network conditions. These mechanisms can operate
    both\non full and partial MPEG-4 Access Units, such as Sync Layer packets,\nor
    typed segments,   These mechanisms can cover a broad range of\nprotection schemes
    and avoid extra connection management complexity\n- e.g. for separate FEC channels
    - in MPEG-4 applications with a high number of streams.\n\t "

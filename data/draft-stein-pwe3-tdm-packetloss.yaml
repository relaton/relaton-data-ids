  content: "The effect of packet loss on voice quality has been the subject of\ndetailed
    study in the VoIP community, but these results are not\ndirectly applicable to
    TDM transport as being studied in the PWE WG.\nThe present document presents an
    analysis of packet loss for the TDM\nover PW case, and demonstrates that packet
    loss of a few percent can\nbe tolerated.  We propose that robustness to packet
    loss of a few\npercent be a requirement for any proposed method for transport
    of TDM\nover pseudowires.\n\t "

  content: "   Shortest path routing offers an easy-to-understand, easy-to-implement\n
    \  method of establishing loop-free connectivity in a network, but\n   offers
    few other features.  Equal-cost multipath (ECMP), a simple\n   extension, uses
    multiple equal-cost paths between any two points in a\n   network: at any node
    in a path (really, Directed Acyclic Graph),\n   traffic can be (typically equally)
    load-balanced among the next hops.\n   ECMP is easy to add on to shortest path
    routing, and offers a few\n   more features, such as resiliency and load distribution,
    but the\n   feature set is still quite limited.\n\n   Traffic Engineering (TE),
    on the other hand, offers a very rich\n   toolkit for managing traffic flows and
    the paths they take in a\n   network.  A TE network can have link attributes such
    as bandwidth,\n   colors, risk groups and alternate metrics.  A TE path can use
    these\n   attributes to include or avoid certain links, increase path\n   diversity,
    manage bandwidth reservations, improve service experience,\n   and offer protection
    paths.  However, TE typically doesn't offer\n   multipathing as the tunnels used
    to implement TE usually take a\n   single path.\n\n   This memo proposes multipath
    traffic-engineering (MPTE), combining\n   the best of ECMP and TE.  The multipathing
    proposed here need not be\n   strictly equal-cost, nor the load balancing equally
    weighted to each\n   next hop.  Moreover, the desired destination may be reachable
    via\n   multiple egresses.  The proposal includes a protocol for signaling\n   MPTE
    paths using various types of tunnels, some of which are better\n   suited to multipathing.\n\n\t "

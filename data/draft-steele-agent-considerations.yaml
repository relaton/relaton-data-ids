abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF specifications provide the basis for technical implementation
    in several programming languages. An IETF specification that provides appropriate
    guidance to artificial intelligence (AI) agents, can enable such agents to consume
    specifiction and generate code from it. This documents defines the use of an Agent
    Consideration section that is in support of code generation including the use
    of agentcards, guidance on authorship, examples and their annotation for code
    generation, as well as language specific guidance for the production of media-types.
    The Agent Consideration defined in this document can be added to any Internet-Draft
    that includes normative language and sufficiant expressive examples derived from
    an included data model and protocol interaction defintions.</p>"

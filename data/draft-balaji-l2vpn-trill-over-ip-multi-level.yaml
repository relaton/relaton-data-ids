  script: Latn
  content: "   There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or (b) TRILL\n
    \  based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities\n   or
    (c) Campus TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more\n   ISPs that provide
    regular IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. Some of the\n   solutions proposed as in
    [DRAFT-EVPN] have not dealt with the\n   scalable methods in their details as
    to how these services could be\n   provided such that multiple TRILL sites can
    be inter-connected with\n   issues like nick-name collisions for unicast and multicast
    being\n   taken care of. It has been found that with extensions to BGP and a\n
    \  scalable method on Provider edge devices the problem statement which\n   we
    will define below can be handled. Specifically the division of the\n   nick-name
    into site-id and Rbridge-ID is one that can limit the\n   number of sites that
    can be interconnected and the number of Rbridges\n   within each such site that
    can be provisioned. The draft proposed\n   herein deals / overcomes these issues
    by not limiting the number of\n   sites and Rbridges within a TRILL site interconnect.
    Only the maximum\n   space for a nick-name which happens to be 16 bits is the
    actual\n   limit. MAC moves across TRILL sites and within TRILL sites can also\n
    \  be realized. This document / proposal envisions the use of BGP-MAC-\n   VPN
    vrfs at the ISP cloud PE devices. We deal in depth with the\n   control plane
    and data plane particulars for unicast and multicast in\n   this scheme. Additionally
    Provider Backbone like functionality is\n   also covered.\n\n\t "

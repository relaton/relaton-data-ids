  content: "   This document specifies enhancement to the Internet Group Management\n
    \  Protocol, IGMPv3.  IGMP is the protocol used by IPv4 systems to\n   report
    their IP Multicast group memberships to neighboring Multicast\n   routers.  This
    enhancement for IGMP adds support for \"specifying day,\n   time and duration
    with Multicast reports\", that is, the ability for a\n   system to report interest
    in receiving traffic for a particular\n   Multicast address at a particular day,
    time and for a specific\n   duration.  This information may be used by intermediate
    routers and\n   switches to ensure providing better Quality of Service.  Also\n
    \  specifying such information in a consolidated packet may help reduce\n   signaling
    load on the multicast routers.\n\t "

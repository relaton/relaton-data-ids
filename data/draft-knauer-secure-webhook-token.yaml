  content: "   The Secure Webhook Token (SWT) is a specialized JSON Web Token (JWT)\n
    \  format designed for securely authorizing and verifying webhook\n   requests.
    \ It defines a set of claims to ensure that the token is\n   explicitly tied to
    webhook events and that its integrity can be\n   reliably validated by the recipient.
    \ A key feature of SWT is the\n   introduction of a unique claim, webhook, which
    encapsulates webhook-\n   specific information, such as the event type.\n\n   By
    providing a structured and secure approach to webhook\n   authentication, SWT
    aims to be a lightweight and flexible solution\n   while maintaining compatibility
    with typical JWT structures.  It is\n   designed with the best practices in mind
    and may serve as a\n   foundation for future standardization efforts.\n\n\t "

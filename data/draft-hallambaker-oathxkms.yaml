- language: en

  content: "A means of provisioning OATH shared secret OTP parameters based on \nthe
    XKMS protocol is described. The techniques used may be extended \nto support XKMS
    registration of symmetric keys for other \ncryptographic protocols. It is hoped
    that publication of this note \nwill allow others to make use of the same architectural
    approach as a \nstarting point for future proposals. \n        \nThis work is
    a joint effort by the members of OATH (Initiative for \nOpen AuTHentication) to
    specify an algorithm that can be freely \ndistributed to the technical community.
    The authors believe that a \ncommon and shared specification will facilitate adoption
    of two-\nfactor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability \ncommercial
    and open-source implementations. \n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
    [RFC7643] provides schemas that represent common identity information about users
    and groups, as well as a protocol for communicating that information between systems.
    The systems that tend to implement SCIM clients and servers are identity providers,
    and service providers. These are the same systems that are now need to manage
    agents and agentic applications across domains. This document describes a SCIM
    2.0 extension for agents and agentic applications, which includes extensions to
    the core User and Group objects, and new resource types and schemas for agentic
    constructs. This extension is intended to provide greater interoperability between
    Identity providers, agentic applications, agents and their clients while reducing
    the responsibilities assumed by the every growing list of new protocols for agents.</p>"

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an method for shortening DES keys from 56 bits\nto
    40 bits. The shortened keys are generally known as 'DES-40'. The\nmotivation for
    this weakening is that some localities (such as the\nUnited States) give special
    preference to applications that use 40-bit\nkeys. The weakened keys are then used
    with the DES encryption\nalgorithm in the same manner as full-strength keys.\n
    \nThere are many possible methods for reducing a 56-bit key to a 40-bit\nkey.
    The method in this draft was chosen because one method is needed\nfor interoperability.
    Further, this method has been known to\noccasionally have been approved for export
    from the United States.\n\t "

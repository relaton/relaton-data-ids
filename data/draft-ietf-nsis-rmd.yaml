  content: "This document describes a Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) Quality-of-Service
    (QoS) Model for networks that use the Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) concept.
    \ RMD is a technique for adding admission control and preemption function to Differentiated
    Services (Diffserv) networks.  The RMD QoS Model allows devices external to the
    RMD network to signal reservation requests to Edge nodes in the RMD network.  The
    RMD Ingress Edge nodes classify the incoming flows into traffic classes and signals
    resource requests for the corresponding traffic class along the data path to the
    Egress Edge nodes for each flow.  Egress nodes reconstitute the original requests
    and continue forwarding them along the data path towards the final destination.
    \ In addition, RMD defines notification functions to indicate overload situations
    within the domain to the Edge nodes.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

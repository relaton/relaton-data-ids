  content: "This document describes a protocol for use between media devices and\n
    \  their controllers.  The scope of such media devices includes voice,\n   video
    and data applications.  This work started with the\n   decomposition of gateways
    into functional elements, viz. media\n   gateway controller, media gateway and
    signaling gateway.  A protocol\n   is needed to allow media gateway controllers
    and media gateways to\n   communicate.  Since then the scope has been broadened
    to the control\n   of media devices that do not have a gateway function, such
    as IVR\n   systems, multipoint processors, etc.\n   A model is introduced to describe
    the functionality of media devices\n   and the various operations on that model
    are described.\n\t "

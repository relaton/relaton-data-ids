abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "RFC 2468 [1] defines the need of a standardized format for\nidentifying
    ISP subscribers for dial-up roaming operations. It\nintroduced the Network Access
    Identifier (NAI) to fulfill this\nneed. The NAI is provided by the mobile node
    to the dialed ISP\nduring PPP authentication.\nThe ability to resolve an NAI for
    second and third generation\ncellular mobile nodes allow traditional cellular
    service providers\nto evolve their home cellular networks to provide cellular\nservices,
    IP packet data services and so on with a single\nsubscription using NAIs. Additionally,
    this allows cellular\nprovider to evolve their networks to be IP based.\nSecond
    and third generation cellular mobile nodes must perform a\nregistration and authentication
    process with their wireless service\nprovider before the mobile node user may
    initiate other operations\n(See [1] for examples). These mobile nodes do not support
    the\nprogramming of an NAI nor does the cellular registration message\nsupport
    the transfer of an NAI to the wireless access network. For\nexample, North American
    cellular networks (e.g. AMPS, TDMA, CDMA)\nservice mobiler nodes that register
    with a Mobile Identification\nNumber (MIN). The MIN is then associated with a
    cellular\nsubscriber. MIN is shown here only as an example, the same general\nidea
    is applicable to other types of identifiers used in different\naccess network
    types. For the same reasons stated in [1], it would\nbe convenient if an option
    was available to provide the wireless\nsubscriber identification in the form of
    an NAI during the wireless\nregistration and authentication process. This draft
    proposes a\nsolution to resolve NAIs from traditional mobile node identifiers.\n\t "

  content: "This document extends the INCH WG's IODEF XML incident reporting\n   format
    for reporting phishing, fraud, other types of electronic\n   crime, and widespread
    spam incidents.  Although the term \"phishing\n   attack\" is used, the data format
    extensions are flexible enough to\n   support information gleaned from activities
    throughout the entire\n   electronic fraud life cycle and extensible enough to
    be used for\n   other types of electronic crime incidents, along with simple spam.\n
    \  The extensions support very simple reporting as well as optional\n   fields
    for detailed forensic reports, and support single phish/fraud\n   incidents as
    well as consolidated reports of multiple phish\n   incidents.\n\n   Sections 1
    and 2 of this document introduce the high-level report\n   format.  Sections 3
    and 4 describe the data elements of the fraud\n   extensions.  This document includes
    an XML schema for the extensions\n   and a few example fraud reports.\n\t "

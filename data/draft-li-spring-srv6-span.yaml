    \  is the most direct and comprehensive technology for capturing data\n   streams
    and forwarding information.  Compared with other\n   visualization technologies,
    it can not only obtain the content of an\n   entire packet, but also add forwarding
    information of a network\n   device to a mirror packet and send the packet to
    a remote analysis\n   server.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an experimental MPTCP option that is meant
    to\n   negotiate the maximum number of subflows that can be established and\n
    \  maintained for a given MPTCP connection.  The purpose is to minimize\n   any
    possible performance degradation that can be induced by a\n   possibly large number
    of establishment requests for additional\n   subflows if the remote endpoint is
    not appropriateley dimensioned to\n   handle such requests.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes a multicast routing protocol for mobile ad hoc\nnetworks
    (MANETs).  The protocol---termed Differential Destination\nMulticast (DDM)---differs
    from common approaches proposed for ad hoc\nmulticast routing in two ways.  Firstly,
    instead of distributing\nmembership control throughout the network, DDM concentrates
    this\nauthority at the data sources (i.e.  senders) thereby giving senders\nknowledge
    of group membership.  Secondly, differentially-encoded,\nvariable-length destination
    headers are inserted in data packets\nwhich are used in combination with unicast
    routing tables to forward\nmulticast packets towards multicast receivers.  Instead
    of requiring\nthat multicast forwarding state be stored in participating nodes,\nthis
    approach also provides the option of stateless multicasting.\nEach node independently
    has the choice of maintaining cached\nforwarding state, or requesting its upstream
    neighbor to insert this\nstate into self-routed data packets, or some combination
    thereof.\nThe protocol is best suited for use with small multicast groups\noperating
    in dynamic networks of any size.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Section 4.3.1 of the Diameter base specification [RFC6733] defines
    a\n   number of derived AVP data formats.  This collection includes the\n   Address
    format, which is suitable for encoding complete addresses.\n   In some potential
    applications, however, there is a requirement to\n   encode a prefix rather than
    a complete address.  This document\n   defines the AddressOrPrefix derived AVP
    data format, modelled after\n   the Address format defined in [RFC6733], but allowing
    the same AVP to\n   represent a prefix of any length up to a full address.  This
    document\n   updates RFC 6733.\n\n\t "

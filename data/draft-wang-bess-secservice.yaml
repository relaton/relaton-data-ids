  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes an approach to encrypting selective user data\n
    \  flows using IPsec and then orchestrating the encrypted flows based on\n   the
    SRv6 Policy path.  The method is needed for some users or\n   applications that
    demand an elevated level of security, necessitating\n   the encryption of their
    data flows even within networks like SRv6,\n   which are built and managed by
    Network Service Providers (NSP) and\n   generally considered secure.  Employing
    encryption for selective\n   flows over NSP managed networks, including technologies
    like SRv6,\n   adds an extra layer of protection, safeguarding valuable data from\n
    \  potential breaches and enhancing overall network security.\n\n\n\t "

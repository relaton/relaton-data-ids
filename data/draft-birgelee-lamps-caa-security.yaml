  script: Latn
  content: "   Cryptographic domain validation procedures leverage authenticated\n
    \  communication channels to ensure resilience against attacks by both\n   on-path
    and off-path network adversaries which may be located between\n   the Certification
    Authority (CA) and the network resources related to\n   the domain contained in
    the certificate.  Domain owners can leverage\n   \"security\" Property Tags specified
    in CAA records (defined in\n   [RFC8659]) with the critical flag set, to ensure
    that CAs perform\n   cryptographically-constrained domain validation during their
    issuance\n   procedure, hence defending against global man-in-the-middle\n   adversaries.
    \ This document defines the syntax of the CAA security\n   Property as well as
    acceptable means for cryptographically-\n   constrained domain validation procedures.\n\n\t "

  content: "Mtrace2 is a tool that can be used to discover the path a multicast\npacket
    takes to reach one or more receivers.  This document describes\nan enhancement
    to extend mtrace2 to be able to discover more than one\npath for a single (S,G)
    or (*,G) entry and to trace more than one\n(S,G) or (*,G) entries simultaneously.
    \ Changes to the mtrace2\nprotocol, and behaviors required by multicast routers
    to support the\nchanges, are specified in this document.\n\t "

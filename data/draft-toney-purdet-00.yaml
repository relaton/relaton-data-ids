  content: "   Originally this draft started out as 'Reliable Extensions To UDP'.\n
    \  Instead of calling it 'Reliable Extensions To UDP', it was decided\n   to use
    an anagram, PURDET, to represent what this draft was about.\n \n   This PURDET
    specification defines a very lightweight protocol\n   with minimal transport functions
    necessary to provide reliability\n   and flow control over non-reliable UDP transport.
    \ It is intended\n   to be very easy to implement, to have a small footprint on
    the\n   OS to allow high fan-out, and support simple control of the\n   connection.\n
    \n   PURDET supports sequencing, flow control, multiplexing/protocol\n   identification
    (using an optional field), error retransmission,\n   and link loss detection.\n
    \n   PURDET is a work in progress presented for comment.  The author\n   hopes
    this represents positive progress towards a reliability\n   approach appropriate
    to the needs of real time control and similar\n   applications.\n\n\t "

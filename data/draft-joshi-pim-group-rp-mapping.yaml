  content: "Each PIM-SM router in a PIM Domain which supports ASM maintains\n   Group-to-RP
    mappings which are used to identify a RP for a specific\n   multicast group.  PIM-SM
    has defined an algorithm to choose a RP from\n   the Group-to-RP mappings learned
    using various mechanisms.  This\n   algorithm does not allow administrator to
    override a specific Group-to-RP mapping with the static Group-to-RP mapping which
    an\n   administrator would want to use.  This algorithm also does not\n   consider
    the PIM mode and the mechanism through which a Group-to-RP\n   mapping was learned.\n\n
    \  This document first explains the requirements to extend the\n   Group-to-RP
    mapping algorithm and then proposes the new algorithm.\n\t "

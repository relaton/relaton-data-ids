    mail delivery, for services such as facsimile and voice\nmessaging.  Traditional
    Internet mail uses a _postal_ mail model,\nwith normal delivery having an indeterminate

    completion\nadds a timelines service feature and extends delivery processing\nall
    the way to the recipient.  This specification provides a\ndeterministic service
    quality response, while preserving most of\nthe traditional roles and responsibilities
    of the agents involved\nin email transfers.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies new File Transfer Protocol (FTP)\n\n\ncommands
    to allow for a distributed FTP server to operate\n\n\ncorrectly. The purpose is
    to address an issue in the FTP\n\n\nProtocol which causes a truely distributed
    FTP server from\n\n\nbeing possible.\n\n\n  Truely distributed meaning that data-connections
    do not need\n\n\nto be routed through the FTP server, itself, to be transferred\n\n\nto
    the client, and allowing data to be stored completely\n\n\nseparately from the
    FTP Server.\n\nCopyright Notice\n\n\n  Copyright (c) 2010 IETF Trust and the persons

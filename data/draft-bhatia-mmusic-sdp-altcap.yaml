  content: "   This document defines Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes
    \n   and semantics to express alternate capabilities and offers. The \n   attribute
    \"cgroup” is defined to express alternate simultaneous sets \n   of capabilities.
    The “ALTS” semantics are defined to express specific \n   alternate simultaneous
    offers. Existing methods like the MIME \n   multipart/alternative subtype and
    the use of multiple session \n   descriptions in SDP are also discussed. \n\t "

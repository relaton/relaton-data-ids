  content: "   Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use\n
    \  but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are\n   defined
    as \"white space.\"  The concept of allowing additional\n   transmissions (which
    may or may not be licensed) in white space is a\n   technique to \"unlock\" existing
    spectrum for new use.  An obvious\n   requirement is that these additional transmissions
    do not interfere\n   with the assigned use of the spectrum.  One approach to using
    white\n   space spectrum at a given time and location is to verify spectrum\n
    \  availability with a database that manages spectrum sharing and\n   provides
    spectrum-availability information.  The IETF has undertaken\n   to develop a Protocol
    to Access Spectrum Database [1] for such a\n   management database.\n\n   This
    document describes a number of possible use cases of white space\n   spectrum
    and technology as well as a set of requirements for the\n   database query protocol.
    \ The concept of white spaces is described\n   along with the problems that need
    to be addressed to enable white\n   space spectrum for additional uses without
    causing interference to\n   currently assigned use.  Use of white space is enabled
    by querying a\n   database that stores information about spectrum availability
    at any\n   given location and time.\n\n\n\t "

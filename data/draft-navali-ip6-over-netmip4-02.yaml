  content: "\n   There is a growing demand for routable IP addresses to support large\n
    \  wireless user base today.  Wireless operators are looking for ways to\n   leverage
    the IPv6 address space to meet the ever increasing number of\n   wireless data
    users.  The operators who have network-based IPv4\n   mobility solutions can leverage
    the same scheme to provide mobility\n\n   access service with larger address pool
    using IPv6 addressing.  The\n   proposed approach solves both, by allowing provision
    of the network-\n   based mobility service, and the IPv6 address acquisition for
    the MNs.\n   The mobility contolling function may be located either at the\n   dedicated
    Access Node (achieving a virtual link-layer to the HA) or\n   at the first hop
    Access Router.\n\t "

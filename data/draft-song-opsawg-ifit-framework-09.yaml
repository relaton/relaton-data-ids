  content: "   Efficient network operation increasingly relies on data-plane\n   telemetry.
    \ As networks increase in scale and network operations\n   become more sophisticated,
    traditional Operation, Administration and\n   Maintenance (OAM) methods, which
    include proactive and reactive\n   techniques, running in active and passive modes,
    become more\n   susceptible to measurement accuracy and misconfiguration errors.\n\n
    \  With the advent of programmable data-plane, emerging on-path\n   telemetry
    techniques provide unprecedented flow insight and realtime\n   notification of
    network issues (e.g., jitter, increased latency,\n   packet loss, significant
    bit error variations, and unequal load-\n   balancing).\n\n   This document enumerates
    several key deployment challenges and\n   requirements for on-path telemetry techniques,
    especially in carrier\n   operator networks.  To address these issues, this document
    outlines a\n   high-level framework, In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT).
    iFIT\n   provides several essential components that can be assembled to\n   achieve
    a complete and efficient solution for on-path telemetry.\n\n   As a reference
    and open framework, iFIT only describes the basic\n   functions of each identified
    component and suggests possible\n   applications.  It does not specify the implementation
    of the\n   components and the interfaces between the components.  The compliance\n
    \  of iFIT framework is not mandated either.  This informational\n   document
    aims to clarify the problem domain, and summarize the best\n   practices and sensible
    system design considerations.  The iFIT\n   framework helps to guide the analysis
    on the current standard status\n   and gaps, and motivate new works to complete
    the ecosystem.  It also\n   helps to inspire innovative network telemetry applications
    supporting\n   advanced network operations.\n\n\n\t "

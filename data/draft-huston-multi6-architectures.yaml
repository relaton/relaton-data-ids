  content: "This memo provides an analysis of the aspects of multi-homing support\n
    \  for the IPv6 protocol suite. The purpose of this analysis is to\n   provide
    a taxonomy for classification of various proposed approaches\n   to multi-homing.
    It is also an objective of this exercise to identify\n   common aspects of this
    domain of study, and also to provide a\n   framework that can allow exploration
    of some of the further\n   implications of various architectural extensions that
    are intended to\n   support multi-homing.\n\t "

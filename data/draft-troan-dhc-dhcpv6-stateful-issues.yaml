  content: "   [RFC3315] was not written with the expectation that other stateful\n
    \  DHCPv6 options would be developed.  [RFC3633] shoe-horned the new\n   options
    for Prefix Delegation options for DHCPv6 into DHCPv6.\n   Implementation experience
    of the CPE model described in [RFC6204] has\n   shown multiple issues with the
    DHCPv6 protocol in supporting multiple\n   stateful options.\n\n\t "

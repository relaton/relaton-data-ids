  content: "   To limit the privacy and security issues created by the association\n
    \  between a device, its traffic, its location and its user, client\n   vendors
    have started implementing MAC address rotation.  When such\n   rotation happens,
    some in-network states may break, which may affect\n   network efficiency and
    the user experience.  At the same time,\n   devices may continue sending other
    stable identifiers, defeating the\n   MAC rotation purposes.  This document lists
    various network\n   environments and a set of functional network services that
    may be\n   affected by such rotation.  This document then examines settings\n
    \  where the user experience may be affected by in-network state\n   disruption,
    and settings where other machine identifiers may help re-\n   identify the user
    or recover the identity of the user, and locate the\n   device and its associated
    user.  Last, this document examines\n   solutions to maintain user privacy while
    preserving user quality of\n   experience and network operation efficiency.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\n
    \  Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for\n   traffic
    across a network and can also update the paths to reflect\n   changes in the network
    or traffic demands.\n\n   The PCE has been identified as an appropriate technology
    for the\n   determination of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE Label\n
    \  Switched Paths (LSPs).\n\n   PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS P2MP
    LSPs, which are\n   supplied to the head end (root) of the LSP using PCEP.  PCEP
    has been\n   proposed as a control protocol to allow the PCE to be fully enabled\n
    \  as a central controller.\n\n   A PCE-based central controller (PCECC) can simplify
    the processing of\n   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements
    of SDN and\n   without necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the P2MP LSP
    can\n   be calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding entries can\n   also
    be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network\n   devices along
    the P2MP path while leveraging the existing PCE\n   technologies as much as possible.\n\n
    \  This document specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions\n   for
    using the PCE as the central controller for P2MP TE LSP.\n\n\t "

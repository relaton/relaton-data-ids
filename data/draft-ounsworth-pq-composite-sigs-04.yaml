  content: "   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come\n
    \  the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n   cryptographic
    algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum algorithms
    is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to be performed
    in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for holding composite
    public\n   keys and composite signature data.\n\n   This document defines the
    structures CompositePublicKey,\n   CompositeSignatureValue, and CompositeParams,
    which are sequences of\n   the respective structure for each component algorithm.
    \ This document\n   also defines algorithms for generating and verifying composite\n
    \  signatures.  This document makes no assumptions about what the\n   component
    algorithms are, provided that their algorithm identifiers\n   and signature generation
    and verification algorithms are defined.\n\n\t "

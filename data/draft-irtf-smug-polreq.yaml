  content: "Policy has long been accepted as means of bridging the gap between\nchanging
    user requirements and static implementations.  Policy\nmanagement infrastructures
    provide abstractions of underlying\nservices.  In this way, applications can freely
    adapt to the needs\nand capabilities of changing environments.  The policy approach
    has\nbeen especially successful in the deployment of security services.\n\n\n\t "

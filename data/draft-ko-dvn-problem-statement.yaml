  content: "   This document examines the problems and challenges associated with\n
    \  the process of setting up secure virtual network connections among\n   authorized
    network nodes.  The network nodes can be located anywhere\n   in a private or
    public network, directly connected or behind one or\n   more levels of NAT.  Setting
    up a secure virtual network in this\n   environment entails the resolution of
    various issues such as\n   authentication, peer discovery, virtual network address
    management,\n   and connection parameters determination.\n\n\t "

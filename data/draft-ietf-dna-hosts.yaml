  content: "Hosts experiencing rapid link-layer changes may require efficient IP\nconfiguration
    change detection procedures than traditional fixed\nhosts.  DNA is defined as
    the process by which a host collects\nappropriate information and detects the
    identity of its currently\nattached link to ascertain the validity of its IP configuration.\nThis
    document details best current practice for Detecting Network\nAttachment in IPv6
    hosts using existing Neighbor Discovery\nprocedures.  Since there is no explicit
    link identification mechanism\nin the existing Neighbor Discovery for IP Version
    6, the document\ndescribes implicit mechanisms for identifying the current link.\n\t "

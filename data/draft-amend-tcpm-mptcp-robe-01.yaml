  content: "   Multipath TCP extends the plain, single-path limited, TCP towards the\n
    \  capability of multipath transmission.  This greatly improves the\n   reliability
    and performance of TCP communication.  For backwards\n   compatibility reasons
    the Multipath TCP was designed to setup\n   successfully an initial path first,
    after which subsequent paths can\n   be added for multipath transmission.  For
    that reason the Multipath\n   TCP has the same limitations as the plain TCP during
    connection\n   setup, in case the selected path is not functional.\n\n   This
    document proposes a set of implementations and possible\n   combinations thereof,
    that provide a more Robust Establishment (RobE)\n   of MPTCP sessions.  It includes
    RobE_TIMER, RobE_SIM, RobE_eSIM and\n   RobE_IPS.\n\n   RobE_TIMER is designed
    to stay close to MPTCP in that standard\n   functionality is used wherever possible.
    \ Resiliency against network\n   outages is achieved by modifying the SYN retransmission
    timer: If one\n   path is defective, another path is used.\n\n   RobE_SIM and
    RobE_eSIM provides the ability to simultaneously use\n   multiple paths for connection
    setup.  They ensure connectivity if at\n   least one functional path out of a
    bunch of paths is given and offers\n   beside that the opportunity to significantly
    improve loading times of\n   Internet services.\n\n   RobE_IPS provides a heuristic
    to select properly an initial path for\n   connection establishment with a remote
    host based on empirical data\n   derived from previous connection information.\n\n
    \  In practice, these independent solutions can be complementary used.\n   This
    document also presents the design and protocol procedure for\n   those combinations
    in addition to the respective stand-alone\n   solutions.\n\n\t "

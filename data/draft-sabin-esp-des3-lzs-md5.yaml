  content: "This document proposes the '3DES-CBC-LZS-HMAC-Replay' security transform
    for the IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).  The proposed transform combines
    triple-DES encryption, LZS compression, HMAC authentication, and replay prevention
    into a single packet format.  The transform is compatible with implementations
    that do not support compression and with implementations that support only single-DES
    encryption.  Compression is performed prior to encryption, which has the side
    benefit of reducing the amount of data that must be encrypted.                                     This
    document is based on the IPsec Working Group's proposed 'Combined DES-CBC, HMAC,
    and Replay Prevention Security Transform,' cited later in this document.\n\t "

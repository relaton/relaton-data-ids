  content: "BGP is the routing protocol used to tie the Autonomous Systems (ASes)\n
    \  of the Internet together.  The ongoing stability of BGP in the face\n   of
    arbitrary inputs, both malicious and unintentional, is of primary\n   importance
    to the overall stability of the Internet.  The overall\n   issue is not a new
    one.  Previously, one aspect of stability, known\n   as route flap damping was
    originally discussed in RFC 2439.  In the\n   intervening years, a great deal
    of experience with flap damping and\n\n   other stability concerns has been accumulated.
    \ Most recently, the\n   issue of BGP stability has been highlighted in RAWS.
    \ This document\n   describes the experience that has been gained concerning stability
    in\n   the intervening years, hypotheses about remaining problems,\n   suggestions
    for experiments to be performed, and proposals for\n   possible alternatives.\n\t "

  content: "   The Layer 3 Discovery and Liveness protocol OPEN PDU may contain a\n
    \  key and a certificate, which can be used to verify signatures on\n   subsequent
    PDUs.  This document describes two mechanisms based on\n   digital signatures,
    one that is Trust On First Use (TOFU), and one\n   that uses certificates to provide
    authentication as well as session\n   integrity.\n\n\n\t "

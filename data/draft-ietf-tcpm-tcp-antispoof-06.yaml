  content: "Recent analysis of potential attacks on core Internet infrastructure indicates
    an increased vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious resets (RSTs), sent
    with forged IP source addresses (spoofing).  TCP has always been susceptible to
    such RST spoofing attacks, which were indirectly protected by checking that the
    RST sequence number was inside the current receive window, as well as via the
    obfuscation of TCP endpoint and port numbers.  For pairs of well-known endpoints
    often over predictable port pairs, such as BGP or between web servers and well-known
    large-scale caches, increases in the path bandwidth-delay product of a connection
    have sufficiently increased the receive window space that off-path third parties
    can brute-force generate a viable RST sequence number.  The susceptibility to
    attack increases with the square of the bandwidth, and thus presents a significant
    vulnerability for recent high-speed networks.  This document addresses this vulnerability,
    discussing proposed solutions at the transport level and their inherent challenges,
    as well as existing network level solutions and the feasibility of their deployment.
    \ This document focuses on vulnerabilities due to spoofed TCP segments, and includes
    a discussion of related ICMP spoofing attacks on TCP connections.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

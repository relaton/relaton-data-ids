  content: "This draft was submitted to obtain comments for an experimental work\nin
    progress. It presents Fast Mobile IPv6 and Context Transfer\ninteractions for
    a specific case of contextful, anticipative,\nnetwork controlled and Layer-2 source-triggered
    IPv6 handover where\none or more candidate access routers can be identified for
    selection\nas target. It is also meant to illustrate a case where it might be\nuseful
    to:\na) have Context Transfer messages as but options in handover\nnegotiation
    messages (e.g., Fast MIPv6's HI/HACK messages)\nbetween Access Routers.\nb) have
    an additional flag in the Context Transfer Protocol Context\nTransfer Data message
    which indicates whether the new Access\nRouter should install any context at all
    given that any one\ncontext fails to be installed.\n\t "

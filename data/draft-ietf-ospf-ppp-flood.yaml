  content: "The OSPF routing protocol synchronizes its link-state database over\nall
    links. However, when multiple point-to-point links connect a\npair of OSPF routers,
    it is only necessary to flood over one of the\nparallel links. This can be done
    in a backward-compatible fashion,\nwithout requiring negotiation between neighboring
    routers, as\ndescribed in this memo.\n\t "

  content: "Many existing DNS clients (resolvers) and applications that support\nIPv6
    first search for AAAA Resource Records (RR) of a target host\nname, and if no
    data, then for A RR of the same name. This memo\nproposes adding A RR in the additional
    section for the no data answer\nof AAAA RR, which can save a request for A RR.\n\t "

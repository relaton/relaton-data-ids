  content: "This document outlines a proposal for a BGP Version 5 (BGP5) which has
    the ability to carry routing information for a variety of network protocols.  The
    proposed BGP modifications are intended to be simple enough to be easily added
    to the existing BGP implementations and, at the same time, provide for a longer
    than 16-bit AS number space.      This document only describes BGP5 support for
    IPv4 and IPv6 networks.\n\t "

  content: "The stateless as well as stateful address autoconfiguration\n   Protocols,
    as specified by the IETF, supports links with different\n   properties.  However,
    often these protocols assume specific\n   properties and behavior from the underlying
    link type, as for example\n   link-layer multicasting.  The solution designer
    and implementers\n   consider these specific link behavior while designing or
    extending\n   these protocols.  IETF Autoconf WG goal is to standardize mechanism\n
    \  for address autoconfiguration of nodes in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network\n   (MANET).
    \ Before designing such protocol, the link model for MANET as\n   seen by the
    IP needs to be clearly understood .  However, there is no\n   document describing
    IP link model for MANET.  This document is an\n   attempt to bridge this gap.\n\t "

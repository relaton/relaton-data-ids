  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard\n
    \  Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing\n   communication.
    \ The security needs are well-recognized but the design\n   space of IoT applications
    and systems is complex and exposed to\n   multiple types of threats.  In particular,
    threats keep evolving at a\n   fast pace while many IoT systems are rarely updated
    and still remain\n   operational for decades.\n\n   This document describes a
    comprehensive agile security framework to\n   integrate existing security processes
    such as risk assessment or\n   vulnerability assessment in the lifecycle of a
    smart object in an IoT\n   application.  The core of our agile security approach
    relies on two\n   protocols: the Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration
    (PASC)\n   and the Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA).  PASC\n
    \  is executed during the onboarding phase of a smart object in an IoT\n   system
    and is in charge of automatically performing a risk assessment\n   and assigning
    a security configuration - applicable to the device or\n   the system - to defeat
    the identified risks.  The assigned security\n   configuration fits the specific
    environment and threat model of the\n   application in which the device has been
    deployed.  PAVA is executed\n   during the operation of the IoT object and ensures
    that\n   vulnerabilities in the smart object and IoT system are discovered in\n
    \  a proactive way.\n\n   These two protocols can benefit users, manufactures
    and operators by\n   automating IoT security.\n\n\t "

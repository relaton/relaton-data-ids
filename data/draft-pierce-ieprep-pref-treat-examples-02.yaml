  content: "Assured Service refers to the set of capabilities used to ensure \nthat
    mission critical communications are setup and remain connected. \n[Pierce1] describes
    the requirements, one of which is to provide \npreferential treatment to higher
    priority calls. IEPS refers to a \nset of capabilities used to provide a higher
    probability of call \ncompletion to emergency calls made by authorized personnel,
    usually \nfrom ordinary telephones. This also requires some form of \npreferential
    treatment. This memo describes some of the methods \nwhich may be applied to provide
    that preferential treatment.\n\t "

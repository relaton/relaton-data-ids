- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This specification incorporates an encapsulation scheme for Fibre- \nChannel
    (FC) using SCTP.  The essential advantages for using SCTP \ncompared to TCP as
    it relates to FC are as follows: \n- Headers contained within one frame. \n- Objects
    aligned at 32-bit boundaries. \n- Out of sequence frame processing. \n- Standard
    authentication. \n- Independent streams under common control. \n- Session restart.
    \n- Improved error detection. \n- Prevention of blind spoofing and denial of service
    attacks. \n- Standard Heartbeat and multi-homing. (optional)\n\t "

  content: "   An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push\n   service
    using the described technique.  This identification\n   information can be used
    by the push service to attribute requests\n   that are made by the same application
    server to a single entity.\n   This can used to reduce the secrecy for push subscription
    URLs by\n   being able to restrict subscriptions to a specific application\n   server.
    \ An application server is further able include additional\n   information the
    operator of a push service can use to contact the\n   operator of the application
    server.\n\n\t "

  content: "Recently there has been interest in using DHCP for configuring \nclients
    accessing the Internet through some form of high-speed \naccess technology such
    as cable or ADSL [DHC-AGENT]. In addition, \nalthough DHCP was initially designed
    for configuring fixed hosts, \nproposals are being made to enhance DHCP to support
    roaming/mobile \nclients [DHC-ENHANCE]. These two trends have put in evidence
    the \nneed for a coupling between AAA and DHCP. Some initial requirements \nfor
    DHCP/AAA have been proposed in [DHC-AAA].\nThis document proposes a different
    model in which AAA procedures are \ninvoked not from a DHCP server but from a
    DHCP relay agent to make \nsure that ALL the Internet Access features supported
    by the PPP model \ncan be replicated in a DHCP based Internet Access environment.\n\n\t "

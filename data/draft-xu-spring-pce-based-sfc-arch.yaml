  content: "   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a flexible way to construct\n
    \  services.  When applying a particular service function chain to the\n   traffic,
    the traffic needs to be steered through an ordered set of\n   service functions
    in the network.  This ordered set of service\n   functions in the network, referred
    to as a Service Function Path\n   (SFP), is an instantiation of the service function
    chain in the\n   network.  Segment Routing (SR) technique can be leveraged to
    steer\n   the traffic through the SFP in SR networks.  This document describes\n
    \  a PCE-based SFC architecture in which the PCE is used to compute a\n   service
    function path (i.e., instantiate a service function chain) in\n   SR networks.\n\n\n\t "

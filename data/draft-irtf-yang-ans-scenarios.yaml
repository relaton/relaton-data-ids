  content: "This document examines some common wireless ad hoc network usage \nscenarios
    that have the potential of being deployed as medium or \nlarge scale networks.
    \ The scenarios include both pure ad hoc \nnetworks without any infrastructure
    support and the hybrid networks \nwith some infrastructure in place.  This document
    is motivated by the \neffort in the IRTF ANS (Ad hoc Network Scalability) research
    group.  \nThe aim of this document is to provide some common network scenarios
    \nthat are rooted in the real world deployment to facilitate meaningful \ninvestigation
    and research of scalability in ad hoc networks.  \n\t "

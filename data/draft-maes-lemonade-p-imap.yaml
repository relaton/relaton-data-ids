  content: "Push Extensions to the IMAP protocol (P-IMAP) defines extensions to \nthe
    IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for optimization in a mobile \nsetting, aimed at
    delivering extended functionality for mobile \ndevices with limited resources.
    \ The first enhancement of P-IMAP is \nextended support to push changes actively
    to a client, rather then \nrequiring the client to initiate contact to ask for
    state changes.  \nIn addition, P-IMAP contains extensions for email filter management,
    \nmessage delivery, and maintaining up-to-date personal information. \nBindings
    to specific transport are explicitly defined. Eventually P-\nIMAP aims at being
    neutral to the network transport neutrality. \n  \nP-IMAP is a recommendation
    for interoperable intermediate \nimplementations awaiting [LEMONADEPROFILEBIS]
    or the realization of \nthe OMA MEM enabler using it. \n\n\t "

  content: "   Techniques that improve user privacy by hiding original client IP\n
    \  addresses, such as VPNs and proxies, have faced challenges with\n   server
    that rely on IP addresses to determine client location.\n   Maintaining a geographically
    relevant user experience requires large\n   pools of IP addresses, which can be
    costly.  Additionally, users\n   often receive inaccurate geolocation results
    because servers rely on\n   geo-IP feeds that can be outdated.  To address these
    challenges, we\n   can allow HTTP clients to actively send their network geolocation
    to\n   an HTTP server via an HTTP header field.  This approach will not only\n
    \  enhance geolocation accuracy and reduce IP costs, but it also gives\n   clients
    more transparency regarding their perceived geolocation.\n   This is also particularly
    useful in the case of HTTP intermediaries\n   that hide client IP addresses, such
    as Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) relays.\n\n\t "

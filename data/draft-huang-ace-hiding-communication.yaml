  content: "   Due to the computation and storage limitations of constrained-node\n
    \  networks, it is costly to apply those security mechanisms based on\n   public
    key algorithm. This document proposed a subliminal channel\n   hiding communication
    method, which can provide message\n   authentication service and protect the transmission
    of the sensitive\n   data.\n\n\t "

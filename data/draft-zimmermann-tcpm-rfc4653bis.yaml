- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR) for TCP.  In\n
    \  the absence of explicit congestion notification from the network, TCP\n   uses
    loss as an indication of congestion.  One of the ways TCP\n   detects loss is
    using the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments.\n   However, this heuristic
    is not always correct, notably in the case\n   when network paths reorder segments
    (for whatever reason), resulting\n   in degraded performance.  TCP-NCR is designed
    to mitigate this\n   degraded performance by increasing the number of duplicate\n
    \  acknowledgments required to trigger loss recovery, based on the\n   current
    state of the connection, in an effort to better disambiguate\n   true segment
    loss from segment reordering.  This document specifies\n   the changes to TCP,
    as well as the costs and benefits of these\n   modifications.\n\n\t "

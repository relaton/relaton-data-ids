  content: "   Pseudowires (PWs) have become a common mechanism for tunneling\n   traffic,
    and may be found in unmanaged scenarios competing for\n   network resources both
    with other PWs and with non-PW traffic, such\n   as TCP/IP flows.  It is thus
    worthwhile specifying under what\n   conditions such competition is acceptable,
    i.e., the PW traffic does\n   not significantly harm other traffic or contribute
    more than it\n   should to congestion.  We conclude that PWs transporting responsive\n
    \  traffic behave as desired without the need for additional mechanisms.\n   For
    inelastic PWs (such as TDM PWs) we derive a bound under which\n   such PWs consume
    no more network capacity than a TCP flow.  For TDM\n   PWs, we find that the level
    of congestion at which the PW can no\n   longer deliver acceptable TDM service
    is never significantly greater\n   than this bound, and typically much lower.
    \ Therefore, as long as the\n   PW is shut down when it can no longer deliver
    acceptable TDM service,\n   it will never do significantly more harm than even
    a single TCP flow.\n   We propose employing a transport circuit breaker to shut
    down a TDM\n   PW that persistently fails to comply with acceptable TDM service\n
    \  criteria.\n\n\t "

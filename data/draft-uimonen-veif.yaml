  content: "   This document proposes the Verified Email Identity Framework (VEIF),\n
    \  a mechanism to ensure that every email address used for sending\n   electronic
    mail is associated with a verifiable and accountable\n   registrant.  The goal
    is to significantly reduce spam, phishing, and\n   identity abuse by introducing
    individual-level authentication in\n   addition to existing domain-level controls
    such as SPF [RFC7208],\n   DKIM [RFC6376], and DMARC [RFC7489].\n\n\t "

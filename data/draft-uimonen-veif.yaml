abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the Verified Email Identity Framework (VEIF),
    a mechanism to ensure that every email address used for sending electronic mail
    is associated with a verifiable and accountable registrant. The goal is to significantly
    reduce spam, phishing, and identity abuse by introducing individual-level authentication
    in addition to existing domain-level controls such as SPF [RFC7208], DKIM [RFC6376],
    and DMARC [RFC7489].</p>"

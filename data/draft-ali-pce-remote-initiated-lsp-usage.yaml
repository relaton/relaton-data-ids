  content: "     When active stateful PCE is used for managing PCE-initiated LSP,\n
    \    PCC may not be aware of the intended usage of the LSP (e.g., in a\n     multi-layer
    network). PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated MPLS and\n     GMPLS LSP Setup specifications
    do not address this requirement.\n     This draft addresses the requirement to
    specify on how PCC should\n     use the remote initiated LSPs.\n\n     \n\t "

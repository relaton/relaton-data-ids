abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol can create an\n   association
    between endpoints known as a dialog.  Some of these\n   methods can also create
    a new association within an existing dialog.\n   These multiple associations,
    or dialog usages, require carefully\n   coordinated processing as they have independent
    life-cycles, but\n   share common dialog state.\n\n   This memo argues that multiple
    dialog usages should be avoided.  It\n   discusses alternatives to their use and
    clarifies essential behavior\n   for elements that cannot currently avoid them.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a resource reservation protocol Hierarchical\n
    \  Proxy Mobile Resource Reservation Protocol (HPMRSVP). This protocol\n   is
    based on the hierarchical architecture HMIPv6 and used a modified\n   version
    of FHMIPv6 to handle the handover. During a session, the\n   resource reservation
    between two mobile nodes is limited to the\n   access network. Furthermore, when
    a handover occurs, resources are\n   uniquely reserved to the target access point
    before the handover is\n   completed. The proposed   protocol allows to reduce
    delays and packet\n   loss. In addition, management of refresh messages is moved
    to the\n   access router, which holds the refresh reservation state for the\n
    \  duration of the session on behalf of the mobile unit. The access\n   network
    thereby becomes responsible for upholding the session, which\n   optimizes the
    utilization of the radio link.\n\t "

  content: "   Forward Secrecy for the Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for\n
    \  Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA' FS) is specified in\n   [RFC9678],
    providing updates to [RFC9048] with an optional extension\n   that offers ephemeral
    key exchange using the traditional Ephemeral\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    (ECDHE) key agreement algorithm for\n   achieving perfect forward secrecy (PFS).
    \ However, it is susceptible\n   to future threats from Cryptographically Relevant
    Quantum Computers,\n   which could potentially compromise a traditional ephemeral
    public\n   key.  If the adversary has also obtained knowledge of the long-term\n
    \  key and ephemeral public key, it could compromise session keys\n   generated
    as part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.\n\n   This draft aims to enhance
    the security of EAP-AKA' FS protocol by\n   making it quantum-safe using Post-Quantum
    Key Encapsulation\n   Mechanisms (PQ-KEMs).\n\n\t "

  content: "         This memo provides a simple analysis for the address\n         utilization
    in the MASC architecture and concludes\n         that the number of levels in
    the hierarchy should be\n         kept small.  More specifically, we believe that
    the\n         number of levels should not exceed 3 MASC levels.\n \n         The
    memo also motivates that MASC should not rely on\n         hints from applications
    for future address\n         requirements, but should rather guess future address\n
    \        demand and allocate addresses pro-actively thereby\n         reducing
    the latency for address requests.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates\n
    \  how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily\n   circumvented
    in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via\n   BGP.  It is meant
    to serve as input to the IETF's Secure Inter-Domain\n   Routing working group
    during routing security requirements\n   discussions and subsequent specification.\n\n\t "

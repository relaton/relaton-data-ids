  content: "   This draft proposes to relay throughput instead of congestion\n   back
    into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total\n   level of throughput
    is accessible to all IP devices along the path\n   followed by IP datagrams. The
    main advantage of this approach is that\n   applications that are not using the
    TCP protocol as transport\n   protocol could also apply the Conex concept to relay
    the throughput\n   experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network.\n\n\n\t "

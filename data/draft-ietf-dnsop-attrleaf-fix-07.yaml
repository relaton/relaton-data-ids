  content: "Using an underscore for a prefix creates a space for constrained interoperation
    of resource records.  Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node
    name prefix were specified without the benefit of an IANA registry.  This produced
    an entirely uncoordinated set of name-creation activities, all drawing from the
    same namespace.  A registry for these names has now been defined by RFC 8552.
    \ However, the existing specifications that use underscored naming need to be
    modified in order to be in line with the new registry.  This document specifies
    those changes.  The changes preserve existing software and operational practice,
    while adapting the specifications for those practices to the newer underscore
    registry model.\n\t "

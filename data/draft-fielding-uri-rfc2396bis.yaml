  content: "A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
    that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification defines
    the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be
    in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use
    of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset
    of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of
    a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible
    identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs;
    that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

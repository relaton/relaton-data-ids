  content: "The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of Access \n
    \  Node Control Mechanism, as described in [ANCP-FRAMEWORK], to PON \n   based
    broadband access. The need for an Access Node Control Mechanism \n   between a
    Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node Complex (a \n   combination of
    Optical Line Termination (OLT) and Optical Network \n   Termination (ONT) elements),
    is described in a multi-service \n   reference architecture in order to perform
    QoS-related, service-\n   related and Subscriber-related operations. The Access
    Node Control \n   Mechanism is also extended for interaction between components
    of the \n   Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT). The Access Node Control mechanism
    \n   will ensure that the transmission of the information does not need to \n
    \  go through distinct element managers but rather uses a direct device-\n   device
    communication. This allows for performing access link related \n   operations
    within those network elements to meet performance \n   objectives.\n\t "

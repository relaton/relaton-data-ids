  content: "   A switching fabric in a massive scale data center can comprise many\n
    \  10,000's of switches and 100,000's of IP hosts.  To connect and\n   configure
    a network of such size needs automation to avoid errors.\n   Zero Touch Provisioning
    (ZTP) protocols exist.  These can configure\n   IP devices that are reachable
    by the ZTP agents.  A method to combine\n   BGP, DHCPv6 and SRv6 with ZTP that
    can be used to discover and\n   configure an entire network of devices is described.
    \ It is designed\n   to scale well, because each networked device is not required
    to know\n   about more than its directly connected neighborhood.\n\n\n\t "

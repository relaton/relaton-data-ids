  content: "   This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries,\n   especially
    those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance\n   Metrics (IPPM) Working
    Group of the IETF, and applicable to all IETF\n   metrics.  Three aspects make
    IPPM metric registration difficult: (1)\n   Use of the Type-P notion to allow
    users to specify their own packet\n   types. (2) Use of flexible input variables,
    called Parameters in IPPM\n   definitions, some which determine the quantity measured
    and others\n   which should not be specified until execution of the measurement.
    (3)\n   Allowing flexibility in choice of statistics to summarize the results\n
    \  on a stream of measurement packets.  Specifically, this memo proposes\n   a
    way to organize registry entries into columns that are well-\n   defined, permiting
    consistent development of entries over time.\n   Also, this fosters development
    of registry entries based on existing\n   reference RFCs for performance metrics,
    and requires expert review\n   for every entry before IANA action.\n\n\n\t "

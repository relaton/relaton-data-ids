  content: "   Segment routing is a new and powerful forwarding paradigm that allows\n
    \  packets to be steered through a network on paths other than the\n   shortest
    path derived from the routing protocol.  The approach uses\n   information encoded
    in the packet header and does not make use of a\n   signaling protocol to pre-install
    paths in the network.\n\n   Two different encapsulations have been defined to
    enable segment\n   routing in an MPLS network and in an IPv6 network.  While\n
    \  acknowledging that there is a strong need to support segment routing\n   in
    both environments, this document defines a converged, unified\n   approach to
    segment routing that enables a single mechanism to be\n   applied in both types
    of network.  The resulting approach is also\n   applicable to IPv4 networks without
    the need for any changes to the\n   IPv4 specification.\n\n   This document makes
    no changes to the segment routing architecture\n   and builds on existing protocol
    mechanisms such as the encapsulation\n   of MPLS within UDP defined in RFC 7510.\n\n\t "

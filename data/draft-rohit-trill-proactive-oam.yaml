abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Pro-active fault monitoring for TRILL monitors all the paths between\n
    \  any two given RBridges in the network. Number of paths to be\n   monitored
    can be of exponential order based on the distance between\n   two RBridges. In
    this document novel fault monitoring mechanism\n   based on a distributed approach
    is presented.\n\n\t "

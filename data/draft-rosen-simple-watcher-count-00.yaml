  content: "In large presence systems deployed in multiservice networks, presence\ninformation
    is often known by the network in addition to, or instead\nof the presentity's
    devices (endpoints).  Examples of such\ninformation include location and availability
    for various kinds of\nsession establishment.  Even if devices know the information,
    the\nnetwork often has more bandwidth and better scale to keep the\npresence server
    up to date.  A Presence Network Agent (PNA) can\npublish presence information
    to a Presence Server(PS).  When done\nlarge scale, the basic publish operation
    can be inefficient.  When\nthe network has millions of subscribers, only some
    of which have\nwatchers, blind Publish operations are unecessary.  WINFO can be
    used\nto determine watchers, but the efficiency of maintaining WINFO per\nsubscriber,
    and the size of the messages involved, make that solution\nunattractive.  The
    PNA would prefer to have the Presence Server\nsimply tell it when there was at
    least one watcher.\n\nThis document describes an XML document stored on the PS
    by which the\nPNA maintains a list of subscribers it can provide presence for
    as a\nSIP event package that tells the PNA when the number of watchers for\na
    presentity on the list (or a specific presence element for a\npresentity) goes
    from 0 to at least 1 or from 1 to 0.\n\t "

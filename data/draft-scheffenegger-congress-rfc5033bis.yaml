  content: "   The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown\n
    \  to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed\n   networks).
    \ Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion\n   control schemes that
    significantly differ from the IETF's congestion\n   control principles.  Using
    these new congestion control schemes in\n   the global Internet has possible ramifications
    to both the traffic\n   using the new congestion control and to traffic using
    the currently\n   standardized congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed\n
    \  with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control\n   proposals.
    \ The goal of this document is to provide guidance for\n   considering alternate
    congestion control algorithms within the IETF.\n\n\t "

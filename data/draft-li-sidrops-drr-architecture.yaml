abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) plays a crucial role
    in securing inter-domain routing. However, the current RPKI Repository system
    suffers from fundamental limitations in reliability, scalability, and consistency.
    In particular, single-point failures at repository publication points (PPs), the
    growing number of bidirectional connections between PPs and relying parties (RPs),
    and the lack of a globally consistent historical RPKI data view pose significant
    risks to the resilience, integrity, and authority of the global RPKI ecosystem.
    This document proposes the Decentralized RPKI Repository (dRR), a novel repository
    architecture that decouples RPKI object signing authority from RPKI object management
    authority (e.g., storage and distribution). dRR introduces a distributed group
    of certificate servers (CSs) and a layer of Monitors to achieve robust, scalable,
    and auditable RPKI data management. The architecture maintains full compatibility
    with the existing RPKI trust model rooted in the five RIR trust anchors, enabling
    incremental deployment without disrupting current relying parties (RPs) validation
    semantics. By doing so, dRR addresses longstanding repository challenges and enhances
    the overall efficiency and trustworthiness of RPKI-based routing security.</p>"

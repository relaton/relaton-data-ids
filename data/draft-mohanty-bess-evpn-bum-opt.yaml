  script: Latn
  content: "   In EVPN, the Broadcast, Unknown Unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic\n
    \  is sent to all the routers participating in the EVPN instance.  In a\n   multi-homing
    scenario, when more than one PEs share the same Ethernet\n   Segment, i.e. there
    are more than one PEs in a redundancy group, only\n   the PE that is the Designated-Forwarder
    (DF) for the ES will forward\n   that packet on the access interface whereas all
    non-DF PEs will drop\n   the packet.  In deployments such as EVPN Gateways (EVPN
    GW) or Data\n   Center Interconnect (DCI) routers, this can be quite wasteful.
    \ This\n   is especially true if there are significantly more EVPN GW or DCI PEs\n
    \  all participating in the same sets of ES and vES.  This draft\n   explores
    the problem and provides solutions for the same.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   One of the limitations of TCP is that it has limited space for TCP\n
    \  options, only 40 bytes.  Many mechanisms have been proposed for for\n   extending
    the TCP option space, but the biggest challenge has been to\n   get additional
    option space in the initial SYN packet.\n\n   This memo presents a optional four-way
    TCP handshake to allow\n   extended option space to be used in SYN packets in
    both directions.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides recommendations for the implementation of\n
    \  password-based cryptography, covering key derivation functions,\n   encryption
    schemes, message-authentication schemes, and ASN.1 syntax\n   identifying the
    techniques.\n\n   The recommendations are intended for general application within\n
    \  computer and communications systems, and as such include a fair\n   amount
    of flexibility. They are particularly intended for the\n   protection of sensitive
    information such as private keys, as in PKCS\n   #8. It is expected that application
    standards and implementation\n   profiles based on these specifications may include
    additional\n   constraints.\n\n   Other cryptographic techniques based on passwords,
    such as password-\n   based-key entity authentication and key establishment protocols
    are\n   outside the scope of this document.  Guidelines for the selection of\n
    \  passwords are also outside the scope.\n\n   This document represents a republication
    of PKCS #5 v2.1 from RSA\n   Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
    series. By\n   publishing this RFC, change control is transferred to the IETF.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token specification allows any party in\n   possession
    of a bearer token to get access to the associated\n   resources (without demonstrating
    possession of a cryptographic key).\n   To prevent misuse, two important security
    assumptions must hold:\n   bearer tokens must be protected from disclosure in
    storage and in\n   transport and the access token must only be valid for use with
    a\n   specific resource server (the audience) and with a specific scope.\n\n   This
    document defines a new header that is used by the client to\n   indicate what
    resource server, as the intended recipient, it wants to\n   access.  This information
    is subsequently also communicated by the\n   authorization server securely to
    the resource server, for example\n   within the audience field of the access token.\n\n\t "

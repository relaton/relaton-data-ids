  content: "   This document collects information required for the creation a\n   complete
    Presence and IM system using SIMPLE and other IETF\n   protocols.  This information
    has been spread out across numerous\n   other internet drafts and RFCs.  The document
    tries to put everything\n   together, discussing the servers involved, security
    mechanisms, call\n   flows, etc.  The goal of this document is that someone, who
    is not an\n   expert in the IETF protocols, can read this document and understand\n
    \  how the IETF protocols can be used for building a complete system and\n   how
    it should work.  SPECIFCATIONS SECTION TO BE UPDATED SHORTLY\n\t "

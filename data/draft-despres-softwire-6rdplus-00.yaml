  content: "The [6rd] mechanism permit IPv6 \"rapid deployment\" across IPv4\ninfrastructures
    of Internet Service Providers, but only in cases\nwhere customer-premise equipments
    can be upgraded to support it. 6rd+\nextends this IPv6 rapid deployment capability
    to hosts behind\ncustomer-premise equipments that cannot be upgraded (provided
    these\nhosts can be upgraded themselves to support 6rd+).  Like [6rd], 6rd+\nprovides
    native IPv6 addresses, so that quality of service can be\nguaranteed by Internet
    Service Providers; it operates statelessly,\nwhich ensures simplicity and scalability;
    and it transmits\nencapsulated IPv6 packets along optimized paths, which contributes
    to\nefficiency and acceptability.\n\t "

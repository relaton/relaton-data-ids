  content: "This Internet Draft describes an enhanced way to exchange prefix\ninformation,
    so as to permit multiple copies of a prefix, with\ndifferent paths, to be announced
    and withdrawn.\n\nThis negotiated capability facilitates faster local (inter-AS)
    and\nglobal (intra-AS) convergence, reduces path-hunting, improves route-\nreflector
    behaviour, including eliminating persistent oscillations.\n\nAdditional prefix
    instances have a new wire format for updates and\nwithdrawals, to control path
    selection.\n\nBenefits are seen both when deployed intra-AS, and on inter-AS\npeering.\n\nAuthor's
    Note\n\nThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related\ndraft(s)
    being placed on the Standards Track for idr.\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in [5].\n\t "

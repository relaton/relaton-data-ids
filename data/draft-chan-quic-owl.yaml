  content: "   This document discusses the use of One Way Latency (OWL) for\n   enhancing
    multipath transmission in QUIC.  Several representative\n   usages of OWL, such
    as congestion control mechanism, retransmission\n   policy, crucial data scheduling
    are analyzed.  Two kinds of OWL\n   measurement approaches are also provided and
    compared.  More\n   explorations related with OWL will be researched to improve
    the\n   performance of QUIC.\n\n\t "

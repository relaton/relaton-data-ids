  content: "   IP anycast [1] is a technology to share one IP address for Internet\n
    \  services with multiple server nodes.  It is now being deployed for\n   improving
    service reliability, scalability, and stability.\n\n   Especially, \"Global-Scope\"
    IP anycast is now being deployed for\n   authoritative name servers, typically
    for root servers.\n\n   RFC 3258 [2] describes a set of practices to apply IP
    anycast\n   technology for authoritative name servers.  And \"Operation of Anycast\n
    \  Services\" Internet-Draft [3] (hereafter, called \"Anycast BCP\")\n   describes
    a series of recommendations and considerations for\n   distribution of services
    using IP anycast.\n\n   On the other hand, operators of authoritative name servers
    can also\n   refer to RFC 2182 [4] and 2870 [5] for general guidances on\n   appropriate
    practices for authoritative name servers.\n\n   This memo describes the details
    of requirements and preconditions for\n   making \"Global-Scope\" IP anycast nodes
    for authoritative name\n   servers, with the conformance of the practices in RFC
    2182, 2870,\n   3258 and Anycast BCP.\n\n   And this memo also describes our findings
    and experiences for making\n   IP anycast nodes for us.  Authors hope that it
    is useful for DNS\n   operators that they will walk on the same way in the future,\n
    \  especially for TLD operators.\n\n\t "

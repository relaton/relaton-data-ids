  script: Latn
  content: "   As the BGP is deployed in a single Autonomous System using converged\n
    \  networks such as Seamless MPLS, it is desirable for BGP to carry more\n   IGP
    nexthop pathway information to help select routing more\n   intelligently.  One
    example of a Seamless MPLS deployment is the\n   Mobile BackHaul (MBH) deployment
    with multiple IGPs Areas per ASN.\n   This document describes a new optional transitive
    path attribute,\n   NEXTHOP_PATH_RECORD ATTRIBUTE for BGP that records the next
    hop path\n   which can be used by BGP network management to monitor and manage
    the\n   BGP infrastructure via management interfaces (such as I2RS).\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The motivation and use cases for interworking and transporting ITU-T\n
    \  DSS1 User-user information element data in SIP are described in the\n   \"Problem
    Statement and Requirements for Transporting User to User\n   Call Control Information
    in SIP\" document.  As networks move to SIP\n   it is important that applications
    requiring this data can continue to\n   function in SIP networks as well as the
    ability to interwork with\n   this ISDN service for end-to- end transparency.
    \ This document\n   defines a usage of the User-to-User header field to enable\n
    \  interworking with this ISDN service.\n\n   This document is covers the interworking
    with both public ISDN and\n   private ISDN capabilities, so the interworking with
    QSIG will also be\n   addressed.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects\n
    \  to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n   different
    domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\" of protocols
    to enable a horizontally unified IoT\n   architecture.  The objective of such
    an architecture is to make\n   resource objects securely accessible to applications
    across\n   organizations and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a few proposals\n
    \  have been made to build an application-layer based unified IoT\n   platform
    on top of today's host-centric Internet.  However, there is\n   a fundamental
    mismatch between the host-centric nature of today's\n   Internet and the mostly
    information-centric nature of the IoT domain.\n   To address this mismatch, the
    common set of protocols and network\n   services offered by an information-centric
    networking (ICN)\n   architecture can be leveraged to realize an ICN-based IoT
    (or ICN-\n   IoT) architecture that can take advantage of the salient features
    of\n   ICN such as naming, security, mobility, compute and efficient content\n
    \  and service delivery support offered by it.\n\n   In this draft, we summarize
    the general IoT demands, and ICN features\n   that support these requirements,
    and then discuss the challenges to\n   realize an ICN-based IoT framework.  Beyond
    this, the goal of this\n   draft is not to offer any specific ICN-IoT architectural
    proposal.\n\n\t "

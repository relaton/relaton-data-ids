    and authentication/\nauthorization.  This document describes what technologies
    can be used\nto solve these issues and analyzes the utility of SIP as a rendezvous\nmechanism
    for this use case.Conventions used in this document\n\nThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",

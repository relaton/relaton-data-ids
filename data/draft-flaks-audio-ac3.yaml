  content: "In recent years we have begun to see a convergence of Internet \ntechnologies
    with traditional media formats such as video and audio. \nIt is therefore likely
    that movies and television with surround \nsound capabilities are soon to be dispersed
    around the Internet.  \nAC-3 is standard multi-channel compression format for
    HDTV, DVD, and \nother video formats, but there is no uniform MIME type for these
    \nfiles\n\t "

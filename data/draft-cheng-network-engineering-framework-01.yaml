  content: "This document outlines an early draft of a Network Engineering (NE) \nframework.
    It defines the Network Engineering function and discusses \nthe differences between
    Traffic Engineering (TE) and Network \nEngineering. It identifies network architecture
    and major functional \ncapabilities for Network Engineering. Network Engineering
    provides a \nnew set of capabilities that is utilized in conjunction with Traffic
    \nEngineering to optimize the network efficiency, operation, and \nutilization.\n\t "

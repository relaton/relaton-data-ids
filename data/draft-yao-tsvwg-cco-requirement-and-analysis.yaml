  content: "   Gernerative AI applications depend on large scale parallel computing\n
    \  clusters for model training and inference.  Existing implementations\n   of
    collective communication in parallel computing is built on top of\n   RDMA, the
    most adoptable AI transport protocol.  However, One-to-\n   Many, Many-to-One,
    and Many-to-Many collective operations all depend\n   on point-to-point transport
    semantics of RDMA, which inevitably\n   introduces more bandwidth occupancy and
    transmission overhead.\n   Emerging approaches for collective communication optimization
    focus\n   on network-assisted collective acceleration and can work compatibly\n
    \  with RDMA.  This document analyzes different technical schemes for\n   network-assisted
    collective acceleration based on RDMA, and presents\n   the gap between these
    work and current IETF standards, notably iWARP.\n   Requirements for designing
    new standards are proposed accordingly.\n\n\n\t "

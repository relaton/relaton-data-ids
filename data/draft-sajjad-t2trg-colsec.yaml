  content: "   This document proposes an architecture for Collaborative Security and\n
    \  Proactive Defence against IoT Botnets.  The proposed architecture is\n   based
    on the violation of the Manufacturer Usage Description policy.\n   This architecture
    provides a means of sharing the attacker\n   information including its Command
    and Control Server information with\n   the peers in order to not only achieve
    proactive defense against\n   Internet of Things botnets but also mitigate them
    at its source end.\n\n\t "

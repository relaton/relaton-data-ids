  content: "This Internet Draft provides a bibliography of documents which address
    the routing and addressing scaling problems in the current IP architecture, and
    the design of the next generation of the IP protocol suite, commonly referred
    to as IPv7.                                                       This document
    is intended to simplify the process of locating all of the relevant documents
    pertaining to this area.  These documents take various forms, including Request
    For Comments (RFCs), Internet Drafts (I-Ds), and other papers produced either
    by Working Groups of the IETF or individuals actively working in this area.  It
    is suggested that Internet Drafts related to this topic reference this bibliography
    I-D, which will be updated on a regular basis as new documents are published or
    existing ones are modified or change status, e.g. from Internet Draft to RFC.\n\t "

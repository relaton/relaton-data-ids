abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies two elliptic curves over prime fields that offer
    a high level of practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport
    Layer Security (TLS). These curves are intended to operate at the ~128-bit and
    ~224-bit security level, respectively, and are generated deterministically based
    on a list of required properties.</p>"

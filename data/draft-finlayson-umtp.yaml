- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Many Internet hosts - such as PCs - while capable of running multicast\napplications,
    cannot access the MBone (or other wide-area multicast\nnetwork) because the router(s)
    that connect them to the Internet\ndo not yet support IP multicast routing.  The
    'UDP Multicast Tunneling\nProtocol' (UMTP) enables such a host to establish an
    'ad hoc' connection to the MBone by tunneling multicast UDP datagrams inside unicast
    UDP datagrams.  By using UDP, this tunneling can be implemented as a 'user level'
    application, without requiring changes to the host's\noperating system.\n\t "

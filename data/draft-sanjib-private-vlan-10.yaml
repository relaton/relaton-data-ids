  content: "This document describes a mechanism to achieve device isolation through
    the application of special Layer 2 forwarding constraints. Such a mechanism allows
    end devices to share the same IP subnet while being Layer 2 isolated, which in
    turn allows network designers to employ larger subnets and so reduce the address
    management overhead.\n\n Some of the numerous deployment scenarios of the aforementioned
    mechanism (which range from data center designs to Ethernet-to-the-home-basement
    networks) are mentioned in the following text to exemplify the mechanism's possible
    usages; however, this document is not intended to cover all such deployment scenarios
    nor delve into their details. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

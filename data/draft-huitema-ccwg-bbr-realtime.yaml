  content: "   We are studying the transmission of real-time Media over QUIC.  There\n
    \  are two priorities: maintain low transmission delays by avoiding\n   building
    queues, and use the available network capacity to provide\n   the best possible
    experience.  We found through experiments that\n   while the BBR algorithm generally
    allow us to correctly and timely\n   assess network capacity, we still see \"glitches\"
    in specific\n   conditions, in particular when using wireless networks.  We analyze\n
    \  these issues and propose small changes in the BBR algorithm that\n   could
    improve the quality of experience delivered by the real-time\n   media application.\n\n\t "

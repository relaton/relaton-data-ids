  content: "OSPF is the preferred interior routing protocol of the Internet.  It is\na
    complex protocol intended to deal with complex networks.  While it is\na powerful
    mechanism, it does not handle all situations, and its\nappropriate use may not
    be obvious to beginners.  Standards track documents\ndeal with protocol design,
    but deployment of OSPF in many enterprise\nnetworks has been limited by lack of
    information on best current practice\ninformation for interior routing.  Best
    Current Practices documents have\nfocused on general exterior connectivity. This
    memorandum is intended to\ncomplement the protocol specification by describing
    the experience-based,\nvendor-independent techniques of OSPF and complementary
    technologies in\nrepresentative networks.  Better understanding of the use of
    OSPF features\nto help exterior connectivity will help reduce the demand for complex
    user\nBGP configuration.\n\n\t "

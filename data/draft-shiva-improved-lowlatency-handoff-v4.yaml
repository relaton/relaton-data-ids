  content: "We are considering the IETF Mobile IP WG proposed Low Latency Handoff\ndraft[2]
    in the different network scenerios and suggesting one simpler\nsolution with low
    loss, reduced number of timers, reduced network \noverhead, along with the low
    latency. One more achievement will \nbe reduction in the dependency on exact L2
    trigger timing and \nPre-Registration timer expiration in Combined Handoff method[2].\n\t "

  content: "By collocating servers at base stations, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)\nprovides
    low latency to users for real time applications such as\nVirtual Reality and Augmented
    Reality. To satisfy the growing demand\nof users, base stations are deployed densely
    in highly populated\nareas. Coordinated Multipoint Transmission (CoMP) allows
    users to\nconnect to multiple base stations simultaneously. In ultra-dense\nnetworks,
    by offloading the partials of tasks to different base\nstations, users can achieve
    lower latency and utilize the computation\nability of the surrounding base stations.
    To control the signaling\noverhead, the number of base stations that can be connected
    should be\nlimited. In this paper, we propose a user-centric base station\nassignment
    algorithm by considering the possible load of base\nstations. Moreover, a partial
    task offloading algorithm is proposed\nto utilize the computation of under-loaded
    base stations. Resource\nallocation is then solved by convex optimization.\n\n\t "

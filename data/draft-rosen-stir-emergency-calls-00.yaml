    \  emergency calls by authorities to citizens need assurances that\n   headers
    intended to get appropriate priority from the networks they\n   traverse, and
    in some cases, appropriate routing.  Protection of the\n   SIP Resource Priority
    Header and the SIP Priority header is needed\n   for such calls.  This document
    describes the environment for placing\n   emergency calls and call backs which
    motivate the need and use of the\n   mechanisms described in other documents\n\n\t "

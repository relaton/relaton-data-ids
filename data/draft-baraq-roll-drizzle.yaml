  content: "   Trickle algorithm used in RPL routing protocol suffers from some\n
    \  issues related to power, network convergence time and overhead and\n   load-distribution.
    To optimize this algorithm for Low-power and Lossy\n   Networks (LLNs), a new
    algorithm called Drizzle is introduced.\n   Drizzle uses an adaptive suppression
    mechanism that permits the nodes\n   to have different transmission probabilities,
    which are consistent\n   with their transmission history. Compared to Trickle,
    Drizzle removes\n   the listen-only period from Drizzle's intervals, thus, leading
    to\n   faster convergence time. Furthermore, a new policy for setting the\n   redundancy
    coefficient has been used to mitigate the negative effect\n   of the short-listen
    problem presented when removing the listen-only\n   period and to further boost
    the fairness in the network.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "Service usage might require some form of compensation and this is\n   also
    true for many communication systems where an entity receiving a\n   call should
    be able to charge the caller.  This is necessary for\n   allowing fair communication
    between two communicating parties and is\n   a major strategy for reducing the
    viability of SPAM.  This draft\n   proposes an approach for doing this in SIP
    using the Security\n   Assertion Markup Language (SAML).  It relies on a third
    party to act\n   as a payment provider and is designed for low value transactions.
    \ It\n   does not aim to provide the same capability as other authentication,\n
    \  authorization and accounting backend infrastructures.\n\t "

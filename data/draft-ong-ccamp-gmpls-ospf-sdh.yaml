- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for\nSONET/SDH
    that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD\nsub-TLV and has been
    designed to be consistent with the work on\nTechnology Agnostic OSPF Traffic Engineering
    Extensions for \nGeneralized MPLS (GMPLS) [BA-TLV].\nThese formats are based on
    previous experience prototyping and\ntesting control plane for ASON networks and
    are proposed for\nadoption as a Standards Track RFC for support of ASON routing.\n\t "

  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based mobility protocol that\nenables
    mobility management for an IP host as it moves across\ndifferent points of attachment
    within the mobility domain.  An IP\nhost whose mobility is being managed by the
    network is unaware of the\naccess networks capability providing PMIPv6 mobility
    management on\nits behalf.  This draft proposes mechanisms by which the host is\ninformed
    of PMIPv6, as well as means to actively discover such\ncapability in the network
    the host is attaching to.  The ability of\nthe host to discover or be aware of
    PMIPv6 support in the access\nnetwork enables better decision making in terms
    of the network\nselection, attach procedure, choice of mobility management, as
    well\nas the service/session and even application configuration abilities.\n\t "

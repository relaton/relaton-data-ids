  script: Latn
  content: "   When the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing\n
    \  protocol is adopted by a highly symmetric network such as the Leaf-\n   Spine
    or Fat-Tree network, the Leaf nodes (e.g., Top of Rack switches\n   in datacenters)
    are recommended to be prevented from receiving other\n   nodes' explicit routes
    in order to achieve scalability.  However,\n   such a setup would cause traffic
    black-holes or suboptimal routing if\n   link failure happens in the network.
    \ This document introduces\n   INFINITE cost to IS-IS LSPs to solve this problem.\n\n\n\t "

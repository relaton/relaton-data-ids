  content: "This document justifies the need and lists the requirements for\ncorrelating
    SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) dialogs.  The\ncorrelated dialogs may or may
    not be related to the same multimedia\nsession.  Being able to logically correlate
    multiple SIP dialogs is\nuseful for applications that, for different reasons,
    need to\nestablish several SIP dialogs to provide a given service.  The\nlogical
    correlation of two SIP dialogs is also useful, for instance,\nto correlate an
    incoming with an outgoing dialog at a B2BUA.\n\t "

  content: "   Taking the opportunity of a fresh implementation of SCHC by a\n   newcomer
    to SCHC to reflect on the design principles and the\n   implications on the implication
    of SCHC.\n\n   Topics addressed:\n\n   *  The parser, as described in SCHC specification.\n\n
    \  *  A discussion on parsing and interpretation.\n\n   *  Practical implications
    of the specification of the parser of SCHC.\n\n   *  the challenge and opportunity
    of a generic parser implementation\n      able to handle any protocol stack and
    rules design to enable it.\n\n\t "

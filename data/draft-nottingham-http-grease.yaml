- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Like many network protocols, HTTP is vulnerable to ossification of\n
    \  its extensibility points.  This draft explains why HTTP ossification\n   is
    a problem and establishes guidelines for exercising those\n   extensions by 'greasing'
    the protocol to combat it.\n\n\t "

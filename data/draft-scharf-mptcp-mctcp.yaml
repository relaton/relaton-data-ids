- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Multipath transport over potentially different paths can be realized\nby
    several coupled Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections.\nMulti-Connection
    TCP (MCTCP) transport aggregates multiple TCP\nconnections between potentially
    different addresses into a single\nsession that can be accessed by an application
    like a single TCP\nconnection.  MCTCP encodes control information, as far as possible,\nin
    the payload of the TCP connections and therefore requires only\nminor changes
    in the TCP implementations, and it is transparent in\nthe single-path case.  MCTCP
    is therefore proposed as a simple,\nmodular, and extensible mechanism for multipath
    transport.\n\t "

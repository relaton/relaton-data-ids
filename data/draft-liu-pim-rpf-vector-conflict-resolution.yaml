  content: "   [RFC7891] Section 7 defines the handling principles for PIM Join\n
    \  attributes with same type of RFF Vector and Explicit RFP Vector, but\n   with
    different contents are received.\n\n   However, it does not address scenarios
    where one downstream router\n   includes a RFF Vector in its message while another
    does not. This\n   leaves the handling of such conflicts unspecified.\n\n   This
    document supplements the existing specifications by defining\n   the processing
    rules for this specific conflict scenario.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines an LDAP auxiliary object class and a single \nattribute,
    which together can be used to store and track the \nentities who may have accessed
    or modified a specific entry in an \nLDAP directory information tree. For example,
    an LDAP application \nmay need to store information which can indicate when an
    entry was \ncreated, when it was accessed, who modified it, and other kinds of
    \nsimilar information, with this information acting as a general-\npurpose auditing
    log for that entry. \nThe object class and attributes defined herein are designed
    for that \npurpose in particular, and are not intended to serve as detailed \nauditing
    information capable of withstanding court-of-law scrutiny, \nnor are they designed
    to be used for journaling-playback purposes. \nThey are simply to be used for
    storing general information about the \nchanges which have been made to a specific
    entry. \n\t "

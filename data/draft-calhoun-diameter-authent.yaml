  content: "This document describes the DIAMETER Dial-up User Authentication\nExtension
    that is used for ROAMOPS [4] purposes. This specification\nwas carefully designed
    to ease the burden of servers that must act as\nRADIUS/DIAMETER gateways, by re-using
    the same address space that\nRADIUS has defined [1]. Further, by re-using the
    same address space,\nit allows a single server to read the same dictiionary for
    both\nDIAMETER and RADIUS. This backward compatibility will hopefully\nfacilitate
    deployment of DIAMETER.\n\t "

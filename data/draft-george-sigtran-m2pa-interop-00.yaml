  content: "This document captures problems and issues discovered on the SIGTRAN\nmailing
    list and at M2PA Interoperability Tests. This document will be\nupdated after
    each interoperability test to include any new\nissues. Two basic sets of problems
    are identified by this draft: (1)\nissues that need to be addressed in the next
    revision of the M2PA\ndraft, and (2) issues that were found that are strictly
    implementation\nproblems.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo specifies methods for text media handling in multi-party\ncalls,
    where the text is carried by the RTP protocol.  Real-time text\nis carried in
    a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103.  Centralized\nmulti-party handling
    of real-time text is achieved through a media\ncontrol unit coordinating multiple
    RTP text streams into one single\nstream RTP session, identifying each stream
    with its own CSRC.\nIdentification for the streams are provided through the RTCP\nmessages.
    \ This mechanism enables the receiving application to\npresent the received real-time
    text medium in different ways\naccording to user preferences.  Some presentation
    related features\nare also described explaining suitable variations of transmission
    and\npresentation of text.  Call control features are described for the\nSIP environment,
    while the transport mechanisms should be suitable\nfor any IP based call control
    environment using RTP transport.  Two\nalternative methods using a single RTP
    stream and source\nidentification inline in the text stream are also described.\n\t "

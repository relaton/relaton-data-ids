  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract\n
    \  view of the provider network topology containing the points from\n   which
    its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN,\n   network slices).
    \ The data model augments the 'ietf-network' data\n   model by adding the concept
    of service attachment points (SAPs).  The\n   service attachment points are the
    points to which network services\n   (such as L3VPN or L2VPN) can be attached.
    \ The customer endpoint of\n   an attachment circuits are not covered in the SAP
    network topology.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a method for dynamically discovering resolvers\n
    \  that support encrypted transports, and introduces the concept of\n   designating
    a resolver to be used for a subset of client queries\n   based on domain.  This
    method is intended to work both for locally-\n   hosted resolvers and resolvers
    accessible over the broader Internet.\n\n\t "

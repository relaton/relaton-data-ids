  content: "This document describes an architecture aimed for reducing the\nlatency
    of network access authentication based on the Extensible\nAuthentication Protocol
    (EAP).  The architecture is based on the\ndesign of a new EAP method for which
    a standalone authenticator is\nused, and does not require any change to the EAP
    specification or the\nspecifications of existing EAP lower-layers.\n\t "

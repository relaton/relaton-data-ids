  content: "Mobility is rapidly becoming a rule rather than an exception in\ncommunication
    services and SIP is gaining widespread acceptance as\nthe signaling protocol for
    multimedia applications on the Internet.\nThus, it is essential to develop a mobility
    management scheme that\nutilizes salient features and capabilities of SIP as well
    as other\nprotocols (e.g., mobile IP) to support mobile services efficiently.\nWithout
    providing any specific solution, this document presents\npreliminary requirements
    and identifies the issues that need to be\nresolved in order to develop a mobility
    management scheme for\nsupporting multimedia applications in a SIP signaling and
    control\nenvironment.\n\t "

  content: "   This specification defined MoqTransport (moqt), an unified media\n
    \  delivery protocol over QUIC.  It aims at supporting multiple\n   application
    classes with varying latency requirements including ultra\n   low latency applications
    such as interactive communication and\n   gaming.  It is based on a publish/subscribe
    metaphor where entities\n   publish and subscribe to data that is sent through,
    and received\n   from, relays in the cloud.  The data is delivered in the strict\n
    \  priority order.  The information subscribed to is named such that\n   this
    forms an overlay information centric network.  The relays allow\n   for efficient
    large scale deployments.\n\n\t "

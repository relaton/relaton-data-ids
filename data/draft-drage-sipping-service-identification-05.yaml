  content: "This document describes private extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) that enable a network of trusted SIP servers to assert the service of authenticated
    users. The use of these extensions is only applicable inside an administrative
    domain with previously agreed-upon policies for generation, transport, and usage
    of such information. This document does NOT offer a general service identification
    model suitable for use between different trust domains or for use in the Internet
    at large.\n\n The document also defines a URN to identify both services and User
    Agent (UA) applications. This URN can be used within the SIP header fields defined
    in this document to identify services, and also within the framework defined for
    caller preferences and callee capabilities to identify usage of both services
    and applications between end UAs. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

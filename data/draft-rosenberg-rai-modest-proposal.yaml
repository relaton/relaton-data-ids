- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become widely deployed on\nthe
    Internet, covering a wide range of usages from toll bypass to\ninstant messaging,
    from service provider to enterprise.  However, its\nrealization in actual deployments
    differs in important ways from the\nspecifications.  This has created a gulf between
    existing and ongoing\nstandards work, and real live deployments.  This document
    argues that\nthe RAI area should focus on solving real world interoperability\nissues
    and address real world functional gaps.\n\t "

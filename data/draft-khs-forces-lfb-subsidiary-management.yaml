  content: "   Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using the\n   Forwarding
    and Control Element Separation (ForCES) architecture to\n   manage resources other
    than packet forwarding.  In that spirit, the\n   Forwarding Element Manager (FEM)
    is modelled by creating a Logical\n   Functional Block (LFB) to represent its
    functionality.  We refer to\n   this LFB as the FE Configuration (FEC) LFB.  A
    Control Element (CE)\n   that controls a Forwarding Element's (FE) resources can
    also manage\n   its configuration via the FEC LFB.  This document introduces the
    FEC\n   LFB, an LFB that specifies the configuration parameters of an FE.\n\n\t "

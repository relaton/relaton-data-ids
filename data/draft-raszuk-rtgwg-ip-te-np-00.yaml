  content: "   This document describes a control plane based IP Traffic Engineering\n
    \  Architecture where path information is kept in the control plane by\n   selected
    nodes instead of being inserted into each packet on ingress\n   of an administrative
    domain.  The described proposal is also fully\n   compatible with the concept
    of network programming.\n\n   It is positioned as a complimentary technique to
    native SRv6 and can\n   be used when there are concerns with increased packet
    size due to\n   depth of SID stack, possible concerns regarding exceeding MTU
    or more\n   strict simplicity requirements typically seen in number of enterprise\n
    \  networks.  The proposed solution is applicable to both IPv4 or IPv6\n   based
    networks.\n\n   As an additional added value, detection of end to end path liveness\n
    \  as well as dynamic path selection based on real time path quality is\n   integrated
    from day one in the design.\n\n\t "

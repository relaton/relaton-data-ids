  content: "   Network mobility is proposed to let a mobile network change its point\n
    \  of attachment and still to keep all nodes attached to the mobile\n   network
    globally reachable.  However, due to scare bandwidth, limited\n   signaling coverage
    and frequent link failure, a mobile network needs\n   multihoming, i.e., multiple
    paths simultaneously to access the\n   Internet, on the perspective of performance
    and reliability.  The\n   document specifies how to support multihoming in network
    mobility\n   using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The proposed Multihomed\n
    \  SIP-based Network Mobility (SIP-NEMO) can dynamically select a path\n   per
    session according to the status of egress interfaces and/or\n   gateways.\n\n\n\n\t "

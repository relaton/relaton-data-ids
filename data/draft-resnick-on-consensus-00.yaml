  content: "   The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through\n
    \  a consensus process, taking into account the different views among\n   IETF
    participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on\n   technical matters.
    \ In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run\n   by a \"majority rules\"
    philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals\n   like \"humming\" instead of
    voting.  However, more and more of our\n   actions are now indistinguishable from
    voting, and quite often we are\n   letting the majority win the day.  This document
    is a collection of\n   thoughts on what rough consensus is, how we have gotten
    away from it,\n   and the things we can do in order to really achieve rough consensus.\n\n\t "

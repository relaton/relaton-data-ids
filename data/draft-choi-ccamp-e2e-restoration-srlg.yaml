  content: "   This draft describes the concept of the SRLG-based logical ring \n
    \  configuration and recovery method using the ring-SRLG for the purpose of \n
    \  restoration in mesh networks. In this restoration architecture, backup \n   paths
    can be easily established through the end-to-end path, which \n   follows the
    logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment \n   of backup path
    disjointed from the working path. We also propose the \n   GMPLS signaling extension
    for the end-to-end restoration based on the \n   SRLG-based logical ring configuration.

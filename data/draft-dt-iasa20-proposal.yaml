  content: "   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally\n   established
    in 2005.  In the intervening years, the needs of the IETF\n   have evolved in
    ways that require changes to its administrative\n   structure.  The IETF Chair
    started an effort in November of 2016 to\n   begin the process of changing the
    IETF administrative structure,\n   starting with a set of virtual workshops to
    get input from the IETF\n   community, and then encompassing a series of BOF sessions
    at IETF\n   meetings to define the problem, develop requirements, explore\n   potential
    options for changes, and a Design Team - the authors of\n   this document - that
    would make recommendations.  The purpose of this\n   document is to collect all
    of the various materials that have lead up\n   to the Design Team recommendation
    that IETF be a Disregarded Limited\n   Liability Company (LLC) of the Internet
    Society.\n\n\t "

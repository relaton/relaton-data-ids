  script: Latn
  content: "Layer 2 interfaces fundamentally operate as either broadcast or \npoint-to-point.
    \ From these primitives, additional layer 3 interface \nconstructs such as non-broadcast
    multiple access and point-to-\nmultipoint are created as necessary.  This approach
    has served the \nwired Internet well.  However this memo argues that a third type
    of \nlayer 2 interface is necessary to seamlessly extend IP over dynamic \nnetworks,
    principally wireless.  This interface, here termed a \n'triggered' interface,
    combines traditional broadcast interface \naddressing semantics (i.e. support
    for unicast, multicast and \nbroadcast link layer addresses) with layer 2 trigger
    support for the \ndynamic creation of peer-to-peer interface associations within
    an \notherwise broadcast interface.  Its intended domain of applicability \ncovers
    cellular, WLAN, MANET, etc; in short all currently envisioned \nforms of dynamic
    wireless networking.\n\t "

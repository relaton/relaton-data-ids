  content: "   The SCIM 2.0 Core API defines a simple profile for searching for\n
    \  specific resource types using filters and qualifiers in combination\n   with
    the HTTP GET verb.  The Token Search specification defines the\n   following additional
    features:\n\n   o  Specification of search terms within an HTTP POST verb to avoid\n
    \     accidental leakage of confidential information via HTTP GET URLs,\n\n   o
    \ An optional result set token enabling clients to page through\n      results
    in a state consistent fashion, and\n\n   o  The ability to search across multiple
    resource types (endpoints)\n      and return one or more resource types.\n\n\n\t "

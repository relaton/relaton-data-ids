  content: "\n   This memo presents the third version of a protocol for a peer-to-peer\n
    \  based chat system.  In this version it is extended for supporting\n   message
    exchange in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) that suffer from\n   node mobility.
    \ Messages can be cryptographically signed, encrypted\n   and anonymized allowing
    authentic and closed group communication as\n   well as anonymous communication.
    \ This work is input for a practical\n   course on software engineering at Technische
    Universitaet\n   Braunschweig.  It is experimental work that is not intended to
    go to\n   the IETF standards track.\n\n\t "

  content: "A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location-\nrelated
    measurement data to a LIS within a request for location\ninformation.  Location-related
    measurement information are\nobservations concerning properties related to the
    position of a\nDevice, which could be data about network attachment or about the\nphysical
    environment.  When a LIS generates location information for\na Device, information
    from the Device can improve the accuracy of the\nlocation estimate.  A basic set
    of location-related measurements are\ndefined, including common modes of network
    attachment as well as\nassisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.\n\t "

  content: "   The advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC)\n
    \  will threaten the public key cryptography that is currently in use in\n   today's
    secure internet protocol infrastructure.  To address this,\n   organizations such
    as the National Institute of Standards and\n   Technology (NIST) will standardize
    new post-quantum cryptography\n   (PQC) that is resistant to attacks by both classical
    and quantum\n   computers.  After PQC algorithms are standardized, the widespread\n
    \  implementation of this cryptography will be contingent upon adapting\n   current
    protocols to accommodate PQC.  Hybrid solutions are one way\n   to facilitate
    the transition between traditional and PQ algorithms:\n   they use both a traditional
    and a PQ algorithm in order to perform\n   encryption or authentication, with
    the guarantee that the given\n   security property will still hold in the case
    that one algorithm\n   fails.  Hybrid solutions can be constructed in many ways,
    and the\n   cryptographic community has already begun to explore this space.\n
    \  This document introduces non-composite hybrid authentication, which\n   requires
    updates at the protocol level and limits impact to the\n   certificate-issuing
    infrastructure.\n\n\t "

  content: "   To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions\n
    \  need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments\n   aspects
    specified as Type-P for test packets.  This memo proposes to\n   update the IP
    Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework with advanced\n   considerations for measurement
    methodology and testing.  The existing\n   framework mostly assumes deterministic
    connectivity, and that a\n   single test stream will represent the characteristics
    of the path\n   when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved
    and\n   test stream descriptions must evolve with them, otherwise unexpected\n
    \  network features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo\n   describes
    new stream parameters for both network characterization and\n   support of application
    design using IPPM metrics.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Despite many years of effort, simple username-password authentication\nis
    still prevalent.  In many cases a password is the only credential\navailable to
    the end user.  IKEv2 uses EAP as a sub-protocol for user\nauthentication.  This
    provides a well-specified and extensible\narchitecture.  To this day EAP does
    not provide a simple password-\nbased authentication method.  The only existing
    password\nauthentication methods either require the peer to know the password\nin
    advance (EAP-MD5), or are needlessly complex when used within\nIKEv2 (e.g.  PEAP).
    \ This document codifies the common practice of\nusing EAP-GTC for this type of
    authentication, with the goal of\nachieving maximum interoperability.  The various
    security issues are\nextensively analyzed.\n\t "

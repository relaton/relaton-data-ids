    addresses associated with IKE and IPsec Security\n   Associations.  The extension
    also includes features that assist in\n   selecting which addresses to use, and
    verify return routability\n   during and after updates.  It is also able to work
    together with NAT\n   Traversal in some scenarios.\n\t "

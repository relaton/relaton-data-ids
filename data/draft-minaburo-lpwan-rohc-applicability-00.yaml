  content: "   This document makes a survey of the way to adapt the RoHC mechanisms\n
    \  to the LPWAN networks.  It aims to show that RoHC header compression\n   is
    not adapted for the constrained LPWAN networks.  RoHC was defined\n   to reduce
    the overhead over point-to-point connections for multimedia\n   flows, which does
    not correspond to the LPWAN traffic description.\n   RoHC is not able to reduce
    the use of battery and optimize the energy\n   lifetime.  If RoHC is used it will
    need a big effort to be adapted,\n   there would be some problems to preserve
    a good transmission and\n   packet lost will cause a context desynchronisation
    which implies a\n   transmission of a complete header.  LP-WAN's are different\n
    \  technologies covering different applications based on long range, low\n   bandwidth
    and low power operation.\n\n\t "

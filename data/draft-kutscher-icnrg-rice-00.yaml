  content: "   Information Centric Networking has been proposed as a new network\n
    \  layer for the Internet, capable of encompassing the full range of\n   networking
    facilities provided by the current IP architecture.  In\n   addition to the obvious
    content-fetching use cases which have been\n   the subject of a large body of
    work, ICN has also shown promise as a\n   substrate to effectively support remote
    computation, both pure\n   functional programming (as exemplified by Named Function
    Networking)\n   and more general remote invocation models such as RPC and web\n
    \  transactions.  Providing a unified remote computation capability in\n   ICN
    presents some unique challenges, among which are timer\n   management, client
    authorization, and binding to state held by\n   servers, while maintaining the
    advantages of ICN protocol designs\n   like CCN and NDN.  This document specifies
    a unified approach to\n   remote method invocation in ICN that exploits the attractive
    ICN\n   properties of name-based routing, receiver-driven flow and congestion\n
    \  control, flow balance, and object-oriented security while presenting\n   a
    natural programming model to the application developer.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In a multipoint Telepresence conference, there are more than two\n
    \  sites participating.  Additional complexity is required to enable\n   media
    streams from each participant to show up on the displays of the\n   other participants.
    \ Common policies to address the multipoint case\n   include \"site-switch\" and
    \"segment-switch\".  The document will\n   discuss these policies as well as the
    \"composed\" policy and how they\n   work in the multipoint case.\n\n   The current
    CLUE framework document contains the \"composed\" and\n   \"switched\" attributes
    to describe situations where a capture is mix\n   or composition of streams or
    where the capture represents a dynamic\n   subset of streams.  \"Composed\" and
    \"switched\" are capture level\n   attributes.  In addition to these attributes
    the framework defines an\n   attribute \"Scene-switch-policy\" on a capture scene
    entry (CSE) level\n   which indicates how the captures are switched.\n\n   This
    draft discusses composition/switching in CLUE and makes a number\n   of proposals
    to better define and support these capabilities.\n\n\t "

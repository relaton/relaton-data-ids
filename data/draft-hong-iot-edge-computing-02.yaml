  content: "   This document describes new challenges such as strict latency,\n   constrained
    network bandwidth and devices, intermittent connectivity,\n   privacy and security,
    for IoT services originated from the IoT\n   environmental changes.  In order
    to address those new challenges, the\n   integration of Edge computing and IoT
    has been emerged as a promising\n   solution.  This document discribes the concept
    of IoT integrated with\n   Edge computing as well as its use cases.  It also discusses
    benefits\n   and challenges of Edge computing.  The direction of Edge computing\n
    \  for IoT should be discussed in the IETF/IRTF.\n\n\t "

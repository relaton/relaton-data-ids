  script: Latn
  content: "   Considering movement characteristics of mobile users, the authors\n
    \  have proposed a kind of soft-handoff-supporting motion-prediction-\n   and-QoS-negotiation-based
    fan-shaped flexible resource reservation\n   mechanism, which can provide QoS
    guarantees to mobile user\n   effectively. The signaling overhead for handoff
    gets effective\n   control by reverse rerouting mechanisms, being much advantageous
    than\n   partial rerouting and complete rerouting. Combining the above two\n   mechanisms,
    soft handoff can be guaranteed and high resource\n   utilization can be attained
    in the mobile wireless Internet.\n   Simulation has shown the proposed mechanisms
    are both efficient and\n   effective.\n\t "

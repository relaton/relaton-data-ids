  content: "   RFC 6296 introduces IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6).\n
    \  By deploying NPTv6, a site can achieve addressing independence\n   without
    contributing to excessive routing table growth.  Section 2.4\n   of RFC 6296 proposes
    an NPTv6 architecture for sites that are homed\n   to multiple upstream providers.
    \ By deploying the proposed\n   architecture, a multihomed site can achieve access
    redundancy and\n   load balancing, in addition to addressing independence.\n\n
    \  This memo proposes an alternative NPTv6 architecture for hosts that\n   are
    homed to multiple upstream providers.  The architecture described\n   herein provides
    transport-layer survivability, in addition to the\n   benefits mentioned above.
    \ In order to provide transport-layer\n   survivability, the architecture described
    herein requires a small\n   amount of additional configuration.\n\n   This memo
    updates RFC 6296.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for\n
    \  software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from basic\n   deployments
    to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-tenant\n   systems.  This document
    specifies the Workload Proof Token (WPT), a\n   mechanism for workloads to prove
    possession of the private key\n   associated with a Workload Identity Token (WIT).
    \ The WPT is a signed\n   JWT that binds the workload's authentication to a specific
    HTTP\n   request, providing application-level proof of possession for\n   workload-to-workload
    communication.  This specification is designed\n   to work alongside the WIT credential
    format defined in draft-ietf-\n   wimse-workload-creds and can be combined with
    other WIMSE protocols\n   in multi-hop call chains.\n\n\t "

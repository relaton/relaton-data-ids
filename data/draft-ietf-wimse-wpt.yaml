abstract:
- content: "<p>The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for
    software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from basic deployments
    to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-tenant systems. This document specifies
    the Workload Proof Token (WPT), a mechanism for workloads to prove possession
    of the private key associated with a Workload Identity Token (WIT). The WPT is
    a signed JWT that binds the workload's authentication to a specific HTTP request,
    providing application-level proof of possession for workload-to-workload communication.
    This specification is designed to work alongside the WIT credential format defined
    in draft-ietf- wimse-workload-creds and can be combined with other WIMSE protocols
    in multi-hop call chains.</p>"

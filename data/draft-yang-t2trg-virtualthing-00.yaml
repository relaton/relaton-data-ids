  content: "   This document provides guidance of IoT architecture based on virtual\n
    \  thing environment for security. In the heterogeneous IoT environment,\n   Internet
    of Things(IoT) have a limitation in adapting management\n   function such as updating
    software, adopting various general\n   cryptography mechanisms since they have
    limited processing power,\n   storage space and transmission capacities. Moreover,
    IoT could not\n   support all of requirement for IoT management function in\n
    \  heterogeneous environment. Especially, security is one of the issue\n   in
    heterogeneous environments. Therefore, this draft describes IoT\n   architecture
    based on virtual thing environment and classify the\n   requirements as well as
    problem statement.\n\n\t "

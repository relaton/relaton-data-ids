abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The latency associated with Mobile IPv6's Return Routability test can\n
    \  have an adverse impact on delay-sensitive applications.  Early\n   Binding
    Updates mitigate this issue by already using a new care-of\n   address in parallel
    with testing it.  We propose and analyze a\n   credit-based mechanism that prevents
    misuse of Early Binding Updates\n   for amplified flooding attacks and discourages
    such misuse for\n   non-amplified flooding attacks.\n\t "

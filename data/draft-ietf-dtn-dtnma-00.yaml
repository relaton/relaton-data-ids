  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a management architecture suitable for\n   deployment
    in the Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture.  The\n   DTN environment
    is characterized by a lack of end-to-end connectivity\n   and communications delays
    that are both long-lives and unpredictable.\n   A DTN Management Architecture
    (DTNMA) is needed that can operate\n   without human- or system-in-the-loop synchronous
    interactivity and\n   without reliance on transport-layer sessions.\n\n   Within
    a DTNMA, nodes must provide both eventual data exchange and\n   in-time local
    protection.  This can be accomplished with the use of\n   autonomous and asynchronous
    configuration and reporting.  Despite the\n   significant challenges to data transport,
    nodes must exhibit behavior\n   that is both determinable and autonomous while
    maintaining as much\n   compatibility with non-challenged-network operations concepts
    as\n   possible.\n\n   The DTNMA is supported by two types of asynchronous behavior.
    \ First,\n   the DTNMA does not presuppose any synchronized transport behavior\n
    \  between managed and managing devices.  Second, the DTNMA does not\n   support
    any query-response semantics.  In this way, the DTNMA allows\n   for operation
    in extremely challenging conditions, to include over\n   uni-directional links
    and cases where delays/disruptions prevent\n   operation over traditional transport
    layers.\n\n\t "

  content: "OCBT is a CBT-based multicast protocol that allows multiple cores for\n
    \  a multicast group.  The goal in OCBT is to set up and mantain a\n   unique
    bidirectional multicast tree connecting members with cores,\n   and also cores
    among themselves. This tree is used to deliver\n   multicast traffic to members
    of the multicast group.  To accomplish\n   that objective, members, non-member
    senders, routers with members and\n   cores must know the IP unicast address of
    cores and the IP multicast\n   address for the multicast group.  This is a key
    issue in tree-based\n   multicast protocols using centers, cores, or rendevous
    points, and\n   their main source of lack of scalability.  In OCBT this key issue
    is\n   open.\n \n   In this Internet-Draft we proposed to use Static Multicast
    as an\n   scalable solution to this problem.\n\t "

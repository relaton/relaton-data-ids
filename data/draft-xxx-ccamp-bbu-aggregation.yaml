  content: "   This document specifies a usecase, called BBU aggregation, for\n   integreting
    radio and optical networks.  It aims to compact several\n   low-utilized BBU cards
    into one BBU to improve the BBU utilization.\n   A flexible optical fronthaul
    network is connecting BBU and RRU to\n   enable BBU aggregation by recongfiguring
    the lightpath between BBU\n   and RRU.  The procedure of the usecase is based
    on the unified radio\n   and optical control archtecture, and an extended OpenFlow
    protocol is\n   introduced to realize the procedure.\n\n\t "

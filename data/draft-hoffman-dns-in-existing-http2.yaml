  content: "   This draft is now a tombstone.  The -00 version of this document has\n
    \  a likely-bad suggestion of how to run DNS service over existing\n   HTTP/2
    connections over TLS, such as those being used for HTTP for\n   basic web service.
    \ The author no longer recommends to do this.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes CSIP, a protocol architecture that provides the\nsupport
    of TCAP user applications over an IP network. The core part of\nthe CSIP architecture
    is the specification of the CSIP (Connectionless\nSCCP over IP) adaptation layer,
    that provides adaptation between the\nSCCP layer already defined in [2] and the
    IP family protocols IP, UDP,\nTCP and ICMP. UDP is used when SCCP class 0 is used,
    TCP is used\nwhen SCCP class 1 is used. CSIP provides the primitives and parameters\nto
    SCCP than MTP, and provides backward compatibility that guarantees\nthe seamless
    connection between nodes implementing CSIP and classical\nSS7 nodes by means of
    a CSIP gateway. The design of CSIP is oriented to\nfulfill the requirements of
    TCAP user applications running on a WAN.\n\t "

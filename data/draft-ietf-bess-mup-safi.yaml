  content: "   This document defines a new SAFI known as a BGP Mobile User Plane\n
    \  (BGP-MUP) SAFI to support MUP Extensions and a extended community for\n   BGP.
    \ This document also provides BGP signaling and procedures for\n   the new SAFI
    to convert mobile session information into appropriate\n   IP forwarding information.
    \ These extensions can be used by operators\n   between a PE, and a Controller
    for integrating mobile user plane into\n   BGP MUP network using the IP based
    routing.\n\n\t "

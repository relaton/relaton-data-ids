abstract:
- content: "<p>IP/LDP Fast-Reroute with Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT-FRR) is a technology
    that gives link-protection and node-protection with 100% coverage in any network
    topology that is still connected after the failure. MRT-FRR creates two alternate
    trees separate from the primary next- hop forwarding used during stable operation.
    These two trees are maximally diverse from each other, providing link and node
    protection for 100% of paths and failures as long as the failure does not cut
    the network into multiple pieces. This document spcifies how data plane protocols
    can be applied to operations and maintenance procedures for MRT. The document
    is structured to outline how Operations and Management functionality can be used
    to assist in fault management.</p>"

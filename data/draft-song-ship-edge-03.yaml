  content: "   To mitigate the IPv6 header overhead and improve the scalability and\n
    \  performance in edge networks, this draft proposes to use short\n   hierarchical
    IP addresses excluding the network prefix within edge\n   networks.  An edge network
    can be further organized into a\n   hierarchical architecture containing one or
    more levels of networks.\n   While each end node only needs to keep a short address
    suffix as its\n   identifier, the border routers for each hierarchical level are\n
    \  responsible for address augmenting and pruning when a packet leaves\n   or
    enter a lower level network.  Specifically, the top-level border\n   routers of
    an edge network convert the internal IP header to and from\n   the standard IPv6
    header.  This draft presents an incrementally\n   deployable scheme allowing packet
    header to be effectively compressed\n   in edge networks without affecting the
    network interoperability.\n   Simplifying both network data plane and control
    plane, the SHIP\n   architecture is suitable for any types of edge networks, especially\n
    \  when low latency, high performance, and high bandwidth efficiency are\n   required.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "It has often been the case that manageability considerations have been
    retrofitted to protocols after they have been specified, standardized, implemented,
    or deployed. This is sub-optimal. Similarly, new protocols or protocol extensions
    are frequently designed without due consideration of manageability requirements.\n\n
    The Operations Area has developed \"Guidelines for Considering Operations and
    Management of New Protocols and Protocol Extensions\" (RFC 5706), and those guidelines
    have been adopted by the Path Computation Element (PCE) Working Group.\n\n Previously,
    the PCE Working Group used the recommendations contained in this document to guide
    authors of Internet-Drafts on the contents of \"Manageability Considerations\"
    sections in their work. This document is retained for historic reference. This
    document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of metrics for high-precision networking
    services. These metrics can be used to assess the service levels that are being
    delivered for a networking flow. Specifically, they can be used to determine the
    degree of compliance with which service levels are being delivered relative to
    service level objectives that were defined for the flow. The metrics can be used
    as part of flow records and/or accounting records. They can also be used to continuously
    monitor the quality with which high-precision networking service are being delivered.</p>"

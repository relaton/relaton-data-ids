  content: "   Mailing Lists often make changes to a message before it is\n   retransmitted.
    \ This invalidates DKIM signatures, causing a DMARC\n   test on the RFC5322.From
    addres to fail.  A DMARC-compliant mailing\n   list is one which uses member alias
    addresses to identify the\n   document as sent by a specific author via the mechanism
    of the list.\n   An appropriate aliasing mechanism will not only prevent DMARC
    FAIL,\n   but will also allow messages between members, will look natural to\n
    \  senders and recipients, and will allow list organization domains to\n   advance
    to p=reject.  This document describes an aliasing approach\n   which meets these
    goals.\n\n\t "

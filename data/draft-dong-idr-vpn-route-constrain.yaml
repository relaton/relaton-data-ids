  content: "There are some problems with current RT-Constrain mechanism defined \nin
    RFC 4684. Firstly, the IPv6 address specific Route Target defined \nin [RFC5701]
    cannot be accommodated in current RT membership NLRI. \nSecondly, the distribution
    of RT-Constrain information cannot build \ncorrect VPN distribution graph when
    hierarchical route reflection (RR) \nis  used.  Thirdly,  current  RT-Constrain
    \ mechanism  is  used  for \nfiltering of all kinds of VPN services and can result
    in imprecise \nVPN route distribution when multiple VPN services are deployed
    in the \nnetwork. \n\nThis document describes the above problems in detail and
    proposes \nsolutions for these problems. A generalized RT-Constrain mechanism
    is \ndefined to accommodate the IPv6 address specific Route Target and to \nprecisely
    control propagation of different kinds of VPN routing \ninformation. The proposed
    solution avoids unnecessary advertising and \nreceiving of VPN routes when multiple
    VPN services are deployed. This \ndocument also proposes modifications of advertisement
    rules of RT-\nConstrain information to ensure the integrity of VPN distribution
    \ngraph. \n\n\t "

  content: "This draft specifies the first three levels of operation of an http based
    distributed search protocol. It is designed for parallel client-side searching
    \ of geospatial  catalogues. An important design objective is to minimize the
    impact and extra resources for catalogue sites which already have existing WWW
    gateways and search interfaces.\n\t "

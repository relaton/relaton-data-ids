  content: "This document describes a \"Layer2-Aware\" IPv4-to-IPv4 (NAT44) Service\nProvider
    NAT function that identifies subscriber traffic based on IP-\nindependent methods
    such as a link-layer address, VLAN, PPP session,\ntunnel, etc. in order to allow
    one to either avoid \"double-NAT\"\n(NAT444) of subscriber IP traffic altogether,
    the need for additional\n\"Shared Service-Provider\" IPv4 address space, or partitioning
    of RFC\n1918 space between subscribers.  While the mechanisms described in\nthis
    document may be applicable to a variety of network\narchitectures, the primary
    focus is on residential \"fixed-line\"\nInternet access.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The link quality mechanism of the MANET Neighborhood Discovery\n   Protocol
    (NHDP) enables \"ignoring\" some 1-hop neighbors if the\n   measured link quality
    from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable\n   threshold, while still retaining
    the corresponding link information\n   as acquired from HELLO message exchange.
    \ This allows immediate\n   reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link quality
    later\n   improves sufficiently.\n\n   NHDP also collects information about symmetric
    2-hop neighbors.\n   However it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop
    neighbor\n   ceases being symmetric, including while \"ignored\" as described
    above,\n   then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed.  This may\n
    \  lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being permanently\n   removed
    (until further HELLO messages are received) if the link\n   quality of a symmetric
    1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable\n   threshold, even if only for a moment.\n\n
    \  This specification updates NHDP, and the Optimized Link State Routing\n   Protocol
    version 2 (OLSRv2) to permit retaining, but ignoring,\n   symmetric 2-hop information
    when the link quality from the\n   corresponding 1-hop neighbor drops below the
    acceptable threshold.\n   This allows immediate reinstatement of the symmetric
    2-hop neighbor\n   if the link quality later improves sufficiently, thus making
    the\n   symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more \"robust\".\n\n\t "

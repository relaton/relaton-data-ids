  content: "   This document specifies a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload\n
    \  format to be used for transporting video encoded with JPEG XS (ISO/\n   IEC
    21122).  JPEG XS is a low-latency, lightweight image coding\n   system.  Compared
    to an uncompressed video use case, it allows higher\n   resolutions and video
    frame rates while offering visually lossless\n   quality, reduced power consumption,
    and encoding-decoding latency\n   confined to a fraction of a video frame.\n\n
    \  This document is a necessary revision of [RFC9134] to add support for\n   new
    features introduced by the 3rd edition of JPEG XS.  It obsoletes\n   [RFC9134]
    but the revised payload format is designed such that\n   existing compliant implementations
    of [RFC9134] remain valid to the\n   updated payload format.  In addition, this
    document integrates the\n   errata of [RFC9134] and provides improvements and
    clarifications to\n   the text where applicable.\n\n\t "

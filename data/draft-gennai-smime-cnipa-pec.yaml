  content: "Since 1997, the Italian laws have recognized electronic delivery systems
    as legally usable. In 2005, after two years of technical tests, the characteristics
    of an official electronic delivery service, named certified electronic mail (in
    Italian \"Posta Elettronica Certificata\") were defined, giving the system legal
    standing.\n\n The design of the entire system was carried out by the National
    Center for Informatics in the Public Administration of Italy (DigitPA), followed
    by efforts for the implementation and testing of the service. The DigitPA has
    given the Italian National Research Council (CNR), and in particular the Institute
    of Information Science and Technologies at the CNR (ISTI), the task of running
    tests on providers of the service to guarantee the correct implementation and
    interoperability. This document describes the certified email system adopted in
    Italy. It represents the system as it is at the moment of writing, following the
    technical regulations that were written based upon the Italian Law DPR. November
    2, 2005. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.\n\t "

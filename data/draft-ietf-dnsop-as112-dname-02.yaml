  script: Latn
  content: "   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that\n
    \  are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in\n   RFC
    1918 for private use within individual sites.\n\n   Devices in such environments
    may occasionally originate Domain Name\n   System (DNS) queries (so-called \"reverse
    lookups\") corresponding to\n   those private-use addresses.  Since the addresses
    concerned have only\n   local significance, it is good practice for site administrators
    to\n   ensure that such queries are answered locally.  However, it is not\n   uncommon
    for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the\n   public DNS instead
    of being answered within the site.\n\n   It is not possible for public DNS servers
    to give useful answers to\n   such queries.  In addition, due to the wide deployment
    of private-use\n   addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume
    of\n   such queries is large and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide\n
    \  a distributed sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on\n   the
    IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers.  The AS112 project is named\n   after the
    Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was assigned to it.\n\n   The AS112 project
    does not accommodate the addition and removal of\n   DNS zones elegantly.  Since
    additional zones of definitively local\n   significance are known to exist, this
    presents a problem.  This\n   document describes modifications to the deployment
    and use of AS112\n   infrastructure that will allow zones to be added and dropped
    much\n   more easily.\n\n\t "

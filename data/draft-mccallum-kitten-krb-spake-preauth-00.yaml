- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a new password authenticated key exchange based\n
    \  pre-authentication mechanism for performing Kerberos authentication.\n   This
    mechanism has three goals.  First, it makes Kerberos pre-\n   authentication more
    resilient against time synchronization errors by\n   removing the need to transfer
    an encrypted timestamp.  Second, it\n   increases the security of the Kerberos
    pre-authentication exchange by\n   making offline brute-force attacks impossible.
    \ Third, it enables the\n   use of secure second factor authentication without
    FAST by utilizing\n   the existing trust relationship established by the shared
    first\n   factor.\n\n\t "

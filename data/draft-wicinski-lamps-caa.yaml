  content: "   [RFC6844] defines the Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS\n
    \  Resource Record type to specify one or more Certification Authorities\n   (CAs)
    authorized to issue certificates for that domain name.  With\n   large domains
    covering multiple web properties, defining all possible\n   certificate authorities
    for the domain has security implications.  It\n   would be beneficial to define
    a CAA for individual host names.  This\n   will allow CAA records that can be
    managed with fine grain control.\n\n   This document provides an alternative CAA
    record using a _caa prefix\n   label that will take precedent on a per Fully Qualified
    Domain Name\n   (FQDN), if it exists.  It will override any CAA record at the
    zone\n   apex.  This will not change current CAA record behavior, but will be\n
    \  an additional option.\n\n\t "

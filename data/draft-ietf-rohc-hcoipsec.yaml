  content: "IP Security (IPsec) provides various security services for IP traffic.
    \ However, the benefits of IPsec come at the cost of increased overhead.  This
    document outlines a framework for integrating Robust Header Compression (ROHC)
    over IPsec (ROHCoIPsec).  By compressing the inner headers of IP packets, ROHCoIPsec
    proposes to reduce the amount of overhead associated with the transmission of
    traffic over IPsec Security Associations (SAs).  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

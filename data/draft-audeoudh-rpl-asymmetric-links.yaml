  content: "   This document summarizes our observations of the behavior of RPL on
    a\n   testbed composed of tens of IEEE 802.15.4 nodes.  Our first\n   observation
    is that the continuous task of estimating the link metric\n   to all candidate
    neighbors causes a significant background load.\n   This traffic is persistent,
    even in a stable network where DIO\n   transmissions are eventually widely spaced.
    \ Next, this document\n   focuses on the case of the presence of an asymmetric
    link, due to\n   either a muted or a deaf node.  In these circumstances, the standard\n
    \  RPL mechanisms may well generate hundreds of routing messages per\n   node
    and per hour.\n\n\t "

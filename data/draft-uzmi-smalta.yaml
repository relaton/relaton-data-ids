- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Concerns about the growth of the global routing table has led to\nproposals
    for short-term FIB-reduction and long-term RIB-reduction\nsolutions.  The simplest
    type of FIB-reduction solution is \"FIB\naggregation\", whereby individual routers
    locally reduce the FIB size\nwithout any changes to external operation.  The draft\n[I-D.zhang-fibaggregation]
    describes and analyzes several FIB\naggregation schemes.  This current draft describes
    and analyzes\nanother point in the design space, called SMALTA.  Compared to the\napproaches
    in [I-D.zhang-fibaggregation], SMALTA provides better\naggregation and does not
    introduce non-routable entries in the FIB,\nbut is also more complex.\n\t "

  content: "General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface \nbetween
    a label switch and a controller, and it provides connection, \nconfiguration,
    event, performance management and synchronization. The \nmanaged objects of RFC
    3295 are only defined to configure, monitor \nand maintain the protocol entity.
    Traditionally, network management \nservices are classified into five categories:
    those are configuration, \nperformance, fault, accounting, and security management.
    These \nservices are provided by the network management functions, which can \nbe
    located either in the controller or in the label switch. In the \nGSMP interface,
    there are no managed objects for the network \nmanagement services and the location
    of network management functions \nis not clearly defined. We discussed the complexity
    of switch \nimplementation and the efficiency of resource usage according to the
    \nlocation of network management functions. \n                    \n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo proposes a profile of the ACME protocol that allows the\n
    \  owner of an identifier (e.g., a domain name) to delegate to a third\n   party
    access to a certificate associated with said identifier.  A\n   primary use case
    is that of a CDN (the third party) terminating TLS\n   sessions on behalf of a
    content provider (the owner of a domain\n   name).  The presented mechanism allows
    the owner of the identifier to\n   retain control over the delegation and revoke
    it at any time by\n   cancelling the associated STAR certificate renewal with
    the ACME CA.\n   Another key property of this mechanism is it does not require
    any\n   modification to the deployed TLS ecosystem.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The United States Government has published guidelines for \"NSA Suite\n
    \  B Cryptography\" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic\n   algorithm
    policy for national security applications.  This document\n   specifies the conventions
    for using Suite B cryptography with Bundle\n   Protocol Security (BPSec).\n\n
    \  Since many of the Suite B algorithms enjoy uses in other environments\n   as
    well, the majority of the conventions needed for the Suite B\n   algorithms are
    already specified in other documents.  This document\n   references the source
    of these conventions, with some relevant\n   details repeated to aid developers
    that choose to support Suite B\n   within BPSec.\n\n\t "

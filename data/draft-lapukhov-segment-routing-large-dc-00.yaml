  content: "   This document discusses ways in which segment routing (aka source\n
    \  routing) paradigm could be leveraged inside the data-center to\n   improve
    application performance and network reliability.\n   Specifically, it focuses
    on exposing path visibility to the host's\n   networking stack and leveraging
    this to address a few well-known\n   performance and reliability problems in data-center
    networks.\n\n\n\t "

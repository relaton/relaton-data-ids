  content: "   This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP packets\n
    \  for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable\n   throughput
    (L4S).  It is similar to the original (or 'Classic')\n   Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN).  'Classic' ECN marking was\n   required to be equivalent to a drop, both
    when applied in the network\n   and when responded to by a transport.  Unlike
    'Classic' ECN marking,\n   for packets carrying the L4S identifier, the network
    applies marking\n   more immediately and more aggressively than drop, and the
    transport\n   response to each mark is reduced and smoothed relative to that for\n
    \  drop.  The two changes counterbalance each other so that the\n   throughput
    of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a non-L4S flow\n   under the same conditions.
    \ Nonetheless, the much more frequent\n   control signals and the finer responses
    to them result in ultra-low\n   queuing delay (sub-millisecond) for L4S traffic
    without compromising\n   link utilization, and this low delay can be maintained
    during high\n   traffic load.\n\n   The L4S identifier defined in this document
    is the key piece that\n   distinguishes L4S from TCP-Reno-Friendly (or 'Classic')
    traffic.  It\n   gives an incremental migration path so that suitably modified
    network\n   bottlenecks can distinguish and isolate existing Classic traffic from\n
    \  L4S traffic to prevent it from degrading the ultra-low queuing delay\n   and
    loss of the new scalable transports, without harming Classic\n   performance.
    \ Examples of new active queue management (AQM) marking\n   algorithms and examples
    of new transports (whether TCP-like or real-\n   time) are specified separately.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the Waypoint path oriented delivery\nmechanism.
    \ Waypoint attempts to rationalize the packet\ninterception problem that has been
    addressed by different\nmechanisms such as router alert or RSVP protocol number
    46\nintercept.  It borrows concepts from prior mechanisms,\nincluding the hop
    by hop security model of RSVP.  Waypoint\nstrives to be complete, eliminating
    the need to reimplement\ncommon functionality in the higher layers of the signaling\nprotocol
    stack.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines various limits that may be applied to\n
    \  receiving, sending, and otherwise processing packets that contain\n   IPv6
    extension headers.  The need for such limits is pragmatic to\n   facilitate interoperability
    amongst hosts and routers in the presence\n   of extension headers and thereby
    increasing the feasibility of\n   deployment of extension headers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes methods for a DNS stub resolver to upgrade\n
    \  its communications with a known recursive resolver to include\n   encrytion
    using DoT or DoH.  This protocol is designed for the\n   scenario where the stub
    resolver already has the IP address of the\n   recursive resolver.\n\n   Other
    protocols under develpment address scenarios where the stub\n   resolver wants
    to discover recursive resolvers that use DoT or DoH.\n   This document does not
    cover such discovery.\n\n\t "

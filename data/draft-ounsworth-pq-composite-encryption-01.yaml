  script: Latn
  content: "   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come\n
    \  the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n   cryptographic
    algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum algorithms
    is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to be performed
    in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for holding composite\n
    \  encryption data.\n\n   This document defines a content encryption process following
    the\n   hybrid model as described in the NIST Post-Quantum Crypto FAQ.  This\n
    \  draft defines three composite encryption modes.  First, Composite Key\n   Transport
    using Encryption primitives which encrypts a message\n   (typically a content
    encryption key) for a recipient with a composite\n   public key composed entirely
    of encryption keys by encrypting it with\n   multiple one-time-pad keys, each
    encrypted under a different\n   recipient public key.  Second, Composite Key Transport
    using\n   Encryption and KEM primitives is the generalization of the previous\n
    \  mode to support a mixture of encryption and KEM algorithms.  Third,\n   Composite
    Key Exchange is the most general and supports establishing\n   a shared secret
    using any combination of encryption, KEM, and key\n   exchange primitives where
    a master shared secret is generated using\n   NIST SP 800-56Cr2.\n\n\t "

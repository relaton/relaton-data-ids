  content: "   DHCP servers have evolved over the years to provide significant\n   functionality
    beyond that which is described in the DHCP base\n   specifications.  One aspect
    of this functionality is support for\n   context-specific configuration information.
    \ This memo describes some\n   such features and makes recommendations as to how
    they can be used.\n\n\t "

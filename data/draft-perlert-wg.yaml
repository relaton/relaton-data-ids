  content: "   This document defines a simple UDP protocol for communicating a\n   server
    simulating a reinforcement learning environment and a client\n   observing it
    and responding with actions.\n\n   Reinforcement learning problems are usually
    defined within the scope\n   of a Markov Decission Process (MDP) where an agent
    sends an action\n   belonging to an action space to an environment.  The environment
    acts\n   as a black box returning an observation and a reward for the agent,\n
    \  whose goal is to maximize the total obtained rewards.\n\n   Although the problem
    statement is easy to understand, there are no\n   conventions on how to communicate
    a reinforcement learning simulation\n   with a client agent, either in a local
    network or over the Internet.\n   Additionally, giving an answer to this can be
    especially useful when\n   it comes to multiagent support and analysis.\n\n   The
    protocol PERLERT defined in this document assumes that server and\n   client have
    shared certain information beforehand via another way of\n   communication like
    a web page served using HTTP protocol.  For\n   example, the client must know
    a port number and an instance number\n   before proceeding to participate in a
    simulation run on a server.\n\n   Also, although it is often desired to know the
    full feedback from the\n   environment, PERLERT focuses on real-time interaction
    where human\n   agents can interact with AI agents even if that means that\n   information
    can be lost due to network packet loss.\n\n\t "

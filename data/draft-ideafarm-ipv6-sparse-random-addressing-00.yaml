  content: "   The IPv6 address space is huge.  This document discusses how \"sparse\n
    \  random addressing\" can be used to defeat DDOS attacks, and also to\n   create
    paid-access websites.  The essential idea is to use the host\n   ID portion of
    an IPv6 address as a time-based password that only paid\n   subscribers know.
    \ (They know it by running a program on the device\n   that they use to access
    the website.  That program uses the current\n   time and a secret shared with
    the web server to calculate the current\n   host ID.)  Each subscriber has a unique
    secret so, at any point in\n   time, uses a unique IPv6 address to access the
    website.  Sparseness\n   prevents attack packets from reaching the web server.
    \ Uniqueness\n   creates accountability.  To protect routers from flood attacks,
    the\n   globally routable /48 prefix is also randomized, in a way that\n   exploits
    BGP route propagation delay to partially or completely quash\n   the flooding
    at the source, thereby protecting all upstream routers.\n\n   This early draft
    only contains a conceptual overview.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Beginning in December 1991, a \"Request for Comments Summary\" was\n
    \  published every 100 RFCs.  RFC numbers ending with 99 were reserved\n   for
    these summary documents.  This document retires the publication\n   of the RFC
    summary documents.  Moving forward, RFC numbers ending in\n   99 will be assigned
    to RFCs-to-be.\n\n\t "

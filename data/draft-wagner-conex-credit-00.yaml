  content: "   Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform\n
    \  the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on\n   the
    same flow.  In order to make ConEx information useful, reliable\n   auditing is
    necessary to provide a strong incentive to declare ConEx\n   information honestly.
    \ However, there is always a delay between\n   congestion events and the respective
    ConEx signal at the audit.  To\n   avoid state and complex Round-Trip Time estimations
    at the audit, in\n   [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech] it is proposed to use credit
    signals\n   sent in advance to cover potential congestion in the next feedback\n
    \  delay duration.  Unfortunately, introducing credit does not provide\n   incentives
    to honestly report congestion.  This document lists\n   potential issues regarding
    the proposed crediting and discusses\n   potential solutions approaches to interpret
    and handle credits at the\n   audit.\n\n\t "

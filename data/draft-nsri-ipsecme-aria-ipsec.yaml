  content: "   This document describes the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm
    in\n   conjunction with several different modes of operation within IKE and\n
    \  IPsec.  It describes the use of ARIA in CBC, CTR, GCM and CCM modes\n   to
    encrypt and/or authenticate IKE and ESP traffic.  It also\n   describes the use
    of ARIA in XCBC, CMAC, and GMAC modes to\n   authenticate IKE, ESP and AH traffic.
    \ The use of ARIA in XCBC and\n   CMAC modes for pseudorandom functions is also
    included.\n\n\t "

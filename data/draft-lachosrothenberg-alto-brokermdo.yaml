- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) demand new multiple\n   administrative
    domain (aka multi-domain) orchestration models.  This\n   document proposes a
    new broker-plane approach working on top of per-\n   domain management and orchestration
    functions to coordinate the\n   delivery of a multi-operator End-to-End Network
    Service (E2ENS).\n   This proposed design resorts to the Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization (ALTO) protocol to offer topology and resource\n   information
    from different administrative domains.  The ALTO services\n   with the proposed
    protocol extension offer aggregated views on\n   various types of resources contributing
    to a more simple and scalable\n   solution.\n\n\t "

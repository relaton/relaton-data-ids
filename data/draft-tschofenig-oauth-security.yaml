  script: Latn
  content: "   The OAuth working group has finished work on the OAuth 2.0 core\n   protocol
    as well as the Bearer Token specification.  The Bearer Token\n   is a TLS-based
    solution for ensuring that neither the interaction\n   with the Authorization
    Server (when requesting a  token) nor the\n   interaction with the Resource Server
    (for accessing a protected\n   resource) leads to token leakage.  There has, however,
    always been\n   the desire to develop a security solution that is \"better\" than\n
    \  Bearer Tokens (or at least different) where the Client needs to show\n   possession
    of some keying material when accessing a Resource Server.\n   This document tries
    to capture the discussion and to come up with\n   requirements to process the
    work on solutions.\n\n   This document aims to discuss threats, security requirements
    and\n   desired design properties of an enhanced OAuth security mechanism.\n\n\t "

  content: "It is generally known that the binding acquisition for symmetric NATs\nwith
    STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs) protocol will not\nyield a usable
    address for traversing symmetric NAT. The use of\nsymmetric RTP allows you to
    accompolish symmetric NAT traversal only\nin situations where the other end is
    open to the Internet, or has a\nfull-cone or a restricted-cone NAT.  This document
    proposes an\nanalytical method for symmetric NATs to obtain more detailed\ncharacteristics
    of the symmetric NAT using STUN, and describes how we\ncan establish a peer-to-peer
    UDP connection even in situations where\nNATs (including symmetric NATs) are present
    at both ends.\n\n\t "

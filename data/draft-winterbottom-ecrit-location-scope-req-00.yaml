  content: "   Special kinds of services require user location information to be\n
    \  authenticated and validated within a specific operating domain.  An\n   example
    of such a service is the emergency services network, where\n   the location of
    a caller is known with in the domain of the telephone\n   network, while the name
    or true identity of the caller is not\n   intrinsically known.  This paper describes
    the entities and key\n   requirements necessary to provide such a service in an
    internet\n   environment.\n\t "

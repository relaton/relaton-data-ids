  content: "The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has been \nchartered
    to standardize reliable multicast transport services and \nprotocol instantiations,
    which include the tree-based ACK (TRACK) \nprotocol. This document describes the
    RMT Building Block for Tree-\nbased ACK (TRACK) mechanisms.  It contains functions
    relating to \npositive acknowledgments and hierarchical tree construction and
    \nmaintenance.  It might primarily be used as part of the TRACK \nProtocol Instantiation.
    According to the charter, a building block \nis 'a coarse-grained modular component
    that is common to multiple \nprotocols along with abstract APIs that define a
    building block's \naccess methods and their arguments.' The TRACK BB mechanisms
    will \noperate on the logical ACK-tree that is configured by the TREE BB \n[10]
    in the TRACK PI sessions. This document is made based on the \nguidelines for
    the RMT BB [5].\n\t "

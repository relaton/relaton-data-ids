abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer 4 loadbalancers are widely used in the deployment of large- scale
    web services. A large number of servers accept incoming connections from clients,
    while multiple loadbalancers make sure that traffic is spread evenly across the
    servers. Due to its use of multiple subflows, Multipath TCP poses several issues
    to the design of a scalable layer 4 loadbalancer that supports it. This document
    presents two ways in which MPTCP connections can be loadbalanced across a large
    pool of servers. Both approaches entail using a slightly modified server stack
    and work well with unmodified MPTCP clients.</p>"

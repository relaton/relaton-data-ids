  script: Latn
  content: "   Hierarchical SFC is a network architecture for implementing SFC the\n
    \  chain with an ordered set of service functions which could be\n   deployed
    in multiple geographically dispersed networks. How to\n   forward traffic between
    networks in Hierarchical SFC is what the\n   draft wants to present.\n\n   This
    document proposes a mapping-based forwarding method with\n   coordinated orchestration
    by the translation of H-SFC and I-SFC to\n   forward traffic between networks
    in Hierarchical SFC.\n\n\t "

  content: "   There is a long-term tradition in the Internet community, predating\n
    \  the IETF by many years, of use of the RFC series to publish materials\n   that
    are not rooted in the IETF standards process and its review and\n   approval mechanisms.
    \ These documents, known as \"independent\n   submissions\", serve a number of
    important functions for the Internet\n   community, both inside and outside of
    the community of active IETF\n   participants.  This document discusses the independent
    submission\n   model and some reasons why it is important.  It then describes\n
    \  editorial and processing norms that can be used for independent\n   submissions
    as the community goes forward into new relationships\n   between the IETF community
    and its primary technical publisher.\n\n\t "

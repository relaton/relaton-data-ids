  content: "This document discusses the most common scenarios of connecting an enterprise
    network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned by an ISP and how the
    approach proposed in \"Enterprise Multihoming using Provider-Assigned Addresses
    without Network Prefix Translation: Requirements and Solution\" could be applied
    in those scenarios.  The problem of enterprise multihoming without address translation
    of any form has not been solved yet as it requires both the network to select
    the correct egress ISP based on the packet source address and hosts to select
    the correct source address based on the desired egress ISP for that traffic.  The
    aforementioned document proposes a solution to this problem by introducing a new
    routing functionality (Source Address Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink selection
    issue.  It also proposes using Router Advertisements to influence the host source
    address selection.  It focuses on solving the general problem and covering various
    complex use cases, and this document adopts its proposed approach to provide a
    solution for a limited number of common use cases.  In particular, the focus of
    this document is on scenarios in which an enterprise network has two Internet
    uplinks used either in primary/backup mode or simultaneously and hosts in that
    network might not yet properly support multihoming as described in RFC 8028.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of the INFO request for the Session Initiation Protocol\n(SIP),
    as described by RFC 2976, is to provide mid-session SIP User\nAgent (UA)-to-SIP
    UA application data transport.  In the years since\nthe introduction of the INFO
    request, experience with the use of the\nINFO request indicates a number of problems.
    \ This document explains\nwhy there are INFO-based, proprietary protocols in the
    wild; the\nflaws of using INFO; and explains why it is not possible to create
    a\nframework to rescue INFO for general purpose use.  Since SIP has\nevolved considerably
    since the introduction of INFO, this document\nhighlights some of the new, robust
    mechanisms for achieving the work\nthat previously led people to use INFO.  As
    these mechanisms are now\navailable, this document formally deprecates the use
    of INFO for new\nusages beyond the existing standardized ones, namely RFC 3372
    (SIP-T)\nand RFC 4497 (QSIG).\n\nConventions Used in this Document\n\nThe key
    words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\n\t "

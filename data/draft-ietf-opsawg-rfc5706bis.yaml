abstract:
- content: <p>New Protocols or Protocol Extensions are best designed with due consideration
    of the functionality needed to operate and manage them. Retrofitting operations
    and management considerations is suboptimal. The purpose of this document is to
    provide guidance to authors and reviewers on what operational and management aspects
    should be addressed when defining New Protocols or Protocol Extensions. This document
    obsoletes RFC 5706, replacing it completely and updating it with new operational
    and management techniques and mechanisms. It also updates RFC 2360 to obsolete
    mandatory MIB creation and introduces a requirement to include an "Operational
    Considerations" section in new RFCs in the IETF Stream.</p>

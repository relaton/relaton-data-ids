  content: "   New Protocols or Protocol Extensions are best designed with due\n   consideration
    of the functionality needed to operate and manage them.\n   Retrofitting operations
    and management considerations is suboptimal.\n   The purpose of this document
    is to provide guidance to authors and\n   reviewers on what operational and management
    aspects should be\n   addressed when defining New Protocols or Protocol Extensions.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 5706, replacing it completely and\n   updating
    it with new operational and management techniques and\n   mechanisms.  It also
    updates RFC 2360 to obsolete mandatory MIB\n   creation and introduces a requirement
    to include an \"Operational\n   Considerations\" section in new RFCs in the IETF
    Stream.\n\n\t "

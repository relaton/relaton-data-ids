abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes TIPC, a protocol intended to be used as a TML\n
    \  (Transport Mapping Layer) for the ForCES protocol[ForCES] when that\n   protocol
    is transported over L2 carriers such as Ethernet, RapidIO or\n   PCI-Express.
    \ TIPC is specially designed for efficient communication\n   within clusters of
    loosely coupled nodes, and may as such even be\n   used outside the context of
    being a ForCES protocol carrier.  It\n   would even be an excellent candidate
    as a ForCES pre-association\n   phase setup protocol.\n\t "

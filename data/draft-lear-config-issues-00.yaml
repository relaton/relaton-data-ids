  script: Latn
  content: "How are network elements configured?  What are the different ways in \nwhich
    a device receives configuration, and why do they use those \nparticular mechanisms?
    \ How do these mechanisms perform for their \ngiven use?  This document discusses
    the problem of device \nconfiguration and state exchange.  As we do so we will
    point out some \nprotocol considerations, such as the objects being transported,
    how \ntransfers are initiated, and what the security requirements are.\n\t "

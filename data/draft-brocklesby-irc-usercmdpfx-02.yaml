  content: "This memo presents a method for a client to prefix commands sent to\nan
    IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server with a label, in order to match\nserver replies
    against commands previously sent, without having to\nkeep excessive state on the
    server connection.  It is a primary\ngoal to implement this in a way which is
    completely backwards-\ncompatible with existing IRC servers.\nThis documents describes
    an extention to the Internet Relay Chat\nprotocol as described in RFC 1459 [1].\n\t "

  content: "For a handoff action using the mobile IPv6, we need two functions: \nre-routing
    on the wired region of the network and the activation of the \nair-link on the
    wireless region. In this architecture, a possibility of \nsmall break for a session
    is still large by the signaling overhead between Home Agent and Mobile Node (MN).
    We propose a new handoff method using the Explicit Multicast (xcast) technique.
    On the wired section, control/user packets are multicasted by xcast scheme to
    the Base Stations where MN can receive, then packets are passed to the air-link
    activated between a BS and the MN.\n\n\t "

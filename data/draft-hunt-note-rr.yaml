  content: "   While the DNS zone master file format has always allowed comments,\n
    \  there is no existing mechanism to preserve comments once the zone has\n   been
    loaded into memory or converted to a binary representation.\n   This note proposes
    a new RR type \"NOTE\", to be allocated from the\n   Covert-RR type range proposed
    in [I-D.krecicki-dns-covert], so that\n   confidential comments can be stored
    alongside zone data, and included\n   in zone transfers when Covert semantics
    are supported by the\n   secondary.\n\n\t "

  content: "This Internet Draft describes an enhanced way to exchange prefix\ninformation,
    to permit multiple copies of a prefix with different\npaths to be announced and
    withdrawn.\n\nThis negotiated capability provides faster local (inter-AS) and\nglobal
    (intra-AS) convergence, reduces path-hunting, improves route-\nreflector behaviour,
    including eliminating both persistent\noscillations and BGP \"wedgies\".\n\nAdditional
    prefix instances have new optional BGP attributes, to\ncontrol path selection.\n\nWithdrawl
    of prefixes will require new attributes to disambiguate\nprefix instances.\n\nBenefits
    are seen both when deployed intra-AS, and on inter-AS\npeering.Author's Note\n\nThis
    Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related\ndraft(s) being
    placed on the Standards Track for idr.\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in [5].\n\t "

  content: "IPv6 was decided as the replacement to the widely deployed IPv4 in\n1992.
    \ The new protocol was designed to meet a number of criteria\nthat at that time
    was seen as the failures of IPv4, such as security\nand limited address space.\nIPv6
    meet these needs, but it fails to meet other needs of the\nInternet of today such
    as scalable solutions for multihoming and\nportable address space for end-sites.
    \ The effects of the lack of\nscalable solutions to this is widely documented.\nIn
    order to solve the multihoming scalability problems, the multi6\nworking group
    was created in the IETF.  This group have so far not\nyet produced any documents
    as it has been hard to find consensus on\neven the most basic documents such as
    requirements.  Multi6 have also\nsuffered from problems reaching consensus on
    what type of solution\nwill be required moving forward, and the attempt of trying
    to come up\nwith a 'fit-all' solution from day one.\nThis document tries to outline
    steps that could be taken to better\nunderstand the problem and what steps could
    be taken as we bit by bit\ntries to address the problem.\n\n\t "

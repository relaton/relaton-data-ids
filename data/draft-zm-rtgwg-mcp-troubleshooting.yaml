  content: "   The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables\n
    \  Large Language Model (LLM) applications to seamlessly integrate with\n   external
    data sources and tools by exposing Resources, Prompts and\n   Tools in a JSON-RPC
    2.0 transport.  This document describes a mapping\n   of MCP roles, primitives
    and security model to the network management\n   domain so that network devices
    act as MCP servers and network\n   controllers act as MCP clients.  This document
    also extends the model\n   to Device-to-Device (D2D) collaboration, allowing network
    elements to\n   perform distributed fault correlation when the controller is\n
    \  unreachable or when real-time cross-device data is required.  The\n   goal
    is to provide an intent-based, conversational and secure\n   approach for automated
    network troubleshooting, configuration\n   validation, and closed-loop remediation
    without inventing new\n   protocols or device agents.\n\n\t "

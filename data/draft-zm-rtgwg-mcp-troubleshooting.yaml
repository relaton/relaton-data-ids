abstract:
- content: "<p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables Large
    Language Model (LLM) applications to seamlessly integrate with external data sources
    and tools by exposing Resources, Prompts and Tools in a JSON-RPC 2.0 transport.
    This document describes a mapping of MCP roles, primitives and security model
    to the network management domain so that network devices act as MCP servers and
    network controllers act as MCP clients. This document also extends the model to
    Device-to-Device (D2D) collaboration, allowing network elements to perform distributed
    fault correlation when the controller is unreachable or when real-time cross-device
    data is required. The goal is to provide an intent-based, conversational and secure
    approach for automated network troubleshooting, configuration validation, and
    closed-loop remediation without inventing new protocols or device agents.</p>"

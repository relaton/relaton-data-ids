  content: "   This document defines a base profile for IPsec for use with the US\n
    \  Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a\n   cybersecurity
    advisory that outlines quantum-resistant cryptographic\n   algorithm policy for
    national security applications.  This profile\n   applies to the capabilities,
    configuration, and operation of all\n   components of US National Security Systems
    that employ IPsec.  It is\n   also appropriate for all other US Government systems
    that process\n   high-value information.  This memo is not an IETF standard, and
    has\n   not been shown to have IETF community consensus.  This profile is\n   made
    publicly available for use by developers and operators of these\n   and any other
    system deployments.\n\n\t "

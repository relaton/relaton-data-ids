  content: "   This draft introduces the scenarios and requirements for performance\n
    \  modeling of digital twin networks, and explores the implementation\n   methods
    of network models, proposing a network modeling method based\n   on graph neural
    networks (GNNs).  This method combines GNNs with\n   graph sampling techniques
    to improve the expressiveness and\n   granularity of the model.  The model is
    generated through data\n   training and validated with typical scenarios.  The
    model performs\n   well in predicting QoS metrics such as network latency, providing
    a\n   reference option for network performance modeling methods.\n\n\t "

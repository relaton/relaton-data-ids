  content: "Mobile Internet access from smartphones and other mobile devices is accelerating
    the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.  IPv6 is widely seen as crucial for the continued
    operation and growth of the Internet, and in particular, it is critical in mobile
    networks.  This document discusses the issues that arise when deploying IPv6 in
    mobile networks.  Hence, this document can be a useful reference for service providers
    and network designers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

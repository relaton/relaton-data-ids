  content: "This document proposes an extension to SIP for subscriptions and\nnotifications
    of user presence. User presence is defined as the\nwillingness and ability of
    a user to communicate with other users on\nthe network. Historically, presence
    has been limited to 'on-line' and\n'off-line' indicators; the notion of presence
    here is broader.\n\n\t "

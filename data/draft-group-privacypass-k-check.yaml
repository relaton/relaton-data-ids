  content: "   This document describes a protocol called K-Check for implementing\n
    \  HTTP resource consistency checks.  The primary use case for K-Check\n   is
    for deployments of protocols such as Privacy Pass and Oblivious\n   HTTP in which
    privacy goals require that clients have a consistent\n   view of some protocol-specific
    resource (typically, a public key).\n\n\t "

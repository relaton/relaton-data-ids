abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines the Agent Authorization Grant, an OAuth 2.1\n
    \  extension allowing a class of Internet applications - called AI\n   Agents
    - to obtain access tokens in order to invoke web-based APIs on\n   behalf of their
    users.  In the use cases envisaged here, users\n   interact with AI Agents through
    communication channels - the Public\n   Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or texting
    - which do not permit\n   traditional OAuth grant flows.  Instead, AI agents collect
    Personally\n   Identifying Information (PII) through natural language conversation,\n
    \  and then use that collected information to obtain an access token\n   with
    appropriately constrained scopes.  A primary considering is\n   ensuring that
    the Large Language Model (LLM) powering the AI Agent\n   cannot, through hallucination,
    result in impersonation attacks.\n\n\t "

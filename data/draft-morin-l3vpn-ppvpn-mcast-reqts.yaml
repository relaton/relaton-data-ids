  content: "   This document presents a set of functional requirements for network\n
    \  solutions that allow the support of IP multicast within IP provider\n   provided
    virtual private networks (PP VPNs).  It specifies\n   requirements both from the
    end user and service provider standpoints.\n   It is intended that potential solutions,
    that specify the support of\n   IP multicast within VPNs, use these requirements
    as a guideline.  It\n   is not the intent of this document to propose technical
    solutions,\n   nor to detail solution specific issues.\n\t "

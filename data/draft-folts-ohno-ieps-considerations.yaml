  content: "This draft requests development of detailed specifications for the\ntechnical
    and operational requirements for an Internet-based\nInternational Emergency Preparedness
    Scheme (IEPS) as\ndefined by ITU-T Recommendation E.106. Public\ntelecommunications
    services have long had such a\nscheme, to ensure priority handling of telephone\ncommunications,
    such as during natural disasters.  As a\nwide range of communication services
    increasingly rely\nupon the family of specifications related to Internet\nProtocol
    (IP), IETF work needs to include consideration\nand provision for supporting IEPS.
    This work needs to\nbe addressed in two phases concurrently - 1) interface\nfor
    transition from today's public switched telephone\nnetwork (PSTN) to IP-based
    network telephony services,\nand 2) additional and enhanced capabilities, such
    as\napplication-specific IEPS services.  An Email list for discussion\nand a Web
    site for background and documents has been established\nto assist the work\n\t "

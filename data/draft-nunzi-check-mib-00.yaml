  content: "   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n
    \  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community,\n   that
    is targeted at increasing scalability of network monitoring via\n   SNMP.  In
    particular, the MIB module defined in this document\n   describes a set of managed
    objects that allow to define a check\n   procedure on a managed device.  The result
    of the  check is\n   accumulated into a single managed object that can be read
    by a\n   manager instead of reading all individual managed objects to be\n   checked
    during the check procedure.\n\n\t "

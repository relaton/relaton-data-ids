  content: "This document proposes a terminology for defining the problem faced\nby
    network mobility. Network mobility is concerned with situations\nwhere an entire
    network changes its point of attachment to the\nInternet and thus its reachability
    in the topology. We shall refer to\nsuch a network as a mobile network. Network
    mobility support is to\nmaintain session continuity between nodes in the mobile
    network and\nnodes in the global Internet.\n\t "

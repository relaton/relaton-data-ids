  content: "   Much current literature discusses queuing delays, and the effects of\n
    \  different queue disciplines, active queue management algorithms, and\n   congestion
    control measures on these delays.  This draft highlights\n   an important distinction
    between different types of delay, which may\n   be helpful to practitioners and
    theoreticians alike.\n\n\t "

  content: "The base Mobile IP allows a host to transparently send datagrams to\nmobile
    nodes as it would to any other nodes. Datagrams addressed to\nthe mobile are always
    routed via the Home Agent in the home network.\nHowever, as the mobile node moves
    away from its home network, it may\nno longer be topologically close to its home
    agent. Route\noptimization [MIP-OPTIM] has been proposed to allow a host to send\npackets
    to the mobile as a mobile node (MN) moves, without having to\nroute the packets
    via the home agent each time.  The mobile provides\nits current address to a host
    (or correspondent node, CN) that it is\ncommunicating with as it moves. The host
    updates the cache of the\nmobile location with this new address and tunnels datagrams\n(addressed
    to the mobile) to the current address of the mobile.\nHowever not all correspondent
    nodes are capable of tunneling IP\ndatagrams as required by the route optimization
    mechanisms described\nin [MIP-OPTIM]. More importantly, disclosing the current
    location (or\nCOA) of the mobile node to correspondent nodes is not always\ndesirable,
    nor is the overhead of encapsulating datagram to the MN\nideal.\n\t "

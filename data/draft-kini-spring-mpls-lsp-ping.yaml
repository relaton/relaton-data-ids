  content: "   MPLS has defined mechanisms for fault detection and isolation and\n
    \  mechanisms for reliably sending an echo reply in RFC 4379.  Source\n   routed
    MPLS LSPs are a technique being proposed to address new use-\n   cases.  This
    document describes how mechanisms defined for MPLS fault\n   detection and isolation
    can be applied for source routed LSPs.\n\n\t "

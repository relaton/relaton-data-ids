  content: "   The problems of modern datacenters are rooted in virtualized host\n
    \  scaling. Virtualization implies VM mobility, which may be intra-\n   datacenter
    or inter-datacenter. Mobility may cross administrative\n   boundaries, such as
    across private-public domains. A public\n   datacenter may be multi-tenant, extending
    several private networks\n   into the public domain. Running these massively scaled,
    virtualized,\n   multi-tenant datacenters poses some unique networking and operational\n
    \  challenges. This document describes these challenges.\n\n\t "

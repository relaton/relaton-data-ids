  content: "   This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion\n
    \  issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of\n   the
    original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy IPv4),
    discusses the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system architecture
    enhancement aspects. It was originated\n   by a study called ExIP (Extended IPv4)
    analyzing the use of the first\n   available octet (eight bits) in the reserved
    private network pools\n   (10/8, 172.16/12 and 192.168/16) to achieve a moderate
    address space\n   expansion factor of 256 by each, while maintaining their familiar\n
    \  operation characteristics. Along the way, a parallel yet similar\n   effort,
    called EnIP (Enhanced IPv4), was discovered. EnIP fully\n   utilizes the same
    private network pools to increase the address space\n   by a factor of 17.1M with
    end-to-end connectivity. EzIP is a superset\n   that proposes one unified format
    for not only encompassing the\n   considerations of both, but also identifying
    additional capabilities\n   and flexibilities. For example, EzIP may expand an
    IPv4 address at\n   least by a factor of 256 to as high as 256M without affecting
    the\n   existing IPv4 public address assignments, while still keeping intact\n
    \  the current private networks for the 256M case if desired. The EzIP\n   is
    in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not only\n   both categories
    of connectivity, but also their interoperability. The\n   traditional Internet
    traffic and the IoT operations may coexist\n   simultaneously without perturbing
    their existing setups, while\n   offering end-users the freedom to choose one
    or the other. If the\n   IPv4 public pool were reorganized, the assignable pool
    could be\n   multiplied by 512M or even up to 2B times with end-to-end\n   connectivity.
    EzIP may be deployed as a firmware enhancement to the\n   Internet edge routers
    or private network gateways wherever needed, or\n   simply installed as an inline
    adjunct module between the two,\n   enabling a seamless introduction. The 256M
    case establishes a\n   spherical layer of routers providing a complete interconnection\n
    \  between the Internet and end-users. This configuration enables the\n   entire
    current Internet and private networks characteristics to\n   remain intact. These
    proposed interim facilities would afford IPv6\n   more time to orderly reach the
    maturity and the availability levels\n   required for delivering a long-term general
    service.\n\n\t "

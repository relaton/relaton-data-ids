  content: "This  document  presents  the  conformance  test specification for SCTP
    \nprototcol (RFC2960), which can be used to test SCTP implementations for\nconformance
    to the protocol definition. The list of test is  exhaustive\nand covers almost
    all the categories of test, except few test for timer\ncalculation and congestion)
    which will be added in the next revision of\nthe draft. \nThis draft can also
    be used in conjunction with  SCTP  specification by\nimplementor  of  protocol
    \ as  implementors  guide,  as  the  pictorial \nrepresentation of various scenarios
    help understand the protocol.\n\nNext revision  of  the  draft will also cover
    the additions done to the\nprotocol revision RFC2960 and any subsequent RFC published
    by IETF.\n\t "

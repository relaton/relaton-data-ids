  content: "   This memo defines an extension to SMTP which provides a mechanism for\n
    \  requesting immediate message delivery over SMTP instead of normal\n   store-and-forward
    delivery.  It also provides a mechanism for\n   querying the SMTP server if immediate
    delivery was successful, is\n   still in progress, or was simply queued as a normal
    store-and-forward\n   message.\n\n\t "

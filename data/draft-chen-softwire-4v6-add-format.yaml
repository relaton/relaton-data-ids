  content: "   There are heated discussion over the unified address format and\n   mapping
    algorithm.  In order to converge the solutions, it is\n   desirable to discuss
    the requirements and principles for the design.\n   This document tries to propose
    practical principles for 4v6\n   deployment.  The requirements have been derived
    from this deployment\n   consideration.  Based on that, a unified address format
    has been\n   proposed for easying 4v6 solution implementation .\n\n\t "

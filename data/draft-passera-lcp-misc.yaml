  content: "This document presents five extensions to the PPP/LCP Protocol :\n \n*
    Assistance from a router to another router (or a host) looking\nfor its Operating
    System file.\n* Assistance from a router to another router (or a host) looking\nfor
    its configuration file.\n* Request from an equipment to receive Discard frame
    when no Data\nframe can be sent. When no Discard or Data frames are received\nthe
    link will be brought down. This method is more efficient\nthan using a timeout
    and/or a keepalive mecanism.\n* Interface Bandwidth and Delay measurements. These
    informations\ncan be used by OSPF or any other IGP protocol.\n\t "

  content: "Most digital-signature system deployments require dedicated and \nsolution-specific
    user-enrollment procedures and user-enrollment \nsoftware[1], and mandate provisioning
    and distribution of physical or \nsoftware-based signature-key tokens to end users.
    \ As deployed such \napproaches create a high burden in logistics, cost, and help-desk
    \nsupport.  They also introduce training obstacles for users and \nsystems administrators.\n\nThis
    document describes the deployment architecture approach used by \nARX to provide
    secure and efficient digital signature services based \non its CoSign(r) solution.
    \ The security solution's deployment \narchitecture is documented in the hope
    that other digital-signature \nand PKI deployment efforts will deliver comparable
    efficiencies.\n\n\n[1] This is also true for deployments of non-standard proprietary
    \n\n electronic signature solutions.\n\t "

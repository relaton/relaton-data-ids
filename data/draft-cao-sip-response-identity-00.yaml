- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The mechanism for securely providing responder's identity in response\n
    \  message is missing in the current Session Initiation Protocol.  Due\n   to
    different call scenarios, the exact response identity is hard to\n   guess through
    the existing response message.  This draft describes\n   some extensions for providing
    SIP response identity and two security\n   mechanisms for verifying the integrity
    of response identity.  It does\n   so by defining new header fields as well as
    one new response code.\n   Furthermore, the issue of how to require the presence
    of response\n   identity in one SIP dialog is also discussed with one solution.\n\t "

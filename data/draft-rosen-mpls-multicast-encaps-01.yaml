abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 3032 established two data link layer codepoints for MPLS: one to\n
    \  indicate that the data link layer frame is carrying an MPLS unicast\n   packet,
    and the other to indicate that the data link layer frame is\n   carrying an MPLS
    multicast packet.  This specification updates\n   RFC3032 by redefining the meaning
    of these two codepoints.  The\n   former \"multicast codepoint\" is now to be
    used only on multiaccess\n   media, and it is to mean \"the top label of the following
    label stack\n   is an upstream-assigned label\".  The former \"unicast codepoint\"
    is to\n   be used in all other cases.  Whether the data link layer payload is
    a\n   unicast MPLS packet or a multicast MPLS packet is now to be\n   determined
    by looking up the top label, rather than by the codepoint.\n\n   RFC3032 does
    not specify the destination address to be placed in the\n   \"MAC DA\" field of
    an ethernet frame which carries an MPLS multicast\n   packet.  This document provides
    that specification.\n\n   This document updates RFC 3032 and RFC 4023.\n\t "

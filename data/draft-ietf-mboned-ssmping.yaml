  content: "The Multicast Ping Protocol specified in this document allows for checking
    whether an endpoint can receive multicast -- both Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)
    and Any-Source Multicast (ASM).  It can also be used to obtain additional multicast-related
    information, such as multicast tree setup time.  This protocol is based on an
    implementation of tools called \"ssmping\" and \"asmping\". [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

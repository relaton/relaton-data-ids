  content: "This document describes a key management protocol for a mobile \ncomputer
    to securely obtain keying material with an access router \nin a visited link for
    use as the local binding security \nassociation with the router. The protocol
    enables an IPv6 node to \nutilize the access router as its temporary home agent
    and continue \nto receive packets destined to its care-of address with the \ntemporary
    home agent as well as to send packets from this care-of \naddress when the nodes
    change its access router. To support this \noperation, two new types of mobility
    headers and one Neighbor \nDiscovery option are defined. All IPv6 nodes MAY support
    this \nprotocol.\n\t "

    and deflate-base64. Adding these CTEs to\nMIME that provide facilities for loss-less,
    adaptive,\ngeneral-purpose compression. The first of these, deflate,\nproduces
    binary output, while the second, deflate-base64,\nproduces the same sort of output
    as the base64 content-\ntransfer-encoding defined in [RFC-2045].\n\t "

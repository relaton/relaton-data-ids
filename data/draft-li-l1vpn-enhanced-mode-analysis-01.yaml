  content: "   This document presents detailed information with respect to the four
    \n   sub-models of the Layer One Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) enhanced \n   mode.
    Each sub-model is evaluated from different points of view, such \n   as Topology
    Confidentiality, scalability, and reliability. The \n   requirements on GMPLS
    to support each sub-model of the L1VPN enhanced \n   mode are also discussed in
    this document. \n\n\t "

  content: "   The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the\n   responsibilities
    for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC\n   Series Editor, the RFC Production
    Center, and the RFC Publisher.\n   Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight
    via the RFC Series\n   Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship\n
    \  between the IETF Administration Limited Liability Corporation Board\n   and
    the RSOC.  This document reflects the experience gained with \"RFC\n   Editor
    Model (Version 1)\", documented in RFC 5620; and obsoletes RFC\n   6635 to replace
    all references to the IASA and related structures\n   with those defined by the
    IASA 2.0 Model.\n\n\t "

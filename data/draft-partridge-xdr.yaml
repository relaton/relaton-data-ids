  content: "   Intermediate data formats (IDFs), also known as external data formats\n
    \  or data-interchange formats, are used to exchange data between\n   networked
    applications.  Example formats are JavaScript Object\n   Notation (JSON) and Abstract
    Syntax Notation One (ASN.1).  IDFs are\n   ubiquitous in networking.\n\n   Despite
    their importance, there's remarkably little written guidance\n   about how to
    actually design or architect an IDF.  This guidance gap\n   exists despite fifty
    years of experience designing and deploying\n   IDFs, going back to the days of
    ARPANET.  As a result, even recently\n   developed IDFs have obvious flaws that
    could have been avoided.\n\n   The purpose of this memo is to provide basic basic
    guidance about how\n   to design an IDF.  This memo is NOT the product of any
    IETF or IRTF\n   working group.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft gives provides an example set of licensing terms for use\n
    \  in IPR disclosures that are compatible with the goals of the proposed\n   video-codec
    working group for further discussion and refinement by\n   participants at the
    IETF.  Although usage of such a license is\n   strictly voluntary, the hope is
    that getting agreement on a set of\n   terms before the bulk of the work begins
    will allow contributors to\n   use a common license and minimize the amount of
    legal analysis that\n   must be performed in order to deploy the codec.\n\n\t "

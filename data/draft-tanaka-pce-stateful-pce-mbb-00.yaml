  content: "   Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding\n   protocol
    extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do\n   stateful control of
    MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSP).  Stateful PCE supports
    manipulating the existing LSP's state\n   and attributes (e.g., bandwidth and
    route) and also creating totally\n   new LSPs in the network.\n\n   In the current
    MPLS TE network using RSVP-TE, LSPs are often\n   controlled by \"make-before-break
    (M-B-B)\" signaling by headend for\n   the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization.
    \ In most cases, it\n   is an essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without
    any data\n   disruption.\n\n   This document specifies the procedure of applying
    Stateful PCE's\n   control to make-before-break RSVP-TE signaling.  In this document,\n
    \  two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined, one-\n   stroke
    mode and granular mode.  This document also specifies the\n   usage and handling
    of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol)\n   messages, expected behavior
    of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several\n   extensions of additional objects.\n\n\t "

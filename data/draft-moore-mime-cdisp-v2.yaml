  content: "This memo provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming to the\nMIME
    specifications [RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2048, RFC 2049]\ncan convey
    presentational information.  It specifies the 'Content-\nDisposition' header field,
    which is optional and valid for any MIME\nentity ('message' or 'body part'). Two
    values for this header field are\ndescribed in this memo; one for the ordinary
    linear presentation of the\nbody part, and another to facilitate the use of mail
    to transfer files.\nAnother content-disposition value, for use in HTML file uploads,
    has\nbeen defined in a separate document. [RFC 2388].  It is expected that\nadditional
    values will be defined in the future, and this memo defines\nthe procedures for
    extending the set of values.\n\n     This document is intended as an extension
    to MIME, which itself is\nan extension to [RFC 822].  As such, the reader is assumed
    to be\nfamiliar with both the MIME specifications and RFC 822. The information\npresented
    herein supplements but does not replace that found in those\ndocuments.\n\n     This
    document is a revision to the Proposed Standard protocol\ndefined in RFC 2183.
    \ As compared to RFC 2183, this document contains\nminor editorial updates, which
    are summarized in section 10 of this\ndocument.\n\n\t "

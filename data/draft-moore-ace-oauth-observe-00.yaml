  content: "   This document describes a method for a client or resource server\n
    \  utilizing an OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] authorization server when responding\n   to
    a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] GET request\n   with the Observe
    option [I-D.ietf-core-observe].  CoAP's Observe\n   option has the potential to
    reduce network traffic by allowing\n   clients to get updates on protected resources
    as the protected\n   resource's values change rather than polling the protected
    resource\n   periodically.  A client adding the Observe option to a CoAP GET\n
    \  request has the greatest impact on the device providing the protected\n   resource
    since the resource server (RS) has to maintain a list of\n   requestors and deal
    with tokens associated with those requests.\n   Additionally an Authorization
    Server (AS) could potentially allow\n   token introspection to happen over a GET
    request with the Observe\n   option, further reducing network usage and heavy
    lifting on the part\n   of the resource server doing the introspection.\n\n\t "

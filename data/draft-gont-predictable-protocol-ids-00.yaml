  content: "   This document performs an analysis of the security and privacy\n   implications
    of different types of \"numeric identifiers\" used in IETF\n   protocols, and
    tries to categorize them based on their\n   interoperability requirements and
    the assoiated failure severity when\n   such requirements are not met.  It describes
    a number of algorithms\n   that have been employed in real implementations to
    meet such\n   requirements and analyzes their security and privacy properties.\n
    \  Additionally, it provides advice on possible algorithms that could be\n   employed
    to satisfy the interoperability requirements of each\n   identifier type, while
    minimizing the security and privacy\n   implications, thus providing guidance
    to protocol designers and\n   protocol implementers.  Finally, it provides recommendations
    for\n   future protocol specifications regarding the specification of the\n   aforementioned
    numeric identifiers.\n\n\t "

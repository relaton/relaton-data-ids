- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Provider Backbone Transport (PBT, known as well as PBB-TE and \n   progressed
    in IEEE as 802.1Qay [802.1Qay]) provides a mechanism \n   where native Ethernet
    point-to-point tunnels can be configured or \n   signaled across a provider-based
    Ethernet network [FEDYK]. PWE3 \n   architecture defines a mechanism, called pseudowires,
    that emulates \n   the essential attributes of a layer-2 and layer-1 service over
    a \n   Packet Switched Network (PSN). This draft describes the architecture \n
    \  and procedures where Pseudowires are carried across PBT tunnels. In \n   this
    proposal PBT tunnels are used as the PSN. \n\n\t "

  content: "   Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets by\n   placing
    additional information in existing fields, by adding\n   semantics to IP addresses
    themselves, or by adding fields.  The\n   intent is to facilitate enhanced routing/forwarding
    decisions based\n   on these additional semantics to provide differentiated forwarding\n
    \  paths for different packet flows distinct from simple shortest path\n   first
    routing.  The process is defined as Semantic Networking.\n\n   This document provides
    a brief introduction to Semantic Networking.\n\n\t "

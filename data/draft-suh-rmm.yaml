  content: "This document defines a new protocol, namely, Regional Mobile IPv6 \nmobility
    management (RMM/RMIPv6). RMM mechanism satisfies the LMM \nrequirements while
    it is more flexible mobility management scheme \nthan existing solution, for example
    HMIPv6. This document therefore\ndescribes methods to be used to reduce the amount
    of signaling to\nthe Home Agent and Correspondent Nodes. In addition, this scheme
    \nis flexible enough to adapt to any network topology assumed by \nIPv6. The network
    that using RMM/RMIPv6 is robust against the failure \nor the performance degradation.
    The mechanism is intended to reuse \nthe Care of Address. Moreover, the forwarding
    tunnel length from \nan anchor point to a Mobile Node can be a controllable or
    \nconfigurable. \n\t "

  content: "   High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WANs) represent a critical\n
    \  infrastructure for the modern global research and education\n   community,
    facilitating collaboration across national and\n   international boundaries.  These
    networks, such as Janet, ESnet,\n   GÉANT, Internet2, CANARIE, and others, are
    designed to support the\n   general needs of the research and education users
    they serve but also\n   the the transmission of vast amounts of data generated
    by scientific\n   research, high-performance computing, distributed AI-training
    and\n   large-scale simulations.\n\n   This document provides an overview of the
    terminology and techniques\n   used for existing HP-WANS.  It also explores the
    technological\n   advancements, operational tools, and future directions for HP-WANs,\n
    \  emphasising their role in enabling cutting-edge scientific research,\n   big
    data analysis, AI training and massive industrial data analysis.\n\n\t "

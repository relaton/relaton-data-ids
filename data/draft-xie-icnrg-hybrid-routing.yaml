  content: "   Name-based routing in information-centric networks faces many\n   challenges,
    one of which is the scalability challenge; in particular,\n   content routers
    may not have sufficiently large FIB to store a large\n   portion of name prefixes,
    even if the latter are aggressively\n   aggregated.  In many ICN designs routers
    have to rely on inefficient\n   mechanisms (e.g., Interest broadcast in content-centric
    networks) in\n   order to route requests.  In this draft, we describe a hybrid,\n
    \  reactive routing approach, where we augment the information-centric\n   network
    design with an Infrastructure Information Base (IIB) to reap\n   the benefits
    of both name-based and infrastructure-based routing.\n   Simulation-based evaluations
    demonstrate that this scheme can\n   significantly improve the network scalability
    by cutting down the\n   number of broadcast packets while maintaining the same
    level of the\n   user-perceived latency.\n\n\t "

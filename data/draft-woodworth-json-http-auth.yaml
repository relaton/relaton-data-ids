  script: Latn
  content: "   The |JSON| authentication scheme provides a mechanism for exchanging\n
    \  authentication challenges and credentials as objects in the form of\n   JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON).  This scheme offers a secure\n   mechanism of providing
    authenticated access to a set of protected\n   HTTP resources which may be handled
    by scripting utility framework as\n   in XMLHttpRequest calls (AJAX) or directly
    by the client's user\n   agent.  This chaining feature is unique to this scheme.\n\n\t "

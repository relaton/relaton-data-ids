  content: "   This document addresses the transport-layer challenges of path\n   selection
    in environments with multiple available tunneling options\n   and congestion control
    mechanisms.  It identifies congestion control\n   conflicts that arise from nested
    tunneling protocols and proposes a\n   congestion-aware multipath tunnel selection
    algorithm that conforms\n   to the guidelines established in [RFC9599] for adding
    congestion\n   notification to protocols that encapsulate IP.  The proposed approach\n
    \  considers Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) propagation,\n   transport
    protocol characteristics, and network conditions to\n   optimize path selection
    while avoiding multilevel congestion control\n   issues.  This work aligns with
    current Transport and Services Working\n   Group efforts on Non-Queue-Building
    (NQB) behaviors, careful\n   congestion control resume, and multipath transport
    protocols.\n\n\t "

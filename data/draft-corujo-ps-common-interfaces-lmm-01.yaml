  content: "   This memo is a problem statement on the use of link events for\n   enhanced
    handover control in network based localized mobility\n   management.  Starting
    from existing solutions for fast link detection\n   the document aims at discussing
    possibilities to extend with a 2.5\n   layer the interface between MN and AR for
    handover control.  The\n   document also presents a set of considerations and
    identifies\n   conditions where a layer 2.5 based interface offers significant\n
    \  advantages compared to a pure layer three solution.  The document\n   addresses
    separately scenarios for Localized Mobility Management and\n   scenarios involving
    interactions between PMIP and CMIP.\n\n\t "

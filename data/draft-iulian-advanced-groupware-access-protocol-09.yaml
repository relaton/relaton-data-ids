  content: "   The Advanced Groupware Access Protocol, (AGAP) allows a client to\n
    \  access and store electronic mail messages, contacts, events, files,\n   and
    configurations on a server.  The electronic mail messages can be\n   grouped in
    folders.  AGAP also provides the capability for an offline\n   client to resynchronize
    with the server.\n\n   AGAP does not specify a means of posting electronic mail
    messages;\n   this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP\n
    \  [RFC2821] .  It also does not specify a means for exchanging messages\n   with
    contacts that are reported as being online; this function is\n   handled by an
    instant messaging protocol such as XMPP [RFC3921] .\n\n   AGAP includes the following
    operations for electronic mail messages:\n   creating, deleting, renaming, moving
    and coping mail folders;\n   checking for new messages; permanently removing messages;
    moving and\n   coping messages between folders; fetching information about a\n
    \  message; setting and clearing tags for messages; searching in\n   messages;
    retrieving only a part of a message; marking messages as\n   SPAM; deleting attachments
    from a message.\n\n   AGAP includes the following operations to manipulate the
    contacts:\n   creating, deleting, moving, coping, tagging, and searching contacts;\n
    \  checking if a contact is online; fetching information about a\n   contact.\n\n
    \  AGAP includes the following operations related to the use of the\n   events:
    creating, deleting, moving, coping and tagging events in\n   calendar; fetching
    events details; searching for events.\n\n   All items are read and written in
    format XML encoded UTF-8 [RFC3629]\n   and each item is identified by a unique
    alphanumeric identifier.\n\n   AGAP is designed to support access only to a single
    server per\n   connection.  It is also designed to balance the volume of text\n
    \  exchanged between the server and clients and its readability by\n   humans
    for debugging.\n\n\t "

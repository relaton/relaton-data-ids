  content: "     A network may be built from multiple layers that may be technology-\n
    \    specific divisions, or may be administrative divisions. It is \n     important
    to globally optimize network resource utilization, taking \n     into account
    all layers, rather than optimizing resource \n     utilization at each layer independently.
    This allows better network \n     efficiency to be achieved through a process
    that we call inter-\n     layer traffic engineering (TE).  \n      \n     The
    Virtual Network Topology (VNT) is defined as the network \n     topology formed
    by lower-layer LSPs and advertised to the higher \n     layer as TE links. The
    Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a \n     powerful tool to achieve inter-layer
    traffic engineering, but \n     requires a separate function to manage and control
    the VNT. \n     This document defines the VNT Manager (VNTM), which manages and
    \n     controls the VNT for PCE-based inter-layer traffic engineering. \n\t "

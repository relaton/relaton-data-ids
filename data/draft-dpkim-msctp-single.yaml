  content: "   SCTP can be used to support soft IP handover between heterogeneous
    \n   wireless networks with the help of the ADDIP extension and its multi-\n   homing
    feature. In this document, we describe the issues in SCTP \n   handover between
    homogeneous wireless networks for a single-homed \n   host that may cause the
    serious communication delay. Then, we propose \n   the use of the ASCONF chunk
    with the cumulative ASCONF Parameters for \n\n   Add IP Set Primary and Delete
    IP ASCONF Parameter to support faster \n   IP handover for a single-homed host.

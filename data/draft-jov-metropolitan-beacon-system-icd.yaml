  content: "   This document describes the air interface of the Metropolitan Beacon
    \n   System (MBS) system.   \n           \n   MBS provides a high precision, reliable,
    consistent positioning system \n   indoors and in urban canyons, where GNSS solutions
    are degraded or denied.  \n           \n          In addition to the high 2-D
    accuracy, the MBS system architecture also \n          provides for high resolution
    and accuracy in the vertical dimension, with \n          the aid of embedded sensors.
    \ \n           \n          MBS technology provides a very fast time to first fix
    (TTFF), on the order \n          of ~6 seconds under cold start conditions.  \n
    \          \n          Similar to GNSS, MBS technology allows computation of the
    location on the \n          device without any network dependence thus enabling
    a wide variety of \n          standalone applications.  \n               \n\t "

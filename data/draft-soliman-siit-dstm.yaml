abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a transition mechanism that combines both\n[SIIT]
    and DSTM mechanisms by adding some extensions to allow fast\nrouting of inbound
    packets. This will result in a more decentralised\nand flexible tool to allow
    V6 only hosts to communicate with V4 only\nhosts.\nThe proposed extensions will
    provide a way that allows SIIT routers\nto route packets addressed to a host running
    a single IPv6 stack with\nminimum delay which is suited to real time services.\n\t "

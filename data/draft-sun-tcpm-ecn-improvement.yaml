  content: "   This document describes TCP fairness performance enhancement scheme\n
    \  by use of two parameters congestion degree and link idle rate. It\n   uses
    IP header flag reserved field and ECN 2 bits field to form a new\n   IP congestion
    and Spare Flag (ICSF) and uses 3bits of reserved bits\n   in the TCP header to
    compose the TCP Congestion and Spare Flag (TCSF)\n   field. This method identifies
    the congestion and link idle status to\n   make sure that every TCP flow can receive
    the same degree of fairness\n   and can improve TCP send window adjustment speed
    and transmission\n   efficiency.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The widespread interest in provider-provisioned Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) solutions lead to memos proposing different and overlapping solutions. The
    IETF working groups (first Provider Provisioned VPNs and later Layer 2 VPNs and
    Layer 3 VPNs) have discussed these proposals and documented specifications. This
    has lead to the development of a partially new set of concepts used to describe
    the set of VPN services.\n\n To a certain extent, more than one term covers the
    same concept, and sometimes the same term covers more than one concept. This document
    seeks to make the terminology in the area clearer and more intuitive. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "This document provides some guidelines for electronic mail clients \n
    \  that support Email Address Internationalization (EAI). A number of \n   interoperability
    cases between different versions of email components \n   are reviewed. Some User
    Interface recommendations are made that will \n   minimize discrepancies between
    the display of composed and received \n   email in different language environments.\n\t "

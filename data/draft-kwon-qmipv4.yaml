  content: "Mobile IP (MIP) suffers from the so-called triangular routing problem.\nMoreover,
    MIP Home Agent (HA) tends to undergo severe data traffic\nload, since it should
    deliver all the data packets toward mobile\nnodes. This paper proposes a simple
    extension of MIP, called Query-\nbased MIP (QMIP), in which the binding query
    to HA will be used to\nget the care-of address of a mobile node and to deliver
    the\nsubsequent data packets over the optimized data path. The proposed\nQMIP
    scheme can be applied to MIPv4 and Proxy MIPv6 as well.\n\t "

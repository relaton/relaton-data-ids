  content: "   RFC 2418 outlines the procedures for IETF Session operation.\n   However,
    it contains little information about post-IETF meeting\n   working group chair
    responsibilities.  In particular, it provides\n   little guidance with respect
    to either form or submission deadlines\n   for the artifacts of the meeting, namely,
    session minutes and\n   presentation materials.  This document addresses the form
    and content\n   of Working Group agendas and minutes.\n\t "

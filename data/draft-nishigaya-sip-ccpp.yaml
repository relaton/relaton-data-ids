  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a SIP extension for CC/PP (Composite \nCapability/Preference
    Profiles) exchange. CC/PPex, proposed by W3C, \nis only usable for client-pull
    service like HTTP. It is not suitable \nfor server initiated push services. Since
    traditional SIP already \nhas a method to convey the limited terminal capabilities
    for \nmultimedia calls, SIP naturally extends to support CC/PP. This \nextension
    allows various types of push services to know the terminal \ncapabilities before
    delivering the contents to the push clients. \nThis is accomplished by introducing
    some additional headers in the \nREGISTER/OPTIONS message that carry the same
    information as CC/PPex \ndoes.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to RFC7030, Enrollment over Secure
    Transport to give an indication to a end-entity device when it should start attempting
    to renew its certificates. Prior art is that client decides, with a typical recommmendation
    to start when the remaining lifetime of the certificate is at the 50% point. As
    typical certificate lifetimes are reduced from years to fractions of a year, the
    50% may be far too early, and this document provides a way to give alternate advice.</p>"

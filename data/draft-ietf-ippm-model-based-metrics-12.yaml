  content: "   We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to assess
    if\n   a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target\n
    \  Transport Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive
    subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly\n   applied to critical
    infrastructure, such as network interconnections\n   or even individual devices,
    to accurately detect if any part of the\n   infrastructure will prevent paths
    traversing it from meeting the\n   Target Transport Performance.\n\n   Model Based
    Metrics rely on mathematical models to specify a Targeted\n   Suite of IP Diagnostic
    tests, designed to assess whether common\n   transport protocols can be expected
    to meet a predetermined Target\n   Transport Performance over an Internet path.\n\n
    \  For Bulk Transport Capacity the IP diagnostics are built using test\n   streams
    and statistical criteria for evaluating the packet transfer\n   that mimic TCP
    over the complete path.  The temporal structure of the\n   test stream (bursts,
    etc) mimic TCP or other transport protocol\n   carrying bulk data over a long
    path.  However they are constructed to\n   be independent of the details of the
    subpath under test, end systems\n   or applications.  Likewise the success criteria
    evaluates the packet\n   transfer statistics of the subpath against criteria determined
    by\n   protocol performance models applied to the Target Transport\n   Performance
    of the complete path.  The success criteria also does not\n   depend on the details
    of the subpath, end systems or application.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Many Internet servers offer content in two transports: unencrypted,\n
    \  and encrypted with TLS.  A user who accesses some content with a URL\n   that
    indicates unencrypted (such as \"http:\") might prefer to get the\n   content
    encrypted but doesn't bother to, or can't, change the URL to\n   indicate this.
    \ This proposal allows Internet clients, particularly\n   web clients and mail
    user agents, to do a DNS lookup to see whether\n   they might expect content for
    a particular host to also be available\n   under TLS.  Using the DNS for this
    is much faster than attempting a\n   TLS session that might time out or take many
    round trips in order to\n   discover that the content is not available.\n\n\t "

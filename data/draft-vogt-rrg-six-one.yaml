  content: "There is heightened concern about the growth of the global routing\ntable
    and the increased frequency of routing table updates.  Both is\ndue to the use
    of provider-independent addressing space in edge\nnetworks, which accommodates
    operators' desire to move traffic\nquickly and easily from one provider to another.
    \ The main recent\nproposals attempt to solve this problem by hiding provider-\nindependent
    addressing space through a level of indirection.\nUnfortunately, indirection requires
    a non-trivial distribution of\naddress translation information across the Internet.
    \ This is either\nslow, or costly in terms of signaling overhead, or both.  Security\nand
    transitionability are further issues.  This document proposes an\nalternative
    solution, which is based on a single, provider-dependent\naddressing space and
    hence avoids the problems of indirection.  The\nsolution meets the objectives
    of edge network operators while\nlimiting the size of the routing table and its
    update frequency.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    mechanism tailored for satellite constellation networks. It describes how a Host
    generates IPv6 Interface Identifiers (IIDs) based on deterministic orbital topology
    parameters and spacecraft identifiers, rather than hardware Media Access Control
    (MAC) addresses. By embedding topological information (Shell, Orbit, Satellite
    Index) directly into the IID, this method provides semantic addressing, allowing
    network operators and routing protocols to derive physical location information
    solely from the IPv6 address. This approach guarantees global uniqueness within
    the constellation, minimizes the need for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), and
    is suitable for Links typically found in space environments, such as CCSDS AOS
    or space- based Ethernet.</p>"

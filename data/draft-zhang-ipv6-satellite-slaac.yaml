  content: "   This document specifies a Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)\n
    \  mechanism tailored for satellite constellation networks.  It\n   describes
    how a Host generates IPv6 Interface Identifiers (IIDs)\n   based on deterministic
    orbital topology parameters and spacecraft\n   identifiers, rather than hardware
    Media Access Control (MAC)\n   addresses.\n\n   By embedding topological information
    (Shell, Orbit, Satellite Index)\n   directly into the IID, this method provides
    semantic addressing,\n   allowing network operators and routing protocols to derive
    physical\n   location information solely from the IPv6 address.  This approach\n
    \  guarantees global uniqueness within the constellation, minimizes the\n   need
    for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), and is suitable for Links\n   typically
    found in space environments, such as CCSDS AOS or space-\n   based Ethernet.\n\n\t "

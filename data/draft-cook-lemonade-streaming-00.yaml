  content: "This document, part of the Lemonade Working Group, describes the Best\nCurrent
    Practice for streaming multimedia attachments received by a\nresource constrained
    and/or mobile device from a IMAP server.  It\nallows such clients, which are limited
    in storage space and\nbandwidth, to play video and audio content which is attached
    to email\nmessages.  The document describes a profile for making use of the\nexisting
    IMAP URLAUTH extension [2] and the \"Netann\" SIP Media\nService as described
    in RFC 4240 [1].\n\t "

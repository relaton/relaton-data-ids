  content: "Lately, a few use-cases have been identified where, besides path\nsetup,
    specific configuration of intermediate nodes is required for\nthe establishment
    of an LSP with its associated functions.  Today,\nRSVP-TE is not supporting the
    selective configuration of intermediate\nnodes; hence extensions are required
    to equip RSVP-TE with such a\ncapability.  In this document we summarize the use-cases
    and their\nrequirements and sketch alternative solutions to configure\nintermediate
    nodes.  Since one of the main issues with intermediate\nnode configuration is
    the introduction of potential scaling problems,\nwe included scalability in our
    analysis.  This document does not\nspecify any extensions; its sole purpose is
    to foster discussion on\nthe subject.\n\t "

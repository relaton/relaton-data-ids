  content: "   Autonomous agents such as LLM-powered crawlers, browser-integrated\n
    \  assistants, and task-oriented bots are rapidly becoming first-class\n   HTTP
    clients on the Web. Today’s infrastructure largely assumes a\n   human behind
    a browser and monetizes content through advertising and\n   coarse subscriptions.
    \ Automated agents consume content at scale\n   without rendering pages or viewing
    ads, exacerbating bot-mitigation\n   arms races and economic misalignment between
    content providers and AI\n   systems.\n\n   This document describes an HTTP Agent
    Profile (HAP) that enables: (1)\n   cryptographic authentication of agent traffic
    using HTTP Message\n   Signatures; (2) clear separation between human and agent
    traffic\n   using privacy-preserving human tokens; and (3) protocol-level value\n
    \  exchange for agents via HTTP status code 402 (\"Payment Required\") and\n   pluggable
    micropayment mechanisms.  The profile reuses existing HTTP\n   features and is
    designed for incremental deployment via reverse\n   proxies, CDNs, and agent libraries.\n\n\t "

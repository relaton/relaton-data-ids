abstract:
- content: '<p>Autonomous agents such as LLM-powered crawlers, browser-integrated
    assistants, and task-oriented bots are rapidly becoming first-class HTTP clients
    on the Web. Today’s infrastructure largely assumes a human behind a browser and
    monetizes content through advertising and coarse subscriptions. Automated agents
    consume content at scale without rendering pages or viewing ads, exacerbating
    bot-mitigation arms races and economic misalignment between content providers
    and AI systems. This document describes an HTTP Agent Profile (HAP) that enables:
    (1) cryptographic authentication of agent traffic using HTTP Message Signatures;
    (2) clear separation between human and agent traffic using privacy-preserving
    human tokens; and (3) protocol-level value exchange for agents via HTTP status
    code 402 ("Payment Required") and pluggable micropayment mechanisms. The profile
    reuses existing HTTP features and is designed for incremental deployment via reverse
    proxies, CDNs, and agent libraries.</p>'

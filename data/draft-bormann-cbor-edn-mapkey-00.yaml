  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, STD 94 == RFC 8949)\n
    \  is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of\n   extremely
    small code size, fairly small message size, and\n   extensibility without the
    need for version negotiation.\n\n   CBOR diagnostic notation (EDN) is widely used
    to represent CBOR data\n   items in a way that is accessible to humans, for instance
    for\n   examples in a specification.  Complex examples often use nested maps,\n
    \  the map keys (labels) for each of which are often sourced from\n   different
    specifications.  While the e'' application extension\n   provides a way to import
    data items, particularly constant values,\n   from a CDDL model, it does not help
    with automatically selecting the\n   right kind of map depending on its position
    in the nested maps.\n\n\n   // The present document is intended to capture ideas
    initially\n   // discussed at the CBOR WG interim 2025-06-25 and demonstrate some\n
    \  // design alternatives.  It is not ready for adoption yet in any way.\n\n\t "

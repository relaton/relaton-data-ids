  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a new mechanism in Mobile IPv6, which allows \na
    mobile node to discover promptly a suitable slave home agent's \naddress on its
    home link when the mobile node may not know a master\nhome agent's address due
    to some reasons. To implement the proposed\nmechanism, new Binding Update/Acknowledgement
    messages are defined.\nThe proposed mechanism might be more efficient and general,
    and \nfaster than the existing Home Agent Address Discovery in [1].\n  \n\t "

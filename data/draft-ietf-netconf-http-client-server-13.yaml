  content: "   This document defines two YANG modules: the first defines a minimal\n
    \  grouping for configuring an HTTP client, and the second defines a\n   minimal
    grouping for configuring an HTTP server.  It is intended that\n   these groupings
    will be used to help define the configuration for\n   simple HTTP-based protocols
    (not for complete web servers or\n   browsers).\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed
    by RFC Editor)\n\n   This draft contains placeholder values that need to be replaced
    with\n   finalized values at the time of publication.  This note summarizes\n
    \  all of the substitutions that are needed.  No other RFC Editor\n   instructions
    are specified elsewhere in this document.\n\n   Artwork in this document contains
    shorthand references to drafts in\n   progress.  Please apply the following replacements
    (note: not all may\n   be present):\n\n   *  AAAA --> the assigned RFC value for
    draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-\n      types\n\n   *  DDDD --> the assigned RFC value
    for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-\n      server\n\n   *  FFFF --> the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-\n      server\n\n   *  GGGG --> the
    assigned RFC value for this draft\n\n   Artwork in this document contains placeholder
    values for the date of\n   publication of this draft.  Please apply the following
    replacement:\n\n   *  2023-04-17 --> the publication date of this draft\n   The
    \"Relation to other RFCs\" section Section 1.1 contains the text\n   \"one or
    more YANG modules\" and, later, \"modules\".  This text is\n   sourced from a
    file in a context where it is unknown how many modules\n   a draft defines.  The
    text is not wrong as is, but it may be improved\n   by stating more directly how
    many modules are defined.\n\n   The \"Relation to other RFCs\" section Section
    1.1 contains a self-\n   reference to this draft, along with a corresponding Informative\n
    \  Reference in the Appendix.\n\n   The following Appendix section is to be removed
    prior to publication:\n\n   *  Appendix A.  Change Log\n\n\t "

    destination address and subnet mask as the first index and DSCP\nvalue as the

    in accordance with them.\nTherefore, applications with different demands of Quality
    of Service\n(QoS) can be served accordingly, which can promote the quality of\ntransmission
    and finally achieve differentiated services.\n\t "

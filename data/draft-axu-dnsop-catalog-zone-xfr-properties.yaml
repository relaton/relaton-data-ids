abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies DNS Catalog Zones Properties that define the
    primary name servers from which specific or all member zones can transfer their
    associated zone, as well as properties related to zone transfers such as access
    control. This document also defines a groups property, for the apex of the catalog
    zone, as a location to assign the additional properties to certain catalog zone
    groups. Besides the additional properties, this document updates RFC9432 by explicitly
    allowing CNAMEs and DNAMEs.</p>"

  content: "          The RVP protocol [2] can be used to query properties of objects,\n
    \         subscribe to certain kinds of events, and send instant messages\n          to
    objects.  These objects are often users, but there are other\n          classes
    of objects as well.\n \n          A schema needs to be defined which applies to
    all kinds of RVP\n          objects, as well as more detailed schemas for the
    most commonly\n          used objects, users and groups.\n \n          The required
    properties for all RVP objects include common name\n          (Cn), schema type
    and access control list.  The required\n          properties for a user object,
    which represents a single human\n          user of the system, include status,
    status message, email address\n          and directory server address.  The required
    properties for a\n          group object, which represents a list of objects which
    may be\n          messaged all at once by messaging this group, include member-\n
    \         count and owner.\n\n\t "

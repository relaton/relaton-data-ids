  content: "   This document is proposed to use version 2 of the Internet Key \n   Exchange
    (IKEv2) to replace current HIP protocol's base exchange. \n   IKE-H is an extension
    of IKE used for performing mutual \n   authentication, establishing and maintaining
    security associations. \n   It provides continuity of communications between not
    only hosts but \n   also security gateways. It supports HIP identity authentication
    \n   method and the establishment of keying material, consequently being \n   used
    by IPsec Encapsulated Security payload (ESP) to establish a two-\n   way secure
    communication channel between the hosts or security \n   gateways.  \n\t "

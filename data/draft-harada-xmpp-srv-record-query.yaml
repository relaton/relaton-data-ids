  content: "   According to RFC 6120, XMPP clients should use SRV records within\n
    \  the connection establishment process to servers. There are two\n   purposes
    for using SRV records. The one is to advertise the FQDN of\n   at least one server
    to clients to establish an initial TCP\n   connection. The other purpose is to
    advertise at least two or more\n   FQDN with priority and weight information to
    clients to accomplish\n   load balancing, a redundant server environment and so
    on. However,\n   most standard resolver libraries of recent client OSs don't support\n
    \  SRV record resolution. Furthermore, many DNS hosting services also\n   don't
    support SRV records. This document proposes a solution that\n   enables a server
    and client to achieve load balancing and a\n   redundant server environment in
    case SRV records cannot be used.\n   Moreover, the proposed IQ-result message
    can include minimum wait\n   time to reconnect, allowing clients to reconnect
    after the most\n   suitable wait time avoiding congestion.\n\n\t "

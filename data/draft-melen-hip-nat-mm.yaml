  content: "This document defines extensions for HIP mobility and multihoming\nmechanisms
    to operate in network environments with NAT devices.  The\nextensions are based
    on the ICE protocol that allows two\ncommunicating end-hosts to establish a direct
    communications path\nwith each other even when residing in separate private address\nrealms.
    \ The focus of the extensions in this document is on fault-\ntolerance with symmetric
    locator pairs, and load-balancing is also\ndiscussed.  This document also updates
    RFC5206.\n\t "

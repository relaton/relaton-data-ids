  content: "HTTP, the hypertext transfer protocol, underpins the World-Wide Web (WWW).
    \ As the Web has grown, pressures have mounted to add a variety of facilities
    to HTTP.  Some of the new features that have been proposed include:  keep-alive,
    packetized data, compression, security, and payment.  This memo offers an alternative:
    \ well-defined hooks in a slightly modified HTTP framework that make it possible
    to add extensions to the basic protocol in a way that will retain compatible behavior
    between clients and servers, yet allow both clients and servers to discover and
    use extended capabilities.  The goal is to use HTTP as just a transport mechanism,
    leaving other, higher-level (session) activities to extensions.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a model for the lightweight use of SDP Offer/\n
    \  Answer in WebRTC.  The goal is to minimize reliance on Offer/Answer\n   exchanges
    in a WebRTC session and provide applications with the tools\n   necessary to implement
    the signalling that they may need in a way\n   that best fits their custom requirements
    and topologies.  This\n   simplifies signalling of multiple media sources or providing
    RTP\n   Synchronisation source (SSRC) identification in multi-party sessions.\n
    \  Another important goal of this model is to remove from clients\n   topological
    constraints such as the requirement to know in advance\n   all SSRC identifiers
    that they could potentially introduce in a\n   particular session.\n\n   The model
    described here is similar to the one employed by the data\n   channel JavaScript
    APIs in WebRTC, where methods are supported on\n   PeerConnection without being
    reflected in SDP.\n\n   This document does not question the use of SDP and the
    Offer/Answer\n   model or the value they have in terms of interoperability with
    legacy\n   or other non-WebRTC devices.\n\n\t "

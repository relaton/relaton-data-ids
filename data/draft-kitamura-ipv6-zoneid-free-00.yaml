  content: "   This document describes how end users can become free from using\n
    \  zone identifiers for IPv6 link-local addresses.\n\n   When users deal with
    IPv6 link-local addresses, it is thought that\n   it is mandatory thing to specify
    accompanied zone identifiers. For\n   end users, however, it is troublesome and
    nuisance thing to do it.\n   Because it is very hard for normal end users to find
    appropriate\n   zone identifiers for this purpose.\n\n   From another viewpoint,
    the usage of IPv6 link-local addresses\n   accompanied with zone identifiers is
    quite different from the usage\n   of traditional global addresses, many problems
    are caused and new\n   specifications are required to fix these problems.\n\n
    \  This document explores and describes a new mechanism that makes end\n   users
    free from using zone identifiers for IPv6 link-local\n   addresses. In order to
    achieve the mechanism, a new notion table\n   that is called \"Link-Local Route
    Cache\" is introduced.\n\n   This method is upper compatible with the current
    mechanism and\n   harmless to the existing communications. By adding small\n   improvement
    to neighbor discovery implementation, \"Link-Local Route\n   Cache\" is easily
    implemented.\n\n   With this method, end users will be released from using nuisance\n
    \  zone identifiers for IPv6 link-local addresses.\n\n\t "

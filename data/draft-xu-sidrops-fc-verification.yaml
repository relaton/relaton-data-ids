  content: "   The Forwarding Commitment (FC) is an RPKI object that attests to the\n
    \  complete routing intents description which an Autonomous System (AS)\n   would
    obey in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route propagation.  This\n   document specifies
    an FC-based AS Path Verification methodology to\n   mitigate, even solve, AS Path
    forgery and route leaks.  This document\n   also explains the various BGP security
    threats that FC can help\n   address and provides operational considerations associated
    with FC\n   deployment.\n\n\t "

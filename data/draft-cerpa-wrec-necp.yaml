  content: "This document describes 'NECP', a lightweight protocol for\nsignalling
    between servers and the network elements that forward\ntraffic to them.  It is
    intended for use in a wide variety of server\napplications, including for origin
    servers, proxies, and\ntransparent proxies.  The network element may also be a
    range of\ndevices, including so-called L4 or content-aware switches and\nload-balancing
    routers.\nNECP provides methods for network elements to learn about servers'\ncapabilities,
    availability, and hints as to which flows can and can\nnot be serviced.  This
    allows network elements to perform load\nbalancing across a farm of servers, redirection
    to network\ntransparent proxies, and cut-through of flows that can not be\nserved
    by the farm.\n\n\n\t "

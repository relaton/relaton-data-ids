  content: "This glossary is intended to help with the understanding of terms\nused
    in the Ivip core-edge separation architecture and of some non-\nIvip terms which
    are pertinent to scalable routing.  These are not\n\"official\" definitions of
    terms as used in scalable routing, but I\nhope they will help newcomers to the
    field.  Please suggest\ncorrections, additions and improvements.\n\t "

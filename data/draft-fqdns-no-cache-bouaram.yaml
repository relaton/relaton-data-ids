  content: "   This document specifies the procedures for resolving Fully Qualified\n
    \  Domain Names (FQDNs) in IPv6 and IPv4 networks when both the Media\n   Access
    Control (MAC) and the Domain Name System (DNS) cache are\n   empty.  The procedures
    aim to reduce the latency and improve the\n   efficiency of FQDN resolution in
    such scenarios.  The procedures\n   described in this document are relevant for
    both IPv6 and IPv4\n   networks, and they can be implemented in hosts and routers.\n\n\t "

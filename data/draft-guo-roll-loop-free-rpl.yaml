  content: "   The IETF has developed the IPv6 based standards for Low-power and\n
    \  Lossy Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained\n   applications,
    such as field monitoring, inventory control and so on.\n   The IPv6 Routing Protocol
    for LLNs (RPL) was published as [RFC6550]\n   in March 2012. Based on routing
    metrics and constraints [RFC6551],\n   RPL builds Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
    topology to establish\n   bidirectional routes for LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-\n
    \  point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point. RPL routes are\n   optimized
    for traffic to or from one or more roots that act as sinks.\n   As a result, a
    DAG is partitioned into one or more Destination\n   Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one
    DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered\n   as a feasible routing protocol for
    LLNs. However, DODAG loops and\n   lack of a loop free DODAG local repair mechanism
    are two open issues\n   to be addressed. This draft introduces an alternative
    rank and an\n   Objective Function to eliminate DODAG loops in RPL. Based on the\n
    \  proposed rank and Objective Function, this draft introduces a loop\n   free
    RPL.\n\n\t "

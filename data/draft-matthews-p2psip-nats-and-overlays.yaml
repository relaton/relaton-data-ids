  content: "   This paper explains the problems created by Network Address \n   Translators
    (NATs) in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlays and recommends some \n   NAT traversal techniques
    appropriate for P2PSIP networks. Two P2PSIP \n   overlay architectures that accommodate
    the presence of NATs are \n   described and analyzed. The first is the super-peer
    scheme used in a    number of p2p file-sharing systems today. The second is a
    scheme \n   where all peers play an equal role in the overlay.  \n\n\n\t "

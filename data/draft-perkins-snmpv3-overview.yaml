  content: "   This document describes a Session Based Security Model (SBSM) for use\n
    \  within version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3).\n   The
    security model is designed to establish a \"session\" between two\n   interacting
    SNMPv3 entities, over which SNMP operations can be sent\n   securely.  It provides
    a number of security properties not previously\n   available in defined SNMPv3
    security models, such as public key based\n   identity authentication, limited
    life-time keying, and the ability to\n   make use of previously implemented and
    deployed security\n   infrastructures for purposes of identification and authentication.\n\t "

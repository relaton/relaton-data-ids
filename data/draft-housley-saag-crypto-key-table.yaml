  content: "This document specifies the information contained in a database of\nlong-lived
    cryptographic keys used by many different security\nprotocols.  The database design
    supports both manual and automated\nkey management.  In many instances, the security
    protocols do not\ndirectly use the long-lived key, but rather a key derivation
    function\nis used to derive a short-lived key from a long-lived key.\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes an architecture for secure IP multicast.\n   It
    identifies the basic components and their functionalities,\n   and specifies how
    these components interact with each other and\n   with the surrounding systems.\n
    \n   The main design principles followed in developing this architecture are\n
    \  simplicity, flexibility, ease of incorporation within existing systems.\n   In
    particular, the design attempts to mimic the IPSec architecture, and\n   to re-use
    existing IPSec mechanisms wherever possible.\n \n   The proposed architecture
    is able to accommodate many of the existing\n   proposals for multicast key management.
    In this draft, we concentrate\n   on the architectural building blocks required
    to enable a group member\n   (either a receiver or a sender of data) to use secure
    IP multicast.\n   Design of the group controller(s) is left to future documents.\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "This document describes a mechanism for enabling RDMA Network \n   Interface
    Cards (RNICs) that implement both the IETF and RDMAC \n   versions of the DDP
    and RDMAP protocols to interoperate with legacy \n   RNICs that are based on the
    RDMAC version of the protocols.  The \n   proposed scheme uses MPA Request/Reply
    Frames to negotiate the \n   protocol version as well as MPA marker and MPA CRC.
    \ A ULP or other \n   supporting entity must perform this negotiation on behalf
    of the \n   RDMAC RNIC because RDMAC MPA does not define an MPA connection \n
    \  scheme using MPA Request/Reply frames. This draft also makes \n   specific
    recommendations for minor changes to the IETF MPA, DDP, and \n   RDMAP internet
    drafts to aid in interoperability.\n\t "

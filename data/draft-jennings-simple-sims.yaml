  content: "This document defines a protocol for conveying binary MIME content in\nnear-real
    time, peer-to-peer or through one or more relays, with the\nopportunity for store
    and forward. SIMS (SIMPLE Instant Messaging\nSessions) can be used as a standalone
    protocol, or in conjunction with\na rendezvous or session setup protocol such
    as SIP.\n\nWhile SIMS was originally envisioned as an alternative to the Media\nSession
    Relay Protocol (MSRP), one section of this document describes\nhow these ideas
    could be applied as MSRP extensions for features such\nas chunking, relay connection
    multiplexing, and prevention of\nhead-of-line blocking.\n\t "

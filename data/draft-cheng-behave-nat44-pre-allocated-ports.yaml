  content: "This document specifies a NAT44 operation model where external\nports
    are pre-allocated per subscriber. The NAT44 function is\ndeployed in carrier's
    networks also known as CGN. Three new RADIUS\nattributes are proposed to support
    that operation for\nconfiguration and billing purpose. Translation logging on
    a\nNAT44 device is significantly reduced with this operational model.\n\t "

  content: "The TCP-MD5 option is most commonly used to secure BGP sessions between
    routers.  However, changing the long-term key is difficult, since the change needs
    to be synchronized between different organizations.  We describe single-ended
    strategies that will permit (mostly) unsynchronized key changes.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

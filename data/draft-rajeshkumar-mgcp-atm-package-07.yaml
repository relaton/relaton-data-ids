  content: "This document describes an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) package for
    the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP).  This package includes new Local Connection
    Options, ATM-specific events and signals, and ATM connection parameters.  Also
    included is a description of codec and profile negotiation.  It extends the MGCP
    that is currently being deployed in a number of products.  Implementers should
    be aware of developments in the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU SG16, which
    are currently working on a potential successor to this protocol.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

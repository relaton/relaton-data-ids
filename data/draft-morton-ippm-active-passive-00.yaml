  content: "   This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive\n   performance
    assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can\n   be described as Active
    or Passive.  Methods can take on some of the\n   attributes of both, and we refer
    to these as Hybrid Methods.\n\n\t "

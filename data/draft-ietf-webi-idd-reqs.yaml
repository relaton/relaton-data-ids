  content: "World Wide Web (WWW) intermediaries (such as proxy caches, gateways,\nand
    surrogate servers) are widely used by information providers,\ntransport providers,
    and information consumers to enhance the\ncharacteristics of a web transaction.
    While there are firm models\nand protocols for the interactions between these
    devices when they\nare used, there is no common method used to discover what\nintermediaries
    are available. This document establishes a set of\nrequirements for a system that
    would make discovery of application\nlevel intermediaries by web clients efficient
    and practical.\n\t "

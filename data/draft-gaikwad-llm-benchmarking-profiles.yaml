abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines performance benchmarking profiles for Large Language
    Model (LLM) serving systems. Profiles bind the terminology defined in draft-gaikwad-llm-benchmarking-terminology
    and the procedures described in draft-gaikwad-llm-benchmarking-methodology to
    concrete architectural roles and workload patterns. Each profile clarifies the
    System Under Test (SUT) boundary, measurement points, and interpretation constraints
    required for reproducible and comparable benchmarking. This document specifies
    profiles only. It does not define new metrics, benchmark workloads, or acceptance
    thresholds.</p>"

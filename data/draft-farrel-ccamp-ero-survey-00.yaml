  content: "   During discussions of a document to provide guidance on the use of\n
    \  addressing fields within the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic\n   Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) signaling protocol used in Generalized\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS), it was determined that there\n   was considerable variation in the implementation
    of options for the\n   Explicit Route Object (ERO).\n\n   Since there was a proposal
    to deprecate some of the options, it was\n   felt necessary to conduct a survey
    of the existing and planned\n   implementations.\n\n   This document summarizes
    the survey questions and captures the\n   results. Some conclusions are also presented.\n\n
    \  This survey was informal and conducted via email. Responses were\n   collected
    and anonymized by the CCAMP working group chair.\n\n\t "

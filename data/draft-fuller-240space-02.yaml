  content: "This memo reclassifies the address block 240.0.0.0/4 as usable\n   address
    space.  While the community has not concluded whether the\n   block should be
    considered public or private, given the current\n   consumption rate, it is clear
    that the block should not be left\n   unused.  This document also makes several
    recommendations on ways\n   that current implementations of the IP protocol stack
    will need to be\n   modified to make this address space usable.\n\t "

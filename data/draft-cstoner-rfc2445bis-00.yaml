  content: "   Calendar systems export, transport and sometimes even store calendar\n
    \  information in a standard, interoperable format.  This memo defines\n   the
    common format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling\n   information
    across the Internet, known as the iCalendar object\n   format.  An iCalendar object
    may represent an event, to-do or task,\n   or journal entry (note).\n\n   Comments
    are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's\n   mailing list
    at ietf-calsify@osafoundation.org and/or the editor.\n\t "

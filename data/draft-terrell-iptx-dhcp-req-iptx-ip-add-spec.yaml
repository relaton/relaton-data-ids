  content: "This document defines the changes when the IP Bit Mapped Header Size\nSpecification
    Equals 64 Bits, as would be required for the Implementation Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP) to support hosts defined by the IPtX IP Addressing Protocol Family
    Specification. Furthermore, while the underlining implications regarding any Change
    in the Header Size Specification maintains the possibility of having a Profound
    Cascading Affect upon other Protocols. Noting specifically, the affects upon the
    'TCP' and 'UDP' Headers, and the corresponding affects upon the Growth in the
    Number of Available 'PORTS'. Nevertheless, while there is a noticeable growth
    occurring in each of these areas, they remain manageable, because the difference
    between the IPv4 and the IPtX Specification is minimal. In which case, it should
    be clearly understood, the Operations presently defined for the IPv4 IP Addressing
    System would be the same under the IPt1 Specification. And this is valid because
    the differences between their IP Addressing Schematic Design does not mandate
    a requirement for any change, and they both use the same 32Bit Header Size Specification.\nIn
    other words, the implementation of the IPtX Specification has little or No affect,
    nor does it constitute an appreciable change in the Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol Specification, which is Currently used in the IPv4 IP Addressing System.
    Hence, this work should only be considered as an extension of the RFC(s) governing
    and supporting the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for the IPv4 Specification,
    because the only objective this paper maintains, is the development and presentation
    of the IPtX DHCP Specification, which only compliments the requirements in the
    current RFC(s) defining the DHCP Protocol Specification.\n\t "

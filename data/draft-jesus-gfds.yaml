  content: "   Building and managing highly dynamic and heterogeneous decentralized\n
    \  systems can prove to be quite challenging due to the great complexity\n   and
    scale of such environments.  This document specifies a Generic\n   Framework for
    Building Dynamic Decentralized Systems (GFDS), which\n   composes a reference
    architecture and execution model for developing\n   and managing these systems,
    while providing high-level abstractions\n   to users.\n\n\t "

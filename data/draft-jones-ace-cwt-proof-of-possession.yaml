  content: "   This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT)\n
    \  that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of-\n   possession
    key.  Being able to prove possession of a key is also\n   sometimes described
    as the presenter being a holder-of-key.  This\n   specification provides equivalent
    functionality to \"Proof-of-\n   Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens
    (JWTs)\" (RFC 7800), but\n   using CBOR and CWTs rather than JSON and JWTs.\n\n\t "

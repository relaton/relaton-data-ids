  content: "   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) is defined in RFC7854.  Most of the\n
    \  types of messages in BMP are extensible via the mechanism of TLVs.\n   However,
    the most important type of message, the route-monitoring\n   message, has a fixed
    format.\n\n   This document proposes a relatively small change to the format of
    BMP\n   route-monitoring messages.  The new format of route-monitoring\n   messages
    is no longer fixed-format, but tlv-encoded.  This document\n   also proposes to
    split the route-monitoring message-type into 3 new\n   message-types.  For Adj-RIB-In,
    Adj-RIB-Out and Loc-RIB.\n\n   This document proposes two types of TLVs to be
    used in this new\n   format.  A TLV to report the BGP update message itself.  And
    a flags-\n   field TLV, to report state of the reported routes.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The main job of a protocol specification is to document how the\nprotocol
    works. It is sometimes difficult to learn how a protocol\nworks from such a document,
    because there are so many details, and\nthe necessary formalism for accuracy makes
    a specification long and\nintimidating to read. What also is usually lost in the
    process of\ncreating an RFC for a protocol is documentation of the tradeoffs that\nwere
    considered when making controversial choices.  Sometimes it is\npossible to find
    this information on the email archives, but that is\na daunting task.  This document
    is intended to work both as a\ntutorial to understanding IKEv2, and a summary
    of the controversial\nissues, with the reasoning on all sides of each issue.  If
    any\ndifferences in details exist between this document and the IKEv2\nspecification,
    the IKEv2 specification is authoritative. This\ndocument is intended only to make
    the IKEv2 specification more\nunderstandable on the first reading, as well as
    documenting reasoning\nbehind decisions.\n\t "

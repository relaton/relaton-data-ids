  content: "   This draft specifies extensions to the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement\n
    \  messages and processing.  Traditionally, prefixes contained in RAs\n   are
    used for on-link determination, on-link address auto-\n   configuration, but not
    for path setup towards multi-hop destinations.\n   The extensions proposed here
    still rely on RAs being communicated on\n   a single link (not across several
    IP hops), but upon RA reception the\n   prefixes are installed in the routing
    table; they are thus used for\n   forwarding packets further than a single link
    (multi IP hop).\n\n\t "

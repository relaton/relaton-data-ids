  content: "Trust routers form an integral part of the ABFAB infrastructure for\ndetermining
    routes between IdPs and RPs and determining CoI membership.\nSince it is inherent
    in their name that they are to be trusted, this\nInternet Draft specifies a trust
    model for their operation, so that IdPs\nand RPs can rely on them to perform the
    tasks that they are trusted to\nperform. These tasks are:\n\n-\tform a trusted
    route between an IdP and RP\n-\tensure that a community of interest (CoI)only
    has the members that it\nshould have\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes mechanisms that a peer can use to locate and\n
    \  establish a Peer Protocol connection to an admitting peer in order to\n   join
    an overlay network.  In the first mechanism, the joining peer\n   uses multicast
    to locate a bootstrap peer; in the second, the node\n   uses one or more bootstrap
    servers to locate a bootstrap peer; in\n   both cases, the bootstrap peer then
    proxies the request by the\n   joining peer on to the admitting peer.  Each mechanism
    has its\n   advantages and disadvantages, and a node can utilize both.\n\n\t "

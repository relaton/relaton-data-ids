  content: "   An Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) extension defined\n
    \  in RFC8784 allows IPsec traffic to be protected against someone\n   storing
    VPN communications today and decrypting it later, when (and\n   if) cryptographically
    relevant quantum computers are available.  The\n   protection is achieved by means
    of Post-quantum Preshared Key (PPK)\n   which is mixed into the session keys calculation.
    \ However, this\n   protection doesn't cover an initial IKEv2 SA, which might
    be\n   unacceptable in some scenarios.  This specification defines an\n   alternative
    way to get protection against quantum computers, which is\n   similar to the solution
    defined in RFC8784, but protects the initial\n   IKEv2 SA too.\n\n   Besides,
    RFC8784 assumes that PPKs are static and thus they are only\n   used when an initial
    IKEv2 Security Association (SA) is created.  If\n   a fresh PPK is available before
    the IKE SA is expired, then the only\n   way to use it is to delete the current
    IKE SA and create a new one\n   from scratch, which is inefficient.  This specification
    also defines\n   a way to use PPKs in active IKEv2 SA for creating additional
    IPsec\n   SAs and for rekeys operations.\n\n\t "

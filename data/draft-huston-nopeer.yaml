  content: "This document proposes the use of a scope control BGP community.\nThis
    new well-known advisory transitive community is intended to\nallow an origin AS
    to specify the extent to which a specific route\nshould be externally propagated.
    In particular this community,\ntermed here as NOPEER, allows the origin AS to
    specify that a route\nwith this attribute need not be advertised across bilateral
    peer\nconnections.\n\t "

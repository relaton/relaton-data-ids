  content: "   Messaging applications are increasingly making use of end-to-end\n
    \  security mechanisms to ensure that messages are only accessible to\n   the
    communicating endpoints, and not to any servers involved in\n   delivering messages.
    \ Establishing keys to provide such protections\n   is challenging for group chat
    settings, in which more than two\n   participants need to agree on a key but may
    not be online at the same\n   time.  In this document, we specify a key establishment
    protocol that\n   provides efficient asynchronous group key establishment with
    forward\n   secrecy and post-compromise security for groups in size ranging from\n
    \  two to thousands.\n\n\t "

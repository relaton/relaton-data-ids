  content: "   This document introduces the main scenarios related to AI services
    in\n   WAN, as well as their requirements for FANTEL (FAst Notification for\n
    \  Traffic Engineering and Load balancing) in these scenarios.\n   Traditional
    network management mechanisms are often constrained by\n   slow feedback and high
    overhead, limiting their ability to react\n   quickly to sudden link failures,
    congestion, or load imbalances.\n   Therefore, these AI services need FANTEL to
    provide real-time and\n   proactive notifications for traffic engineering and
    load balancing,\n   meeting the requirements of ultra-high throughput and lossless
    data\n   transmission.\n\n\t "

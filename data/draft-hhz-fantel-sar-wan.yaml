abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the main scenarios related to AI services
    in WAN, as well as their requirements for FANTEL (FAst Notification for Traffic
    Engineering and Load balancing) in these scenarios. Traditional network management
    mechanisms are often constrained by slow feedback and high overhead, limiting
    their ability to react quickly to sudden link failures, congestion, or load imbalances.
    Therefore, these AI services need FANTEL to provide real-time and proactive notifications
    for traffic engineering and load balancing, meeting the requirements of ultra-high
    throughput and lossless data transmission.</p>"

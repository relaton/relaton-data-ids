  content: "   There are certain use cases where the Encapusalating Security Payload\n
    \  (ESP) protocol in its current form cannot reach its maximum potential\n   regarding
    security, features and performance.  Although these\n   scenarios are quite different,
    the shortcomings could be remedied by\n   three measures: Introducing more fine-grained
    sub-child-SAs, adapting\n   the ESP header and trailer format, and allowing parts
    of the\n   transport layer header to be unencrypted.  These mechanisms are\n   neither
    completely interdependent, nor are they entirely orthogonal,\n   as the implementation
    of one measure does influence the integration\n   of another.  Although an independent
    specification and implementation\n   of these mechanisms is possible, it may be
    worthwhile to consider a\n   combined solution to avoid a combinatorial explosion
    of optional\n   features.\n\n   Therefore, this document does not yet propose
    a specific change to\n   ESP.  Instead, explains the relevant scenarios, details
    possible\n   modifications of the protocol, collects arguments for (and against)\n
    \  these changes, and discusses their implications.\n\n\t "

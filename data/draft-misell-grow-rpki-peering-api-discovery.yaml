  content: "   The Peering API currently under discussion in the GROW Working Group\n
    \  does not provide a mechanism for discovering the API endpoints that\n   an
    ASN uses to accept peering requests.  This document defines a new\n   RPKI Signed
    Object to publicise this endpoint and allow discovery.\n\nDiscussion\n\n   This
    note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this draft
    and an issue tracker can be found at\n   https://github.molgen.mpg.de/q/rpki-peering-api-discovery.\n\n\t "

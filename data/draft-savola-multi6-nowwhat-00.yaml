  content: "ROUTING ARCHITECT'S WARNING: flagrant IPv4 site multihoming practices\ncause
    a significant increase the routing table size, change rates and\ninstability,
    the tragedy of the commons by encouraging selfish\nrouting practices, the exhaustion
    of the 16-bit AS number space, and\nmay collapse the Internet interdomain routing
    architecture.\nAs there has been a desire to avoid similar problems as seen with\nIPv4,
    the use of similar techniques to achieve site multihoming has\nbeen prevented
    operationally in IPv6.  However, the long effort to\nproceed with other IPv6 multihoming
    mechanisms has produced lots of\nheat but little light.  This memo tries to list
    available techniques,\nsplit the organizations to different types to separately
    examine\ntheir multihoming needs, to look at the immediate and short-term\nsolutions
    for these organization types, and to list a few immediate\naction items on how
    to proceed with IPv6 site multihoming.\n\n\t "

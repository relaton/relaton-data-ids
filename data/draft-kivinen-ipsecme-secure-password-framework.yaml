  content: "This document defines a generic way for Internet Key Exchange version
    2 (IKEv2) to use any of the symmetric secure password authentication methods.
    \ Multiple methods are already specified in other documents, and this document
    does not add any new one.  This document specifies a way to agree on which method
    is to be used in the current connection.  This document also provides a common
    way to transmit, between peers, payloads that are specific to secure password
    authentication methods.\n\t "

  content: "Well-known web servers such as Apache and web proxies like Squid\nsupport
    event logging using a common log format.  The logs produced\nusing these de-facto
    standard formats are invaluable to system\nadministrators for trouble-shooting
    a server and tool writers to\ncraft tools that mine the log files and produce
    reports and trends.\nFurthermore, these log files can also be used to train anomaly\ndetection
    systems and feed events into a security event management\nsystem.  The Session
    Initiation Protocol does not have a common log\nformat, and as a result, each
    server supports a distinct log format\nthat makes it unnecessarily complex to
    produce tools to do trend\nanalysis and security detection.  We propose a common
    log file format\nfor SIP servers that can be used uniformly by proxies, registrars,\nredirect
    servers as well as back-to-back user agents.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft

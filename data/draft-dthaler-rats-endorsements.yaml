- content: "<p>Various formats exist, including standard and vendor-specific formats,
    for messages in the RATS Architecture. Indeed, one of the purposes of a Verifer
    is to accept Evidence in a variety of formats and generate Attestation Results
    in a format needed by a Relying Party. This document discusses considerations
    around formats for Endorsements, and the suitability of EAT and CORIM as Endorsement
    formats.</p>"

  content: "Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect\nthe
    Quality of Service of inelastic flows.  It does this by marking\npackets when
    traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a\nthreshold below the physical
    link rate.  This baseline encoding\nspecified how two encoding states could be
    encoded into the IP\nheader.  This document specified an extension to the baseline\nencoding
    that enables three encoding states to be carried in the IP\nheader as well as
    enabling limited support for end-to-end ECN.\n\nStatus (to be removed by RFC Editor)\n\nThis
    memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually\nbe published
    as an experimental RFC.  The PCN Working Group will be\nasked to adopt this memo
    as a Working Group document describing one\nof several possible experimental PCN
    encoding schemes.  The intention\nis that the title of this document will change
    to avoid confusion\nwith the three state marking scheme.\n\nChanges from previous
    drafts\n\nFrom 00 to 01:\n\no  Checked terminology for consistency with\n\n[I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding]\n\no
    \ Minor editorial changes.\n\t "

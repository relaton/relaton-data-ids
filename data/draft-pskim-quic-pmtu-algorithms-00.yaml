  content: "   This draft consider a couple of algorithms for Path MTU (PMTU) in\n
    \  QUIC to discovery optimal PMTU and resolve PMTU black hole problem.\n   Fistly,
    a passive probing approach is adopted to discover the PMTU.\n   The process of
    discovering the PMTU is not performed separately, but\n   is performed simultaneously
    in the actual application data\n   communication. That is, the actual application
    data is allowed to be\n   carried in the process of discovering the PMTU. A probe
    packet is\n   defined newly using 1-RTT packet which includes actual application\n
    \  data as well as a short packet header and a PING_EXT frame. Until the\n   optimal
    PMTU is discovered, the size of the probe packet is changed\n   according to the
    size of the PMTU candidate. Secondly, a PMTU black\n   hole problem in secure
    and reliable transport protocol is discussed\n   and a possible solution can be
    suggested from existing researches.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes (Stateful HBS) such as LMS, HSS,
    XMSS and XMSS^MT combine Merkle trees with One-Time Signatures (OTS) to provide
    signatures that are resistant against attacks using large-scale quantum computers.
    Unlike conventional stateless digital signature schemes, Stateful HBS have a state
    to keep track of which OTS keys have been used, as double-signing with the same
    OTS key allows forgeries. This document provides guidance and documents security
    considerations for the operational and technical aspects of deploying systems
    that rely on Stateful HBS. Management of the state of the Stateful HBS, including
    any handling of redundant key material, is a sensitive topic, and we discuss some
    approaches to handle the associated challenges. We also describe the challenges
    that need to be resolved before certain approaches should be considered.</p>"

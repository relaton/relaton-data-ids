  content: "   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is an effective method to provide\n
    \  security protection for resolvers and end users in the DNS protocols.\n   But
    the DNSSEC is too aggressive for the DNS service in the poor\n   network infrastructure,
    because the domain name will be invisible\n   when large DNSSEC messages were
    dropped by some other network\n   equipments, like the routers which have MTU
    problem or the old\n   firewalls which do not support ENDS0.  This document defines
    a new\n   concept weak trust anchor which can be used on a security-aware\n   resolver
    to get rid of the above problem.\n\n\t "

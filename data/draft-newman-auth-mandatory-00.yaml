  content: "     This memo defines the ``mandatory-to-implement authentication\n     mechanism''
    problem (at the per-TCP-connection level), describes\n     the requirements necessary
    for a solution, and identifies the\n     mechanisms which meet a significant subset
    of the requirements.  It\n     is hoped this will help the IETF come to an understanding
    of the\n     problem and a rough consensus on a solution.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines extended electronic signature policies (ext-SP)\nthat
    extend the boundaries of the electronic signature policy defined in\n[RFC3125]
    in a manner that the relationships and dependences among\nmultiple electronic
    signatures generated within the scope of the same\nelectronic transaction can
    be established. A given legal/contractual\ncontext may recognize a particular
    ext-SP as meeting its requirements.\n\nAn ext-SP has a globally unique reference,
    which is bound to an\nelectronic signature by the signer as part of the signature
    calculation.\n\nThe ext-SP can be defined in human readable form so that it can
    be\nassessed to meet the requirements of the legal and contractual context\nin
    which it is being applied.\n\nTo allow for the automatic processing, the ext-SP
    specifies, using a\ncomputer processable form, the timing and sequence dependencies
    of the\nset of signatures that must be generated to make the transaction\neffective
    along with the set of attributes and rules that each signature\nmust comply with.
    \ In the current document the format of the ext-SP is\ndefined using ASN.1.\n\nThe
    content of this document is based on the requirements and needs\nestablished in
    ETSI TR 102 045 V1.1.1 (2003-03) Copyright (C).\nIndividual copies of this ETSI
    deliverable can be downloaded from\nhttp://www.etsi.org.\n\nDiscussion\n\n   This
    draft is being discussed on the 'ietf-smime' mailing list. To\n   subscribe, send
    a message to smime-request@ietf.org with the\n   single word subscribe in the

  content: "This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).\nThe
    overall description of protocol and the underlying architectural\nthinking is
    available in the separate HIP architecture specification.\nThe Host Identity Protocol
    is used to establish a rapid\nauthentication between two hosts and to provide
    continuity of\ncommunications between those hosts independent of the networking\nlayer.\nThe
    various forms of the Host Identity (HI), Host Identity Tag (HIT),\nand Local Scope
    Identifier (LSI), are covered in detail.  It is\ndescribed how they are used to
    support authentication and the\nestablishment of keying material, which is then
    used by IPsec\nEncapsulated Security payload (ESP) to establish a two-way secured\ncommunication
    channel between the hosts.  The basic state machine for\nHIP provides a HIP compliant
    host with the resiliency to avoid many\ndenial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  The
    basic HIP exchange for two\npublic hosts shows the actual packet flow.  Other
    HIP exchanges,\nincluding those that work across NATs are covered elsewhere.\n\t "

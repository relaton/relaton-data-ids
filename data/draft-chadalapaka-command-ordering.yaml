  content: "iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol designed to run on top of TCP. The
    \niSCSI session abstraction is equivalent to the SCSI I_T nexus, and \nthe iSCSI
    session provides an ordered command delivery from the SCSI \ninitiator to the
    SCSI target.  This document goes into the design \nconsiderations that led to
    the iSCSI session model as it is defined \ntoday, relates the SCSI command ordering
    features defined in T10 \nspecifications to the iSCSI concepts, and finally provides
    guidance \nto system designers on how true command ordering solutions can be \nbuilt
    based on iSCSI.\n\t "

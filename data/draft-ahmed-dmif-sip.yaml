  content: "This draft proposal discusses technical issues related to delivery\nand
    control of IP multimedia services, such as video-conferencing,\ninvolving heterogeneous
    end terminals. In particular, it describes\nthe design and implementation of an
    experimental system for\ninterworking between IETF SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
    and ISO\nMPEG-4 DMIF (Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework) session and\ncall
    control signaling protocols. This IP videoconferencing\ninterworking system is
    composed of two core units for supporting\ndelivery of audio-video streams from
    a DMIF domain to a SIP domain\n(i.e. DMIF2SIP unit) and from a SIP domain to a
    DMIF domain (i.e.\nSIP2DMIF unit). These units perform various translation functions\nfor
    transparent establishment and control of multimedia sessions\nacross IP networking
    environment, including, session protocol\nconversion, service gateway conversion
    and address translation.\n\t "

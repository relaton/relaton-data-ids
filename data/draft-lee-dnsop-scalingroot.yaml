  content: "       In Domain Name System (DNS), 13 root servers are deployed in order\n
    \      to provide the entrance of domain name resolution and they are\n       denoted
    by 13 letters. From 2000 or so, the anycast technology has\n       been adopted
    to extend the number of root servers with the explosive\n       development of
    Internet. To date, 11 of the 13 letters are hosted at\n       multiple sites,
    and the root zone is served at about 380 sites\n       around the globe. However,
    increasing mirror sites is not a perfect\n       solution to scale the DNS root
    servers because the geographical\n       distribution of the current 13 root servers
    is uneven and only\n       increasing mirror sites cannot solve the efficiency
    and scalability\n       issues caused by that. Then we propose a new DNS root
    system in this\n       draft based on the widely deployed Domain Name System Security\n
    \      Extensions (DNSSEC). The proposed architecture is scalable and\n       secure
    enough to meet the current and future needs to scale the DNS\n       root system
    in an easy-deployment way.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new internetworking\n
    \  architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer packets\n   within
    outer network layer headers using a non-broadcast, multiple\n   access (NBMA)
    virtual interface model.  IRON suggests a third-party\n   global deployment of
    servers and relays to achieve a Provider-\n   Independent (PI) routing and addressing
    framework, but there may be\n   instances in which an Internet Service Provider
    (ISP) wishes to\n   manage its own IRON deployment.  This document presents a
    Provider-\n   Managed IRON framework that offers a fast path alternative for\n
    \  deployment of a long term solution.\n\n\t "

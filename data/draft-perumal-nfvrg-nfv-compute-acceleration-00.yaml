  script: Latn
  content: "   Network functions are being virtualized and moved to industry\n   standard
    servers. Steady growth of traffic volume requires more\n   compute power to process
    the network functions. Network packet based\n   architecture provides a lot of
    scope for parallel processing. Generic\n   parallel processing can be done in
    common multicore platforms like\n   GPUs, coprocessors like Intel Xeon Phi[6][7]
    and Intel[7]/AMD[10]\n   multicore CPUs. In this draft to check the feasibility
    and to exploit\n   this parallel processing capability, multi string matching
    is taken\n   as the sample network function for URL filtering. Aho-Corasick\n
    \  algorithm has been made use for multi pattern matching.\n   Implementation
    utilizes OpenCL [3] to support many common\n   platforms[7][10][11]. A list of
    optimizations is done, the\n   application is tested on Nvidia Tesla K10 GPUs.
    A common API for NFV\n   Compute Acceleration has been proposed.\n\n\n\t "

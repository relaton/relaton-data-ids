  content: "This memo documents a proposed mechanism for a first stage of a\ntransition
    from an unsigned DNS root to a signed root, such that\nthe data in the root zone
    is accompanied by DNSSEC signatures to\nallow validation.\nThe underlying reason
    for signing the root is to be able to provide\na more secure DNS hierarchy, where
    it is possible to distinguish\nfalse answers from correct answers. \nFor the special
    case of the DNS root zone, an interim scheme is\nproposed. This scheme is mostly
    aimed at securing the root zone\nitself for technical and operational reasons,
    and to give\noperational experience of DNSSEC.\n\t "

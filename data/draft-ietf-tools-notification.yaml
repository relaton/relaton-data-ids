  content: "The output of the IETF consists of documents.  The IETF process is\n   largely
    related to changing the status of documents.  Active\n   participation in the
    work of the IETF often consists of writing or\n   editing documents or providing
    input to the process of changing the\n   documents' status.  Passive participation
    often consists of reading\n   documents and observing the changes of their status.
    \ This document\n   describes the requirements for an automated service that helps
    the\n   IETF participants to learn about the existence and follow the changes\n
    \  of status of any particular document.\n\t "

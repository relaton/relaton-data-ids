  content: "Therefore, the X.25 Call Setup and Charging Determination Protocol (XCDP)',
    described in this document, has been developed, to support  global Internet connectivity
    via the system of X.25 Public Data Networks PDN (even via VAN-gateways preventing
    local charges), by providing a pseudo-reverse charging option, which is indicated
    in the Call User Data(CUD) field of the call request. In addition, information
    about the source and destination address of the Internet datagram to be transmitted,
    can also be indicated in the user data field of the call request.\n\t "

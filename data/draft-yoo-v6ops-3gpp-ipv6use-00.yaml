- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "3GPP PS (Packet Switched) domain Standard states the usage of IPv6 as
    \nits network protocol to compensate the shortage of Internet address \nand to
    use the enhanced network protocol functions. In case of the \ncurrent IPv6 usage
    in 3GPP packet domain standards, they have unique \nIPv6 address allocation scheme
    which is somewhat different from the  \none of IETF due to its 3G equipments and
    packet network elements. \nMeanwhile, IETF presents 'recommendations to 3GPP networks
    (RFC3314 \n[2])' to satisfy compatibility between IETF IPv6 and IPv6 of 3GPP \nnetworks
    and to lift up the IPv6 capabilities. In this situation, \nthis document provides
    a new IPv6 address allocation scheme in 3GPP \nnetworks satisfying IETF' recommendations.
    Provided scheme keeps       rules of recommendations of IETF standards and guarantees
    backward \ncompatibility with the legacy 3GPP IPv6 autoconfiguration.\n\t "

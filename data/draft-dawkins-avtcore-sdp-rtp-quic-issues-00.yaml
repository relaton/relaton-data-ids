  content: "   This document is intended to capture SDP aspects of RTP over QUIC\n
    \  design issues that have arisen, been discussed by the AVTCORE working\n   group,
    and have reached a resolution that can be included in \"SDP\n   Offer/Answer for
    RTP using QUIC as Transport\".\n\n   This document is a companion document to
    \"SDP Offer/Answer for RTP\n   using QUIC as Transport\".  That document focuses
    on the description\n   and registration of SDP \"proto\" attribute parameters
    with IANA, to\n   allow applications that rely on SDP Offer/Answer to negotiate
    the\n   QUIC protocol as an encapsulation for RTP.\n\n   \"SDP Offer/Answer for
    RTP using QUIC as Transport\" is itself a\n   companion document to \"RTP over
    QUIC\", and follows the lead of the\n   latter specification as it evolves.\n\n\t "

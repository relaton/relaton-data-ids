- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document presents an architecture for IPv6 access networks that\n
    \  decouples the network-layer concepts of Links, Interface, and Subnets\n   from
    the link-layer concepts of links, ports, and broadcast domains,\n   and limits
    the reliance on link-layer broadcasts.  This architecture\n   is suitable for
    IPv6 over any network, including non-broadcast\n   networks.  A study of the issues
    with ND-Classic over wireless media\n   is presented, and a framework to solve
    those issues within the new\n   architecture is proposed.\n\n\t "

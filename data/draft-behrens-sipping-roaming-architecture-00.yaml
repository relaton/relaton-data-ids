  content: "           This draft describes an authentication mechanism which can
    \n           be used to enable users of VoIP to globally roam between any \n           number
    of ITSPs (Internet Telephony Service Providers) \n           without needing to
    have a prior customer or billing \n           relationship with all of them. This
    enables profiles and one- \n           line-billing. \n           Providers using
    this authentication mechanism do neither \n           need full-mesh \n           trust
    relationships or roaming agreements with every other \n           possible provider
    nor do they need to rely on a centralized \n           brokerage entity to process
    calls. \n           The Home Network (HN), which handles all AAA for a user \n
    \          attempting to use an ITSP's service is determined through a \n           unique
    identifier submitted by the user. This Network Access \n           Identifier
    [RFC2486] contains information about the trust \n           domain or trust realm
    the user belongs to. Based on a simple \n           discovery mechanism a provider
    can establish a trust path to \n           this home network. Once this is \n
    \          established, the provider can authenticate the user and \n           check
    his credit with the home network. Accounting and rate \n           information
    will be sent to the home network for mediation \n           and processing. \n\t "

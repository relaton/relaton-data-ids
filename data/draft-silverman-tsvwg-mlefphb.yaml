  content: "Some networks require certain packet flows to be transported with \n   preferential
    treatment over others of the same type (e.g., voice or \n   video).  This document
    defines a new PHB (Per Hop Behavior), the \n   Multi-Level Expedited Forwarding
    (MLEF) PHB, which is a minor \n   extension to EF defined in RFC 3246.  RFC 3246
    defines the Expedited \n   Forwarding PHB for applications requiring low latency,
    but with a \n   single DSCP and treatment per queue.  Although EF suggests that
    \n   packet discard should be used to achieve this behavior, it does not\n   define
    an algorithm for packet discard.  This document extends that \n   concept and
    defines a PHB with multiple discard treatments for \n   packet flows for applications
    requiring low latency and multiple \n   priority levels.\n\t "

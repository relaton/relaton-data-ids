  content: "   This document is a proposed revision that simplifies the working\n
    \  group's workload-to-workload protocol document.  If accepted by the\n   working
    group, these changes will be back-ported to that document.\n   Otherwise, it was
    a good try.\n\n   The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization
    for\n   software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from the\n   most
    basic ones up to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-\n   tenant deployments.
    \ This document defines the simplest, atomic unit\n   of this architecture: the
    protocol between two workloads that need to\n   verify each other's identity in
    order to communicate securely.  The\n   scope of this protocol is a single HTTP
    request-and-response pair.\n   To address the needs of different setups, we propose
    two protocols,\n   one at the application level and one that makes use of trusted
    TLS\n   transport.  These two protocols are compatible, in the sense that a\n
    \  single call chain can have some calls use one protocol and some use\n   the
    other.  Workload A can call Workload B with mutual TLS\n   authentication, while
    the next call from Workload B to Workload C\n   would be authenticated at the
    application level.\n\n\t "

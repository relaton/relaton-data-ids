  content: "   This document defines a new two-factor authentication mechanism for\n
    \  the Kerberos SPAKE pre-authentication.  The mechanism uses the time-\n   based
    one-time password (TOTP) as a second factor, and combines it\n   with the password
    factor in a more secure way, which can prevent\n   attackers from both impersonating
    Kerberos clients and obtaining\n   TGTs' session keys in case of any factor leakage.\n\n\t "

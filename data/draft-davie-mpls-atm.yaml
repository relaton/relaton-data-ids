  content: "A Multi Protocol Label Switching architecture is described in [1]. Label
    Switching enables the use of ATM Switches as Label Switching Routers. The ATM
    Switches run network layer routing algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.), and
    their data forwarding is based on the results of these routing algorithms. No
    ATM-specific routing or addressing is needed.\n\nThis document describes how the
    label switching architecture is applied to ATM switches.\n\t "

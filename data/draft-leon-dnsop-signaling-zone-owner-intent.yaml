  content: "   This document introduces a standardized mechanism for zone owners to\n
    \  signal their intent regarding DNS provider responsibilities through\n   DNS
    itself.  It defines a new DNS RRtype, HSYNC (Horizontal\n   Synchronization),
    that enables zone owners to designate which\n   providers are authorized to serve
    and/or sign their zones, control\n   whether providers or the zone owner manages
    the NS RRset, and specify\n   zone transfer chain configurations.\n\n   The HSYNC
    record allows DNS providers to discover each other and\n   establish secure communication
    channels, either via DNS messages\n   secured by SIG(0) signatures or via a RESTful
    API secured by TLS.\n   This provider-to-provider communication via Agents enables
    automated\n   coordination for tasks such as NS RRset management, zone transfers,\n
    \  and DNSSEC-related operations.  This specification covers the\n   provider
    discovery and communication establishment aspects.\n\n   The document defines
    two new roles to facilitate this\n   synchronization: the Agent responsible for
    provider-to-provider\n   communication and the Combiner which merges unsigned
    zone data from\n   the zone owner with managed data from providers.\n\n   While
    a distributed DNSSEC multi-signer architecture (similar to\n   \"model 2\" in
    RFC8901) is an important application of this framework,\n   the HSYNC mechanism
    supports broader provider synchronization needs.\n\n   The specific synchronization
    algorithms for multi-signer operation\n   are described in [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-automation].\n
    \  Specification for how to express these algorithms over provider-to-\n   provider
    communication is left for a follow-up document.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/johanix/draft-leon-dnsop-signaling-zone-owner-\n
    \  intent (https://github.com/johanix/draft-leon-dnsop-signaling-zone-\n   owner-intent).
    \ The most recent working version of the document, open\n   issues, etc, should
    all be available there.  The authors (gratefully)\n   accept pull requests.\n\n\t "

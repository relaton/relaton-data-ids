  content: "   This document describes the attributes and classes that will be used\n
    \  in the internet Registry Information Database Exchange formats\n   (RIDE).
    For now it is mostly limited to 'domain' and 'contact'\n   classes since they
    were widely considered as most urgent. Encoding\n   that will be used for the
    objects and ways to find and access objects\n   are beyond the scope of this document.
    This will be addressed in the\n   future in separate drafts.\n\t "

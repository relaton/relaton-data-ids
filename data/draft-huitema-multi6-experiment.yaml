  content: "The current Internet routing architecture does not provide for a\nscalable
    multi-homing solution. Scalability of the interdomain\nrouting architecture is
    already a problem and is expected to become\nan even larger problem if millions
    of home users and small\nbusinesses will start to use multi-homing technology
    in order to\nachieve redundancy and reliability that traditionally can only be\nprovided
    by BGP multi-homing.\nAuthors believe that it is possible to solve the problems
    of end-\nusers and small businesses with a multi-addressing mechanism and\nsource
    address selection mechanism instead of using the routing\nsystem.\nThis draft
    proposes a setup that will allow us to try a multi-\naddressing solution. Instead
    of trying to solve the problems for\nmore complex network setups, it was decided
    to go for a solution\nthat covers most simple setups but that cover the majority
    of home\nand small business networks. Authors believe that we can more easily\nreach
    progress by starting with a simple solution that can later be\nextended to solve
    the issues of a larger class of users.\n   \n\t "

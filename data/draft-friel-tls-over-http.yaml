  content: "   Many clients need to establish secure connections to application\n
    \  services but face challenges establishing these connections due to\n   the
    presence of middleboxes that terminate TLS connections from the\n   client and
    restablish new TLS connections to the service.  This\n   document defines a mechanism
    for transporting TLS records in HTTP\n   message bodies between clients and services.
    \ This enables clients\n   and services to establish secure connections using
    TLS at the\n   application layer, and treat any middleboxes that are intercepting\n
    \  traffic at the network layer as untrusted transport.  In short, this\n   mechanism
    moves the TLS handshake up the OSI stack to the application\n   layer.\n\n\t "

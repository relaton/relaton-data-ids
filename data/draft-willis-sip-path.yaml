  content: "The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associate\na
    temporary contact address with an address-of-record.  This contact\nis generally
    in the form of a URI, such as Contact:\n<sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com> and is generally
    dynamic and associated\nwith the IP address or hostname of the SIP UA.  The problem
    is that\nnetwork topology may have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and\nthe
    registrar, such that any request travelling from the user's home\nnetwork to the
    registered UA must traverse these proxies.  The\nREGISTER method does not give
    us a mechanism to discover and record\nthis sequence of proxies in the registrar
    for future use.  This\ndocument defines an extension header field, 'Path' which
    provides\nsuch a mechanism\n\t "

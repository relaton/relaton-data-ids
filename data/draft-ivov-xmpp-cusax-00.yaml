- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes current practices for combined use of the\n
    \  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the eXtensible Messaging and\n   Presence
    Protocol (XMPP).  Such practices aim to provide a single\n   fully featured real-time
    communication service by using complimenting\n   subsets of features from each
    of the protocols.  Typically such\n   subsets would include telephony oriented
    from SIP and instant\n   messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP.  This
    specification\n   does not define any new protocols or syntax for neither SIP
    nor XMPP.\n   However, implementing it may require modifying or at least\n   reconfiguring
    existing client and server-side software.  Also, it is\n   not the purpose of
    this document to make recommendations as to\n   whether or not such combined us
    should be preferred to the mechanisms\n   provided natively by each protocol like
    for example SIP's SIMPLE or\n   XMPP's Jingle.  It merely aims to provide guidance
    to those who are\n   interested in such a combined use.\n\n\t "

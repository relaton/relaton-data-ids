  content: "The structure that LSP was handled as 1-hop became necessary. It came\nfrom
    the requirement of LSP topology management in the MPLS network.\nAs for VPN services
    using LSP, VPN customers may be confused by\nreceiving ICMP packet, e.g., traceroute
    includes the routers in the\nMPLS backbone un-belonging to the user's VPN topology
    view, from non\nVPN topology.\n\t "

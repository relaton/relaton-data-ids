- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive\n
    \  resolver to use either opportunistic encryption (that is, encryption\n   with
    optional authentication) or fully-authenticated encryption when\n   communicating
    with authoritative servers.  The motivating use case\n   for this method is that
    more encryption on the Internet is better,\n   some resolver operators will only
    want to offer fully-authenticated\n   encryption when encryption is available,
    and some resolver operators\n   believe that opportunistic encryption is better
    than no encryption at\n   all.  The method described here is optional for both
    the recursive\n   resolver and the authoritative server.  This method supports
    both\n   fully-authenticate encryption and opportunistic encryption using the\n
    \  same mechanism for discovery of encryption support and discovery of\n   authenticated
    public keys for the server.\n\n   IMPORTANT NOTE: This version of the document
    is completely different\n   than the earlier version.  It now covers both opportunistic
    and\n   fully-authenticated encryption.  It is in a very rough state, and\n   there
    are many holes in the description.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the use of loop-free alternates to provide local
    protection for unicast traffic in pure IP and MPLS/LDP networks in the event of
    a single failure, whether link, node, or shared risk link group (SRLG).  The goal
    of this technology is to reduce the packet loss that happens while routers converge
    after a topology change due to a failure.  Rapid failure repair is achieved through
    use of precalculated backup next-hops that are loop-free and safe to use until
    the distributed network convergence process completes.  This simple approach does
    not require any support from other routers.  The extent to which this goal can
    be met by this specification is dependent on the topology of the network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

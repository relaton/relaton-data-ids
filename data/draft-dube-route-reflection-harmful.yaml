  content: "   Route reflection as defined by [2] is a popular way of reducing the\n
    \  full-mesh IBGP peering required by routers running the Border Gateway\n   Protocol
    [1]. There are cases where a topology built using route\n   reflectors produces
    persistent loops or does not produce the same\n   results as what one would expect
    with a full IBGP mesh. This document\n   describes these problems.\n\n\t "

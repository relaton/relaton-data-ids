  content: "   In this document, we use SF classification of 1)indispensible SF for\n
    \  packet delivery, allegedly mandatory SFs, such as NAT and 2)optional\n   SFs
    that a packet can be delivered without them, such as Firewall and\n   IDS.\n\n
    \  The nodes of SFC-enabled domain can be various.  Different vendors\n   make
    different types of equipments, and this causes performance\n   issues.  Considering
    this diversity, the kind of SFs can be in myriad\n   form.  Thus, we should distinguish
    some mandatory SFs from not\n   mandatory SFs and treat distinctively.  Mandatory
    SFs should be\n   matched with higher-performance SFF to achieve high availability
    as\n   well as lower the probability of failure.  Above all, whether each SF\n
    \  is mandatory or optional should be registered in advance.  Mandatory\n   SFs
    are to allocated to relatively higher-performance, larger\n   capacity, more stable
    SFFs.  SFC constructed using this way of\n   allocation becomes the path for packets
    and packets are transferred\n   to classifier through C1 interface, and to SFF
    through C2 interface,\n   respectively.\n\n\t "

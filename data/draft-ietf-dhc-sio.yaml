  content: "This option is provided by DHCP servers to DHCP clients to identify the
    origin of a DHCPOFFER -- on a basis other than a server's IP address -- so that
    a DHCP client may optionally select from among multiple offers based on a client's
    preference to a particular DHCP server(s).  The information contained in this
    option is a hex value indicating the assigned identification of the server originating
    the DHCPOFFER in which this option is contained.\n\t "

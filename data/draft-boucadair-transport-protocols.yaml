  content: "   The world of Internet transport protocols is changing, after decades\n
    \  of TCP and UDP operation.  Several proposals have been submitted for\n   the
    past years (and counting) to introduce other transport protocols\n   that aim
    at reducing the web latency of that of TCP or avoiding the\n   burden of the various
    middle-boxes (NATs, firewalls, for one)\n   encountered along the communication
    path.  Such initiatives, although\n   not new, are motivated by the complexity
    of some (non-transparent)\n   networking functions.\n\n   This document advocates
    for the definition of transport profiles and\n   the need to document recommendations
    for middleboxes, including\n   Performance Enhancement Proxies (PEPs) behaviors.
    \ A collaboration\n   among the involved players (service providers, vendors)
    is required\n   to soften the current complications encountered in the Internet
    at\n   large.\n\n\t "

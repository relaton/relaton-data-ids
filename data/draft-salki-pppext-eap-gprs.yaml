  content: "This document specifies an extension to the Extensible Authentication
    \nProtocol (EAP) [2], referred to as EAP-GPRS, which allows GPRS \nclients to
    perform signaling procedures with a core GPRS network \nthrough devices that enforce
    EAP-based access control. For example, a \nGPRS client can use EAP-GPRS to attach
    to a GPRS network through an \naccess point that enforces IEEE 802.1X [3] access
    control. In this \ncase, the GPRS attach signaling is performed in the context
    of the \nunderlying 802.1X procedure and the GPRS messages are encapsulated \ninto
    EAP-GPRS packets. If the GPRS client is permitted to attach to \nthe GPRS network,
    then the 802.1X procedure ends successfully and the \nclient is authorized access
    to the access point. In general, EAP-GPRS \nallows any type of signaling to take
    place during the EAP \nauthentication as an embedded signaling procedure. However,
    in this \ndocuments we particularly focus on GPRS specific signaling.\n\t "

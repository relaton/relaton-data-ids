  content: "\n   The BGP Version 4 routing protocol (RFC4271) is now used in many\n
    \  ways, crossing boundaries of administrative and technical\n   responsibility.\n\n
    \  The protocol lacks an operational messaging plane which could be\n   utilised
    to diagnose, troubleshoot and inform upon various conditions\n   across these
    boundaries, securely, during protocol operation, without\n   disruption.\n\n   This
    document proposes a new BGP message type, the OPERATIONAL\n   message, which can
    be used to effect such a messaging plane for use\n   both between and within Autonomous
    Systems.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data\n
    \  format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n   code
    size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need for version
    negotiation.\n\n   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR
    tags.\n   RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 date/time\n
    \  string) and tag 1 (Posix \"seconds since the epoch\").  Since then,\n   additional
    requirements have become known.  This specification\n   defines a CBOR tag for
    an RFC 3339 date text string, for applications\n   needing a textual date representation
    without a time.  It also\n   defines a CBOR tag for days since the Posix epoch,
    for applicaitons\n   needing a numeric date representation without a time.  It
    is intended\n   as the reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR
    tags\n   defined.\n\n\t "

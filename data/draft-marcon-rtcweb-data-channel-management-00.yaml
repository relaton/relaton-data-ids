  content: "   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n   communication
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.  For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular defined
    the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP.  How to transport application
    messages on these\n   data channels seems straightforward (i.e. they can be carried
    as SCTP\n   user messages), however it is yet to be decided how to establish and\n
    \  manage these data channels.  This document specifies a method for\n   this,
    which relies first on a lightweight and scalable out-of-band\n   negotiation of
    data channel configurations (within the SDP offer/\n   answer exchange) and second
    on the signaling of the configuration in\n   use in the SCTP user message itself.
    \ Once these configurations are\n   negotiated, further creations of data channels
    can occur purely in-\n   band by simply sending user messages, which avoids to
    define a new\n   in-band data channel protocol.\n\n\t "

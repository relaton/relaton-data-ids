  content: "To allow interoperability between the existing telephone network and\nInternet
    Telephony (IT) it is necessary for the signaling performance to\nbe comparable
    to that of the current standards to avoid introducing\ndegradation in the service.
    In this Internet Draft, we highlight the\nproblem of providing high-quality signaling
    across an IP network that is\nbuilt on a SONET infrastructure.  We show that there
    are cases where the\ncurrent PSTN standards are not satisfiable by a naive mapping
    of the IT\nsignaling directly to the UDP or TCP transport protocols, even neglect-\ning
    packet loss in router queues.\n\n\t "

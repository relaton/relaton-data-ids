  content: "   PAWS provides protection against old duplicated segments caused by\n
    \  wrapped sequence or earlier incarnated connections.  One drawback of\n   PAWS
    is that it requires to place timestamp option in all segments,\n   which consumes
    10-12 bytes in the option space of TCP.  In addition,\n   since PAWS just checks
    if timestamps is older or not, the protection\n   logic is not very strong against
    malicious attacks or cannot work\n   properly in some situations.  On the other
    hand, some other\n   technologies which can provide stronger protections than
    PAWS are\n   becoming available these days.  In this document, we propose to\n
    \  utilize other protection mechanisms as replacements of PAWS when they\n   are
    available.\n\n\t "

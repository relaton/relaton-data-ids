abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies BGP Failure Propagation (BGP-FP), an infrastructure
    and protocol that improves inter-domain routing convergence by accelerating the
    removal of stale (invalid) routes. BGP-FP uses (1) an Agent deployed per Autonomous
    System (AS) to detect eBGP link/policy/prefix failures and to configure local
    routers, (2) a logically centralized (potentially distributed) Repository to store
    and selectively forward failure information, and (3) BGP Large Communities as
    a "route freshness" marker. Agents validate and apply Repository updates to filter
    routes that traverse failed eBGP links or otherwise violate the originating AS’s
    forwarding intent, reducing route flap propagation in the control plane.</p>

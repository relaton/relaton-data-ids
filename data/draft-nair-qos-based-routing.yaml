  content: "There are many reasons to consider QoS-based routing as a component of
    the integrated services Internet. But several questions arise with regard to its
    development: what are the requirements on QoS-based routing in the Internet? What
    sort of a routing architecture is practical? What are the technical and policy
    issues that arise in realizing a QoS-based Internet routing architecture? This
    draft is an attempt to generate some discussion on these topics. To this end we
    present some potential requirements on path computation, efficiency, robustness
    and scalability, and describe some issues in realizing a QoS-based routing architecture.
    Our conclusions are that QoS-based routing is a challenging problem, and that
    it each of its major components, path computation, scalability and administrative
    control present their own set of issues that must be addressed in developing the
    routing architecture.\n\t "

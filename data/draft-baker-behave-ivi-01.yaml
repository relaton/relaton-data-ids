- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This note proposes an address and service architecture designed to\nfacilitate
    transition from an IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 Internet.\nThis service contains three
    parts: A DNS Application Layer Gateway, a\nstateful Network Address Translator
    that enables IPv6 clients to\ninitiate connections to IPv4 servers and peers,
    and a stateless\nNetwork Address Translator that enables IPv4 and IPv6 systems
    to\ninteroperate freely.\n\nIt is couched as an update to RFCs 2765 and 2766.
    \ This is because\nthe stateless service is essentially the SIIT with a different\naddress
    format, and because the DNS Application Layer Gateway and the\nstateful translator
    have significant similarities to NAT-PT.  There\nare, however, important differences
    from NAT-PT, responsive to the\nissues raised in RFC 4966.\n\t "

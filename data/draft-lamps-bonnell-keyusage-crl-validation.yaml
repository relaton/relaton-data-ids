abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 5280 defines the profile of X.509 certificates and certificate\n
    \  revocation lists (CRLs) for use in the Internet.  This profile\n   requires
    that certificates which certify keys for signing CRLs\n   contain the key usage
    extension with the cRLSign bit asserted.\n   Additionally, RFC 5280 defines steps
    for the validation of CRLs.\n   While there is a requirement for CRL validators
    to verify that the\n   cRLSign bit is asserted in the keyUsage extension of the
    CRL issuer's\n   certificate, this document clarifies the requirement for relying\n
    \  parties to also verify the presence of the keyUsage extension in the\n   CRL
    issuer's certificate.  This check remediates a potential security\n   issue that
    arises when relying parties accept a CRL which is signed\n   by a certificate
    with no keyUsage extension, and therefore does not\n   explicitly have the cRLSign
    bit asserted.\n\n\t "

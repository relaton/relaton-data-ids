  content: "This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) mechanism
    for authentication and session key distribution using the Global System for Mobile
    Communications (GSM) Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).  GSM is a second generation
    mobile network standard.  The EAP-SIM mechanism specifies enhancements to GSM
    authentication and key agreement whereby multiple authentication triplets can
    be combined to create authentication responses and session keys of greater strength
    than the individual GSM triplets.  The mechanism also includes network authentication,
    user anonymity support, result indications, and a fast re-authentication procedure.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   New research in the design of peer-to-peer overlay networks offers
    \n   the possibility of addressing limitations of existing service, \n   resource
    and content discovery methods.  We identify the research \n   goals to be pursued
    in investigating new designs for global scale \n   service discovery. The purpose
    of this document is to attract \n   participation from other researchers interested
    in these problems and \n   to lead to a coordinated research approach within the
    P2PRG CORE \n   subgroup. \n\t "

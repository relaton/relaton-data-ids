  content: "   The MULTIMOB group has specified a base solution to support IP\n   multicasting
    in a PMIPv6 domain [RFC6224]. In this document, some\n   enhancements are proposed
    to the base solution. These enhancements\n   include the use of a multicast tree
    mobility anchor as the\n   topological anchor point for multicast traffic, as
    well as a direct\n   routing option where the MAG can provide access to multicast
    content\n   in the local network. These enhancements provide benefits such as\n
    \  reducing multicast traffic replication and supporting different\n   PMIPv6
    deployments scenarios.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of an\n
    \  interface named Application Intelligent Policy Interface (AIPI) that\n   translates
    the real application requirements (e.g., network should\n   ensure how many users
    of the OTT provider watch high definition video\n   simultaneously.) into network
    level requirements, e.g.,\n   configurations or service deployments requirements
    and network QoS\n   requirements, are useful and necessary for modern networks.\n\n\t "

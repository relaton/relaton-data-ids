  content: "   This document describes the extensions to the OSPF protocol to\n   distribute
    the traffic flow specification rules and associated\n   actions.  The notion and
    principles of operation of the mechanism\n   were initially introduced into the
    BGP protocol.  The IPv4 part of\n   specification was published in RFC5575 and
    later the specification\n   was enhanced for IPv6 via draft-raszuk-idr-flow-spec-v6.
    \ The\n   mechanism allows the routing protocol to distribute information about\n
    \  the traffic flows and associated actions such as packet filtering\n   with
    it.\n\n\n\t "

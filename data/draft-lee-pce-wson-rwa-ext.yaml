  content: "   This draft provides the Path Computation Element communication\n   Protocol
    (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength\n   Assignment (RWA)
    in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).\n   Lightpath provisioning in
    WSONs requires a routing and wavelength\n   assignment (RWA) process.  From a
    path computation perspective,\n   wavelength assignment is the process of determining
    which wavelength\n   can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional
    routing\n   constraint to optical light path computation.\n\n\t "

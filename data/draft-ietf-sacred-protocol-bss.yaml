- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a protocol whereby a user can acquire cryptographic
    credentials (e.g., private keys, PKCS #15 structures) from a credential server,
    using a workstation that has locally trusted software installed, but with no user-specific
    configuration.  The protocol's payloads are described in XML.  This memo also
    specifies a Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) profile of the protocol.
    \ Security requirements are met by mandating support for TLS and/or DIGEST-MD5
    (through BEEP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

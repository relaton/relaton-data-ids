  content: "   The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) propositions for email are based upon\n
    \  already existing email and encryption formats (i.e., PGP/MIME) and\n   designed
    to allow for easy implementable and interoperable\n   opportunistic encryption:
    this ranging from key distribution to\n   mechanisms of subject encryption.\n\n
    \  The goal of pEp for email is to automatize operations in order to\n   make
    email encryption usable by a wider range of Internet users, to\n   achieve wide
    application of confidentiality and privacy practices in\n   the real world.\n\n
    \  This document defines basic operations of pEp's approach towards\n   email
    and two PGP/MIME formats (pEp Email Format 1 and 2) to provide\n   certain security
    guarantees.\n\n   The proposed operations and formats are targeted to Opportunistic\n
    \  Security scenarios and are already implemented in several\n   applications
    of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t "

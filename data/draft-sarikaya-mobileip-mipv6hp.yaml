  content: "This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging\n(HMIPv6HP),
    an IP host alerting protocol which is a link-layer\nindependent extension to Hierarchical
    Mobile IPv6. The extension\nallows a mobile node to enter a power saving dormant
    mode during\nwhich its location is known with coarse accuracy defined by a paging\narea.
    In the visited domain only the paging mobility anchor point\n(PMAP) is responsible
    for keeping the binding cache entries for\ndormant mobile nodes and, it re-establishes
    the downlink routes on\ndemand by means of paging. Paging is initiated by the
    paging agent\n(PA) and the access routers in paging areas and does not involve\nperiodic
    layer 3 messages to be sent except for time-slot based\npaging which is optional
    and is to be used on links with no support\nfor layer 2 paging.\n\t "

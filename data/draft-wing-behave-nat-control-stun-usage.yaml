  content: "A drawback with many NAT UDP hole punching techniques is the\nkeepalive
    traffic necessary to keep the UDP binding open.  It it\nnecessary to send keepalives
    frequently because it is not possible to\ndetermine or modify the NAT's binding
    lifetime.  This keepalive\ntraffic causes server load and additional network traffic,
    which is\nespecially problematic with battery-operated wireless devices.\nThis
    document describes two mechanisms to discover NATs and firewalls\nand a mechanism
    to query and control their binding lifetime.  With\nthese mechanisms, UDP binding
    discovery and UDP keepalive traffic can\nbe reduced to involve only the necessary
    NATs or firewalls.  This\neliminates the keepalive traffic to servers, and vastly
    reduces\nkeepalive traffic across the network.  At the same time, backwards\ncompatibility
    with NATs and firewalls that do not support this\nspecification is retained, which
    allows for incremental deployment of\nthis mechanism.\n\nThis document is discussed
    on the SAFE mailing list,\n<http://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/safe>.\n\t "

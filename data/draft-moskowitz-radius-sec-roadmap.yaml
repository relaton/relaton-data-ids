  content: "   RADIUS has become the defacto protocol between network edge devices\n
    \  (e,g, dial NAS or Wireless AP) and a backend Authentication Server.\n   In
    this environment the backend Server is often called a (RADIUS\n   Server).  RADIUS
    is gaining very broad penetration, even into homes,\n   because of its use with
    wireless authentication.  Because of the\n   amount of deployed infrastructure
    already in place, we believe that\n   RADIUS will not be supplanted by another
    authentication service in\n   the foreseeable future.  Because the widespread
    deployment in\n   wireless has different infrastructure requirements than what
    is\n   required for dialup, RADIUS requirements, especially trust between\n   Edge
    devices and RADIUS Servers needs to be addressed.  This document\n   sets the
    requirements for RADIUS security and then sets forth\n   technologies that will
    satisfy those requirements.\n\t "

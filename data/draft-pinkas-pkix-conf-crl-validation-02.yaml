  content: "   The text currently present in section 6.3 from RFC 3280 is dedicated\n
    \  to CRL validation. This text needs to be more detailed to explain \n   exactly
    how it can made be sure that a CRL is issued by the right \n   entity.  In addition,
    a text dedicated to the characteristics that\n   conforming applications MUST
    support needs to be provided: the \n   current text covers the most complex case
    and is too complicated to \n   be easily simplified.  Text is proposed to be included
    in 3280bis \n   and to partially replace section 6.3 .\n\t "

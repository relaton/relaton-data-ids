  content: "Users have various human (i.e., natural) language needs, abilities, and
    preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. This document defines
    new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media- level attributes so that when establishing
    interactive communication sessions (\"calls\"), it is possible to negotiate (i.e.,
    communicate and match) the caller's language and media needs with the capabilities
    of the called party. This is especially important for emergency calls, because
    it allows for a call to be handled by a call taker capable of communicating with
    the user or for a translator or relay operator to be bridged into the call during
    setup. However, this also applies to non-emergency calls (for example, calls to
    a company call center).\n\n This document describes the need as well as a solution
    that uses new SDP media attributes.\n\t "

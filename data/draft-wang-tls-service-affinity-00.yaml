  content: "   This draft proposes a service affinity solution between client and\n
    \  server based on Transport Layer Security (TLS).  An extension to\n   Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 to enable session migration.  This\n   mechanism is designed
    for modern network architectures, particularly\n   for multi-homed servers that
    possess multiple network interfaces and\n   IP addresses.\n\n   Comparing to the
    existing solutions such as maintaining the customer-\n   based connection status
    table in network devices, HTTP redirection\n   and DNS redirection, this solution
    can avoid the waste of resources\n   caused by saving a large amount of customer
    status data in the\n   network devices, and realize the optimized scheduling of
    resources\n   based on network conditions and computing resources in the computing-\n
    \  aware traffic steering scenario, so as to realize the reasonable\n   operation
    of network resources, cloud resources and computing\n   resources.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In the Publish-Subscribe model, subscribers express their interest
    in\n   an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently notified of\n   any
    event generated by a publisher that matches their registered\n   interest.  The
    model is well suited for communication in large-scale\n   and loosely coupled
    distributed systems.  This document describes how\n   the model fits into Interface
    to the Routing System (I2RS) and\n   Software Defined Networking (SDN) architectures,
    and analyzes its\n   advantages, its security requirements, and its use in providing\n
    \  security within I2RS.\n\n\t "

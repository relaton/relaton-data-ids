  content: "   The Delegated CoAP Authorization Framework (DCAF) defines how\n   constrained
    devices can securely obtain security associations and\n   authorization information
    from their respective less constrained\n   devices, the Authorization Managers.
    \ In DCAF a constrained client\n   requests an authorization ticket from the Server
    Authorization\n   Manager (SAM) by contacting its own Client Authorization Manager\n
    \  (CAM).  However, there may be cases where this approach is not\n   applicable,
    e.g., because the client is not able to reach\n   Authorization Managers in the
    Internet.\n\n   Specifically for these situations, this document defines the Server-\n
    \  Initiated Ticket Request (SITR) that specifies how a constrained\n   server
    can request authorization tokens and securely obtain security\n   associations
    and authorization information for mutual authenticated\n   authorization with
    the client.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a new generation of PIM family of multicast\n
    \  routing protocols called Protocol Independent Multicast-Next\n   Generation
    (PIM-NG) which is faster in source discover and provides\n   many features suitable
    for Different type of networks. PIM-NG uses\n   the underlying unicast routing
    information, but unlike PIM-SM it\n   doesn't necessarily need to build unidirectional
    shared trees rooted\n   at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group. It achieves this
    due to the\n   fact that the processes through which a source registers with the\n
    \  Rendezvous Point and a host finds the source of the multicast\n   destination
    groups it needs are done in a whole new way and hence,\n   the source of multicast
    group (G) is discovered faster at the cost of\n   additional memory. So at some
    points PIM-NG works faster than its\n   predecessor. Also the new Domain concept,
    unique to PIM-NG, along the\n   RPF check method used in PIM-NG specifications
    provides many features\n   along a robust and flexible control and administration
    over multicast\n   networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes a terminology for defining network mobility\nproblems
    and solution requirements. Network mobility occurs when an\nentire network changes
    its point of attachment to the Internet and\nthus its reachability in the topology,
    which is referred to as a\nmobile network\n\t "

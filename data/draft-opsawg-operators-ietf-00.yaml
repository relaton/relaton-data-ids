  content: "   Internet Society has launched a new project to address the perceived\n
    \  gap between Operators and the IETF.  The objective of this project is\n   ultimately
    to facilitate communications between the operator\n   community and the IETF to
    help ensure that operational realities\n   inform the development of key standards.
    \ The first phase of this\n   project was a survey of the operator community that
    was conducted\n   over the first half of 2014.  This I-D aims to synthesize the
    initial\n   survey results, along with information we collected directly from\n
    \  operators during the survey window.  The primary purpose of doing\n   this
    is to start a conversation which we hope will lead to increases\n   in the level
    of operational input and feedback to the IETF standards\n   making process.\n\n\n\t "

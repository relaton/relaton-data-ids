  content: "   Different hypervisors are used in SDN network in cloud datacenters,\n
    \  such as KVM, VMware ESXi and Xen. However, different hypervisors are\n   not
    well supported by SDN network to some degrees.  In order to solve\n   the problems
    with hypervisor VMware ESXi and Xen, decoupling schemes\n   for hypervisor from
    SDN architecture are presented.  Through\n   different decoupling schemes, we
    want to find a better way in order\n   to get the overall view by the SDN network.\n\n\t "

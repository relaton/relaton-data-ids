  content: "When watching the same IPTV channel, different TV sets may not render\nthe
    same picture and the associated audio at the same moment.  The\nvariation in end-to-end
    delay that resulted in such asynchronous\nplayback between users is referred to
    as inter-user playback delay.\nUnicast based rapid acquisition of multicast RTP
    sessions (RAMS) as\nspecified in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] is an
    important\ntechnique in achieving fast channel switching in IPTV as well as\nother
    multicast applications.  In addition, RAMS also significantly\nrelaxes the requirement
    of relatively short random access point\nperiod in encoding of video streams in
    multicast applications, thus\nallowing significantly improved compression efficiency.
    \ However, on\nthe other hand, the use of RAMS increases inter-user playback delay,\nwhich
    makes users receiving the same multicast session playback the\nsame content asynchronously.
    \ This document specifies a mechanism to\nhelp reduce inter-user playback delay
    caused by the use of RAMS.\n\t "

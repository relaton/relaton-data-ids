  content: "   Route aggregation is critical to the long-term viability of the\n   Internet.
    \ This document presents practical information that network\n   managers can use
    to both understand the concepts of aggregation as\n   well as put those concepts
    into use in order to do their part to make\n   the Internet stable and allow its
    continued growth.  The intended\n   audience for this document is anyone responsible
    for configuring a\n   network which has its own Autonomous System Number (ASN)
    and\n   exchanges routing information with its Internet Service Provider(s)\n
    \  (ISP(s)) using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  This document does\n   not
    cover multi-homing, though multi-homed sites can still benefit\n   from understanding
    this material.\n\n\t "

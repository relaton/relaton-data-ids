  content: "   The developers of \"user level\" transports will benefit from a\n   standard
    implementation of authentication and encryption.  This can\n   be achieved using
    DTLS as a sub-transport.  Using DTLS enables\n   developers to benefit from the
    investment in TLS, and removes the\n   burden and the risks of re-creating similar
    technology.\n\n   There are several requirements to ensure that DTLS is a suitable
    sub-\n   transport: zero RTT setup, low overhead, and DOS prevention.  The IAB\n
    \  SEMI workshop outlined other potential requirements: start/stop\n   indication,
    and ability to accept indications from the network.  The\n   draft presents guidelines
    for meeting these requirements in a new\n   version of DTLS.\n\n\t "

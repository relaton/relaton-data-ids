abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for UUIDs
    (Universally Unique IDentifiers), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifiers).
    A UUID is 128 bits long, and is intended to guarantee uniqueness across space
    and time. UUIDs were originally used in the Apollo Network Computing System and
    later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment
    (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows platforms. This specification is derived
    from the DCE specification with the kind permission of the OSF (now known as The
    Open Group). Information from earlier versions of the DCE specification have been
    incorporated into this document. This document obsoletes RFC4122.</p>"

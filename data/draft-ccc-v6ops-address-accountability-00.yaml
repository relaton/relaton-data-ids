  script: Latn
  content: "   Hosts in IPv4 networks typically acquire addresses by use of DHCP,\n
    \  and retain that address and only that address while the DHCP lease\n   remains
    valid.  In IPv6 networks, hosts may use DHCPv6, but may\n   instead autoconfigure
    their own global address(es), and potentially\n   use many privacy addresses over
    time.  This behaviour places an\n   additional burden on network operators who
    require address\n   accountability for their users and devices.  There has been
    some\n   discussion of this issue on various mail lists; this text attempts to\n
    \  capture the issues to encourage further discussion.\n\n\t "

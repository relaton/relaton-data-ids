abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes and extension of the port range assignment
    mechanisms used for the IPv4 address sharing framework (SHARA) that is based on
    port range routing. The extension provides means for dynamically changes port
    range assignments by allowing clients to smoothly migrate to a new port range
    before releasing the range that is currently in use. This way, the number of ports
    per client can be adjusted to actual usage patterns.</p>"

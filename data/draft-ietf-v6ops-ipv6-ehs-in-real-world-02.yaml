  script: Latn
  content: "This document presents real-world data regarding the extent to which packets
    with IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) are dropped in the Internet (as originally measured
    in August 2014 and later in June 2015, with similar results) and where in the
    network such dropping occurs.  The aforementioned results serve as a problem statement
    that is expected to trigger operational advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets
    carrying IPv6 EHs so that the situation improves over time.  This document also
    explains how the results were obtained, such that the corresponding measurements
    can be reproduced by other members of the community and repeated over time to
    observe changes in the handling of packets with IPv6 EHs.\n\t "

  content: "   This document illustrates that significance difference or discarding\n
    \  priority might exist among RTP packets which encapsulate video\n   streaming
    data with the existing modern video codecs, i.e., H.264/\n   AVC, SVC, H.265/HEVC
    and H.266/VVC.\n\n   The document overviews the RTP NALU header format for the
    existing\n   modern video codecs.  Each contains at least one field that indicates\n
    \  the RTP packet's relative significance within the video stream.  With\n   the
    dominance of video traffic in the Internet, selectively dropping\n   RTP packets
    from competing video streams according to their\n   significances or discarding
    priorities could be a complementary\n   mechanism when dealing with network congestion.
    \ The document\n   proposes the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value
    mapping\n   to the RTP packet discarding priority carried in the RTP NALU header.\n
    \  The document also proposes a new Hop-by-Hop Extension Header (HbH-EH)\n   with
    a value that is copied from the discarding priority of the RTP\n   packet, if
    the 6-bit DSCP value is not long enough for the mapping.\n\n\t "

  content: "   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), as defined in RFC 9396,\n
    \  provides a mechanism for clients to request fine-grained, structured\n   authorization
    details.  However, in emerging ecosystems of\n   collaborating AI agents and long-running
    automated tasks, two\n   critical authorization dimensions remain implicit: the
    required\n   security assurance level of the authorization policy and the strict\n
    \  binding of authorization lifetime to a task's lifecycle.\n\n   This document
    extends the \"authorization_details\" object of RAR by\n   introducing two new
    members: \"policy_context\" and\n   \"lifecycle_binding\".  The \"policy_context\"
    member allows a client to\n   explicitly request that the authorization be evaluated
    and granted\n   under a specific policy assurance level, mitigating policy downgrade\n
    \  attacks and enhancing user consent.  The \"lifecycle_binding\" member\n   enables
    the validity of an authorization grant to be tied directly to\n   the state of
    an external entity, such as an automated task, ensuring\n   permissions are automatically
    and immediately revoked upon task\n   completion.  These extensions provide a
    standardized way to achieve\n   more secure, transparent, and context-aware authorization
    in complex,\n   automated environments.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "This memo proposes a compression method for the TLS protocol based on
    the LZS compression algorithm.  The method can be used to compress the contents
    of a TLS record.  The compression method proposed here is stateless, meaning that
    a record can be decompressed independently of any other record.  Compression is
    performed prior to the encryption operation, which has the side benefit of reducing
    the amount of data that must be encrypted.                                                                 This
    memo anticipates a forthcoming draft of ESP that will supercede [Atkins96].  The
    forthcoming draft will allow for ESP payloads to be compressed via transforms
    such as the one described in this memo.\n\t "

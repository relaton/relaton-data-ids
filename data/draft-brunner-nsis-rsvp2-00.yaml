  content: "This memo is a first step towards the design of RSVP Version 2. We \ntake
    RSVP Version 1 as a basis of this work. RSVP has been criticized \nmainly because
    of its complexity and poor scalability among others. \nWe present the first steps
    towards the definition of a new version of \nRSVP. The goal is to provide a more
    'light' approach that can help \nimprove handling reservations in the network
    by means of a simplified \nbehavior. \nThis proposal for RSVP Version 2 is not
    meant as a complete \nreplacement of RSVP Version 1 but is meant to coexist with
    Version 1. \nFor some scenarios such as receiver orientation and multicasting
    we \nassume that RSVP version 1 works fine. \n\t "

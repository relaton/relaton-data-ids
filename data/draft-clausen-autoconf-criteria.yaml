  content: "   This document gives a general set of objective criteria to evaluate\n
    \  an autoconfiguration mechanism in a MANET environment.  All criteria\n   are
    important to outline an evaluation of an autoconfiguration\n   mechanism.  These
    criteria have been grouped into three classes:\n   functional criteria, performance
    criteria and usability criteria.\n   For each of the criteria, a description is
    outlined, hints are given\n   on how to perform an adequate measure of the criterium,
    and an\n   evaluation features the importance of the criterium in the full\n   evaluation
    of a mechanism.\n\t "

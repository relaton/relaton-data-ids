  content: "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is one of the most\n
    \  promising candidate technologies for the future data transmission\n   network.
    \ The GMPLS has been developed to control and cooperate\n   different kinds of
    network elements, such as conventional routers,\n   switches, Dense Wavelength
    Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems, Add-\n   Drop Multiplexors (ADMs), photonic
    cross-connects (PXCs), optical\n   cross-connects (OXCs), etc.  Dynamic provisioning
    ability of these\n   physically diverse devices differs from each other drastically.
    \ At\n   the same time, the need for dynamically provisioned connections is\n
    \  increasing because optical networks are being deployed in metro area.\n   As
    different applications have varied requirements in the\n   provisioning performance
    of optical networks, it is imperative to\n   define standardized metrics and procedures
    such that the performance\n   of networks and application needs can be mapped
    to each other.\n\n   This document provides a series of performance metrics to
    evaluate\n   the dynamic LSP provisioning performance in GMPLS networks,\n   specifically
    the dynamical LSP setup/release performance.  These\n   metrics can depict the
    features of the GMPLS network in LSP dynamic\n   provisioning.  They can also
    be used in operational networks for\n   carriers to monitor the control plane
    performance in realtime.\n\t "

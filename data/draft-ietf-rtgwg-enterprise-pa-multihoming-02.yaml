  content: "   Connecting an enterprise site to multiple ISPs using provider-\n   assigned
    addresses is difficult without the use of some form of\n   Network Address Translation
    (NAT).  Much has been written on this\n   topic over the last 10 to 15 years,
    but it still remains a problem\n   without a clearly defined or widely implemented
    solution.  Any\n   multihoming solution without NAT requires hosts at the site
    to have\n   addresses from each ISP and to select the egress ISP by selecting
    a\n   source address for outgoing packets.  It also requires routers at the\n
    \  site to take into account those source addresses when forwarding\n   packets
    out towards the ISPs.\n\n   This document attempts to define a complete solution
    to this problem.\n   It covers the behavior of routers to forward traffic taking
    into\n   account source address, and it covers the behavior of host to select\n
    \  appropriate source addresses.  It also covers any possible role that\n   routers
    might play in providing information to hosts to help them\n   select appropriate
    source addresses.  In the process of exploring\n   potential solutions, this documents
    also makes explicit requirements\n   for how the solution would be expected to
    behave from the perspective\n   of an enterprise site network administrator .\n\n\t "

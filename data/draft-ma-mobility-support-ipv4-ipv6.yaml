  content: "This document specifies a protocol named Mobile IPv4/v6, which allows
    \n   mobile nodes to remain reachable while moving in IPv4/v6 mixed \n   networks.
    A translation gateway called Mobile IPv4/v6 Translation \n   Gateway (MIPv4/v6-TG)
    is introduced in this protocol. MIPv4/v6-TG is \n   based on NAT-PT gateway and
    equipped with a newly introduced \n   application level gateway called MIP-ALG.
    MIPv4/v6-TG is located \n   between IPv4 network and IPv6 network. On IPv4 network
    side, \n   MIPv4/v6-TG acts as a Mobile IPv4 entity and interacts with other \n
    \  Mobile IPv4 entities under Mobile IPv4, while on IPv6 network side, \n   it
    acts as a Mobile IPv6 entity and interacts with other Mobile IPv6 \n   entities
    under Mobile IPv6. In MIPv4/v6-TG, Mobile IPv4 entities and \n   Mobile IPv6 entities
    are translated with each other. In order to \n   maintain each of Mobile IP sessions
    that pass through MIPv4/v6-TG, a \n   data structure called Mobile IP Table is
    introduced.  \n\t "

  content: "   Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol overhead in\n
    \  many scenarios.  However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may\n   significantly
    degrade network and device performance in terms of link\n   utilization, latency,
    memory usage and/or energy consumption.  This\n   document defines the TCP ACK
    Pull (AKP) mechanism, which allows a\n   sender to request the ACK for a data
    segment to be sent without\n   additional delay by the receiver.  AKP makes use
    of one of the\n   reserved bits in the TCP header, which is defined in this\n
    \  specification as the AKP flag.\n\n\t "

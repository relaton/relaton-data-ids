abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The  current  link  state  routing protocols flood link states to all\nrouters
    so that routers have the information required to compute  the\nshortest  paths
    \ to route packets on a hop by hop basis. However, for\nthe purpose of establishing
    MPLS paths, constraint  path  computation\nis  only  performed at certain nodes,
    for instance, at the node where\npath setup is triggered or  at  the  head-end
    \ of  a  loosely  routed\nsegment  that  crosses  a network (or area) boundary.
    In addition, it\nnot possible to have all required constraints present in all
    nodes in\na  network,  nor  is it always feasible for nodes setting up paths to\ncompute
    the constraint paths themselves, a notable example is when  a\npath  traverses
    \ network  or area boundary.  These reasons motivate a\nsolution using a 'subset'
    of routers (called  route  exchangers),  to\ncollect  constraint  information
    \ and  exchange  it  with other route\nexchangers. Route exchangers store traffic
    \ engineering  link  states\nand  other types of constraint information and compute
    on demand, the\nexplicit routes required by routers establishing paths.  Hence,
    \ link\nstate  information  need  only  be distributed to the subset of nodes\nthat
    help compute constraint paths in the network.\n\n\n\t "

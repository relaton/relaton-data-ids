abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   DNS SRV RRs of a domain implicitly specify servers and port numbers\n
    \  corresponding to the domain.\n\n   By combining URLs and SRV RRs, no port numbers
    have to be specified\n   explicitly in URLs, even if non-default port numbers
    are used, which\n   makes URLs more concise for port based virtual and real hosting,\n
    \  where port based real hosting means that multiple servers sharing an\n   IP
    address are distinguished by port numbers to give service for\n   different URLs,
    which is the case for port forwarded servers behind\n   NAT and servers with realm
    specific IP.\n\n\t "

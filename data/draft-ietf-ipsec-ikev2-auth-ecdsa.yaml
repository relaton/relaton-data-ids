  content: "   This document describes how the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature\n
    \  Algorithm (ECDSA) may be used as the authentication method within\n   the Internet
    Key Exchange protocol, version 2 (IKEv2).  ECDSA may \n   provide benefits including
    computational efficiency, small signature\n   sizes, and minimal bandwidth, compared
    to other available digital \n   signature methods.  This document adds ECDSA capability
    to IKEv2 \n   without introducing any changes to existing IKEv2 operation.\n\t "

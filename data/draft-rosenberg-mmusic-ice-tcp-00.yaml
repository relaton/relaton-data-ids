- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for\n
    \  NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the\n   offer/answer
    model of session negotiation.  ICE works by providing a\n   set of candidate transport
    addresses for each media stream, which are\n   then validated with peer-to-peer
    connectivity checks based on Simple\n   Traversal of UDP over NAT (STUN).  ICE
    provides a general framework\n   for describing alternates, but only defines UDP-based
    transport\n   protocols.  This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media,\n
    \  including the ability to offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates\n   for
    a single stream.\n\t "

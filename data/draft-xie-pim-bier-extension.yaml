  content: "   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new architecture that\n
    \  provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate\n   routers
    to maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific\n   BIER header.
    \ PIM is a well-known multicast-specific routing protocol\n   which is widely
    deployed either in a VRF context or in a Non-VRF\n   context.  This document describes
    PIM extensions to signal a P2MP\n   Tree with BIER information, which is called
    a P2MP based BIER in\n   [I.D.xie-bier-mvpn-mpls-p2mp].  PIM is required to alloc
    Label to\n   build a P2MP tree hop-by-hop, and build a P2MP based BIER forwarding\n
    \  table further.  This requires a BitMask being carried as a PIM Join\n   Attribute
    by downstream node to upstream node hop-by-hop, and the\n   behavior is like precedures
    as specified in [RFC6807].\n\n\n\t "

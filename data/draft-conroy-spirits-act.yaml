  content: "This  Internet Draft has  been written at the  request of one  of the\nSPIRITS
    Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussion on what\nextended functionality
    SPIRITS may be used to provide.\nIt has been requested  that mapping  to any specific
    \ protocol is not\nundertaken at this  juncture. As such,  only 'possible' functionality\nis
    identified and no mapping to existing protocol methods is given.\nThis document
    is only intended to  provide a basis for discussion and\nwould be expected to
    form one aspect of the requirements for SPIRITS.\nAs such the terminology used
    is deliberately and (we hope) suitably\nambiguous.\n\t "

  content: "The proposed IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) Optimization\n\"Optimistic
    DAD\" defines a set of recoverable procedures which allow\na node to make use
    of an address before DAD completes.  Essentially,\nOptimistic DAD forbids usage
    of certain Neighbour Discovery options\nwhich could pollute active neighbour cache
    entries, while an address\nis tentative.\n\nThis document defines a new option
    and procedures to replace cache\npolluting options, in a way which is useful to
    tentative nodes.\nThese procedures are designed to be to backward compatible with\nexisting
    devices which support IPv6 Neighbour Discovery.\n\t "

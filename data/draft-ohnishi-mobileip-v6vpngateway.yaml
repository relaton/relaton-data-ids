  content: "Mobile IPv6 [Mobile IPv6] provides mobility functions for IPv6.  It\ncan
    also be used for public mobility services.  One of the most\nimportant services
    is the VPN service enabling users to access their\nIntranets from outside.  Mobile
    IP does not work well with VPN,\nhowever, and this issue is being discussed in
    the Mobile IP WG [VPN\nproblem].  This document proposes a simple mechanism that
    combines\nVPN and Mobile IP functions. This mechanism uses a hierarchical HA\narchitecture
    and includes an HA with GW functions, called a Gateway\nHome Agent (GHA).\n\n\n\t "

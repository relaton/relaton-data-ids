  content: "The SNMPv2 Working Group has accomplished much good work thus far by refining
    and extending the definition of management information, by improving protocol
    operations in several important ways, and by enriching and formalizing compliance
    statements.  Improvements in these areas have been discussed and consensus has
    been reached on a set of documents that are ready to be moved forward to Draft
    Standard on the Internet standards track.\n\t "

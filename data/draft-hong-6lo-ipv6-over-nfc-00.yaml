  content: "   Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones\n
    \  and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other\n   by
    touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no\n   more than
    a few inches.  NFC standards cover communications protocols\n   and data exchange
    formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency\n   identification (RFID) standards
    including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.\n   The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and
    those defined by the NFC\n   Forum, which was founded in 2004 by Nokia, Philips
    Semiconductors.\n   The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available
    in\n   mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.  This\n   document
    describes how IPv6 is transforted over NFC using 6LowPAN\n   techiques.\n\n\t "

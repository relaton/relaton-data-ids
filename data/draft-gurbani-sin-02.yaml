  content: "Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) services such as 800-number routing
    (freephone), time-and-day routing, credit-card calling, and virtual private network
    (mapping a private network number into a public number) are realized by the Intelligent
    Network (IN).  This document addresses means to support existing IN services from
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoints for an IP-host-to-phone call.  The
    call request is originated on a SIP endpoint, but the services to the call are
    provided by the data and procedures resident in the PSTN/IN.  To provide IN services
    in a transparent manner to SIP endpoints, this document describes the mechanism
    for interworking SIP and Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP).  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures\n
    \  require cooperation among a threshold number of signers each holding\n   a
    share of a common private key.  Consequently, generating signatures\n   in a threshold
    setting imposes overhead due to network rounds among\n   signers, proving costly
    when secret shares are stored on network-\n   limited devices or when coordination
    occurs over unreliable networks.\n   This draft describes FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized
    Schnorr\n   Threshold signature scheme that reduces network overhead during\n
    \  signing operations while employing a novel technique to protect\n   against
    forgery attacks applicable to similar schemes in the\n   literature.  FROST improves
    upon the state of the art in Schnorr\n   threshold signature protocols, as it
    can safely perform signing\n   operations in a single round without limiting concurrency
    of signing\n   operations, yet allows for true threshold signing, as only a\n
    \  threshold number of participants are required for signing operations.\n   FROST
    can be used as either a two-round protocol where signers send\n   and receive
    two messages in total, or optimized to a single-round\n   signing protocol with
    a pre-processing stage.  FROST achieves its\n   efficiency improvements in part
    by allowing the protocol to abort in\n   the presence of a misbehaving participant
    (who is then identified and\n   excluded from future operations)--a reasonable
    model for practical\n   deployment scenarios.\n\n\t "

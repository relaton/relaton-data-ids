  content: "This document is a submission to the SNMPv2 Working Group of the IETF.
    \    The Administrative Model for SNMPv2 document defines a framework and an administrative
    model which realizes effective management in a variety of configurations and environments.
    \                                          In the administrative model, there
    are provisions for multiple authentication and privacy services (identified by
    the security protocol identifier, sPI) to achieve various objectives.  Each manager
    (including a dual-role entity acting in a manager role) and each agent (including
    a dual-role entity acting in an agent role) implements one or more of these types
    of service.                                                          Although
    many such types of authentication and privacy services might be defined, it is
    the purpose of this document, User-Based Symmetric Security Protocols for SNMPv2,
    to define three such services; one service supporting neither authentication nor
    privacy (usecNoAuth(4)), one service supporting authentication but not privacy
    (usecAuth(5)), and another supporting both authentication and privacy (usecPriv(6)).
    \    This updated version of the document is the output of the SNMPv2* meeting
    held in Dallas\n\t "

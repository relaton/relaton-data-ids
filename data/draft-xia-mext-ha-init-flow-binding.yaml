  content: "   There are scenarios in which home agent initiated flow binding\n   operations
    towards the mobile node is needed such as revoking a flow\n   binding or moving
    a flow from one interface to another because of\n   network resource availability.
    \ This document defines one new\n   Mobility Header, two messages, several actions
    and two new sub-\n   options to perform home agent initiated interactions for
    flow\n   bindings in a mobile node.  Home agent initiated flow bindings are\n
    \  supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled mobile nodes.\n\n\t "

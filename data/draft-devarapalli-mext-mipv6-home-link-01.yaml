  content: "The Mobile IPv6 protocol is being adopted by various Standards\nDevelopment
    Organizations (SDO) for mobility across wide area\nnetworks.  Some of the architectures
    developed by these SDOs require\nsome of the access links to be home link for
    mobile node.  The belief\nis that if the mobile node thinks it is attached to
    the home link,\nthere will not be additional packet overhead due to Mobile IPv6\ntunneling.
    \ Many of these links where the mobile node is supposed to\nbe attached to the
    home link are point-to-point links.  There are\nsome issues with making these
    point-to-point links appear like home\nlink to the mobile node.  This document
    captures some of the issues\nrelated to this, and analyzes possible solutions.\n\t "

  content: "   The Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) is used by IPv6 routers to\n
    \  discover the presence of multicast listeners (i.e.  nodes that wish\n   to
    receive multicast packets) on their directly attached links, and\n   to discover
    which multicast addresses are of interest to those\n   neighbouring nodes.  The
    existing protocol specification (MLDv2)\n   discusses the effects of on-link forgery
    of MLD packets but provides\n   no protection from on-link attacks.\n\n   By taking
    advantage of or abusing Multicast Listener Discovery, bogus\n   devices may cause
    incorrect state and disruption to multicast or\n   unicast packet delivery.  This
    memo considers the trust models for\n   the MLD protocols, and their interaction
    as well as their interaction\n   with link-layer and multicast proxy devices.
    \ It provides a security\n   and threat analysis for each model.\n\t "

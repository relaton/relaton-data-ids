  content: "   Spam, defined as the transmission of bulk unsolicited messages, has\n
    \  plagued Internet email.  Unfortunately, spam is not limited to email.\n   It
    can affect any system that enables user to user communications.\n   The Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) defines a system for user to\n   user multimedia communications.
    \ Therefore, it is susceptible to\n   spam, just as email is.  In this document,
    we analyze the problem of\n   spam in SIP.  We first identify the ways in which
    the problem is the\n   same and the ways in which it is different from email.
    \ We then\n   examine the various possible solutions that have been discussed
    for\n   email and consider their applicability to SIP.  Discussions on this\n
    \  draft should be directed at sipping@ietf.org.\n\t "

  content: "   A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is formed by the spontaneous \n   association
    of wireless and mobile devices capable of communicating \n   among them even when
    there is no networking infrastructure \n   available. Several unicast Internet
    gateway mechanisms have been \n   proposed within the IETEF MANET WG. However,
    the particular nature \n   of the IP Multicast model poses some additional requirements
    which \n   need to be satisfied by candidate solutions. This document aims at
    \n   identifying the requirements that a multicast solution for MANET \n   interworking
    with a fixed IP Multicast network should satisfy. \n\t "

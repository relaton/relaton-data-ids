  content: "   It has been proposed to encapsulate IOAM tracing option data fields\n
    \  in IPv6 HbH options header.  However, due to size of the trace data\n   and
    its location in the IPv6 header packets, this arrangement creates\n   practical
    challenges for implementation, especially when other\n   extension headers, such
    as routing header, also exist and require in-\n   network processing.  We propose
    several alternative approaches to\n   address this challenge, including separating
    the IOAM trace data to a\n   different extension header, using the postcard-based
    telemetry (e.g.,\n   IOAM DEX) instead, and applying the segment IOAM trace export
    scheme,\n   based on the network scenario and application requirements.  We\n
    \  discuss the pros and cons of each approach and foster standard\n   convergence
    and industry adoption.\n\n\n\t "

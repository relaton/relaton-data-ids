  content: "   This document proposes a new fast start-up mechanism for TCP that can\n
    \  be used to speed the beginning of an Internet connection and then\n   improved
    the short-lived TCP connections performance.\n\n   Initial Spreading allows to
    safely increase the Initial Window size\n   in any cases, and notably in congested
    networks.\n\n   Merging the increase in the IW with the spacing of the segments\n
    \  belonging to the Initial Window (IW), Initial Spreading is a very\n   simple
    mechanism that improves short-lived TCP flows performance and\n   do not deteriorate
    long-lived TCP flows performance.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The quality of a codec has to be measured by multiple parameters\n
    \  such as audio quality, speech quality, algorithmic efficiency,\n   latency,
    coding rates and their respective tradeoffs. During\n   standardization, codecs
    are tested and evaluated multiple times to\n   ensure a high quality outcome.\n\n
    \  As the upcoming Internet codec is likely to have unique features,\n   there
    is a need to develop new quality testing procedures to measure\n   these features.
    Thus, this draft reviews existing methods on how to\n   measure a codec's qualities,
    proposes a couple of new methods, and\n   gives suggestions which may be used
    for testing the Internet\n   Interactive Audio Codec (IIAC).\n\n   This document
    is work in progress.\n\n\t "

  content: "In this document, we propose another solution to support Internet \n   connectivity
    for AODV. In the design of our solution, several \n   important limits of existing
    solutions are considered. Especially, \n   new route determination and forwarding
    algorithms are proposed. \n   Proposed route determination algorithm supports
    dynamic switching \n   between default route and host route in a sender node through
    which \n   enhanced performance can be achieved under frequent topological \n
    \  changes. And proposed forwarding algorithm supports next hop \n   forwarding
    for default routes towards multiple gateways.\n\t "

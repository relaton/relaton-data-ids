  content: "In some Mobile IPv4 deployments, identifying the mobile node or the mobility
    service subscriber is not enough to distinguish among the multiple services possibly
    provisioned to the mobile node.  The capability to specify different services
    in addition to the mobile node's identity can be leveraged to provide flexibility
    for mobility service providers to provide multiple services within a single mobility
    service subscription.  This document describes a Service Selection extension for
    Mobile IPv4 that is intended to assist home agents to make specific service selections
    for their mobility service subscriptions during the registration procedure.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

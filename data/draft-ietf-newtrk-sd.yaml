  content: "   The \"ISD\" model for specifying the definition, status, and content
    of\n   Internet Standards does not appear to be satisfactory for the\n   documents
    that describe IETF procedures, structure, or relationships\n   with other bodies.
    \ Those documents have traditionally be published\n   as BCPs and described as
    \"process\" BCPs.  This document proposes an\n   special document series for those
    process documents, paralleling the\n   ISDs.\n\t "

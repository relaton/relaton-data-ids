  content: "In order for DNSSEC to be deployed operationally, there needs to\nbe a
    mechanism that allows for unsigned RRsets in a secure zone.\nIn the current definition
    of DNSSEC [RFC 2535], it is allowed to\nhave 2 types of unsigned records, i.e.
    glue address RRsets and\ndelegation point NS RRsets. There exists several reasons
    to\nallow other unsigned RRsets, all related to the scalability and\nmaintenance
    of a secure zone.\n\t "

  content: "An Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) requires the ability to
    \nprovide an elevated probability of session establishment to an \nauthorized
    user in times of network congestion (typically, during a \ncrisis). When supported
    over the Internet Protocol suite, this may be \nfacilitated through a network
    layer admission control solution, which \nsupports prioritized access to resources
    (e.g., bandwidth). These \nresources may be explicitly set aside for emergency
    services, or they \nmay be shared with other sessions. \n\nThis document specifies
    RSVP extensions that can be used to support \nsuch an admission priority capability
    at the network layer. Note that \nthese extensions represent one possible solution
    component in \nsatisfying ETS requirements. Other solution components, or other
    \nsolutions, are outside the scope of this document. \n\n\t "

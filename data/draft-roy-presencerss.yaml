  content: "RSS Feeds have always played an important role in providing users \n        content
    related updates typically of Websites without having to visit \n        those
    websites manually. Typical examples of RSS usage include users \n        'subscribing'
    to the RSS feed of a website, say, CNN.com and thereby \n        automatically
    receiving 'news headlines' when the content changes. \n\n        Recently, there
    have been significant innovations (such as Yahoo \n        Pipes and Google Mash-up
    Editor) where RSS feeds from different \n        sources have been combined to
    produce new services in a 'Web Based \n        Service Creation Environment' model
    allowing users to create \n        interesting services building on top of 'primitives'
    that can be \n        represented on the Web.  \n\n        This document describes
    the motivation for an RSS feed for Presence \n        information, which the authors
    believe would be useful to create new \n        services using a similar environment
    described above.\n\t "

  content: "The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion on the\nrefresh
    overhead reduction of RSVP. Specifically, this document\nproposes some extensions
    to deal with route change while maintaining\nthe advantage of ID-based refreshes.
    For environments where PATH\nrefreshes must be used to detect route change, ID-only
    refreshes are\nused to decrease the message size. For environments where route\nchange
    is informed to RSVP process by some other means, a new message\nis introduced
    to invalidate ID.\n\t "

  content: "   Segment Routing architecture leverages the source routing and\n   tunneling
    paradigm and can be directly applied to MPLS dataplane.  A\n   node steers a packet
    through a controlled set of instructions called\n   segments, by prepending the
    packet with Segment Routing header.\n\n   The segment assignment and forwarding
    semantic nature of Segment\n   Routing raises additional consideration for connectivity
    verification\n   and fault isolation in LSP with SPRING architecture.  This document\n
    \  illustrates the problem and describe a mechanism to perform LSP Ping\n   and
    Traceroute on Segment Routing network over MPLS dataplane.\n\n\t "

  content: "The purpose of this document is to provide a mapping of QoS policy \ninformation
    to a form that can be implemented in a directory that uses \n(L)DAP as its access
    protocol. Its derivation is as follows.\n\nThe structure of generic policy information
    is defined in the Policy \nCore Information Model ([PCIM]). The mapping of this
    information to a \nform that can be implemented in a directory is defined in the
    Policy \nCore Schema ([PFSCHEMA]). The [PCIM] is extended to represent specific
    \ninformation needed to represent QoS policies with the QoS Information \nModel
    ([QOSIM]). This draft, then, maps the data defined in the [QOSIM] \nto a form
    that can be implemented in a directory. Specifically, this \ndraft refines the
    concept of generic policy rules, conditions and \nactions to cover extensions
    necessary for representing policies to \ncontrol the configuration and management
    of RSVP and Differentiated \nServices. This document also discusses LDAP related
    issues regarding \nthe implementation of such a schema.\n\n\t "

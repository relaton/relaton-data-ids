  content: "   This document specifies the usage of Explicit Congestion Notification\n
    \  (ECN) markings for real-time inelastic flows such as voice, video\n   conferencing,
    and multimedia streaming.  We build on the principles\n   of RFC 3168, \"The Addition
    of Explicit Congestion Notification to\n   IP\", and apply them to real-time inelastic
    traffic in DiffServ\n   networks.  Defined in this document are, new ECN semantics
    that\n   provide two levels of experienced congestion along the path for real-\n
    \  time inelastic flows, the required ECN marking behavior in network\n   nodes,
    and state the required behavior of end-systems that support\n   this function
    with an explanation of how the two ECN schemes can co-\n   exist safely in the
    network.\n\t "

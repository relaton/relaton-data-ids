  content: "   Massive datasets continue to be acquired, simulated, processed and\n
    \  analyzed by globally distributed scientific collaborations, and the\n   volume
    of this data is growing exponentially.  These datasets need to\n   be exchanged
    through a global network infrastructure.  Applications\n   that manages the transfer
    of such massive data volumes can benefit\n   substantially from the utilization
    of network information, and more\n   directly from network-resident services that
    optimize and load\n   balance network usage among multiple transfer requests,
    and\n   coordinate the network use with the use of other resources such as\n   computing
    and storage.\n\n   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    can\n   provide via extensions such network information, to both users and\n   proactive
    network management services where applicable, with the goal\n   of improving both
    application performance and network resource\n   utilization, leading to greater
    overall efficiency of the science\n   programs' workflows.\n\n   This document
    introduces an Exascale Dataset Transfer Orchestrator\n   (EDTO), which is a data
    transfer scheduling service for exascale\n   science networks.  EDTO provides
    simple APIs for users to submit,\n   update and delete data transfer requests
    and to monitor the status of\n   each transfer, along with local and global network
    and site state\n   information in real-time.  EDTO collects network information
    from\n   multiple ALTO services utilizing proposed topology extensions and\n   leverages
    emerging SDN control capabilities to orchestrate the\n   scheduling of multiple
    large dataset transfers, leading to improved\n   data transfer latency and reliability
    as well as more efficient\n   utilization of limited network resources.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A link-state routing protocol such as OSPF or IS-IS is an essential\n
    \  component for a routing system.  With substantial effort on the IGP\n   protocols,
    the infrastructure of the network has achieved high\n   reliability.  During past
    years they have been operated and\n   maintained through typical CLI, SNMP and
    NETCONF.  As modern networks\n   become larger and more complex, the IGP protocol
    may require a\n   programmatic interface which is able to facilitate additional
    control\n   and observation in such networks.\n\n   Interface to the Routing System's
    (I2RS) is a standards-based\n   interface which provides a programmatic way to
    control and observe\n   the IGP protocol.  I2RS can be used to operate, maintain
    and monitor\n   the routing-related state.  This document describes set of use
    cases\n   for which I2RS can be used for IGP protocol.  It is intended to\n   provide
    a base for the solution draft describing information models\n   and a set of interfaces
    to the IGP protocol.\n\n\n\t "

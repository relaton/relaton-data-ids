  content: "   The security protocol Object Security for Constrained RESTful\n   Environments
    (OSCORE) provides end-to-end protection of messages\n   exchanged with the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP).  Messages\n   protected with OSCORE include a CoAP
    OSCORE option, where the\n   \"Partial IV\" field specifies the sequence number
    value used by the\n   message sender and the \"kid\" field specifies the identifier
    of the\n   message sender.  In order to reduce the information exposed on the\n
    \  wire that can be used for fingerprinting traffic and for tracking\n   endpoints,
    this document defines a lightweight add-on method that\n   obfuscates certain
    fields of the OSCORE option, by encrypting the\n   \"Partial IV\" field and overwriting
    the \"kid\" field with a stand-in\n   identifier.  Therefore, it updates RFC 8613.
    \ With minor adaptations,\n   the defined method is applicable also to the security
    protocol Group\n   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group
    OSCORE)\n   that protects group communication for CoAP.\n\n\t "

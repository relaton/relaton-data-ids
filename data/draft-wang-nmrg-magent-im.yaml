  content: "   In the push toward Level 4 Autonomous Networks, CSPs must to adopt\n
    \  new processes and organizational changes, along with function-centric\n   building
    blocks for higher autonomy.  As intelligent agents evolve,\n   network autonomy
    increasingly relies on deploying these agents,\n   enabling self-management, self-healing,
    and adaptation with minimal\n   human intervention.  These agents facilitate the
    transition toward\n   fully autonomous network operations across multiple layers,
    including\n   services and resources.  However, achieving Level 4 autonomy, where\n
    \  networks independently handle tasks across various domains, presents\n   significant
    challenges, notably secure, efficient, and accurate\n   multi-agent interactions.
    \ This document introduces a protocol-\n   agnostic data model that enables multiple
    intelligent agents to\n   communicate effectively using the model, ensuring end-to-end
    task\n   execution and closed-loop operations in autonomous networks.\n\n\t "

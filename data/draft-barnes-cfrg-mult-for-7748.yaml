  content: "   In some contexts it is useful for holders of the private and public\n
    \  parts of an elliptic curve key pair to be able to independently apply\n   an
    updates to those values, such that the resulting updated public\n   key corresponds
    to the updated private key.  Such updates are\n   straightforward for older elliptic
    curves, but for X25519 and X448,\n   the \"clamping\" prescribed for scalars requires
    some additional\n   processing.  This document defines a multiplication procedure
    that\n   can be used to update X25519 and X448 key pairs.  This algorithm can\n
    \  fail to produce a result, but only with negligible probability.\n   Failures
    can be detected by the holder of the private key.\n\n\t "

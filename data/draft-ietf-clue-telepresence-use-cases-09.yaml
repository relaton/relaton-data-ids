  content: "Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create an environment that gives
    users (or user groups) that are not co-located a feeling of co-located presence
    through multimedia communication that includes at least audio and video signals
    of high fidelity.  A number of techniques for handling audio and video streams
    are used to create this experience.  When these techniques are not similar, interoperability
    between different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible.  Conveying
    information about the relationships between multiple streams of media would enable
    senders and receivers to make choices to allow telepresence systems to interwork.
    \ This memo describes the most typical and important use cases for sending multiple
    streams in a telepresence conference.\n\t "

  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet through a\n   controlled
    set of instructions, called segments, by prepending a SR\n   header to the packet.
    \ A segment can represent any instruction,\n   topological or service-based.  SR
    allows to enforce a flow through\n   any path (topological, or application/service
    based) while\n   maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the SR
    domain.\n\n   Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane with the\n
    \  addition of a new type of Routing Extension Header.  This document\n   analyzes
    the security aspects of the Segment Routing Extension Header\n   (SRH) and how
    it is used by SR capable nodes to deliver a secure\n   service.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The DNS SRV record has been specified in RFC 2052 and RFC 2782 for\nuse
    in dynamic service discovery for a domain.  These two RFCs did\nnot clearly specify
    an IANA registry for the names of the services\nand their underlying protocols.
    \ This document clarifies RFC 2782\nregarding the formation and use of the Service
    Prefix in the owner\nname of SRV records, based on the unified IANA \"Service
    Name and\nTransport Protocol Port Number\" registry and provides a few other\ncorrections,
    clarifications, and usage recommendations.\n\t "

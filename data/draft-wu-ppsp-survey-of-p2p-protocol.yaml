  content: "Most of Peer-to-Peer survey papers are described about the P2P\n   applications
    architecture. But it is hard to compare PPSP with them\n   with the high-level
    description. In this survey, we focus on the\n   message design for the well-known
    P2P file downloading and streaming\n   applications (Bittorrent and eMule) and
    study their base and\n   enhancement approach in the peer and tracker protocol
    specifications.\n   Through the survey, we summarize a common message design for
    the P2P\n   streaming protocol standardization.\n\n\n\t "

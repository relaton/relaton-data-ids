  content: "   The TWAMP protocol provides a common architecture for two way\n   measurements
    in the IP network.  However IP network performance are\n   also affected by a
    set of L4-L7 service deployed in the network.\n   Monitoring of these service
    performance in the IP network also plays\n   a vital role in network optimization
    and application layer traffic\n   optimization.  This capability is not supported
    by the existing TWAMP\n   protocol.\n\n   In this document, we extend TWAMP protocol
    to support service\n   performance monitoring and service KPIs calculation.  Some
    of the\n   existing fields in the TWAMP protocol are extended to support new\n
    \  modes for calculating these KPIs.  A set of new messages are added in\n   the
    control protocol between TWAMP client (session sender) and the\n   TWAMP server
    (session reflector).  Services here ranging from Layer 4\n   to Layer 7 services,such
    as Http based services, Traffic load\n   balancer, DPI, Video caching, real time
    streaming and IPSec.  The\n   KPIs MAY be service latency, liveliness of an application,
    number of\n   flows and sessions per service, load balancer statistics.\n\n   There
    is a separate Draft[I.D-spv-ippm-monitor-implementation-\n   services-kpi] that
    talks about implementation of monitoring these\n   KPIs in the network using TWAMP.
    \ Monitoring of these KPIs in the\n   service plane with in a network play a vital
    role in optimum usage of\n   network resources and improving the overall performance
    and capacity.\n\n\t "

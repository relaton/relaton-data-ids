  content: "This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking IGP Route \nConvergence.
    \ The applicability of this testing is described in \n[1] and the new terminology
    that it introduces is defined in [2].\nService Providers use IGP Convergence time
    as a key metric of \nrouter design and architecture.  Customers of Service Providers
    \nobserve convergence time by packet loss.  IGP Route Convergence \nis a Direct
    Measure of Quality (DMOQ) when benchmarking the data \nplane and not the control
    plane.  The test cases in this document \nare black-box tests that emulate the
    network events that cause \nroute convergence, as described in [1].  Black-box
    test design \naccounts for all of the factors for route convergence time, as\nprovided
    in [1].  The methodology and terminology is to be used \nfor benchmarking route
    convergence and can be applied to any\nlink-state IGP such as ISIS [3] and OSPF
    [4]. \n\t "

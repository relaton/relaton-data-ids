  content: "   Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the\n
    \  need for a solid and secure firmware update mechanism that is also\n   suitable
    for constrained devices.  Incorporating such update\n   mechanism to fix vulnerabilities,
    to update configuration settings as\n   well as adding new functionality is recommended
    by security experts.\n\n   This document lists requirements and describes an architecture
    for a\n   firmware update mechanism suitable for IoT devices.  The architecture\n
    \  is agnostic to the transport of the firmware images and associated\n   meta-data.\n\n
    \  This version of the document assumes asymmetric cryptography and a\n   public
    key infrastructure.  Future versions may also describe a\n   symmetric key approach
    for very constrained devices.\n\n\t "

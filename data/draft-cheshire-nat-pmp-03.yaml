  content: "This document describes a protocol for automating the process of\n   creating
    Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings. Included in\n   the protocol
    is a method for retrieving the external IP address of a\n   NAT gateway, thus
    allowing a client to make this external IP address\n   and port number known to
    peers that may wish to communicate with it.\n   This protocol is implemented in
    current Apple products including Mac\n   OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort
    wireless base stations.\n\t "

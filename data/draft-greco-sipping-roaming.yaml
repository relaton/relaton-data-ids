  content: "   Roaming services allow users that have a contract with a voice\n   service
    provider to use access resources owned by other providers\n   known as internet
    access providers.  This draft proposes a token-\n   based Authentication, Authorization,
    Accounting (AAA) and billing\n   model for roaming users supporting the Session
    Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP).  It also introduces a protocol solution for the
    proposed model\n   that is based on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)\n
    \  protocol and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\n\n\t "

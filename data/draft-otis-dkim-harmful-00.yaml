abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be\n   identified
    by an authenticated domain.  Unfortunately many hope to\n   use DKIM as an alternative,
    but it is independent of intended\n   recipients and domains accountable for sending
    the message.  This\n   means DKIM is poorly suited for establishing abuse assessments
    for\n   unsolicited messaging of commercial email otherwise known as SPAM,\n   nor
    was this initially DKIM's intent.  DKIM lacks message context\n   essential to
    ensure fair assessment and to ensure this assessment is\n   not poisoned.\n\n
    \  DKIM was instead intended to establish increased levels of trust\n   based
    upon valid DKIM signatures controlling acceptance and what a\n   user sees within
    the FROM header field.  But DKIM failed to guard\n   against pre-pended header
    fields where any acceptance based on valid\n   DKIM signatures is sure to exclude
    header field spoofing, especially\n   that of the FROM.  This weakness allows
    malefactors to exploit DKIM\n   signature acceptance established by high-volume
    DKIM domains to spoof\n   ANY other domain, even when prohibited within the Signer's
    network.\n\n\n\t "

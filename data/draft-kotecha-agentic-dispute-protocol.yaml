abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Agentic Dispute Protocol (ADP), a standardized
    framework for autonomous agents and AI systems to file, process, and resolve disputes
    through structured, automated processes. The protocol defines message formats,
    transport mechanisms, evidence submission standards, and cryptographic proof requirements
    for internet-native dispute resolution. ADP is designed to handle disputes arising
    from AI agent interactions, service level agreement breaches, and automated contract
    enforcement, providing deterministic, auditable, and legally enforceable outcomes.
    ADP includes chain of custody tracking, dual-format award specifications (JSON
    and PDF), arbitrator discovery mechanisms, and support for multiple resolution
    frameworks including expert determination, binding arbitration, mediation, and
    hybrid approaches.</p>"

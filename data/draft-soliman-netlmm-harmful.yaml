  content: "Over the last six years the IETF has developed a number of protocols\nthat
    are expected to be useful for localized mobility management\n(LMM), both for IPv4
    and IPv6. All of these protocols were designed\nas extensions to Mobile IPv4 and
    Mobile IPv6. However, more recently,\nthe IESG has approved the formation of the
    NETLMM WG, which aims to\ndevelop a network-based localized mobility management
    protocol. This\nmemo discusses the impacts of a network-based mobility management\nprotocol
    on the Internet and the IETF. The aim of this memo is to\ngenerate discussion
    in this area in order to better critique the\nnetwork-based approach and show
    its impacts.\n\n\t "

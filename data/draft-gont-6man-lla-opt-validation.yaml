  content: "   This memo documents two scenarios in which an on-link attacker emits\n
    \  a crafted IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packet that poisons its\n   victim's
    neighbor cache.  In the first scenario, the attacker causes\n   a victim to map
    a local IPv6 address to a local router's own link-\n   layer address.  In the
    second scenario, the attacker causes the\n   victim to map a unicast IP address
    to a link layer broadcast address.\n   In both scenarios, the attacker can exploit
    the poisoned neighbor\n   cache to perform a subsequent forwording-loop attack,
    thus\n   potentially causing a Denial of Service.\n\n   Finally, this memo specifies
    simple validations that the recipient of\n   an ND message can execute in order
    to protect itself against the\n   above-mentioned threats.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an optional extension to Router Advertisement
    messages for communicating default router preferences and more-specific routes
    from routers to hosts.  This improves the ability of hosts to pick an appropriate
    router, especially when the host is multi-homed and the routers are on different
    links.  The preference values and specific routes advertised to hosts require
    administrative configuration; they are not automatically derived from routing
    tables. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

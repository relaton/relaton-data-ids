  content: "This document contains the profile for Congestion Control\nIdentifier
    2, TCP-like Congestion Control, in the Datagram\nCongestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
    [DCCP]. DCCP implements a\ncongestion-controlled, unreliable flow of datagrams
    suitable\nfor use by applications such as streaming media. The TCP-like\nCongestion
    Control CCID is used by senders who are able to\nadapt to the abrupt changes in
    the congestion window typical\nof the AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease)\ncongestion
    control in TCP.  TCP-like Congestion Control is\nparticularly useful for senders
    who would like to take\nadvantage of the available bandwidth in an environment
    with\nrapidly changing conditions\n\n\n\t "

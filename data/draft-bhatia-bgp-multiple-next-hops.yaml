  content: "   This document describes an extensible mechanism that allows a BGP   \n
    \  speaker to advertise multiple BGP paths for a destination to its   \n   peers,
    by describing a new BGP capability, termed \"Multiple-Hop   \n   Capability\".
    \  \n        \n   The mechanisms described in this document are applicable to
    all \n   routers, both those with the ability to inject multiple routing \n   entries
    in their forwarding table and those without. \n\n\t "

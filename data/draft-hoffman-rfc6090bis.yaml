  content: "   This note describes the fundamental algorithms of Elliptic Curve\n
    \  Cryptography (ECC) as they were defined in some seminal references\n   from
    1994 and earlier.  These descriptions may be useful for\n   implementing the fundamental
    algorithms without using any of the\n   specialized methods that were developed
    in following years.  Only\n   elliptic curves defined over fields of characteristic
    greater than\n   three are in scope; these curves are those used in Suite B.\n\n
    \  This version of the note incorporates errata that were reported on\n   RFC
    6090 [RFC6090].\n\n\t "

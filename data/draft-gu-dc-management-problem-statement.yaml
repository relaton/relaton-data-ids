  content: "Virtualization provides Data Center with feasibility and improves the\nutilization
    of limited physical resource, e.g. switches/routers,\nservers and links.  Virtual
    machines (VM) are allowed to migrate to\nany place in the Data Center.  A variety
    of policies (e.g.  ACL,\nfirewalls, load balancers, IPS and QoS) are deployed
    in Data Center\nto guarantee the SLA the provider signed with their clients.  Dynamic\ninformation,
    such as TCP Connection Table, dynamic ACLs and cumulated\ndata, is generated on
    network devices.  In order to keep running\nservices uninterrupted while VM migrating,
    relevant policies and\ndynamic information, also need to migrate with VM.\n\nThis
    document describes some examples of the policies and dynamic\ninformation that
    need to migrate with VM, the influence if they are\nnot migrated with VM, the
    problems that need to consider when migrate\npolices and dynamic information.
    \ It also describes some existing\nnetwork management protocols standardized by
    IETF and the advantages\nand disadvantages of them for operating policies and
    dynamic\ninformation migration respectively.  The goal is to justify that it\nis
    necessary for IETF to make effort on policy and dynamic\ninformation migration
    for large virtualized Data Center.\n\t "

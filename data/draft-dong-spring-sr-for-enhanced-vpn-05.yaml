  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to enable it
    to\n   support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that\n
    \  are associated with 5G services.  These applications require better\n   isolation
    from both control and data plane's perspective and have\n   more stringent performance
    requirements than can be provided with\n   overlay VPNs.  The characteristics
    of an enhanced VPN as perceived by\n   its tenant needs to be comparable to those
    of a dedicated private\n   network.  This requires tight integration between the
    overlay VPN and\n   the underlay network topology and resources in a scalable
    manner.  An\n   enhanced VPN may form the underpinning of 5G network slicing,
    but\n   will also be of use in its own right.  This document describes how to\n
    \  use segment routing based mechanisms to provide the enhanced VPN\n   service
    with the required network topology and resources.  The\n   overall mechanism of
    providing segment routing based enhanced VPN\n   service is also described.  The
    proposed mechanism is applicable to\n   both segment routing with MPLS data plane
    (SR-MPLS) and segment\n   routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).\n\n\n\t "

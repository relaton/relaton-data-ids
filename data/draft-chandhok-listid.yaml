  content: "Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers and user
    agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to a particular
    mailing list.  With the advent of list management headers, it has become even
    more important to provide a unique identifier for a mailing list regardless of
    the particular host that serves as the list processor at any given time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   This memo proposes resource pooling mechanism for multi-layer\n   operations.
    \ Resource pool is often discussed in the context of\n   robustness and restoration.
    \ But, resource pooling mechanism should\n   also be used for realizing flexibility
    in multi-layer network\n   operations.  Today, it takes days or weeks of lead
    time to change\n   wide area networks composed of multiple network layers.  One
    of the\n   reasons is because communications between operators of different\n
    \  network layers are necessary before configuration of each layer is\n   made.
    \ A network management system that uses resource pooling\n   mechanism would get
    rid of communications made between operators of\n   different network layers,
    and would realize flexible changes in\n   multi-layer networks.\n\n\t "

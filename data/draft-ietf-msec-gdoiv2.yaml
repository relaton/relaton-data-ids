  content: "   This document specifies a group key distribution protocol (GKDP)\n
    \  based on IKEv2 [2]; the new protocol is similar to IKEv2 in message\n   and
    payload formats, and message semantics to a large extent.  The\n   protocol in
    conformance with MSEC key management architecture\n   contains two components:
    member registration and group rekeying, and\n   downloads a group security association
    from the GCKS to a member.\n   This protocol is independent of IKEv2 except in
    its likeness.\n\t "

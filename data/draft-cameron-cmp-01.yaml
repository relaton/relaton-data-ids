  script: Latn
  content: "One of the problems with terminal servers attached to a LAN is the large
    number of small packets they can generate.  Frequently, most of these packets
    are destined for only one or two hosts.  CMP is a protocol which allows multiple
    Telnet and Rlogin connections, between a server and a host, to share a single
    TCP connection.  With simple extensions this can be expanded to include other
    TCP protocols.\n\t "

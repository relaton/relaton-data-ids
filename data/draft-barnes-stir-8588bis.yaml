  content: "   This document extends the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), which\n
    \  is a token object that conveys cryptographically signed information\n   about
    the participants involved in communications.  The extension is\n   defined based
    on the \"Signature-based Handling of Asserted\n   information using toKENs (SHAKEN)\"
    specification by the ATIS/SIP\n   Forum IP-NNI Task Group.  It provides both (1)
    a specific set of\n   levels of confidence in the correctness of the originating
    identity\n   of a call originated in a SIP-based telephone network as well as
    (2)\n   an identifier that allows the Service Provider (SP) to uniquely\n   identify
    the origin of the call within its network.  This document\n   obsoletes RFC8588.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The delivery of network services often require service functions and\n
    \  their specific order, called a service function chain (SFC).  A SFC\n   request
    is usually composed by distributed resources which are\n   expected to available
    across multiple domains with different\n   technology and/or administration.  This
    document describes different\n   standardization activities and research projects
    addressing the\n   challenges posed by SFC across multiple domains (specifically,\n
    \  multiple administrative domains).  In addition, this document\n   presents
    an initial approach to realize inter-domain service chains\n   leveraging the
    Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)\n   protocol.  Finally, another
    important concern of this document is to\n   initiate a discussion (ALTO, SFC
    as well as other WGs) regarding if,\n   how, and under what conditions ALTO can
    be useful to improve the\n   multi-domain SFC process.\n\n\t "

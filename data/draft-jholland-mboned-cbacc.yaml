  content: "   This document specifies Circuit Breaker Assisted Congestion Control\n
    \  (CBACC).  CBACC enables fast-trip Circuit Breakers by publishing rate\n   metadata
    about multicast channels from senders to intermediate\n   network nodes or receivers.
    \ The circuit breaker behavior is defined\n   as a supplement to receiver driven
    congestion control systems, to\n   preserve network health if receivers subscribe
    to a volume of traffic\n   that exceeds capacity policies or capability for a
    network or\n   receiver.\n\n\t "

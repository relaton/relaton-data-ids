  content: "This proposal extends the PIM-DM [1] protocol specification by intro-\nducing
    the PIM State-Refresh control message.\nWhen an (S,G) entry is created in a router
    for a directly connected\nsource, if the interface directly connected to the source
    is the\nincoming interface for the entry, a new timer is started: the State-\nRefresh-Timer
    [SRT(S,G)]. The State-Refresh-Timer controls periodic\ntransmission of the PIM
    State-Refresh message, which is propagated\nhop-by-hop down the (S,G) RPF tree.
    When received by a router on the\nRPF interface, the State-Refresh message causes
    existing prune state\nto be refreshed.\nAddition of this heartbeat message solves
    many of the current prob-\nlems with PIM-DM. It prevents the periodic timeout
    of prune state in\nrouters, greatly reducing the re-flooding of multicast traffic
    down\nthe pruned branches that expire periodically. It also causes topology\nchanges
    to be realised quicker than the traditional 3 minute timeout.\n\t "

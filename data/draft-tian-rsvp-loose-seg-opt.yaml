  content: "   RSVP-TE [RSVPTE] can signal explicit paths with loose or strict hops\n
    \  in a MPLS network. Using loose hops can shorten the ERO, but can not\n   reduce
    the overhead associated with an RSVP signaled LSP since path\n   states are still
    created on every hop along the path.\n\n   In this paper, we propose a mechanism
    that can reduce the signaling\n   and maintenance overhead associated with loose
    hops in an RSVP\n   signaled LSP in an LDP enabled network. The mechanism can
    also be\n   generalized to work with other tunneling technologies such as GRE
    or\n   IP-in-IP.\n\t "

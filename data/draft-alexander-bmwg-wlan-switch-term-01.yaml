abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a terminology to be used when performing performance
    test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches and controllers, including
    systems comprising groups of controllers and Access Points. The various wireless-specific
    device nomenclature, as well as the definitions of configuration parameters and
    test conditions that may be used to characterize the performance of these devices,
    are provided. The document also defines some of the metrics used during WLAN switch
    benchmarking. This terminology is to be used in conjunction with the companion
    methodology document.</p>"

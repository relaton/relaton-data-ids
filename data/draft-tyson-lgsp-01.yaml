  content: "This document presents the Lightweight GNSS (Global Navigation\n   Satellite
    System) Support Protocol (LGSP).  The Lightweight GNSS\n   Support Protocol (LGSP)
    is being developed in order to provide a\n   comprehensive solution which solves
    the problems inherent in\n   traditional radio-based Differential GPS (DGPS) protocols.
    \ LGSP will\n   also provide additional support for GNSS user equipment, such
    as a\n   GPS almanac retrieval method, allowing compatible units to perform\n
    \  faster almanac acquisition, thus resulting in less time until an\n   initial
    position measurement can be established.  Other supporting\n   features include
    alternative distribution of GPS navigation messages\n   and differential correction
    messages, a hierarchical mirroring\n   architecture, redundant backup operation
    and load balancing\n   functions.\n\t "

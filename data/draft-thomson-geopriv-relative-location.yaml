  content: "This document defines an extension to PIDF-LO (RFC4119) for the\nexpression
    of location information that is defined relative to a\nreference point.  The reference
    point may be expressed as a geodetic\nor civic location, and the relative offset
    may be one of several\nshapes.  Optionally, a reference to a secondary document
    (such as a\nmap image) can be included, along with the relationship of the map\ncoordinate
    system to the reference/offset coordinate system to allow\ndisplay of the map
    with the reference point and the relative offset.\nAlso included in this document
    is a Type/Length/Value (TLV)\nrepresentation of the relative location for use
    in other protocols\nthat use TLVs.\n\t "

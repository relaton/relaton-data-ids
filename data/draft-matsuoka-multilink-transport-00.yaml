  content: "Multi-link transport can offer higher bandwidth and more robust \nconnections.
    Because of a wide variety of emerged wireless access \ntechnologies, a mobile
    host can potentially have subscriptions and \naccess more than one wireless network
    simultaneously. This document \nintroduces example applications which use multiple
    links in a \nconnection simultaneously and illustrates the advantages of multi-link
    \ntransport. A problem with those applications is that the efficient \nmulti-link
    transport needs much more knowledge about each link \ncharacteristics such as
    bandwidth, delay, reliability and robustness.\nThis document defines the requirements
    for efficient and adaptive\nmulti-link transport and also describes the link information
    that\nmulti-stream senders can require.\n\t "

  content: "SDN and NFV have been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers,\ngovernments,
    and industries. In most recent months, these two novel frameworks created jitters\nand
    excitements across major academic institutions and communities of practice. While
    these\nare considered disruptive to major network infrastructures operating on
    status quo, SDN and\nNFV nonetheless bring network resiliency, scalability, manageability,
    and, most\nimportantly, lower long-term operational expenditures.\n\nThey create
    opportunities for  innovation that engage key players from networks,\nsecurity,
    and software to develop new software controllers, APIs, networks, and technologies.\n\nThis
    document aims to propose a formal security architecture that overarches important\naspects
    of SDN and NFV 's frameworks.\n\nThe architecture can be elaborated and modified
    as these two frameworks mature over\ntime. \n\n\t "

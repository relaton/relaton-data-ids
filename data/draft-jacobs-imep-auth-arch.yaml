  content: "   The Internet MANET Encapsulation Protocol (IMEP) is designed to support\n
    \  the operation of many routing algorithms or other Upper Layer\n   Protocols
    (ULP) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET). The MANET computing\n   environment is
    very different from the ordinary computing environment\n   in that these mobile
    computers will be connected to the network via\n   wireless links. Such links
    are particularly vulnerable to\n   eavesdropping, replay, spoofing, and other
    attacks. The use of IMEP\n   results in a mobile node relying on other MANET nodes
    to perform\n   routing operations on behalf of the transmitting node. This routing\n
    \  function constitutes a significant vulnerability if the IMEP management\n   messages
    are not authenticated. The risk of attacks on MANET routing\n   control messages
    necessitates a MANET Authentication Architecture to\n   protect these messages
    in some networking contexts. Consequently all\n   MANET nodes SHOULD be able to
    perform authentication. The MANET\n   Authentication Architecture provides MANET
    routers with the ability to\n   choose between multiple authentication options
    ranging from simple to\n   complex, while leaving the option of no authentication
    in some\n   contexts. IMEP messages between MANET routers are authenticated with\n
    \  the IMEP Authentication object.\n \n   This document describes how MANET nodes
    using IMEP and desiring\n   authentication SHOULD authenticate IMEP messages.
    Mechanisms\n   described herein will allow these nodes to use either secret key
    type\n   cryptosystems or public key type cryptosystems (with digital\n   certificates
    and digital signatures) for authenticating IMEP management\n   messages. The use
    of of secret key mechanisms will facilitate research\n   and experimentation of
    MANET networks while the use of public key\n   cryptosystems will allow MANET
    to scale to thousands of MANET mobile\n   nodes.\n\n\t "

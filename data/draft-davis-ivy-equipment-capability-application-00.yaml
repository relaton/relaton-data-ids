abstract:
- content: "<p>This document applies the generalized capability principles to the
    description of equipment (a physical thing) with applied data (configuration state
    and code (software, firmware etc.)) and shows how such capability specifications
    integrate with base inventory and entitlement models as defined in Network Inventory,
    Software Extension and Entitlement YANG models. The approach is examined by example,
    focusing on how the potential capabilities of each equipment type-version with
    applied data are described, how these map to entitlements (licensed or policy-
    controlled subsets of capabilities), and how they are instantiated as inventory
    items. The explanation covers both the capabilities of equipment in terms of physical
    properties and the capabilities of equipment with applied data in terms of resultant
    emergent functionality.</p>"

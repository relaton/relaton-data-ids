abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any
    path. SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e., instructions) that represent
    a source-routed policy. The packets steered into an SR Policy carry an ordered
    list of segments associated with that SR Policy. An SR Policy can be instantiated
    SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes. In some use cases, an SRv6 Policy's SID list ends
    with the policy endpoint's node SID, and the traffic steered (over policy) already
    ensures that it is taken to the policy endpoint. In such cases, the SID list can
    be optimized by excluding the endpoint Node SID when installing the policy. This
    draft specifies procedures to indicate whether the endpoint's node SID needs to
    be included or excluded when installing the SRv6 Policy.</p>"

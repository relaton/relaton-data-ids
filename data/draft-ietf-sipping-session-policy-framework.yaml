  content: "Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call\n   routing,
    rendezvous, and other call features.  However, there is\n   currently no standard
    mechanism by which a proxy can define or\n   influence policies on sessions such
    as the codecs or media types to\n   be used.  This document specifies a framework
    for SIP session\n   policies that provides this capability to proxies.  It defines
    a\n   model, an overall architecture and the protocol components for\n   session
    policies.\n\t "

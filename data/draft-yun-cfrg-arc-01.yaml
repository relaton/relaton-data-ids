  content: "   This document specifies the Anonymous Rate-Limited Credential (ARC)\n
    \  protocol, a specialization of keyed-verification anonymous\n   credentials
    with support for rate limiting.  ARC credentials can be\n   presented from client
    to server up to some fixed number of times,\n   where each presentation is cryptographically
    bound to client secrets\n   and application-specific public information, such
    that each\n   presentation is unlinkable from the others as well as the original\n
    \  credential creation.  ARC is useful in applications where a server\n   needs
    to throttle or rate-limit access from anonymous clients.\n\n\t "

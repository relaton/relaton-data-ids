  script: Latn
  content: "   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and\n   networks.
    \ In many applications, CoAP will be used via cross-protocol\n   proxies from
    HTTP clients.  HTTP client libraries may make it hard to\n   operate an HTTP-CoAP
    forward proxy by not providing a way to put a\n   CoAP URI on the HTTP Request-Line;
    reverse-proxying may therefore\n   lead to wider applicability of a proxy.  This
    specification will\n   define a convention for URIs operating such a HTTP-CoAP
    reverse\n   proxy.\n\n   The current version of this specification is a placeholder
    only.  It\n   is meant to pick up\n   http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/259
    and provide a home\n   for its considerations.  It might be merged with other
    documents\n   later.\n\n\t "

  content: "The IETF has defined a standard format for exchanging calendaring and\nscheduling
    data, called iCalendar. This format is useful for exchange\nof personal calendar
    data across the Internet, as well as in non-\nInternet environments.\n \nIn a
    number of environments where the iCalendar will be used, the\nformat type and
    version needs to be identified. For example, when\nregistering the iCalendar as
    a format for memory-based 'clipboard' or\n'drag/drop' user interface interactions.
    For these cases, a\ndefinitive formal public identifier (FPI) for the iCalendar
    will be\nrequired. This memo defined the FPI to be used when referring to the\nversion
    2.0 (the value in the 'VERSION' property) of the iCalendar\nformat.\n\t "

  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State\nPublication
    describes a mechanism for a User Agent Client (UAC) to\npublish event state information
    to a User Agent Server (UAS).\nGenerally, the UAC is free to monitor certain resources
    at a certain\nrate and publish changes of their event state, for instance with
    the\npresence event package.  However, for a UAC on a mobile device, this\ncan
    be very costly in terms of battery, computing, and network\nresources.  Although
    some mechnisms exist for a UAC to deduce whether\nevent state publication is needed
    and at what rate publish messages\nmay be sent, these are rather coarse and reactive
    in nature.  This\nmemo defines a solution for a UAS to regulate monitoring and\npublications
    by providing detailed information to the UAC regarding\nwhich resources to monitor,
    at what rate, whether urgent and with\nwhat delta.\n\n\t "

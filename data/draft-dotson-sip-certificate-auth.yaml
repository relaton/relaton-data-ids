  content: "This document defines requirements for adding certificate\nauthentication
    to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The use\ncase addressed is that of
    a SIP device authenticating on behalf of\nconfigured users using a device certificate
    for purposes such as\nregistration.  This document is being presented with the
    intention of\nproviding requirements to any potential solutions specifying\ncertificate
    authentication within SIP networks.  Supporting\ncertificate authentication in
    SIP would provide strong authentication\nand increase the types of possible deployment
    scenarios.\n\t "

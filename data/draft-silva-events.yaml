  content: "   This document defines extensions to iCalendar and iTIP that allow the\n
    \  expression of imprecise and multiple alternative events in calendar\n   objects
    and scheduling messages.  Imprecise events can be used to\n   imprecisely describe
    an event by specifying various ranked periods of\n   time in which it could be
    scheduled.  Alternative events can be used\n   to describe an event in terms of
    multiple ranked event descriptions,\n   imprecise or not, that could alternatively
    be scheduled.\n\n\n\t "

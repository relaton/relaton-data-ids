  content: "   This document defines the concept of an NSF (Network Security\n   Function)
    Capability, as well as its information model. Capabilities\n   are a set of features
    that are available from a managed entity, and\n   are represented as data that
    unambiguously characterizes an NSF.\n   Capabilities enable management entities
    to determine the set offer\n   features from available NSFs that will be used,
    and simplify the\n   management of NSFs.\n\n\t "

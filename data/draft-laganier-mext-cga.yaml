  content: "The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates\nsent
    by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pair\nof unidirectional
    IPsec security associations between these two\nnodes.  The standard mechanism
    to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates\nsent by a Mobile Node to one of its Correspondent
    Nodes relies on the\nuse of a return routability test that involves the Correspondent
    Node\nverifying reachability of the Mobile Node at both its Home Address\nand
    its Care-of Address.  The mechanism also requires the\ncorrespondent node to send
    keying material to both of these\naddresses.\n\nRFC 4866 specifies a standard
    track mecanism that allows a Mobile\nNode that has configured a Cryptographically
    Generated Address (RFC\n3972) as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding
    Updates sent\nits Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its\nCryptographically
    Generated Addresses.  Note that Cryptographically\nGenerated Addresses have also
    been used to counter similar security\nissues in the context of SHIM6 (RFC 5533)
    and Secure Neighbor\nDiscovery (RFC 3971.)\n\nThis memo proposes a mechanism that
    would let a Mobile Node use a\nsimilar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding
    Updates its sent to\nits Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use
    of\nCryptographically Generated Addresses.\n\t "

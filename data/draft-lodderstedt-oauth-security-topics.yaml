  content: "   This draft gives a comprehensive overview on open OAuth security\n
    \  topics.  It is intended to serve as a tool for the OAuth working\n   group
    to systematically address these open security topics,\n   recommending mitigations,
    and potentially also defining OAuth\n   extensions needed to cope with the respective
    security threats.  This\n   draft will potentially become a BCP over time.\n\n\t "

  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables network-based mobility for a regular IPv6\nmobile
    node with no mobility management protocol.  It makes it appear\nto the mobile
    node that its IP address does not change as the mobile\nnode moves across the
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  There have been some\nissues identified with supporting
    a host with multiple interfaces\nattaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  This
    document describes\nand analyzes some of the scenarios associated with this.  It
    also\ndescribes the requirements for a handover across interfaces using\nProxy
    Mobile IPv6.\n\t "

  content: "   This document  contains  an  extract from the approved text of IEEE\n
    \  standard 802.5R ''Dedicated Token Ring''.   The  extract  comprises\n   the
    \ MIB for the Dedicated Token Ring Concentrator, in SNMPv2 format.\n   The changes
    from the previous version of this draft are small but\n   important, and are in
    the area of CRF creation, where a RowStatus\n   mechanism replaces the previous
    way of creating CRFs.\n \n   802.5R  is a standard that encompasses the existing
    802.5 token-\n   passing method of operation, and also defines a new duplex method
    of\n   operation for use only on dedicated point to point links, that does\n   not
    use tokens for data transmission.\n \n   The architecture of a DTR  Concentrator
    is defined in the 802.5R\n   standard.  It  is a MAC layer bridging device, which
    uses a new set\n   of forwarding rules that  ease interoperability between source\n
    \  routing and transparent bridging in an  802.5  LAN.  The DTR\n   Concentrator
    MIB is derived from the Source Routing and Transparent\n   Bridge MIBs  (RFCs
    1525 and 1493).\n\n\t "

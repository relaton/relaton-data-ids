  content: "   When BGP route collectors such as RIPE RIS and Route Views are used\n
    \  by operators and researchers, currently one can not tell if the\n   collection
    of paths announced to a collector represents the ISP's\n   customer cone, includes
    internal routes, includes paths learned from\n   peerings or transits.  This greatly
    reduces the utility of the\n   collected data.  This document specifies the use
    of BGP communities\n   to differentiate the kinds of views being presented to
    the\n   collectors.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Call recording is an important feature in enterprise telephony\napplications.
    \ Some industries such as financial traders have\nrequirements to record all calls
    in which customers give trading\norders.  This poses a particular problem for
    Secure RTP systems as\nmany SRTP key exchange mechanisms do not disclose the SRTP
    session\nkeys to intermediate SIP proxies.  As a result, these key exchange\nmechanisms
    cannot be used in environments where call recording is\nneeded.\n\nThis document
    specifies a secure mechanism for a cooperating endpoint\nto disclose its SRTP
    master keys to an authorized party to allow\nsecure call recording.\n\t "

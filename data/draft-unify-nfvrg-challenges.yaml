  content: "   The introduction of network and service functionality virtualization\n
    \  in carrier-grade networks promises improved operations in terms of\n   flexibility,
    efficiency, and manageability.  In current practice,\n   virtualization is controlled
    through orchestrator entities that\n   expose programmable interfaces according
    to the underlying resource\n   types.  Typically this means the adoption of, on
    the one hand,\n   established data center compute/storage and, on the other, network\n
    \  control APIs which were originally developed in isolation.  Arguably,\n   the
    possibility for innovation highly depends on the capabilities and\n   openness
    of the aforementioned interfaces.  This document introduces\n   in simple terms
    the problems arising when one follows this approach\n   and motivates the need
    for a high level of programmability beyond\n   policy and service descriptions.
    \ This document also summarizes the\n   challenges related to orchestration programming
    in this unified cloud\n   and carrier network production environment.  A subsequent
    problem is\n   the resource orchestration.  This is handled separately in\n   [I-D.caszpe-nfvrg-orchestration-challenges]
    and will be merged in the\n   next iteration of this document.\n\n\t "

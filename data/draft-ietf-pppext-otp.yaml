  content: "EAP is an authentication protocol which supports multiple authentication\nmechanisms.
    EAP typically runs directly over the link layer without\nrequiring IP and therefore
    includes its own support for in-order\ndelivery and re-transmission.  While EAP
    was originally developed for\nuse with PPP, it is also now in use with IEEE 802.
    This document defines\nthe One Time Password (OTP) and Generic Token Card EAP
    methods.\n\n\n\n\t "

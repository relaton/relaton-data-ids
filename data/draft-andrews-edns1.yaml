  content: "   It is impracticable to deploy new EDNS options, with EDNS version 0,\n
    \  on a global scale due to inconsistent server behaviour in deployed\n   servers
    when a EDNS option is present in the query.  Most existing\n   EDNS option deployment
    has been small scale between essentially\n   consenting implementations.\n\n   When
    EDNS options were added to every outgoing recursive query made\n   it became clear
    that trial and error to discover the level of EDNS\n   version 0 support was not
    practicable.\n\n   This document request that EDNS version 1 be assigned so that\n
    \  consistent well defined behaviour can be seen when a EDNS option is\n   present.\n\n\t "

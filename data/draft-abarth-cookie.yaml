  content: "This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers.  These\nheaders
    can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP user\nagents, letting the servers
    maintain a stateful session over the\nmostly stateless HTTP protocol.  The cookie
    protocol has many\nhistorical infelicities and should be avoided for new applications
    of\nHTTP.\n\n\nNOTE: If you have suggestions for improving the draft, please send\n\nemail
    to http-state@ietf.org.  Suggestions with test cases are\n\nespecially appreciated.\n\t "

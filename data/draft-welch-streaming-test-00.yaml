  content: "This memo defines a set of supplementary tests for networking \ninterconnection
    devices (switches) that can be used to evaluate and \ncompare their performance
    when used with streaming media.  The Media \nDelivery Index (MDI) [i3] measurement
    is employed as a convenient \nstream quality indicator of input and output streams
    to indicate \ncumulative stream jitter and packet loss under test load conditions.
    \ \nTypical operating profiles are defined to focus test efforts on \ncommon switch
    applications for unidirectional streaming media to \nreduce the amount of testing
    required and to encourage device and \nsystem evaluation in advance of deployment
    through use of a set of \nreference tests.  \n         \nThe supplementary tests
    defined in this memo are intended for         Information only.\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a Session Description Protocol (SDP) Transport Independent
    Application Specific Maximum (TIAS) bandwidth modifier that does not include transport
    overhead; instead an additional packet rate attribute is defined. The transport
    independent bit-rate value together with the maximum packet rate can then be used
    to calculate the real bit-rate over the transport actually used.\n\n The existing
    SDP bandwidth modifiers and their values include the bandwidth needed for the
    transport and IP layers. When using SDP with protocols like the Session Announcement
    Protocol (SAP), the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the Real-Time Streaming
    Protocol (RTSP), and when the involved hosts has different transport overhead,
    for example due to different IP versions, the interpretation of what lower layer
    bandwidths are included is not clear. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces an approach to enable emergency services\n
    \  over Wi-Fi access networks.  These services encompass emergency\n   services
    such as 911 in North America, 112 in the European Union, and\n   equivalent emergency
    services in other regulatory domains.  The\n   proposed approach aims to provide
    a comprehensive solution for\n   supporting emergency communication across different
    regions and\n   regulatory frameworks.\n\n   Leveraging the legal framework and
    infrastructure of the OpenRoaming\n   federation, this proposal aims to extend
    emergency calling\n   capabilities to the vast number of OpenRoaming Wi-Fi hotspots
    that\n   have already been deployed.\n\n   The approach addresses critical challenges
    related to emergency\n   calling, including discovery and authentication procedures
    for\n   accessing networks that support emergency services, emergency access\n
    \  credentials, the configuration of emergency voice services, accurate\n   location
    determination of the emergency caller, and call spofing.\n\n   By providing a
    comprehensive solution, this proposal ensures that\n   emergency communication
    services can be seamlessly and effectively\n   supported within the IEEE 802.11-based
    Wi-Fi ecosystem leveraging\n   Passpoint Profiles.\n\n\t "

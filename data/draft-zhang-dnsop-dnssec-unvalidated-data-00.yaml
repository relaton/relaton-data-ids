  content: "   Due to the prevalence of DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security\n   Extensions)
    misconfigurations, many domain administrators\n   troubleshoot the records of
    DNSSEC-signed domains via queries with CD\n   (Checking Disabled) bit set.  However,
    as DNS resolvers are not\n   forced to perform DNSSEC validation for CD=1 queries,
    the unvalidated\n   data introduced during troubleshooting could be mixed up with
    the\n   routine ones in the resolver cache.  Recent research has revealed\n   that
    the reuse of the cached unvalidated data in subsequent\n   resolutions could lead
    to the risk of Denial-of-Service (DoS).  This\n   document clarifies the definition
    of unvalidated data in the context\n   of DNSSEC.  Then, it demonstrates the DoS
    vulnerabilities of current\n   DNS resolver implementations due to the reuse of
    cached unvalidated\n   data.  Accordingly, it provides several recommendations
    for DNSSEC-\n   validating resolvers to handle the unvalidated data and mitigate
    the\n   risk of DoS, so as to improve the availability of DNSSEC-signed\n   domains.\n\n\t "

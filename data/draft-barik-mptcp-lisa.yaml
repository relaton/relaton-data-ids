- language: en

  content: "   This document describes the LISA (Linked Slow-Start Algorithm) for\n
    \  Multipath TCP (MPTCP).  Currently during slow-start, subflows behave\n   like
    independent TCP flows making MPTCP unfair to cross-traffic and\n   causing more
    congestion at the bottleneck.  This also yields more\n   losses among the MPTCP
    subflows.  LISA couples the initial windows\n   (IW) of MPTCP subflows during
    the initial slow-start phase to remove\n   this adverse behavior.\n\n\t "

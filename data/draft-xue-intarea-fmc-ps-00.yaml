  content: "   The purpose of this document is to analyze the issues that have\n   arisen
    so far and then to propose a set of requirements for the Fixed\n   Mobile Convergence.
    \ The term Fixed Mobile Convergence spans several\n   scenarios from true integration
    of fixed and mobile terminals,\n   services, and network infrastructure on both
    technical and management\n   level down to pure interworking between fixed and
    mobile networks in\n   serving access for multi-interface terminals like todays'\n
    \  smartphones.  In the interworking scenario, the mobile network passes\n   on
    the mobile subscribers policies to the fixed broadband network in\n   order to
    maintain the end-to-end service level agreement and to\n   support remote terminal
    and access network management.  Explicitly,\n   the fixed broadband network must
    have partnership with the mobile\n   network in Fixed Mobile Convergence interworking
    scenario.  This\n   document gives a brief overview of the assumed Fixed Mobile\n
    \  Convergence architecture and related works and then introduces\n   several
    requirements based on the partnership in Fixed Mobile\n   Convergence architecture,
    such as User Equipment identification and\n   authentication, Femto Access Point
    management, device type\n   identification and mobility considerations.\n\n\t "

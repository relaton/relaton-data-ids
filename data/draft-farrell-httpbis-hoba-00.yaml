  content: "   This memo proposes a way of using origin-bound certificates for HTTP\n
    \  authentication, called HOBA.  HOBA is an HTTP authentication method\n   with
    credentials that are not vulnerable to simple phishing attacks,\n   and that does
    not require a server-side password database, both major\n   potential positives,
    if deployed.  HOBA can be integrated with\n   account management and other applications
    running over HTTP and\n   supports portability, so a user can associate more than
    one device or\n   origin-bound certificate with the same service.  This also provides
    a\n   mechanism to handle state-loss, if one of a user's credentials is\n   lost.
    \ HOBA also provides a logout mechanism.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document analyzes multihoming from the perspective of the\n   Internet
    edge: i.e.  hosts and other edge networks.  We built on top\n   of the previous
    work that describes goals and benefits of\n   multihoming, and identify problems
    for the provisioning of\n   multihoming at the edge level.  In this memo, we first
    look at the\n   problem of multihoming for a generic IPv6 node, followed by narrowing\n
    \  the analysis down to mobile hosts and networks.\n\t "

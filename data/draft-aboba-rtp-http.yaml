- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a payload format for use in encoding HTTP within
    RTP. This payload format can be used for unreliable multicasting of resources
    such as Web pages, stock tickers, etc.  As with other RTP applications, receiver
    feedback and group membership information is provided via RTCP.  This specification
    is not expected to be used with unicast, since unicast applications will instead
    use HTTP over TCP.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft suggests a method by which many IP payload data bodies may
    be encapsulated in a single IPv6 datagram.  New headers, designed with IPv6 in
    mind, will all contain a ``next header'' field, allowing headers to be chained,
    however older header types, inherited from IPv4, such as TCP and UDP, do not contain
    this field.  This means that, without assistance, they would have to be the last
    header in any sequence, and only one such header could appear in a packet.  This
    draft provides the mechanism to overcome this difficulty.\n\t "

  content: "This draft defines how XML Digital Signatures and XML Encryption may\nbe
    used with Multipart MIME security to provide MIME integrity and\nconfidentiality.
    \ It extends RFC 1847 by defining\napplication/signature+xml and application/encryption+xml
    protocols\nfor the Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted MIME types.\nAlthough
    non-XML content may be signed or encrypted based on XML\nsigning and encryption,
    additional capabilities are available for XML\nMIME content.  This draft defines
    a signature transform parameter for\npartial signing or manipulation of XML MIME
    content as well as\nprocessing rules in addition to the XML Digital Signature
    and XML\nEncryption processing rules.\n\t "

  content: "Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user shared\nsimulations,
    are becoming increasingly used for serious work in\naddition to the traditional
    uses of research and entertainment.\nBased on actual need identified by interaction
    with various customers\nwhen working on virtual world interoperability over the
    last four\nyears, this draft summarizes the main interoperability functions\nrequired
    to satisfy those needs.  From these use cases, requirements\nfor the MMOX virtual
    world interoperability charter can be derived.\n\t "

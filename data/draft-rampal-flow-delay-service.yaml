  content: "The purpose of this document is to illustrate when and how flow aggregation
    can be of benefit in the context of the Guaranteed Service.  Specifically, it
    identifies simple cases and provides generic rules for when grouping of flows
    allows a reduction in the amount of resources (bandwidth) needed to ensure the
    deterministic Guaranteed Service delay bounds of all flows.  The benefits of grouping
    should be especially of interest to, say, Internet Service Providers, wishing
    to interconnect sites with Guaranteed Service flows.  In particular, this document
    shows that in the case of flows with identical traffic characteristics and requirements,
    e.g., Internet voice, grouping of flows is ALWAYS beneficial.                                                                This
    technique is not intended for IETF standardization and is being submitted for
    informational purposes only.\n\t "

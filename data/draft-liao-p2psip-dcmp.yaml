  content: "This document proposes a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference\nPlatform
    which can support a lot of meetings simultaneously. It\ndesigns a new distributed
    conference architecture. In this\narchitecture the component called MCS is responsible
    for the process\nof media data including audio and video. Some conference UEs
    which\nhave enough bandwidth or other conditions could also undertake parts\nof
    media data process. All the MCSs form the reload overlay. The\ncapacity and state
    information of conference UEs is stored in the\nRELOAD overlay. One or several
    MCSs will be selected to provide media\nprocess for a meeting  and these MCSs
    process all the  transcoding\nand transmission of audio and video data, and decide
    which media\nprocess task could be assigned to Conference UEs.\n\t "

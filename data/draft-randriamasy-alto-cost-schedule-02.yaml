abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to\n   bridge
    the gap between network and applications by provisioning\n   network related information.
    \ This allows applications to make\n   informed decisions, for example when selecting
    a target host from a\n   set of candidates.  The ALTO problem statement [RFC5693]
    considers\n   typical applications as file sharing, real-time communication and\n
    \  live streaming peer-to-peer networks.  Recently other use cases\n   focused
    on Content Distribution Networks and Data Centers have\n   emerged.\n\n   The
    present draft proposes to extend the cost information provided by\n   the ALTO
    protocol.  The purpose is to broaden the decision\n   possibilities of applications
    to not only decide 'where' to connect\n   to, but also 'when'.  This is useful
    to applications that have a\n   degree of freedom on when to schedule data transfers,
    such as non-\n   instantaneous data replication between data centers or service\n
    \  provisioning to end systems with irregular connectivity.  The draft\n   therefore
    specifies a new cost mode, called the \"schedule\" mode.  In\n   this mode the
    ALTO server offers cost maps that contain path ratings\n   that are valid for
    a given timeframe (e.g. hourly) for a period of\n   time (e.g. a day).  Besides
    the functional time-shift enhancement\n   providing multi-timeframe cost values,
    the ALTO Cost Schedule also\n   allows to save a number of ALTO transactions and
    thus resources on\n   the ALTO server and clients.  Last, guidance to schedule
    application\n   traffic can also efficiently help for load balancing and resources\n
    \  efficiency.\n\n\n\t "

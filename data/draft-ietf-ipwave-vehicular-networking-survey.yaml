  content: "   This document surveys the general problem area on IP-based vehicular\n
    \  networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent\n   Transportation
    Systems (ITS).  The main topics of vehicular\n   networking are vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure\n   (V2I), and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V)
    networking.  This document\n   deals with some critical aspects in vehicular networking,
    such as IP\n   address autoconfiguration, vehicular network architecture, routing,\n
    \  mobility management, and security.  This document also surveys\n   standard
    activities for vehicular networks.  In addition, this\n   documment surveys the
    use cases of IP-based vehicular networking for\n   ITS.  Finally, this document
    summarizes and analyzes the previous\n   research activities that use IPv4 or
    IPv6 for vehicular networking.\n\n\t "

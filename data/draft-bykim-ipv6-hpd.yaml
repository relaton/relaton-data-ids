  content: "Stateless Autoconfiguration enables IPv6 hosts to send a request for a
    prefix, a network identifier to a router on the subnet.  Using this  ability a
    host can configure its IPv6 address.  Likewise, by defining a way to request for
    a prefix to an upper level router, a router can get a prefix to be assigned to
    its subnet.\n\nThis document describes a protocol for prefix delegation between
    routers.  It allows routers get prefixes from its upstream routers, enabling the
    entire network and its belonging hosts autoconfigure their own addresses.\n\t "

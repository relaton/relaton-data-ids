  content: "   This document specifies extensions to the Entity Attestation Token\n
    \  (EAT) [RFC9248] to support robust, interoperable attestation of\n   capabilities
    in agentic AI systems.  These extensions introduce new\n   claims and guidance
    for securely asserting agent functional,\n   reasoning, and operational capabilities,
    as well as their\n   compositional structure and policy constraints.  The goal
    is to\n   enable trustworthy, verifiable, and privacy-respecting capability\n
    \  attestation for autonomous agents in dynamic, decentralized\n   environments.\n\n\t "

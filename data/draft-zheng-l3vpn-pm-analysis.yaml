  content: "   To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other metrics
    on\n   a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific\n   ingress
    VRF a packet belongs to.  But for L3VPN, multipoint-to-point\n   network model
    applies, flow identifying is a challenge.  This\n   document summarizes the current
    performance monitoring mechanisms for\n   L3VPN in MPLS networks, and analyzes
    various solutions and challenges\n   for measuring performance metrics within
    these networks.  This\n   document also identifies various key points which needs
    to be taken\n   in consideration when designing L3VPN performance monitoring\n
    \  mechanisms.  Performance measurements within non-MPLS L3VPN networks\n   is
    not within the scope of the document.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes techniques for allowing sites running the Locator/ID
    Separation Protocol (LISP) to interoperate with Internet sites that may be using
    either IPv4, IPv6, or both but that are not running LISP.  A fundamental property
    of LISP-speaking sites is that they use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather than
    traditional IP addresses, in the source and destination fields of all traffic
    they emit or receive.  While EIDs are syntactically identical to IPv4 or IPv6
    addresses, normally routes to them are not carried in the global routing system,
    so an interoperability mechanism is needed for non- LISP-speaking sites to exchange
    traffic with LISP-speaking sites.  This document introduces three such mechanisms.
    \ The first uses a new network element, the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (Proxy-ITR),
    to act as an intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP- speaking
    hosts.  Second, this document adds Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality
    to LISP ITRs and LISP Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) to substitute routable IP addresses
    for non-routable EIDs.  Finally, this document introduces the Proxy Egress Tunnel
    Router (Proxy-ETR) to handle cases where a LISP ITR cannot send packets to non-LISP
    sites without encapsulation.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

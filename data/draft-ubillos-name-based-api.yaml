  content: "Today, networked applications typically make use of name-oriented\nnetwork
    abstractions.  There is a myriad of application development\nframeworks who provide
    abstracted APIs allowing applications to refer\nto their peers by name.  These
    abstractions normally only provide\napplication-layer protocol functionality.
    \ They are normally uni-\nlateral solutions, the support for the protocol used
    is implied by\nthe service accessed on the remote peer(s).\n\nWe suggest a unified
    API for networked applications.  Isomorphic to\nthe existing name-based solutions,
    but with added network-related\nfunctionality.  Providing an existing application-layer
    protocols\nwith network features such as mobility, multi-homing, IPv4/IPv6\ninteroperability,
    NAT-traversal and so on...\n\t "

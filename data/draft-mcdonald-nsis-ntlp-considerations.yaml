  content: "A framework for NSIS is in preparation, and will identify a split\ninto
    two layers. The lower layer, referred to as the NSIS Transport\nLayer Protocol
    (NTLP) provides generic support for different types of\npath coupled signalling,
    including QoS signalling. This document\ndiscusses issues to be considered in
    the design of an NSIS Transport\nLayer Protocol (NTLP).\n\n\t "

  content: "   Ever since vendors started deploying TLS 1.0 clients, these clients\n
    \  have had to handle server implementations that do not tolerate the\n   TLS
    version supported by the client, usually by automatically\n   signaling an older
    supported version instead.  Such version rollbacks\n   represent a potential security
    hazard, if the older version should\n   become vulnerable to attacks.  The same
    history repeated when TLS\n   Extensions were introduced, as some servers would
    not negotiate with\n   clients that sent these protocol extensions, forcing clients
    to\n   reduce protocol functionality in order to maintain interoperability.\n\n
    \  This document outlines a procedure to help clients decide when they\n   may
    use version rollback to maintain interoperability with legacy\n   servers, under
    what conditions the clients should not allow version\n   rollbacks, such as when
    the server has indicated support for the TLS\n   Renegotiation Information extension.
    \ The intention of this procedure\n   is to limit the use of automatic version
    rollback to legacy servers\n   and eventually eliminate its use.\n\n\t "

  content: "   HTTP clients rarely make use of the Date header field when making\n
    \  requests.  This document describes considerations for using the Date\n   header
    field in requests.  A method is described for correcting\n   erroneous in Date
    request header fields that might arise from\n   differences in client and server
    clocks.  The risks of applying that\n   correction technique are discussed.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This proposal defines key management approaches for Quantum Safe\n
    \  Cryptographic (QSC) algorithms currently under evaluation in the NIST\n   Post
    Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process.  This includes key\n   identification, key
    serialization, and key compression.  The purpose\n   is to provide guidance such
    that the adoption of quantum-safe\n   algorithms is not hampered with the fragmented
    evolution of necessary\n   key management standards.  Early definition of key
    material standards\n   will help expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms
    at the\n   same time as improving interoperability between implementations and\n
    \  minimizing divergence across standards.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The PCE is a core component of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)\n
    \  systems.\n\n   The PCE has been identified as an appropriate technology for
    the\n   determination of the paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE Label\n   Switched
    Paths (LSPs).\n\n   A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing
    of\n   a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and\n   without
    necessarily completely replacing it.  Thus, the P2MP LSP can\n   be calculated/set
    up/initiated, and the label-forwarding entries can\n   also be downloaded through
    a centralized PCE server to each network\n   device along the P2MP path while
    leveraging the existing PCE\n   technologies as much as possible.\n\n   This document
    specifies the procedures and PCE Communication Protocol\n   (PCEP) extensions
    for using the PCE as the central controller for\n   provisioning labels along
    the path of the static P2MP LSP.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   One of the obstacles to implementing AMT Multicast in a multi-\n   network
    environment is the difficulty an AMT Gateway may have in\n   finding an AMT Relay
    that is optimal.  Optimal in this context means\n   that the AMT Relay has multicast
    connectivity to the Source, and its\n   location minimizes the unicast (tunneled)
    portion of the path to the\n   Gateway.  Blind use of the global anycast address
    specified for AMT\n   Relays in \"Automatic IP Multicast Without Explicit Tunnels
    (AMT)\"\n   (RFC 7450) could result in reaching an AMT Relay that does not have\n
    \  multicast connectivity to the source, which would yield a failure to\n   obtain
    the multicast content; or it could result in reaching an AMT\n   Relay that is
    otherwise less than optimal.  This document proposes a\n   method for implementing
    standard DNS procedures so that an AMT\n   Gateway using normal DNS queries can
    virtually always find the\n   optimal AMT Relay for a given Source..\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A common protocol problem is to want to arrange to maintain client\n
    \  state with little or no local storage.  The usual design pattern here\n   is
    to provide the client with a token which is returned with\n   subsequent interactions.
    \ In order to prevent tampering, forgery, and\n   privacy issues, such tokens
    should be cryptographically protected.\n   This draft describes one workable mechanism
    for constructing such\n   tokens.\n\n\t "

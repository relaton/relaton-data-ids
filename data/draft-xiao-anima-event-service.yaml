- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Event service is an asynchronous communication model between\n   interacting
    parties, e.g. autonomic functions (AFs), instead of a\n   tightly coupled point-to-point
    (P2P) synchronous communication model.\n   Event service enables autonomic nodes
    in ANI to publish data\n   information, which will be made network distributable
    autonomously,\n   and subscribers who register interests to specific events will
    be\n   notified if the information is available. This draft describes how to\n
    \  support event service (ES) for autonomic networking.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a methodology for measurement of the IETF\nIPPM
    WG's one-way IP performance metrics such as one-way delay and\njitter of subpaths
    consisting of a specific end-to-end path in IPv6\nnetwork as well as end-to-end
    one-way IP performance metrics.  The\nmethodology measures one-way IP performance
    metrics in use of IPv6\nsource routing through IPv6 extension headers. Because
    the\nmethodology can contribute to the finding of congested link or\nunderutilized
    link, it can provide important information to\nconfigure and manage IPv6 network.\n\n\n\t "

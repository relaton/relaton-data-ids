- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The \"Encoded Word\" conventions have been used extensively in email\n
    \  headers and elsewhere to permit the encoding of non-ASCII characters\n   where
    only ASCII ones are normally permitted.  The existing\n   specification defines
    only two kinds of encoding, one of which cannot\n   be understood easily by people
    and the other of which has been widely\n   discredited.  This document specifies
    a third encoding that is easily\n   accessible by users and much more closely
    tied to contemporary\n   practices.\n\n   The current version of the proposal
    is intended for possible\n   discussion in the EAI, IRI, and PRECIS WGs to see
    if it sheds light\n   on other issues being discussed in those WGs.  It is not,
    at this\n   point, proposed for adoption.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC5926 specifies cryptographic algorithms for TCP-AO. It explains
    how to use KDF_HMAC_SHA1 and KDF_AES_128_CMAC as KDFs. It also explains how to
    use HMAC-SHA-1-96 and AES-128-CMAC-96 as MAC algorithms. This document specifies
    several new KDFs and MAC algorithms for TCP- AO. The KDFs and MAC algorithms specified
    in this document are based upon more recent, stronger cryptography.</p>"

  content: "Telepresence systems create a \"being there\" conferencing experience.\nA
    number of issues need to be solved largely by manipulating multiple\naudio and
    video streams.  Different systems take different\napproaches, employ different
    techniques, and convey information by\nusing different vocabularies, making interoperability
    extremely\nchallenging.  This problem statement describes the typical issues\nthat
    must be solved and uses examples to illustrate the kind of\ndiversity that makes
    interworking problematic.\n\t "

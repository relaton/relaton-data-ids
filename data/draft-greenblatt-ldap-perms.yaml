  content: "In the current ACL Model draft [2], the kinds of permissions that an \nLDAP
    server understands are limited to those defined in clause \n4.1.1.  Certain LDAP
    integrated applications need to store their own \nApplication Defined Permissions
    (ADP) as well.  For example, \nconsider an application that allows users to perform
    several \ndifferent actions on various types of objects.\n\t "

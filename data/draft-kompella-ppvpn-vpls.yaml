  content: "Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as Transparent LAN\nService,
    and Virtual Private Switched Network service, is a useful\nService Provider offering.
    \ The service offered is a Layer 2 VPN;\nhowever, in the case of VPLS, the customers
    in the VPN are connected\nby a multipoint network, in contrast to the usual Layer
    2 VPNs, which\nare point-to-point in nature.\nThis document describes the functions
    required to offer VPLS, and\nproposes a mechanism for signaling a VPLS, as well
    as for forwarding\nVPLS frames across a packet switched network.\n\t "

  content: "   This memo defines the two artifacts \"voucher\" and \"voucher-\n   revocation\",
    which are YANG-defined structures that have been signed\n   by a TBD algorithm.\n\n
    \  The voucher artifact is generated by the device's manufacture or\n   delegate.
    \ The voucher's purpose is to securely assign one or more\n   devices to an owner.
    \ The voucher informs each device which entity it\n   should consider to be its
    owner.\n\n   The voucher revocation artifact is used by the manufacturer or\n
    \  delegate (i.e.  the issuer of the voucher) to revoke vouchers, if\n   ever
    necessary.  The voucher revocation format defined herein\n   supports both issuer-wide
    and voucher-specific constructs, enabling\n   usage flexibility.\n\n   For both
    artifacts, this memo only defines the artifact, leaving it\n   to future work
    to describe specialized protocols for accessing them.\n\n\t "

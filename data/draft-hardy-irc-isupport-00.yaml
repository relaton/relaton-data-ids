  content: "   IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a long-standing protocol for real-time\n
    \  chatting.  Servers often provide features that are backward\n   compatible
    with older clients, but do not provide a reliable method\n   for making clients
    aware of what extensions exist.  This memo\n   presents a method for servers to
    advertise such extensions to\n   clients.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Class 1 constrained IoT devices, defined in RFC7228, may be\n   unable
    to use certificates within limited RAM.  Exiting enrollment\n   protocols of BRSKI
    are all using certificates.  This document defines\n   a certificateless enrollment
    framework in BRSKI (BRSKI-CLE) for\n   constrained IoT devices.  Considering the
    evolution towards quantum-\n   safe algorithms, the framework is based on Key
    Encapsulation\n   Mechanism (KEM).  Cooperating with the authentication mechanism
    shown\n   in I-D.selander-lake-authz, a constrained IoT device does not need to\n
    \  configure a public key to identify itself for the whole bootstrapping\n   process.
    \ An authentication centre (AC) is used for issuing\n   lightweight credentials,
    such as CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs), to\n   constrained IoT devices.  This document
    does not specify any\n   lightweight credentials.\n\n\t "

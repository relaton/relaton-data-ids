  content: "This memo documents a multicast CDN (Content Delivery Network) issues,
    \n   and describes requirement and discussion points when we solve them. \n   Here,
    we need a method of precise user accounting (logging) of a user \n   activity
    to a multicast group and of user access control to a \n   multicast group to protect
    to subscribe from an illegal access. In \n   this case, it is needed to authorize
    a user access to a multicast \n   group on the CDN, and to get information of
    user action (Join/Leave) \n   to a multicast group. The key is how a control process
    of group \n   membership synchronizes with an AAA process (authentication, \n
    \  authorization and accounting), because we can get a user access \n   information
    at an AAA server. This depends on the network model of \n   the multicast CDN
    service. Last of all, we introduce an example of \n   solution MLDA (Multicast
    Listener Discovery Authentication protocol).\n\t "

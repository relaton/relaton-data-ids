  content: "   In certain scenarios, a BGP router may not require its peer to\n   update
    all routes within an address family, but rather only the\n   specific routes it
    needs. For example, in an EVPN network, a router\n   might only require updates
    for all MAC/IP Advertisement Routes or\n   all IP Prefix Advertisement Routes,
    or even just a subset of IP\n   Prefix routes.\n\n   This document presents a
    method for requesting the update of\n   specific routes from a peer, thereby minimizing
    the impact of\n   additional BGP updates.\n\n\t "

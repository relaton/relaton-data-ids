  content: "This document registers a set of IANA Diameter Command Codes to be used
    in new vendor-specific Diameter applications defined for the Third Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Packet System (EPS).  These new Diameter applications
    are defined for Mobile Management Entity (MME)- and Serving GPRS (General Packet
    Radio Service) Support Node (SGSN)-related interfaces in the architecture for
    the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain, which is also known as the Evolved Packet
    System (EPS).  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   A wide array of information is being carried (or proposed to be\n   carried)
    through BGP peering sessions.  While this information is\n   necessary and valid,
    BGP was not designed to carry blobs of\n   information, but rather network layer
    reachability and information\n   related directly to forwarding traffic from peer
    to peer.  This\n   document proposes a new BGP message type with a well defined\n
    \  structure to use BGP peering sessions for information passed from\n   provider
    to provider along edge peering points, the BGP based Generic\n   transPort (bgpBGP).
    \ This message type is designed to allow any pair\n   of BGP speakers to transfer
    information within an existing session,\n   or for BGP peering semantics to be
    used with multihop sessions\n   between \"information exchange speakers\" within
    an autonomous system.\n   The new message type is designed to provide flexibility
    by allowing\n   the encoding of virtually any information within a BGP session\n
    \  through the use of type-length-vector formatting.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a set of energy efficiency metrics to assess\n
    \  and optimize the energy consumption of data networks.  These metrics\n   enable
    network administrators and designers to identify opportunities\n   for energy
    savings, optimize network performance, and reduce the\n   environmental impact
    of network operations.  The proposed metrics\n   Power Consumption per Data Rate
    (PCDR), Power Usage Effectiveness\n   (PUE), Network Equipment Energy Efficiency
    (NEEE), and Energy\n   Proportionality Coefficient (EPC).\n\n\t "

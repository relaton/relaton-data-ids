- language: en

  content: "   Network Address Translators (NATs) are widely deployed to share\n   scarce
    public IPv4 addresses among multiple end hosts.  They\n   overwrite IP addresses
    and ports in IP packets to do so.  QUIC is a\n   protocol on top of UDP that provides
    transport-like services.  QUIC\n   is better-behaved in the presence of NATs than
    older protocols, and\n   existing UDP NATs should operate without incident if
    unmodified.\n   QUIC offers additional features that may tempt NAT implementers
    as\n   potential optimizations.  However, in practice, leveraging these\n   features
    will lead to new connection failure modes and security\n   vulnerabilities.\n\n\t "

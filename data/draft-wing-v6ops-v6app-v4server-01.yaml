  content: "When an application runs on a host or network that only supports IPv6\n(\"IPv6-only\"),
    it is sometimes necessary that the application\ncommunicate with IPv4 peers.  When
    that communication involves DNS,\nDNS64 and a 6/4 translator works well without
    any changes to most\napplications.  However, when that communication does not
    involve DNS,\nit can require additional features be configured on or programmed\ninto
    the IPv6 application.  This document explains why this\nfunctionality is important
    and describes mechanisms for applications\nto provide such functionality.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Ephemeral Compute Attestation (ECA) protocol,
    which enables ephemeral compute instances to prove their identity without pre-shared
    operational credentials. ECA uses a three-phase ceremony that cryptographically
    combines a public Boot Factor (a high-entropy provisioning value), a secret Instance
    Factor, and a dynamically released Validator Factor to establish attestation evidence.
    The protocol is transport-agnostic and produces Entity Attestation Tokens (EAT)
    for consumption by Relying Parties, such as within automated certificate issuance
    protocols.</p>"

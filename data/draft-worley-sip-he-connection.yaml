  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports multiple transports\n
    \  running both over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.  In more and more cases, a\n   SIP
    user agent (UA) is connected to multiple network interfaces.  In\n   these cases
    setting up a connection from a dual stack client to a\n   dual stack server may
    suffer from the issues described in RFC 6555\n   [RFC6555] (\"Happy Eyeballs\")
    - significant delays in the process of\n   setting up a working flow to a server.
    \ This negatively affects user\n   experience.\n\n   This document builds on RFC
    6555 and explains how a [RFC3261]\n   compliant SIP implementation can minimize
    delays when contacting a\n   host name (obtained by using DNS NAPTR and SRV lookups)
    in a dual\n   stack network using connection-oriented transport protocols.\n\n\t "

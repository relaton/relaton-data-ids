  script: Latn
  content: "Dynamically provisionable optical crossconnects (OXCs) will play an \nactive
    role in future optical networks and the MPL(ambda)S control \nplane will be used
    to establish, teardown, and reroute optical \ntrails through the network.  This
    document specifies extensions to \nRSVP to address some of the unique requirements
    of such optical \ntrails.  Specifically, we propose extensions to RSVP that allow
    an \nupstream node to make a Label suggestion to a downstream node when \nestablishing
    an optical trail and allow both directions of a bi-\ndirectional optical trail
    to be established simultaneously.  A new \nmessage type is also defined so that
    an RSVP node can notify \n(possibly non-adjacent) RSVP nodes when network failures
    occur, \nwithout affecting the RSVP states of intermediate RSVP nodes.  \nFinally,
    we propose a modification to allow bundle messages to be \nsent to non-adjacent
    RSVP nodes.\n\t "

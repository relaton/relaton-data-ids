  content: "     This draft attempts to fill a portion of the gap between DNSSEC\n
    \    deployment expectations and the lack of DNSSEC trust anchor key\n     management
    solutions, protocol and procedural aspects. Specific\n     requirements are stated
    at a level of abstraction that should\n     accommodate solution alternatives
    to the issues of providing trust\n     anchor keys to DNSSEC-aware resolvers,
    and rolling those keys.\n     Nonetheless, the characteristics the DNSSEC protocols
    and the DNS\n     operation contingencies do shape many of the requirements.\n\n\t "

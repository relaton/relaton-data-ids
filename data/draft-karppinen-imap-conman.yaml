  content: "The IMAP4 [RFC-2060] protocol is based on the client-server paradigm\nwhere
    a single client is concerned only with the mail of a single\nuser.  However, due
    to advent of several scenarios where n-tier\ninteraction is desired, the need
    has arisen to work with several\nusers' mail during a single IMAP4 connection.\nIn
    such scenario, a component of a n-tier system may act as an IMAP4\nclient on behalf
    of multiple end-users.  Present examples of this\ninclude many WWW-based email
    services.  Initial profiling suggests\nthat persistent IMAP4 connections can lead
    to a performance increase\nof an order of magnitude when compared to separate
    IMAP4 connections\nper mailbox action.\nThis document defines an extension to
    the IMAP4 protocol that allows\na persistent connection to be established for
    accessing the mail of\nmultiple users. The extension includes a new USERLOGOUT
    command, and\na requirement for a CAPABILITIES response from servers implementing\nthe
    extension.\n\n\t "

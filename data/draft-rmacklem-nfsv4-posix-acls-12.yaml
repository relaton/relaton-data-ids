  content: "   This document describes a potential protocol extension involving the\n
    \  addition of four new attributes to be used by servers to provide\n   support
    for POSIX ACLs.  The term POSIX ACLs refers to the ACL\n   component of the Portable
    Operating System Interface (POSIX) 1003.1e\n   draft 17 document for which sponsorship
    was withdrawn in January\n   1998.  Although the draft POSIX standard that describes
    these ACLs\n   was never ratified, several POSIX-based operating systems, such
    as\n   Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD include support for them.  The NFS Version\n
    \  4 (NFSv4) ACLs described in Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor\n   Version
    1 henceforth referred to as NFSv4 ACLs, use a different model\n   and attempts
    to map between the ACLs of these two models have not\n   been completely successful.
    \ In order to adequately support POSIX\n   ACLs, this document proposes four new
    attributes that may optionally\n   be used by an NFS Version 4, minor version
    2 (NFSv4.2) server to\n   support ACLs that conform to the aforementioned POSIX
    1003.1e draft\n   17.\n\n\t "

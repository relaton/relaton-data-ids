  content: "   A SAID (Self-Addressing IDentifier) is a special type of content\n
    \  addressable identifier based on encoded cryptographic digest that is\n   self-referential.
    \ The SAID derivation protocol defined herein\n   enables verification that a
    given SAID is uniquely cryptographically\n   bound to a serialization that includes
    the SAID as a field in that\n   serialization.  Embedding a SAID as a field in
    the associated\n   serialization indicates a preferred content addressable identifier\n
    \  for that serialization that facilitates greater interoperability,\n   reduced
    ambiguity, and enhanced security when reasoning about the\n   serialization.  Moreover
    given sufficient cryptographic strength, a\n   cryptographic commitment such as
    a signature, digest, or another\n   SAID, to a given SAID is essentially equivalent
    to a commitment to\n   its associated serialization.  Any change to the serialization\n
    \  invalidates its SAID thereby ensuring secure immutability evident\n   reasoning
    with SAIDs about serializations or equivalently their\n   SAIDs.  Thus SAIDs better
    facilitate immutably referenced data\n   serializations for applications such
    as Verifiable Credentials or\n   Ricardian Contracts.\n\n   SAIDs are encoded
    with CESR (Composable Event Streaming\n   Representation) [CESR] which includes
    a pre-pended derivation code\n   that encodes the cryptographic suite or algorithm
    used to generate\n   the digest.  A CESR primitive's primary expression (alone
    or in\n   combination ) is textual using Base64 URL Safe characters.  CESR\n   primitives
    may be round-tripped (alone or in combination) to a\n   compact binary representation
    without loss.  The CESR derivation code\n   enables cryptographic digest algorithm
    agility in systems that use\n   SAIDs as content addresses.  Each serialization
    may use a different\n   cryptographic digest algorithm as indicated by its derivation
    code.\n   This provides interoperable future proofing.  CESR was developed for\n
    \  the [KERI] protocol.\n\n\t "

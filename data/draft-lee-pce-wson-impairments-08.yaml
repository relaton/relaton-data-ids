abstract:
- content: <p>As an optical signal progresses along its path it may be altered by
    the various physical processes in the optical fibers and devices it encounters.
    When such alterations result in signal degradation, these processes are usually
    referred to as "impairments". These physical characteristics may be important
    constraints to consider in path computation process in wavelength switched optical
    networks. This document provides PCEP extensions to support Impairment Aware Routing
    and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in wavelength switched optical networks.</p>

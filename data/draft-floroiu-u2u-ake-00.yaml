  content: "   The present draft describes an user-to-user (u2u) authenticated key\n
    \  exchange mechanism based on the UMTS AKA mechanism [1]. The proposed\n   scheme
    is based on the generation of security tokens (in fact\n   encrypted public Diffie-Hellman
    keys) by the peer's operator. Such a\n   security token along with credential
    information contained within the\n   peer's AKA Authentication Vector (AV) enables
    two communicating peers\n   to securely derive a shared key.\n\t "

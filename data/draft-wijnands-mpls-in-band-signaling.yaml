  content: "When an IP multicast tree needs to pass through an MPLS domain, it is\n
    \  advantageous to map the tree to a Point-to-Multipoint or Multipoint-\n   to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Path.  This document specifies a way to provide a one-one mapping
    between IP multicast trees and Label\n   Switched Paths.  The IP multicast control
    messages are translated\n   into MPLS control messages when they enter the MPLS
    domain, and are\n   translated back into IP multicast control messages at the
    far end of\n   the MPLS domain.  The IP multicast control information is coded
    into\n   the MPLS control information in such a way as to ensure that a single\n
    \  Multipoint Label Switched Path gets set up for each IP multicast\n   tree.\n\t "

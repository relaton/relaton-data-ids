  content: "   As networks expand bridging access, Data Center, and WAN, more\n   networks
    have a central control point for the network elements in one\n   administrative
    domain.  This document defines that network device as\n   central control network
    element (CCNE).  The CCNE can be RR Router,\n   PCE Server, or a federation of
    RR Router and PCE Server, or other\n   devices.  This document describes use cases
    where the CCNE can\n   utilize both these the traditional functions and the programmatic\n
    \  Interface to Routing System (I2RS) to communicate with devices in the\n   network.
    \ The I2RS use cases described in this document encompass:\n   Control IP Network
    by RR Router, Control MPLS TE Network by PCE\n   Server.\n\n   The goal of this
    document is to increase the community's\n   understanding of how CCNE extensions
    fit within the overall I2RS\n   architecture.  It is intended to provide a basis
    for the solutions\n   draft describing the set of interfaces for the CCNE device.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The current work of SIPREC will soon finish.  As its charter defined,\n
    \  SIPREC has covered industries like financial trading floors, contact\n   center
    and emergency service bureaus.  But when talking about\n   products or solutions
    like data or web conferencing, SIPREC is\n   insufficient to record all aspects
    of calls with different\n   interactive media channels.  This draft tries to show
    a use case for\n   web conference recording and show how it can work well under
    SIPREC\n   mechanism.\n\n\n\t "

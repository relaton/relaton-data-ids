  script: Latn
  content: "   The traditional \"castle-and-moat\" security paradigm is no longer\n
    \  effective for some emerging scenarios, such as cloud services, remote\n   workforces
    and intelligent agents.  Zero trust (ZT) has emerged as\n   the new paradigm,
    holding on the \"never trust, always verify\"\n   principle, treats every single
    access request as untrudted and\n   requires veficication.\n\n   While a high-level
    atchitectural guidance exists, notably from NIST\n   in SP 800-207 where thtenants
    of zero trust are well interperated,\n   the industry lacks the open, interoperable
    framework and protocol\n   necessary for building multi-vendor zero trust practice
    enrironment.\n   This document presents the problem statement for zero trust\n
    \  interoperability, outlines the key use cases, and argue for the need\n   for
    standardization in the IETF.  It discusses the possible scope for\n   zero trust
    standardization work in the IETF, identifying which\n   aspects are well suited
    for the IETF protocols and which are better\n   addressed by other bodies.  The
    aim of this document is to initiate a\n   discussion in the IETF community on
    the necessity and prospective of\n   promoting zero trust related work here.\n\n\t "

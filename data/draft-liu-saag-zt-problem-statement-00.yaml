abstract:
- content: <p>The traditional "castle-and-moat" security paradigm is no longer effective
    for some emerging scenarios, such as cloud services, remote workforces and intelligent
    agents. Zero trust (ZT) has emerged as the new paradigm, holding on the "never
    trust, always verify" principle, treats every single access request as untrudted
    and requires veficication. While a high-level atchitectural guidance exists, notably
    from NIST in SP 800-207 where thtenants of zero trust are well interperated, the
    industry lacks the open, interoperable framework and protocol necessary for building
    multi-vendor zero trust practice enrironment. This document presents the problem
    statement for zero trust interoperability, outlines the key use cases, and argue
    for the need for standardization in the IETF. It discusses the possible scope
    for zero trust standardization work in the IETF, identifying which aspects are
    well suited for the IETF protocols and which are better addressed by other bodies.
    The aim of this document is to initiate a discussion in the IETF community on
    the necessity and prospective of promoting zero trust related work here.</p>

  content: "LIN6 is a protocol supporting mobility and multi-homing in IPv6.  LIN6\nintroduces
    the node id, not the interface id, for each node.  Each node\ncan be identified
    by its node id no matter where the node is connected\nand no matter how many interfaces
    the node has.  In the IPv6 layer,\n64-bit node id called LIN6 ID is used while
    128-bit node-id called LIN6\ngeneralized ID is used above the Transport layer.
    \ TCP connections and\nsecurity associations can be preserved even if the node
    moves to another\nsubnet or the node changes the using interface in a multi-homing\nenvironment
    without modifying TCP or IPsec.  In comparison with Mobile\nIPv6, LIN6 has several
    advantages in terms of header overhead and fault\ntolerance.\n\t "

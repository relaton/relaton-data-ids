  content: "   This document provides environment security requirements for the SFC\n
    \  architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent of\n   the
    protocols used for SFC - such as NSH for example.  As a result,\n   the requirements
    provided in this document are intended to provide\n   good security practices
    so SFC can be securely deployed and operated.\n   These security requirements
    are designated as environment security\n   requirements as opposed to the protocol
    security requirements.\n\n\t "

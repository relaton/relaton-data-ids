  content: "   This document describes a mechanism for delivering authenticated\n
    \  telephone call identity information using the VESPER framework in\n   environments
    where SIP signaling is unavailable or unsuitable.  By\n   supporting an out-of-band
    (OOB) transport model, this approach\n   enables entities to publish and retrieve
    signed PASSporT assertions\n   independent of end-to-end delivery within SIP-based
    VoIP networks.\n   These PASSporTs are signed with delegate certificates that
    were\n   authorized for issuance by corresponding authority tokens, which\n   represent
    the trust and validation of telephone number control and\n   related claim information.
    \ Transparency features ensure that these\n   authorizations are publicly auditable
    and cryptographically provable,\n   supporting a higher standard of trust.  This
    document also introduces\n   support for Connected Identity to the STIR OOB model,
    enabling the\n   called party to respond with a signed PASSporT asserting its\n
    \  identity, thereby binding the identities of both parties to the\n   transaction
    and enhancing end-to-end accountability.  The OOB\n   mechanism serves as an alternative
    delivery path for PASSporTs in\n   cases where end-to-end in-band SIP delivery
    is not possible, enabling\n   verifiers to confirm the association between the
    originating\n   telephone number and the identity asserting authority as part
    of the\n   broader VESPER trust framework.\n\n\t "

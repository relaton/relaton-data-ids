  content: "   The DNS Resolving service Discovery Protocol (DRDP) enables to\n   discover
    resolving services available and eventually upgrade to an\n   encrypted resolving
    service.\n\n   DRDP requires a resolving domain or a pointer to a list of resolving\n
    \  domains.  Currently ISP or CPEs do not advertise resolving domain or\n   pointers
    to resolving domains which does not make possible for a DNS\n   client to discover
    potential resolving services - such as encrypted\n   DNS for example - made available
    by the ISP.\n\n   Instead, ISPs or CPE advertise via DHCP the IP address of the
    host\n   with a IA Address Option [RFC3315] and the IP addresses of the\n   resolver
    provided by the ISP with Recursive Name Server option\n   [RFC3646].\n\n   This
    document describes a procedure for a DNS client to derive\n   resolving domains
    from the legacy configuration of the host.\n\n   This is expected to ease the
    deployment of encrypted DNS from ISP as\n   it will enable OS, applications to
    discover resolving service put in\n   place by the ISP even though the CPE has
    not been upgraded.\n\n\t "

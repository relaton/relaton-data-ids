  content: "The International Standard Book Number, ISBN, is a widely used\nidentifier
    for monographic publications.  Since 2001, there has been\na URN (Uniform Resource
    Names) namespace for ISBNs.  The namespace\nregistration was performed in RFC
    3187 and applies to the ISBN as\nspecified in the original ISO Standard 2108-1992.
    \ To allow for\nfurther growth in use, the successor ISO Standard, ISO 2108-2005,
    has\ndefined an expanded format for the ISBN, known as \"ISBN-13\".  This\ndocument
    replaces RFC 3187 and defines how both the old and new ISBN\nstandard can be supported
    within the URN framework and the syntax for\nURNs defined in RFC 2141.  An updated
    namespace registration is\nincluded, which describes how both the old and the
    new ISBN format\ncan share the same namespace.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis draft version
    is the outcome of work started in 2008 and brought\nto the IETF as a contribution
    to a much larger effort to revise the\nbasic URN RFCs, in order to bring them
    in alignment with the current\nURI Standard (STD 63, RFC 3986), ABNF, and IANA
    guidelines, and to\nestablish a modern URN resolution system for bibliographic\nidentifiers.\n\nUntil
    a more specific mailing list is established, comments are\nwelcome on the urn-nid@ietf.org
    mailing list (or sent to the\nauthors).\n\t "

  content: "It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing architecture
    is facing challenges in scalability, mobility, multi-homing, and inter-domain
    traffic engineering.  The Routing Research Group is investigating an alternate
    architecture to meet these challenges.  This document consists of a prioritized
    list of design goals for the target architecture.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "Service providers (ISPs) are interested in reducing the use of IPv4\nin
    their internal networks because of the anticipated exhaustion of\nthe IPv4 address
    space.  Softwires Network Address Translation (SNAT)\ncombines IPv4 NAT and IPv4-in-IPv6
    softwires to carry IPv4 traffic\nthrough the ISP network that uses only IPv6 service.
    \ Multiple\nsubscribers are multiplexed through a single external global IPv4\naddress,
    reducing the total number of IPv4 addresses in use by the\nISP to support Internet
    traffic to those subscribers.\n\t "

  content: "   Current routing mechanism is based on the shortest path, which only\n
    \  take the link status and the path accessibility into consideration,\n   without
    the security of links and forwarding nodes.  As security has\n   become an important
    factor to the user.  This paper proposes to add\n   security factor in the routing
    process.\n\n   With the frequent occurrence of security incidents, services security\n
    \  is an essential demand for the users.  As there are many security\n   devices
    in the ISP's network, this draft proposes secure routing\n   mechanism.  The purpose
    of secure routing is to converge security and\n   routing to ensure the secure
    data transmission.\n\n   The scope is transmission process security, while end-to-end
    security\n   and application layer security are out of scope.\n\n\t "

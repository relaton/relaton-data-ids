  content: "IPv6 Neighbour Discovery does not provide a mechanism which allows a\n
    \  node to match its router solicitations to advertised responses.\n\n   The Nonce
    Neighbour Discovery Option was originally defined for\n   Secured Neighbour Discovery.
    \ This draft describes the use of the\n   Nonce Option for generic router reachability
    testing.\n\t "

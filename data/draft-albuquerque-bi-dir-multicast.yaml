  content: "This document addresses the problem of providing a bi-directional\nmulticast
    protocol in an Intranet environment. A protocol named\nSwitched Bi-directional
    Multicast Protocol (XMP) is proposed.\nParticipants(Sender, S, or Receivers, Rs)signal
    their will to join\nthe group sending a START(G) packet toward a Focal Point Router(FP).\nTo
    take control of transmission a receiver application receives\npermission from
    the master application (the master transmitter)and\nsends a START(G) packet re-labeling
    the involved routers interfaces\nfrom R to S. The master Sender resumes transmission
    by means of his\napplication commanding the receiver's application to go back
    to the\nreceiver mode and emitting a START(G)packet to FP. ns-2 has been used\nto
    simulate it.\n\n\t "

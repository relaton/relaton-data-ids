  content: "This document describes Lemonade requirements for server to client \n
    \  notifications. These server to client notifications provide \n   information
    on crucial changes to a client.   \n    \n   This document does not assume how
    notifications are provided to the \n   clients: the client to server notifications
    may be actively pushed to \n   a client through different mechanisms rather than
    requiring the \n   client to initiate contact to ask for state changes; or they
    may be \n   polled by the client, still avoiding that the client performs full
    \n   state comparisons.\n\t "

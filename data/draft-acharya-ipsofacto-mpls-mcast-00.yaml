  content: "   Multicast  support in  a  MPLS  network has yet   to be  defined. This\n
    \  document discusses both dense-mode and sparse-mode IP multicast within\n   the
    \  context of a MPLS  network.   Unlike unicast routing, dense-mode\n   multicast
    routing trees are established in a data-driven manner and it\n   is  not possible
    \ to   topologically aggregate such  trees,  which are\n   rooted at different
    sources. In sparse-mode multicast, source-specific\n   trees may coexist with
    a core/shared  tree, and it  is not possible to\n   assign a common label to traffic
    from different sources on a branch of\n   the shared tree. This leads  us to suggest
    a per-source traffic-driven\n   label allocation scheme for supporting   all three
    types of  multicast\n   (dense  mode, shared tree,  source  tree)   routing  trees
    in a   MPLS\n   network.\n\n\t "

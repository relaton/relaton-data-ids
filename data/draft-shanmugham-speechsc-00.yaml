  content: "This document describes a proposal for the SPEECHSC protocol and \naims
    to meet the requirements specified in the SPEECHSC working \ngroup requirements
    document. It is based on the Media Resource \nControl Protocol (MRCP) developed
    jointly by Cisco Systems, Inc., \nNuance Communications, and Speechworks Inc.
    \ \n     \nThe SPEECHSC protocol will control media service resources like \nspeech
    synthesizers, recognizers, signal generators, signal \ndetectors, fax servers
    etc. over a network. This protocol depends on \na session management protocol
    such as the Session Initiation \nProtocol (SIP) to establish a separate SPEECHSC
    control session \nbetween the client and the media server. It also depends on
    SIP to \nestablish the media pipe and associated parameters between the media
    \nsource or sink and the media server. Once this is done, the SPEECHSC \nprotocol
    exchange can happen over the control session established \nabove allowing the
    client to command and control the media \nprocessing resources that may exist
    on the media server.  \n\n\t "

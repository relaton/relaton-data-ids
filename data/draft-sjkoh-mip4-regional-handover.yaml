  content: "This document addresses how to support fast handover in regional MIPv4
    \nnetworks (Regional Hanover). The proposed regional handover scheme is \ndesigned
    based on the existing MIPv4 Post-Registration scheme in a \nmore effective way
    that the regional MIPv4 features are exploited. In \nthe proposed regional handover
    scheme, the GFA acts as an anchor FA \nand thus the bi-directional handover tunnels
    are established between \nGFA and nFA, not between oFA and nFA.  \n\t "

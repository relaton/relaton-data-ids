  content: "An important class of location-based services answer the question\n\"What
    instances of this service are closest to me?\"  Examples include\nfinding restaurants,
    gas stations, stores, automated teller machines,\nwireless access points (hot
    spots) or parking spaces.  Currently, the\nLocation-to-Service Translation (LoST)
    protocol only supports mapping\nlocations to a single service based on service
    regions.  This\ndocument describes an extension that allows queries \"N nearest\"
    and\n\"within distance X\".\n\t "

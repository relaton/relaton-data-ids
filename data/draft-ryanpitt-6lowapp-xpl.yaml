- language: en

  content: "This document proposes an Extensible Presentation Language (XPL) and\nXPL
    Type Resolution Protocol to be used as the basis for building\nprotocols in the
    application area addressed by the IETF 6lowpan and\nproposed 6lowApp Working Groups.
    \ This comprises applications for\nhighly resource-constrained devices over wireless
    networks, where the\ndevices are: power-constrained; ubiquitous; potentially very
    small;\nheterogeneous; have very short duty cycles (e.g. 0.1%); and are\ninstalled
    or used for many years on end, e.g. 'smart' electricity\nmeters, electric cars,
    etc.\n\t "

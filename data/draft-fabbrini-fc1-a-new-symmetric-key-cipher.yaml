  content: "   In this paper we describe a symmetric key algorithm that offers an\n
    \  unprecedented grade of confidentiality. Based on the uniqueness of\n   the
    modular multiplicative inverse of a positive integer a modulo n\n   and on its
    computability in a polynomial time, this non-deterministic\n   cipher can easily
    and quickly handle keys of millions or billions of\n   bits that an attacker does
    not even know the length of.\n   The algorithm's primary key is the modulo, while
    the ciphertext is\n   given by the concatenation of the modular inverse of blocks
    of\n   plaintext whose length is randomly chosen within a predetermined\n   range.
    In addition to the full specification here defined, in a\n   related work we present
    an implementation of it in Julia Programming\n   Language, accompanied by real
    examples of encryption and decryption.\n\n\n\t "

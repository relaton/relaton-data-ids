  content: "   This document explores how existing IETF YANG data models,\n   specifically
    the Attachment Circuit (AC)-as-a-Service (ACaaS) and\n   Traffic Engineering (TE)
    topology data models, can be applied to\n   support a use case involving dynamic
    AI model placement at Edge Cloud\n   sites.  The use case involves selecting optimal
    Edge locations for\n   real-time AI inference based on end-to-end network performance\n
    \  between street-level cameras and Edge Cloud compute nodes.  By\n   mapping
    the use case across multiple network segments and applying\n   relevant YANG data
    models to retrieve and request specific services\n   objectives such as bandwidth,
    latency, and reliability, this document\n   serves as a practical exercise to
    evaluate model applicability and\n   identify gaps, if any.\n\n\t "

  content: "OpenPGP specifies message formats and certificate formats used for\nexchange
    of encrypted and/or authenticated objects. This document\ndiscusses methods of
    extending OpenPGP's message formats to support\nan authorization system. This
    system would use public key\ncryptography to authenticate a user to a server and
    establish the\nuser's access permissions. The concept is that the user acquires
    a\nticket signed by some issuer that specifies what they are entitled to\ndo.
    That ticket is then submitted to a server. The server uses a\nchallenge/response
    method to verify that the holder really has the\nmatching private key. The server
    then allows the access specified.\n\t "

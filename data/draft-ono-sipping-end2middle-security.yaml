abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Some services provided by intermediaries depend on the ability to\n
    \  inspect the message bodies in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n   When
    sensitive information is included in these bodies, a SIP User\n   Agent (UA) needs
    to protect it from intermediaries except those that\n   the UA agreed to disclose
    it to.  This document proposes a mechanism\n   for securing information passed
    between an end user and\n   intermediaries using S/MIME.  It also proposes mechanisms
    for an\n   intermediary to notify the UA about its need to inspect an\n   S/MIME-secured
    message body, and to notify the need for the message\n   body to be transmitted
    securely.\n\t "

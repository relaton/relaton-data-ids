  content: "This RFC document envisages the need and necessity in utilizing or\nextending
    the compute resource technologies in such as networking(NW),\nremote computing(RC),cloud
    computing(CC),distributed computing(DC),\nMachine Learning(ML) and other related
    fields of AI to the biological\nfield of electron microscopy(EC) for use in rapid
    and timely\nidentification or diagnosis of virological/bacterial elements in\nclinical
    samples in the current world scenario, within the given\ntime frame irrespective
    of the place of origin and with having\ngeographical presence.\n\nElectron microscopy
    (EM) is a pioneering methodology used in\nidentification and diagnosing of viral
    and microbiological elements.\nIt is able to identify in morphological form the
    tiniest of the\nviruses in minimum amount of time by clinical scientists.\n\n\t "

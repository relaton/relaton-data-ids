  script: Latn
  content: "   Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS\n
    \  and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation.  [RFC7344]\n   automates
    this for DS records by having the child publish CDS and/or\n   CDNSKEY records
    which hold the prospective DS parameters.  Similarly,\n   CSYNC records indicate
    a desired update of the delegation's NS\n   records [RFC7477].  Parent-side entities
    (e.g.  Registries,\n   Registrars) typically discover these records by periodically
    querying\n   them from the child (\"polling\"), before using them to update the\n
    \  delegation's parameters.\n\n   This document specifies that if polling is used,
    parent-side entities\n   MUST ensure that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and
    CSYNC records\n   are consistent across the child's authoritative nameservers,
    before\n   taking any action based on these records.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Market-based allocation of the existing 32-bit address space will offer
    several advantages as unallocated space becomes scarce. Most importantly, addresses
    will be allocated to those who value them most. In addition, address allocations
    will adjust more quickly to changes in network topology or utilization efficiency.
    A registry will still be required, much like a registry of deeds for real estate,
    but the registry would no longer make allocation decisions.\n\t "

  content: "   DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information about\n
    \  both the devices offering services and the devices requesting\n   services.
    \ This information includes host names, network parameters,\n   and possibly a
    further description of the corresponding service\n   instance.  Especially when
    mobile devices engage in DNS Service\n   Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public
    hotspot, a serious privacy\n   problem arises.\n\n   The draft currently progressing
    in the DNS-SD Working Group assumes\n   peer-to-peer pairing between the service
    to be discovered and each of\n   its clients.  This has good security properties,
    but creates scaling\n   issues, because each server needs to publish as many announcements
    as\n   it has paired clients.  This leads to large number of operations when\n
    \  servers are paired with many clients.\n\n   Different designs are possible.
    \ For example, if there was only one\n   server \"discovery key\" known by each
    authorized client, each server\n   would only have to announce a single record,
    and clients would only\n   have to process one response for each server that is
    present on the\n   network.  Yet, these designs will present different privacy
    profiles,\n   and pose different management challenges.  This draft analyses the\n
    \  tradeoffs between privacy and scaling in a set of different designs,\n   using
    either shared secrets or public keys.\n\n\t "

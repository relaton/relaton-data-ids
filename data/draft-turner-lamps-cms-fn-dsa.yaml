abstract:
- content: "<p>The Fast-Fourier Transform over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature
    Algorithm (FN-DSA), as defined by NIST in FIPS 206, is a post-quantum digital
    signature scheme that aims to be secure against an adversary in possession of
    a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). This document specifies
    the conventions for using the FN-DSA signature algorithm with the Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS). In addition, the algorithm identifier is provided.</p>"

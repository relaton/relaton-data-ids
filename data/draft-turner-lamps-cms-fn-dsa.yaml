  content: "   The Fast-Fourier Transform over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature\n
    \  Algorithm (FN-DSA), as defined by NIST in FIPS 206, is a post-quantum\n   digital
    signature scheme that aims to be secure against an adversary\n   in possession
    of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer\n   (CRQC).  This document specifies
    the conventions for using the FN-DSA\n   signature algorithm with the Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS).  In\n   addition, the algorithm identifier is provided.\n\n\t "

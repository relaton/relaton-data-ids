  script: Latn
  content: "   The RFC Series has evolved to allow for the use of non-ASCII\n   characters
    in RFCs.  While English remains the required language of\n   the Series, the encoding
    of RFCs is now in UTF-8, allowing for a\n   broader range of characters than typically
    used in the English\n   language.  This document describes requirements and guidelines
    for\n   the RFC Production Center regarding the use of non-ASCII characters\n
    \  in RFCs.\n\n   This document updates RFC 7997 to reflect changes in the practices
    of\n   the RFC series since RFC 7997 was published, and makes further\n   changes
    based on agreements in the IETF community about what\n   characters are allowed
    in RFCs.\n\n   [ A repository for this draft can be found here (https://github.com/\n
    \  paulehoffman/7997bis). ]\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: '<p>OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), as defined in RFC 9396,
    provides a mechanism for clients to request fine-grained, structured authorization
    details. However, in emerging ecosystems of collaborating AI agents and long-running
    automated tasks, two critical authorization dimensions remain implicit: the required
    security assurance level of the authorization policy and the strict binding of
    authorization lifetime to a task''s lifecycle. This document extends the "authorization_details"
    object of RAR by introducing two new members: "policy_context" and "lifecycle_binding".
    The "policy_context" member allows a client to explicitly request that the authorization
    be evaluated and granted under a specific policy assurance level, mitigating policy
    downgrade attacks and enhancing user consent. The "lifecycle_binding" member enables
    the validity of an authorization grant to be tied directly to the state of an
    external entity, such as an automated task, ensuring permissions are automatically
    and immediately revoked upon task completion. These extensions provide a standardized
    way to achieve more secure, transparent, and context-aware authorization in complex,
    automated environments.</p>'

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the security requirements and
    mechanisms considered for delay tolerant networking security. It discusses the
    options for protecting such networks and describes reasons why specific security
    mechanisms were (or were not) chosen for the relevant protocols. The entire document
    is informative, given its purpose is mainly to document design decisions.</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "   Some clients on the Internet make inferences about the administrative\n
    \  relationships among servers on the Internet based on the domain names\n   of
    those servers.  Perhaps unfortunately, it is not currently\n   possible to detect
    the real administrative boundaries in the DNS, and\n   therefore such inferences
    can go wrong in several ways.  Mitigation\n   strategies deployed so far will
    not scale.  The solution to this is\n   to provide a way to make an explicit assertion
    about the\n   relationships between different domain names and perhaps the services\n
    \  provided at them.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The 'Age' response-header field in HTTP/1.1 [RFC 2068] is intended to
    provide a lower-bound for the estimation of a response message's age (time since
    generation) by explicitly indicating the amount of time that is known to have
    passed since the response message was retrieved or revalidated.  However, there
    has been considerable controversy over when the Age header field should be added
    to a response.  This document explains the issues and provides a set of proposed
    changes for the revision of RFC 2068.\n\t "

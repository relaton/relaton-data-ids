  content: "This draft makes comparisons of various multi-area TE methods, which are
    \nevaluated against specific criteria.  Four basic path selection \napproaches
    are compared: a) distributed methods, \nb) path-computation-server (PCS) methods
    (centralized & distributed),\nc) interarea-flooding methods, and d) multiple-path-compare
    methods.  \nThese approaches include needs to support PCS functionality, query
    \nfunctionality, crankback functionality, summary-te-LSA functionality, \nand
    TE feedback functionality.  The target is to converge on a reduced \nsubset of
    required multi-area TE methods and protocol extensions.\n\n\t "

  content: "While an IPv6 site is being renumbered, both DHCPv6 and ND may be\nused
    to reconfigure the host addresses. This may cause potential\naddress configuration
    conflicts during renumbering procedure. The\nissue mainly include two situations:
    a) Address configuration method\nconflict, which means a host receives a new prefix
    comes from another\naddress configuration protocol. b) Address prefix conflict,
    a host\nreceives both DHCPv6 and ND address configuration messages which\nassign
    different address prefixes. This documents analyzes the\nconflict issues and proposes
    a conflict report mechanism for hosts to\nreport the conflicts to DHCPv6 servers.\n\t "

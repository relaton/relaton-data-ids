  script: Latn
  content: "RFC5648 extends MIPv6 with the ability for a Mobile Node to register\nMultiple
    Care-of Addresses with its Home Agent and Correspondent\nNode(s).  RFC 5648 also
    introduces the notion of a Home Binding that\nis essentially a binding on the
    Home Link, where the Care-of Address\nis set to the Home Address of the Mobile
    Node.  A Mobile Node uses\nsuch a Home Binding together with one or more Multiple
    Care-of\nAddress binding(s) to be able to use simultaneously both the Home\nLink
    and one or more visited link(s).  The description of the Home\nBinding in a section
    of RFC 5846 entitled \"Returning Home:\nSimultaneous Home and Visited Link Operation\"
    seems to imply that a\nHome Binding can only be legitimately created while returning
    home\nand maintaining simultaneous bindings on one or more visited link(s).\nThere
    is however no specific reason to prevent creation of such a\nHome Binding when
    the Mobile Node is only attached to the Home Link\nand does not have any interface
    attached to a visited link.\nMoreover, there is a specific use case for the creation
    of such a\nLone Home Binding.  This specification explicits the use case for\ncreation
    of a Lone Home Binding, and clarifies the protocol behavior\nof Mobile IPv6 nodes
    (Mobile Node, Home Agent, Correspondent Node)\ninvolved with its creation.\n\t "

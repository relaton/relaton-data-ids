  content: "   This document describes how Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are\n   typically
    managed, in terms of pre-deployment management, as well as\n   rationale and means
    of monitoring and management of MANET routers\n   running the routing protocol
    OLSRv2 and its constituent protocol\n   NHDP.  Apart from pre-deployment management
    for setting up IP\n   addresses and security related credentials, OLSRv2 only
    needs routers\n   to agree one single parameter (called \"C\").  Other parameters
    for\n   tweaking network performance may be determined during operation of\n   the
    network, and need not be the same in all routers.  This, using\n   MIB modules
    and related management protocols such as SNMP (or\n   possibly other, less \"chatty\",
    protocols).  In addition, for\n   debugging purposes, monitoring data and performance
    related counters\n   can be sent to the Network Management Station (NMS) via standardized\n
    \  management protocols.\n\n\t "

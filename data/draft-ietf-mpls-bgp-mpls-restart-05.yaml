  content: "A mechanism for BGP that helps minimize the negative effects on routing
    caused by BGP restart has already been developed and is described in a separate
    document (\"Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP\"). This document extends this
    mechanism to minimize the negative effects on MPLS forwarding caused by the Label
    Switching Router's (LSR's) control plane restart, and specifically by the restart
    of its BGP component when BGP is used to carry MPLS labels and the LSR is capable
    of preserving the MPLS forwarding state across the restart.\n\n The mechanism
    described in this document is agnostic with respect to the types of the addresses
    carried in the BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) field. As such,
    it works in conjunction with any of the address families that could be carried
    in BGP (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, etc.). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   For privacy reasons, encrypted DNS clients need to be anonymous to\n
    \  their encrypted DNS servers to prevent third parties from correlating\n   client
    DNS queries with other data for surveillance or data mining\n   purposes.  However,
    there are cases where the client and server have\n   a pre-existing relationship
    and each peer wants to prove its identity\n   to the other.  For example, an encrypted
    DNS server may only wish to\n   accept resolutions from encrypted DNS clients
    that are managed by the\n   same enterprise.  This requires mutual authentication.\n\n
    \  This document defines when using client authentication with encrypted\n   DNS
    is appropriate, the benefits and limitations of doing so, and the\n   recommended
    authentication mechanism(s) when communicating with TLS-\n   based encrypted DNS
    protocols.\n\n\t "

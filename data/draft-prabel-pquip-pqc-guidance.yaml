  content: "   This document provides general information (such as parameter sizes,\n
    \  security assumptions, and targeted security models) on a range of\n   widely
    studied post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, including Key\n   Encapsulation
    Mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature schemes.\n\n   The cryptographic schemes
    described in this document are among those\n   recommended by major security agencies
    and/or standardization bodies,\n   and are believed to be secure against Cryptographically
    Relevant\n   Quantum Computer (CRQC).\n\n   The goal of this document is to offer
    a high-level overview of these\n   schemes and their distinguishing features,
    to help implementers,\n   protocol designers, standards developers, and policymakers
    in\n   understanding and selecting appropriate post-quantum cryptographic\n   primitives
    for use in protocols and systems.\n\n   By aggregating and presenting this information
    in a unified format,\n   this document aims to facilitate informed decision-making
    and\n   interoperability during the migration to post-quantum cryptography,\n
    \  and to encourage consistent practices when evaluating and deploying\n   Post-Quantum
    Cryptography (PQC) schemes in cryptographic protocols.\n\n\t "

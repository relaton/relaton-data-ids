  content: "The current Mobile IPv6 and NEMO specifications support IPv6 only.\n   This
    specification extends those standards to allow the registration\n   of IPv4 addresses
    and prefixes, respectively, and the transport of\n   both IPv4 and IPv6 packets
    over the tunnel to the HA. This\n   specification also allows the Mobile Node
    to roam over both IPv6 and\n   IPv4, including the case where Network Address
    Translation is present\n   on the path between the mobile node and its home agent.\n\t "

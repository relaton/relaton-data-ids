  content: "This document describes a mechanism for discovering inter-FE topology,
    \ntopology maintenance in Intra-NE. Such a mechanism is essential for \nall these
    elements in the set to behave as a single Network Element, \nas required by the
    ForCES architecture as well as to perform certain \noptimizations at the FE by
    making use of the topology. The mechanism \nonly operates during post-association
    phase of ForCES protocol. \n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes Best Current Practices (BCP) for improving
    meaningful connectivity and digital sovereignty through the circular management
    of end-user and network devices. It addresses a foundational but often overlooked
    dependency of Internet access deployments: the availability, repairability, governance,
    and lifecycle management of devices required to meaningfully use access networks.
    Based on operational experience from deployments in Spain, Argentina, and Senegal—including
    eReuse.org, EKOA/UNLP, Solidança, TAU/RAEE, and Hahatay—this document identifies
    practices that have demonstrated positive access, social, and environmental outcomes.
    These practices complement research within the IRTF GAIA Research Group by documenting
    reproducible operational approaches that increase the sustainability, autonomy,
    and long-term viability of Internet access in underserved contexts, and therefore
    contribute to facilitate "the unconnected" to connect.</p>'

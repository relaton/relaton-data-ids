  content: "   This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise\n
    \  Equipment (CPE) can have a balanced security policy that allows for a\n   mostly
    end-to-end connectivity while keeping the major threats\n   outside of the home.
    \ It is documenting an existing IPv6 deployment\n   by Swisscom and allows all
    packets inbound/outbound EXCEPT for some\n   layer-4 ports where attacks and vulnerabilities
    (such as weak\n   passwords) are well-known.  The policy is a proposed set of
    rules\n   that can be used as a default setting.  The set of blocked inbound\n
    \  and outbound ports is expected to be updated as threats come and go.\n\n\t "

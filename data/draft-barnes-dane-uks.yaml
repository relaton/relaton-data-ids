  content: "   Unknown key-share attacks are a class of attacks that allow an\n   attacker
    to deceive one peer of a secure communication as to the\n   identity of the remote
    peer.  When used with traditional, PKI-based\n   authentication, TLS-based applications
    are generally safe from\n   unknown key-share attacks.  DNS-based Authentication
    of Named\n   Entities (DANE), however, proposes that applications perform a\n
    \  different set of checks as part of authenticating a TLS connection.\n   As
    a result, DANE as currently specified is likely to lead to unknown\n   key-share
    attacks when clients support DANE for authentication.  We\n   describe these risks
    and some simple mitigations.\n\n\t "

  content: "RFC1122 [1] introduced a ``Requirements Summary'' format,\n        to
    help implementors understand what aspects of a lengthy\n        specification
    were mandatory, recommended, or optional.\n        The HTTP/1.1 specification
    is similarly lengthy and\n        complicated; many implementors have asked for
    guidance in\n        understanding what they need to do.  The latest draft\n        revision
    of the HTTP/1.1 specification [2] has a\n        placeholder section for a ``Requirements
    Summary'', but\n        there has been relatively little discussion of the format\n
    \       and content of this summary in the HTTP working group.\n        This document
    proposes a specific format for the summary,\n        and gives an example summary
    for one section of the\n        document.\n\t "

  content: "Upon establishing a new link-layer connection, a host determines\n   whether
    a link change has occurred to examine the validity of its IP\n   configuration.
    \ This draft presents a way to robustly check for link\n   change without assuming
    changes to the routers.  Each link can be\n   uniquely identified by the set of
    prefixes assigned to it.  We\n   propose that, at each attached link, the host
    generates the complete\n   prefix list, that is, the prefix list contains all
    the prefixes on\n   the link, and when it receives a hint that indicates a possible
    link\n   change, it detects the identity of the currently attached link by\n   consulting
    the existing prefix list.  This memo describes how to\n   generate the complete
    prefix list and to robustly detect the link\n   identity even in the presence
    of packet losses.\n\t "

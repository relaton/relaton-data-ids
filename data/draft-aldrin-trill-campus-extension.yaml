  content: "   This document presents a solution suite for TRILL campuses to be\n
    \  connected over WAN networks. TRILL protocol is primarily designed to\n   work
    within intra-data centers. Connecting different sites over WAN\n   using overlay
    tunnel protocols is the primary method employed at\n   present. Though this presents
    a simple mechanisms to extend TRILL\n   campuses over WAN networks, it also brings
    in the problem of\n   scalability for TRILL nicknames exchanged between sites,
    latency,\n   duplication of traffic etc. This draft proposes a way to extend the\n
    \  TRILL sites without having the WAN network aware of TRILL campus\n   network
    and its topology. This document details on how to extend\n   TRILL campus sites
    and to establish connections between various sites\n   without having to exchange
    entire TRILL campus information, thus\n   reducing the information flow to the
    required sites only. This\n   document do not add or define datacenter interconnect
    protocol.\n\n\t "

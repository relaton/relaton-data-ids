  content: "   The DNS Zone Version (ZONEVERSION) extended is a way to get\n   information
    about the version of a DNS in the backend.  For example\n   when a DNSSEC signer
    for a zone generates a new SOA serial, because\n   it has created new RRSIG records,
    the original data has not changed,\n   but this is not visible to anyone looking
    at the zone.  This document\n   will make it possible show the zone information
    which is the base of\n   the presented data.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Bluetooth protocol suite defines a set of security mechanisms between\n
    \  its devices. All the authentication procedure is based on the\n   knowledge
    of a shared secret called PIN. Bluetooth suggests to use\n   systems such as Diffie-Hellman
    method or others else to initiate the\n   PIN between two unknown devices. This
    draft proposes a simple\n   mechanism that help two entities already presented
    to an AAA\n   infrastructure share the PIN and start secured Bluetooth\n   communications
    with Bluetooth Security protocols.\n\t "

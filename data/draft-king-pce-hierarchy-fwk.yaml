  content: "Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across\nmultiple
    domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLS\nnetworks presents a problem
    because no single point of path\ncomputation is aware of all of the links and
    resources in each\ndomain. A solution may be achieved using the Path Computation\nElement
    (PCE) architecture.\n\nWhere the sequence of domains is known a priori, various
    techniques\ncan be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains are\nsimply-connected,
    or if the preferred points of interconnection are\nalso known, the Per-Domain
    Path Computation technique can be used.\nWhere there are multiple connections
    between domains and there is\nno preference for the choice of points of interconnection,
    the\nBackward Recursive Path Computation Procedure (BRPC) can be used to\nderive
    an optimal path.\n\nThis document examines techniques to establish the optimum
    path when\nthe sequence of domains is not known in advance. The document\nshows
    how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow the optimum\nsequence of domains
    to be selected, and the optimum end-to-end path\nto be derived through the use
    of a hierarchical relationship between\ndomains.\n\t "

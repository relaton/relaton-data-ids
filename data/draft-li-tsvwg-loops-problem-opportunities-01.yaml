  content: "   Various overlay tunnels are used in networks including WAN,\n   enterprise
    campus and others.  End to end paths are partitioned into\n   multiple segments
    using overlay tunnels to achieve better path\n   selection, lower latency and
    so on.  Traditional end-to-end transport\n   layers respond to packet loss slowly
    especially in long-haul\n   networks: They either wait for some signal from the
    receiver to\n   indicate a loss and then retransmit from the sender or rely on\n
    \  sender's timeout which is often quite long.\n\n   LOOPS (Localized Optimization
    of Path Segments) attempts to provide\n   non end-to-end local based in-network
    recovery to achieve better data\n   delivery by making packet loss recovery faster.
    \ In an overlay\n   network scenario, LOOPS can be performed over the existing,
    or\n   purposely created, overlay tunnel based path segments.\n\n   This document
    illustrates the slow packet loss recovery problems\n   LOOPS tries to solve in
    some use cases and analyzes the impacts when\n   local in-network recovery is
    employed as a LOOPS mechanism.\n\n\t "

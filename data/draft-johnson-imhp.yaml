  content: "This document specifies the Internet Mobile Host Protocol (IMHP), which
    allows transparent routing of IP packets to mobile hosts in the Internet, while
    using only the mobile host's 'home' IP address. No changes are required in stationary
    hosts that communicate with mobile hosts, and no changes are required in mobile
    hosts above the IP level.  IMHP quickly converges to optimal routing following
    the movement of a mobile host, while maintaining the 'weak security' model of
    today's Internet.           The views and conclusions contained in this document
    are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the Mobile
    IP Working Group or the IETF.  It is our hope to better explain the issues and
    to stimulate discussion, in order to assist the Working Group in its efforts to
    develop a single Group draft protocol specification.  This document has not been
    approved by the Mobile IP Working Group.\n\t "

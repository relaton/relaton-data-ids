  content: "   In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware\n   internetworking
    architecture has two important properties: it exposes\n   the properties of available
    Internet paths to endpoints, and provides\n   for endpoints and applications to
    use these properties to select\n   paths through the Internet for their traffic.
    \ While this property of\n   \"path awareness\" already exists in many Internet-connected
    networks\n   within single domains and via administrative interfaces to the\n
    \  network layer, a fully path-aware internetwork expands these concepts\n   across
    layers and across the Internet.\n\n   This document poses questions in path-aware
    networking open as of\n   2021, that must be answered in the design, development,
    and\n   deployment of path-aware internetworks.  It was originally written to\n
    \  frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking proposed Research\n   Group
    (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in\n   this space.\n\n\t "

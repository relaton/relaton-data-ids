  content: "As the Internet has evolved, many types of arrangements have been advertised
    and sold as \"Internet connectivity\".  Because these may differ significantly
    in the capabilities they offer, the range of options, and the lack of any standard
    terminology, the effort to distinguish between these services has caused considerable
    consumer confusion.  This document provides a list of terms and definitions that
    may be helpful to providers, consumers, and, potentially, regulators in clarifying
    the type and character of services being offered.  This document specifies an
    Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a standard form for digital certificates and\n
    \  access control lists.  These structures bind either names or\n   authorizations
    to keys or names that resolve to keys.  The name and\n   authorization structures
    can be used separately or together.  We use\n   S-expressions as the standard
    format for these certificates and\n   define a canonical form for those S-expressions.\n
    \n   These structures are also known under the name SDSI 2.0.\n\n\t "

  content: "    This document describes the use cases and related requirements of\n
    \   Massive Data Transmission（MDT）in High Bandwidth-delay Product (BDP)\n    Network.
    The MDT framework enables efficient use of nighttime idle\n    bandwidth to provide
    services such as same-day or next-day delivery.\n    To meet these objectives,
    the system introduces a terminal-driven\n    intelligent parameter optimization
    method that adjusts local\n    configurations (e.g., disk I/O, NIC bandwidth,
    TCP buffer) to match\n    transmission goals. This document outlines the end-to-end\n
    \   architecture and key mechanisms including service identification and\n    traffic
    statistics, network layer load balancing, transmission\n    protocol optimization,
    collaboration between terminal APP, network\n    device and controller, etc.\n\n\t "

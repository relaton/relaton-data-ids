  content: "The purpose of this document is to provide information to the  gen-\neral
    Internet community regarding security expectations of Internet Ser-\nvice Providers
    (ISPs).\n \nIt is not the intent of this document to define a set  of  require-\nments
    \ that would be appropriate for all ISPs, but rather to provide the\ncommunity
    with a framework for discussion of security expectations  with\ncurrent and prospective
    service providers.\n\nThis document is written from  the  perspective  of  the
    \ consumer.\nCompanion documents provide information from the ISP perspective.\n\t "

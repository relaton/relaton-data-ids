  content: "   The purpose of this draft is to document two implementations which\n
    \  implemented parts of PvD architecture document.  One implementation\n   was
    done from scratch (PvD-manager) while another is a part of an\n   existing component
    (NetworkManager).  The implementation of server\n   component was also done but
    only in IPv6 router.  DHCP was ignored\n   due to IPR claims.\n\n\t "

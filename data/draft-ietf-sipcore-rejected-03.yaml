  content: "   This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code.  This\n
    \  response code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary\n   rejected
    their call attempt.  The call will not be answered.  As a\n   6xx code, the caller
    will be aware that future attempts to contact\n   the same UAS will likely fail.
    \ The present use case driving the need\n   for the 608 response code is when
    the intermediary is an analytics\n   engine.  In this case, the rejection is by
    a machine or other\n   process.  This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response
    code,\n   which a human at the target UAS indicated the call was not wanted.\n
    \  In some jurisdictions this distinction is important.  This document\n   also
    defines the use of the Call-Info header in 608 responses to\n   enable rejected
    callers to contact entities that blocked their calls\n   in error.  This provides
    a remediation mechanism for legal callers\n   that find their calls blocked.\n\n\t "

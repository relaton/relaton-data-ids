  content: Virtual interface for supporting multihoming and inter technology handover

  content: "The Proxy Mobile IPv6 supports a mobile node to perform inter-\ntechnology
    handover as well as multihoming.  However the inter-\ntechnology handover requires
    the new interface to use the same\nnetwork prefix with the old one and all the
    IP address/prefix at the\nold interface are removed.  These requirements disable
    multihoming\nfunction which requires different network prefixes for different\ninterfaces.
    \ In this Internet draft we address this problem and\nsuggest the necessary changes
    in PMIPv6 operations to support a\nmobile node to perform multihoming as well
    as seamless inter\ntechnology handover with virtual interface.\n\t "

  content: "   This documents covers issues of spam reporting by the general public.\n\n
    \  The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was originally developed for use by\n   large
    operators.  However, abuse reporting is also useful for medium\n   and small operators.
    \ The need to automate abuse reporting originates\n   from the volume of spam,
    not the size of the operators.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines the use of ROHC header compression mechanisms \nfor
    the NEMO Basic Support protocol [7]. The idea is to use both NEMO \nand ROHC as
    they have been defined. In the NEMO Basic Support \nprotocol, the tunneling between
    the Mobile Router (MR) and the Home \nAgent (HA) of the MR is done over different
    access technologies. Some \nof these technologies are wireless (e.g. Wireless
    LAN, 3G or PPP) and \nhave scarce resources by nature, the use of  ROHC compression
    can be \nuseful to reduce the bandwidth consumption.\n\t "

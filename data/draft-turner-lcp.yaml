  content: "The Lightweight Currency Protocol (LCP) is a framework for creating\nlightweight
    currencies to be used by applications that rely on market \nforces for the allocation
    of scarce resources, or rely on incentives \nfor the creation and operation of
    desirable services that would be \notherwise impractical or infeasible through
    the use of real-world \ncurrencies.\n\t "

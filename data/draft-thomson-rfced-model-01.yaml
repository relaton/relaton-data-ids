- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The finishing process for a document that is approved for publication\n
    \  as an RFC currently involves a somewhat detailed and lengthy process.\n   The
    system that executes that process involves a number of different\n   actors, each
    bringing competency with different aspects of the\n   overall process.  Ensuring
    that this process functions smoothly is\n   critical to the mission of the organizations
    that publish documents\n   in the RFC series.\n\n   This document proposes a framework
    for that system that aims to\n   provide clear delineations of accountability
    and responsibility for\n   each of the actors in this system.\n\n\t "

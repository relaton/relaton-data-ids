  content: "   Providing an early implementation report is important in order to\n
    \  help validating a standard before its finalization. This document\n   describes
    the lessons learnt while implementing both an IPFIX probe\n   and collector. Its
    goals are manifold and include feedback to the\n   IPFIX working group, in addition
    to suggestions for tackling open\n   protocol issues that can be addressed in
    future IPFIX drafts.\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This\n
    \  openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but\n   it
    can allow bad communications as well as good.  Thus, as the\n   Internet has grown,
    so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact\n   of abusive or illegal communications.
    \ Recently, there has been an\n   increasing emphasis on \"blocking\", the active
    prevention of abusive\n   or illegal communications.  This document examines several
    technical\n   approaches to Internet service blocking in terms of their fit with\n
    \  the overall Internet architecture.  In general, the approach to\n   service
    blocking that is most coherent with the Internet architecture\n   is to inform
    endpoints about bad services, so that the communicants\n   can avoid engaging
    in abusive or illegal communications.\n\n\t "

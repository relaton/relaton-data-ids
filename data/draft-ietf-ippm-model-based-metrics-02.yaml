  content: "   We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine\n
    \  if an end-to-end Internet path can meet predefined transport\n   performance
    targets by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive subpaths.
    \ The subpath-at-a-time tests are designed to\n   accurately detect if any subpath
    will prevent the full end-to-end\n   path from meeting the specified target performance.
    \ Each IP\n   diagnostic test consists of a precomputed traffic pattern and a\n
    \  statistical criteria for evaluating packet delivery.\n\n   The IP diagnostics
    tests are based on traffic patterns that are\n   precomputed to mimic TCP or other
    transport protocol over a long path\n   but are independent of the actual details
    of the subpath under test.\n   Likewise the success criteria depends on the target
    performance and\n   not the actual performance of the subpath.  This makes the\n
    \  measurements open loop, eliminating nearly all of the difficulties\n   encountered
    by traditional bulk transport metrics.\n\n   This document does not fully define
    diagnostic tests, but provides a\n   framework for designing suites of diagnostics
    tests that are tailored\n   the confirming the target performance.\n\n   By making
    the tests open loop, we eliminate standards congestion\n   control equilibrium
    behavior, which otherwise causes every measured\n   parameter to be sensitive
    to every component of the system.  As an\n   open loop test, various measurable
    properties become independent, and\n   potentially subject to an algebra enabling
    several important new\n   uses.\n\n   Interim DRAFT Formatted: Fri Feb 14 14:07:33

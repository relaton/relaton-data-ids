  content: "   Answering DNSKEY/CDS/CDNSKEY queries in an [RFC8901] multi-signer\n
    \  DNSSEC configuration requires all operators to serve not only their\n   own
    public key information, but also include each other's public\n   keys.  This ensures
    that clients obtain a consistent view of the\n   DNSSEC configuration regardless
    of who is answering a given query.\n   In order to enable operators to import
    the keys needed for assembling\n   these responses, a method for discovering them
    is necessary.\n\n   This document specifies how DNS operators can announce which
    are the\n   keys they intend to use for signing a given zone (DNSKEY) and which\n
    \  keys are designated for secure entry into the zone (CDS/CDNSKEY).  It\n   further
    introduces the CNS record type to facilitate proactive\n   discovery of the aforementioned
    signals.  Taken together, these parts\n   function as an authenticated multi-signer
    key-exchange (MSKE) scheme.\n\n   This MSKE mechanism uses the signaling mechanism
    introduced in\n   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping] to complete the automated\n
    \  workflows described in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dnssec-automation].\n\n\t "

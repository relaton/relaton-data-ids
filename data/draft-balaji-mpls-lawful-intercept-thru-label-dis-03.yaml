abstract:
- content: "<p>In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful Intercept is a key requirement.
    For example, MPLS-based Layer 3 VPN models do not have any provider provisioned
    methods of lawful intercept that are comprehensive, quick and easy to provision
    from one single point. More particularly the auto-provisioning of lawful intercept
    for all sets of streams travelling between VPN sites and consequent re-direction
    of these streams to the appropriate government network has not been covered without
    multiple instances of having to configure the intercept at various points in the
    network both in the Single-AS case and the Inter-Provider VPN case. In this paper,
    we propose a technique which uses a set of pre-defined labels called Lawful Intercept
    labels and a method for provisioning lawful intercept amongst the various PE devices
    using these labels both in the Single-AS and the inter-provider VPN cases. A single
    point of action is the key to this idea. The intercepted traffic is mirrored on
    a PE or a whole set of PEs or on all the PEs participating in the VPN. A technique
    called the Domino-effect provisioning of these Label-based Provider Provisioned
    Lawful Intercept mechanism is also outlined.</p>"

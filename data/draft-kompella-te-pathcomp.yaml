  content: "This draft presents some notes on Constraint-Based Routing.  The main\npurpose
    is to standardize the terminology used, and define the\nsemantics of the various
    constructs used in Constraint-Based Routing\nso that implementations from a wide
    variety of vendors will have (at\nleast to the first order) similar results in
    path selection.  A\nsecondary goal is to define the semantics of optimization,
    which we\ndefine as the recalculation of routes that have already been computed\nand
    established.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In confidential computing, device assignment (DA) is the method by\n
    \  which a device (e.g., network adapter, GPU), whether on-chip or\n   behind
    a PCIe Root Port, is assigned to a Trusted Virtual Machine\n   (TVM).  For the
    TVM to trust an assigned device, the device must\n   provide the TVM with attestation
    Evidence confirming its identity and\n   the state of its firmware and configuration.\n\n
    \  Since Evidence claims can be processed by 3rd party entities (e.g.,\n   Verifiers,
    Relying Parties) external to the TVM, there is a need to\n   standardize the representation
    of DA-related information in Evidence\n   to ensure interoperability.  This document
    defines an attestation\n   Evidence format for DA as an EAT (Entity Attestation
    Token) profile.\n\n\t "

  content: "This is a very simple strawman protocol for agents to request NAT \naddress
    translations and firewall pinholes from a middlebox. This \nprotocol uses the
    underlying transport for reliability and to avoid \nreinventing TCP.  This protocol
    does not use an existing protocol \nlike COPS, SOAP, HTTP or DIAMETER as these
    protocols include \nsignificant complexity that is not required to solve the middlebox
    \nproblem.\n\t "

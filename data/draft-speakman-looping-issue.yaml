  content: "This document describes the routing loop and packet looping issues in\nmobile
    ad hoc network (MANET) running proactive routing protocols\nusing hop count metric.\n\nMechanisms
    of loop formation are identified and how the problem of\nloop formation is exacerbated
    by the use of Link Layer Notification\nis described.  The effect of the looping
    packets on the network are\nshown by comparing against the case where the looping
    packets are\ndetected and discarded, showing the need for routing loops or looping\npackets
    to be dealt with in MANETs.\n\t "

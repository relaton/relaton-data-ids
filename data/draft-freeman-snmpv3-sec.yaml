  content: "     This document presents simpler and more secure architectures for\n
    \   SNMPv3 agents than the ones specified in RFCs 2271-2275.  Agent\n    security
    is improved by restricting each module's access to data,\n    using the 'principle
    of least privilege'.  The new agent\n    architectures are analyzed in terms of
    software complexity as\n    well as security, and are shown in some respects to
    be simpler.\n\n\t "

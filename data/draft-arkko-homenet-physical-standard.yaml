  content: "   Support for network technology in buildings varies greatly depending\n
    \  on the age of the building, but the ease of building a home network\n   is
    also highly dependent on the chosen wiring, power, and equipment\n   space designs.
    \ As networking technology evolves at a fast pace, it\n   is important to choose
    designs that are expected to be useful for a\n   long time.  While there are many
    cabling, equipment, and protocol\n   standards, only limited standards exist for
    the physical network\n   layout for new buildings.  This memo sets a baseline
    requirements\n   that new, single-family dwellings must at least satisfy in order
    to\n   benefit from advances in networking technology.\n\n   Standardizing network
    technology for buildings is a challenging task,\n   however.  This memo has been
    submitted for the home networking\n   working group at the IETF as one forum that
    the authors were able to\n   find that cares about the home network as a system.
    \ However, in\n   general the IETF has expertise only on protocols, not on the
    physical\n   medium.  Advice is sought on what existing standards already address\n
    \  this problem, what standardization efforts may be under way in the\n   world,
    and if work remains, what the right forum to discuss these\n   matters might be.\n\n\t "

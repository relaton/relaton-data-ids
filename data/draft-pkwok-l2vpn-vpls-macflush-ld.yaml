  content: "MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to \nremove
    or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned, \nfor faster convergence.
    Failure of mechanisms that control loop free \nconnectivity (e.g Split Horizon)
    among VPLS PE nodes may cause MAC \nAddress Withdrawal messages looping among
    those nodes, leading to \nDenial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of control
    plane in the \nPE nodes. This document describes a mechanism to detect and prevent
    \nloops of MAC Address Withdrawal messages in a VPLS PE node on such \nfailures.\n\t "

  content: "   Multi-Factor Authentication has rapidly become a driving requirement\n
    \  for any internet based technology that requires authentication.\n   While a
    large number of initiatives are active for providing\n   solutions to this requirement
    for Web Browser based applications that\n   can generally support real time human
    interaction for providing a\n   secondary method of identification, legacy protocols
    such as [IMAP]\n   have not yet been revised to provide such support despite being
    a\n   high-risk target for business email compromise, possibly as a result\n   of
    [IMAP] activity generally expecting to be non-interactive in\n   nature outside
    of Webmail logins.\n\n   This document defines an extension to the [IMAP] service
    protocol\n   called \"CLIENTID\" that an [IMAP] client can provide an additional\n
    \  unique identification token prior to standard credentials\n   authentication
    that the server may then apply as an identity\n   verification method in a similar
    manner to other Multi-Factor\n   authentication techniques.\n\n\t "

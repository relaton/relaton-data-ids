  content: "   The path model used in the current MPQUIC draft binds a connection\n
    \  identifier to a path.  In fact, the sequence number of a connection\n   identifier
    is used as an implicit path identifier.  This has a number\n   of consequences
    that may cause MPQUIC to diverge from the principles\n   of RFC9000.  One of these
    consequences, for example, is to associate\n   each connection with a different
    application data packet number space\n   rather than maintaining a single application
    data packet number space\n   across all connections as defined in RFC9000.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a different path model for Multipath QUIC\n   using
    explicit path identifiers, enabling a multipath management\n   framework that
    retains the principles and operations of RFC9000.\n\n\t "

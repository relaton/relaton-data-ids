  content: "This document describes practices and plans that are emerging among Internet
    Service Providers for the deployment of IPv6 services.  They are based on practical
    experience so far, as well as current plans and requirements, reported in a survey
    of a number of ISPs carried out in early 2010.  This document identifies a number
    of technology gaps, but it does not make recommendations.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of classical
    cryptographic primitives, making it essential to design hybrid schemes that remain
    secure against both classical and quantum adversaries. This document specifies
    GhostLock, a file-level hybrid encryption protocol that combines classical elliptic-curve
    cryptography (X25519, Ed25519) with post-quantum lattice-based mechanisms (Kyber768),
    integrated under a modern AEAD cipher (ChaCha20-Poly1305). The protocol defines
    a portable encrypted container format (.glock) providing confidentiality, integrity,
    and authenticity beyond the lifetime of current cryptosystems.</p>"

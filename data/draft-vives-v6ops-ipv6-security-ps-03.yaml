  content: "Today, each network is often secured by a unique device (i.e.\n   security
    gateway or firewall) that becomes a bottleneck for the\n   end-to-end security
    model with IPv6.  The deployment of IPv6 enabled\n   devices and networks bring
    some issues, which must be addressed by\n   security administrators in order to
    guarantee at least the same level\n   of security that is obtained nowadays with
    IPv4 and network-based\n   (including perimetral-based) security schemes, allowing
    at the same\n   time all the IPv6 advantages.\n\t "

  content: "   Some NFSv4 servers allow a mode SETATTR to restore ACL permissions\n
    \  which were removed by a previous mode SETATTR.  This allows servers\n   to
    handle mode SETATTRs without destroying the information in ACLs.\n   However,
    these temporarily masked permissions are not exposed to\n   clients.  This proposal
    adds an optional new file attribute,\n   file_masks, which can be used by clients
    to see these temporarily\n   masked permissions.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents the design of Unicorn, a multi-domain,\n   geographically-distributed,
    data-intensive analytics system.  The\n   setting of such a system includes edge
    science networks, which\n   provide storage and computation resources for collecting,
    sharing and\n   analyzing extremely large amounts of data, and transit networks,\n
    \  which provide networking resources to connects edge science networks\n   for
    transmitting large science datasets.\n\n   The key design challenge is to accurately
    discover and represent\n   resource information from different domains.  Unicorn
    leverages\n   multiple ALTO services, including ALTO-Path Vector, ALTO-Routing\n
    \  State Abstraction, ALTO-Server-Side Event and ALTO-Flow Cost Service\n   to
    address this challenge.  In particular, Unicorn decomposes the\n   resource discovery
    into three phases.  The first phase is to identify\n   endpoint resource, e.g.,
    dataset storage location, computation\n   resource location and output storage
    resource location.  The second\n   phase is to identify the reachability information
    between the\n   locations of storage and computation resources.  The third phase
    is\n   to identify the available networking resource connecting different\n   storage
    and computation resources.  All information collected through\n   these three
    phases can be used by a logically centralized scheduling\n   system to orchestrate
    the resources usage.\n\n\t "

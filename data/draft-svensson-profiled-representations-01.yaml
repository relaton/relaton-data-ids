  script: Latn
  content: "   This document details approaches for enriching HTTP interactions with\n
    \  information pertaining to the profiles to which resource\n   representations
    conform.  It surveys approaches that were recently\n   introduced to indicate
    the profile of a resource representation, and\n   to make representations that
    conform to a profile discoverable.  It\n   introduces a generally applicable approach
    to negotiate for a\n   resource representation that conforms to a profile preferred
    by a\n   user agent.  That approach leverages the existing content negotiation\n
    \  mechanism but applies it to the profile dimension to which it was\n   previously
    not applied.  The document also shows how a server can\n   convey which profiled
    representations it is able to accept from a\n   user agent.\n\n\t "

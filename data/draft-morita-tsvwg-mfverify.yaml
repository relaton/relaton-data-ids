  content: "The Priority Promotion Scheme (PPS) is a new scheme for traffic \ncontrol;
    specifically, the PPS achieves end-to-end QoS for \ninteractive multimedia services
    by exercising admission control for \nseries of packets on a packet-based network.
    \ The scheme is based on \nthe end-to-end measurement of network resources by
    end systems.  The \ndestination end system notifies the conditions of receipt
    for a \nlimited set of packets sent from the source end.  If this is \nacceptable,
    the source end system then promotes the priority of the \nsucceeding IP packets
    to firmly establish the session.  The network \nis only assumed to support a per-class
    form of priority control, \nsince this allows the end systems to measure remaining
    resources \nwithout affecting the existing streams.  If all end systems behave
    in \nthe above way, we can achieve specific levels of end-to-end QoS \nwithout
    maintaining per-flow states in each item of network equipment. \nThe PPS is based
    on a new per-hop forwarding behavior, called \nmeasurable forwarding (MF-PHB),
    which will use the DiffServ \narchitecture. \nIn this document, we propose a way
    to verify whether MF-PHB is \nrealizable by elaborating configurations of existing
    equipment. \n    \n\t "

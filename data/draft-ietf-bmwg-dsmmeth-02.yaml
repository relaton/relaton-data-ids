  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the methodology for the benchmarking of \n  devices
    that implement traffic control based on classification such \n  as diff-serv code
    point (DSCP) criteria.  The methodology is to be \n  applied to measurements made
    on the data plane to evaluate the \n  performance of the traffic control mechanisms.
    \ The methodology \n  permits the specific traffic control mechanisms and configuration
    \n  commands to vary between DUTs.  The methodology provides procedures \n  using
    existing Terminology to benchmark DUT performance traffic \n  control mechanisms
    applied to physical and logical interfaces using \n  DSCP as the classification
    criteria. This includes scenarios where \n  Forwarding Congestion occurs due to
    interface congestion.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There is an opportunity in successor-to-IKE to fix two major problems\nthat
    have plagued IKEv1: a misunderstanding about what is identity, and\nhaving to
    send certificates every time because you don't know if the\nother party already
    has your certificate. This proposal covers both\ntopics at once because it turns
    out that they are related.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces a policy-based resource management and\n   orchestration
    framework which aims at contributing towards the\n   current namesake NFVRG near-term
    work items.\n\n   It describes key points of the recursive resource orchestration\n
    \  framework developed within the wider research area of federated\n   virtual
    network function orchestration.  The document also relates\n   this effort with
    respect to other orchestration frameworks, thus\n   addressing both the NFV research
    and practitioner communities.\n\n\t "

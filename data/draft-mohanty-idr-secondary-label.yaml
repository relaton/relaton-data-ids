  content: "   This draft utilizes the concept of a secondary label to solve few\n
    \  cases in L3VPN Deployments.In BGP VPN networks, BGP speakers\n   associate
    a local MPLS label when the next-hop is reset and advertise\n   that label to
    other peers.  The receiving peer installs this\n   \"received\" label in the forwarding
    and forwards traffic to the\n   sending router using this label.  In some deployments,
    there arises\n   need where a different label is required to be sent.  We illustrate\n
    \  with two use-cases.\n\n   This draft presents a method where this label is
    encoded in a newly\n   defined attribute that is advertised with the BGP updates
    targeting\n   these specified use-cases\n\n\t "

  content: "   Over the years, it has been repeatedly observed that the STD nnnn and\n
    \  BCP nnnn designation for IETF Standards has not worked well, either\n   as
    a stable reference for external specifications or as a combined\n   reference
    for multiple documents that are linked together into a\n   single specification.
    \ This document proposes two changes that have\n   been discussed on and off for
    some time, but never written up or\n   considered as specific proposals.  The
    first of these would assign a\n   STD (or BCP) number to a specification when
    it enters the first level\n   of the Standards Track (or is first designated as
    a BCP).  The second\n   would turn STDs and BCPs into actual documents that describe
    what\n   they identify and their publication and change history.\n\t "

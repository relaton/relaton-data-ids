  content: "A deployment problem exists with existing self-configuring 6to4\nimplementations
    making often incorrect assumptions about the state of\ntheir IPv4 network connectivity.\nThis
    document describes the problem, and proposes a qualification\nmechanism by which
    nodes can validate that their connectivity to the\nglobal IPv6 network is suitable
    for use with the 6to4 protocol.\n\t "

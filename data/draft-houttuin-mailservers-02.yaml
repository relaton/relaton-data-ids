  content: "This document defines recommendations to be implemented in mail based
    servers in the Internet and GO-MHS e-mail communities.   The requirements only
    affect the basic behaviour of  servers,  i.e.  it mainly deals with how header
    fields are handled. Although there is also a clear need for recommendations in
    the field of end user requirements, such as command syntaxes for archive servers,
    automatic distribution list subscription, etc., such issues are considered more
    suitable to be dealt with in a separate document.                     It is highly
    desirable that other e-mail networks connected to the Internet also implement
    these recommendations.\n\t "

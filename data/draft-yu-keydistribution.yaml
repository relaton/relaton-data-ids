  script: Latn
  content: "   There are several key distribution systems based on the physical\n
    \  layer of the LTE Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication system,\n   utilizing
    the random and high-agreement secret key generation schemes\n   from noisy wideband
    channels.  These systems are used in conjunction\n   with physical layer authentication
    systems that are also based on\n   physical characteristics.  To characterize
    these systems, this\n   document proposes a reference model and several test methods
    of main\n   technical parameters of such systems, including average key\n   generation
    rate as well as the consistency and the randomness of\n   generated key bits.\n\n\t "

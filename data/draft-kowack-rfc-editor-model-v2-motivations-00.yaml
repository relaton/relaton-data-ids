    as part of the RFC Editor, the differences between [RFC5620]and\nthe [I-D.v2-overview]
    recommendations, a discussion of development\nwork that should be done, and an
    assessment of the time needed to\nperform the RSE job.  There is also a section
    listing and responding\nto questions surrounding the recommendations.\n\t "

  content: "     Unencrypted plaintext passwords are the biggest single risk to\n
    \    Internet application protocol security.  Unfortunately, they are\n     widely
    deployed, often tightly integrated into operating system\n     services and very
    difficult to replace in an interoperable fashion.\n \n     This specification
    discusses some methods which can be used to\n     eliminate unencrypted plaintext
    passwords.  It also defines a SASL\n     mechanism [SASL] which may be used by
    newer protocols such as ACAP\n     [ACAP] to transition away from a legacy authentication
    database.\n\t "

  content: "This document provides an overview of tag switching. Tag switching is
    a way to combine the label-swapping forwarding paradigm with network layer routing.
    This has several advantages. Tags can have a wide spectrum of forwarding granularities,
    so at one end of the spectrum a tag could be associated with a group of destinations,
    while at the other a tag could be associated with a single application flow. At
    the same time forwarding based on tag switching, due to its simplicity, is well
    suited to high performance forwarding. These factors facilitate the development
    of a routing system which is both functionally rich and scalable. Finally, tag
    switching simplifies integration of routers and ATM switches by employing common
    addressing, routing, and management procedures.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes how to construct DNSSEC NSEC resource records\n
    \  that cover a smaller range of names than called for by [-records].\n   By generating
    and signing these records on demand, authoritative name\n   servers can effectively
    stop the disclosure of zone contents\n   otherwise made possible by walking the
    chain of NSEC records in a\n   signed zone.\n\t "

  content: "   The increasing prevalence of cloud computing and micro service\n   architectures
    has led to the rise of complex software functions being\n   built and deployed
    as workloads, where a workload is defined as a\n   running instance of software
    executing for a specific purpose.  This\n   document discusses an architecture
    for designing and standardizing\n   protocols and payloads for conveying workload
    identity and security\n   context information.\n\n\t "

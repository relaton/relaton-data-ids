  content: "Running routing protocols on connection oriented Public Data Networks,
    for example X.25 packet switched networks or ISDN, can be expensive if the standard
    form of periodic broadcasting of routing information is adhered to.  The high
    cost arises because a connection has to all practical intents and purposes be
    kept open to every destination to which routing information is to be sent, whether
    or not it is being used to carry user data.                                                                      Routing
    information may also fail to be propagated if the number of destinations to which
    the routing information is to be sent exceeds the number of channels available
    to the router on the Wide Area Network (WAN).\n\t "

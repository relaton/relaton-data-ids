  content: "Current CCAMP works focus on intra-domain control plane. This \ndocument
    focuses on inter-domain control plane. It views the overall \nnetwork as a collection
    of administrative domains, partitioned by \noperators according to administrative,
    technological or geographical \nconsiderations. This document specifies a BGP/GMPLS
    based inter-domain \nsolution for setting up circuit LSPs(Label Switched Paths)
    that span \nmultiple administrative domains. A few extensions and modifications
    \nare proposed to BGP in order to disseminate appropriate topology \ninformation
    and calculate end-to-end circuit paths. GMPLS signaling is \nalso extended for
    the inter-domain connection operations. The solution \nspecified in this draft
    is fundermental for inter-domain operations \nand can be used as a base for various
    applications, e.g. OVPN. It is \nalso very flexible and scalable.\n\t "

  content: "In this informational draft, a simple TCP-level method to tackle\nunnecessarily
    inflated TCP retransmission timeout (RTO) value due to\nnon-congestion losses
    over wireless uplink is evaluated.  This method\nworks between the handset and
    the intermediate node, and does not\nrequire the changes on legacy TCP implementations
    on wireline side.\nIt uses one bit, named Kick (K) bit, from the TCP header to
    signal\nthe handset or IN to override RTO. Also, this method does not\nundermine
    the congestion-control aspect of RTO exponential backoff.\n\n\t "

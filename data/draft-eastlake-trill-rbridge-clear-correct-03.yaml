  script: Latn
  content: "   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n   protocol
    provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without\n   configuration in multi-hop
    networks with arbitrary topology, safe\n   forwarding even during periods of temporary
    loops, and support for\n   multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic.
    TRILL\n   accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate\n
    \  System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a\n   header
    that includes a hop count. Since the TRILL base protocol was\n   approved in March
    2010, active development of TRILL has revealed a\n   few errata in the original
    RFC 6325 and some cases that could use\n   clarifications or updates.\n\n   RFCs
    6327, RFC 6439, and RFC XXXX, provide clarifications with\n   respect to Adjacency,
    Appointed Forwarders, and the TRILL ESADI\n   protocol. This document provide
    other known clarifications,\n   corrections, and updates to RFCs 6325, 6327, and
    6439.\n\n\n\t "

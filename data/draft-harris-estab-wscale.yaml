  content: "   The TCP Window Scale option modifies the interpretation of packets
    in\n   a flow but is transmitted only at the start of the connection.  As\n   such
    there is a problem for observability and fault-finding, since a\n   packet capture
    by a third party may miss the start of a relevant\n   connection.  This document
    describes the use of TCP options to\n   provide the scale values during a connection.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Network performance, especially network latency is widely recognized\n
    \  as one of major obstacles in adopting public cloud services (e.g.,\n   cloud
    desktop service), especially in the scenario where the network\n   paths between
    cloud end-users and cloud data centers traverse more\n   than one Autonomous System
    (AS). However, the current Border Gateway\n   Protocol (BGP) specification [RFC4271]
    doesn't use network\n   performance metrics (e.g., network latency) in the route
    selection\n   decisions. This document describes a performance-based BGP routing\n
    \  mechanism in which network latency metric is taken as one of the\n   route
    selection criteria.\n\n\t "

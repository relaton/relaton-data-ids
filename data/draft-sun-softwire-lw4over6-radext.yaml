  content: "   lightweight 4over6(lw4over6) [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an\n   extension
    to DS-Lite in which the amount of state maintained in\n   lwAFTR has been reduced
    to per-subscriber-level.  The lwB4 needs to\n   be provisioned with the public
    IPv4 address and port set it is\n   allowed to use.  The DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Transport
    [I.D-ietf-dhc-\n   dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP)\n   Option for Port Set [I.D-sun-dhc-port-set-option] can be used for\n
    \  lwB4 to provison with the public IPv4 address and port set.\n\n   However,
    in many networks, the configuration information may be\n   stored in Authentication
    Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers\n   while user configuration is mainly
    from Broadband Network Gateway\n   (BNG).  This document defines a Remote Authentication
    Dial In User\n   Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries lightweight 4over6\n
    \  configuration information from AAA server to BNG.\n\n\t "

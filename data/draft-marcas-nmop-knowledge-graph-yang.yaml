  content: "   The success of the YANG language and YANG-based protocols for\n   managing
    the network has unlocked new opportunities in network\n   analytics.  However,
    the wide heterogeneity of YANG models hinders\n   the consumption and analysis
    of network data.  Besides, data encoding\n   formats and transport protocols will
    differ depending on the network\n   management protocol supported by the network
    device.  These\n   challenges call for new data management paradigms that facilitate
    the\n   discovery, understanding, integration and access to silos of\n   heterogenous
    YANG data, abstracting from the complexities of the\n   network devices.\n\n   This
    document introduces the knowledge graph paradigm as a solution\n   to this data
    management problem, with focus on YANG-based network\n   management.  The document
    provides background on related topics such\n   as ontologies and graph standards,
    and shares guidelines for\n   implementing knowledge graphs from YANG data.\n\n\t "

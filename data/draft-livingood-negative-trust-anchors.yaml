  content: Definition and Use of DNSSEC Negative Trust Anchors

  script: Latn
  content: "   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread\n   deployment.
    \ However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet\n   as mature and reliable
    as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain\n   administration tools and processes.
    \ One potential technique to\n   mitigate this is to use a Negative Trust Anchor,
    which is defined in\n   this document.\n\n   This document discusses Trust Anchors
    for DNSSEC and defines a\n   Negative Trust Anchor, which is potentially useful
    during the\n   transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC deployment.  These are configured\n
    \  locally on a particular instance of a validating DNS recursive\n   resolver
    and can shield end users of such a resolver from the DNSSEC-\n   related authoritative
    name server operational errors that appear to\n   be somewhat typical during the
    transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC\n   deployment.  Negative Trust Anchors are intended
    to be temporary, and\n   should not be distributed by IANA or any other organization
    outside\n   of the administrative boundary of the organization locally\n   implementing
    a Negative Trust Anchor.  Finally, Negative Trust\n   Anchors pertain only to
    DNSSEC and not to Public Key Infrastructures\n   (PKI) such ad X.509.\n\n\t "

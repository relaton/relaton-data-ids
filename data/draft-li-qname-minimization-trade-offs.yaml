abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the current protocol policies and operational
    state of QNAME Minimization (QMIN), defined in RFC 9156 [RFC9156]. While QMIN
    is a DNS privacy mechanism, its existing implementation strategies introduce subtle
    trade-offs between privacy and security. Specifically, current policies may still
    present potential information leakage or introduce query amplification potential.
    This informational document aims to alert protocol designers, implementers, and
    users to these emerging challenges and suggests that a careful re-evaluation and
    improvement of the QMIN mechanism are necessary to fully mitigate these combined
    privacy and security risks.</p>"

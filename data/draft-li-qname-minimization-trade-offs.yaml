  content: "   This document examines the current protocol policies and operational\n
    \  state of QNAME Minimization (QMIN), defined in RFC 9156 [RFC9156].\n   While
    QMIN is a DNS privacy mechanism, its existing implementation\n   strategies introduce
    subtle trade-offs between privacy and security.\n   Specifically, current policies
    may still present potential\n   information leakage or introduce query amplification
    potential.  This\n   informational document aims to alert protocol designers,\n
    \  implementers, and users to these emerging challenges and suggests\n   that
    a careful re-evaluation and improvement of the QMIN mechanism\n   are necessary
    to fully mitigate these combined privacy and security\n   risks.\n\n\t "

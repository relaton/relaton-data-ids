  content: "   MPLS Traffic engineering heavily relies on the correct simulation of\n
    \  traffic under normal and failure conditions.  Currently traffic\n   simulations
    rely on RSVP TE or on SPF routing with ECMP.  SR\n   introduces basically a new
    overlay on top of the L3 topology, the SR\n   topology.  The SR-topology is demand
    dependant.  This document\n   discusses issues, requirements and some solution
    approaches to\n   combine Segment Routing and Traffic Engineering.\n\n\t "

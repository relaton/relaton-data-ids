  content: "The Dublin Core is a simple resource description format which arose out
    of a loose grouping of 'librarians, archivists, humanities scholars and geographers,
    as well as standards makers in the Internet, Z39.50 and Standard Generalized Markup
    Language (SGML) communities' [1].              This document describes a mapping
    from the abstract model of the Dublin Core to the X.500 [2], LDAP [3], and CLDAP
    [4] directory service protocols.\n\t "

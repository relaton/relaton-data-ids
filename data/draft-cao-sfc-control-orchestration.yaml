  content: "   Service Function Chain architecture further enables the modularity
    of\n   network functions; network service functions can be split and chained\n
    \  together to compose complicated services.  Network automation relies\n   on
    a specific orchestrator to automatically deploy an end2end service\n   or application.
    \ If this end2end service or application has a\n   specific requirement to chaining
    several service functions, there is\n   a need of an interface from the application
    to inform the\n   orchestrator.  This document investigates the problem.\n\n\t "

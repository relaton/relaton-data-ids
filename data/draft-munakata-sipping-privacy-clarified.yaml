  content: "   This document is an informational RFC to clarify the use of privacy\n
    \  mechanism for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that is specified in\n   RFC
    3323 and extended in subsequent RFCs, such as RFC 3325. It is\n   intended to
    clarify the semantics of each privacy header value\n   (priv-value) and the handling
    of the relevant target SIP headers\n   for each of the priv-value.  It also provides
    some guidelines on\n   providing privacy considerations for future specifications
    that\n   define SIP headers which may be influenced by the privacy mechanism.\n\n\t "

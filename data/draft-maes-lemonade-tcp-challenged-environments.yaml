  content: "   The IETF lemonade group has defined extensions to the IMAP and SMTP
    \n   protocols that provide optimizations for clients in a variety of \n   settings,
    such as mobile networks. This document discusses issues \n   related to deployments
    where TCP support in the client is degraded or \n   non-existent, and techniques
    for overcoming these limitations. \n\t "

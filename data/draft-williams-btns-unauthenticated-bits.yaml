  content: "   This document specifies how to use the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)\n
    \  protocols, such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, to setup \"unauthenticated\"\n   security
    associations (SAs) using public keys as IKE identities and\n   unauthenticated
    public keys and/or certificates as IKE credentials.\n   This unauthenticated SA
    negotiation protocol works by having IKE\n   peers assert public keys as identities
    using a new IKE ID payload\n   type for the purpose.  Unauthenticated IPsec is
    herein referred to by\n   its popular acronym, \"BTNS\" (Better Than Nothing Security).\n\n
    \  This document focuses on BITS (bump in the stack) mode IPsec, leaving\n   specification
    of unauthenticated native IPsec to a separate document.\n   We assume an RFC2401bis
    processing model, specifically a PAD (peer\n   authorization database) separate
    from the SPD (security policy\n   database).\n\t "

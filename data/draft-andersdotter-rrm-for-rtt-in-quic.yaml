  content: "   The latency spin bit is an optional feature included in the QUIC\n
    \  transport protocol, as standardized by the Internet Engineering Task\n   Force
    (IETF).  It enables passive, on-path observations for\n   estimation of latency.
    \ This document presents the results of an\n   inquiry into the potential of using
    randomized response mechanisms\n   (RRM) to reduce privacy loss in latency measurements.
    \ It concludes\n   that RRM could be used to introduce choice for clients in preserving\n
    \  privacy in latency measurements.  But the trade-offs, especially\n   since
    the latency spin bit is already optional, do not favour RRM.\n\n\t "

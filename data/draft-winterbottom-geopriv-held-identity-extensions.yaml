  content: "When a Location Information Server receives a request for location\n   information
    (using the locationRequest message), described in the\n   base HTTP Enabled Location
    Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the\n   source IP address of arriving message
    as a pointer to the location\n   determination process.  This is sufficient in
    environments where the\n   location of a Device can be determined based on its
    IP address.\n\n   Two additional use cases are addresses by this document.  In
    the\n   first, location configuration requires additional or alternative\n   identifiers
    from the source IP address provided in the request.  In\n   the second, an entity
    other than the Device requests the location of\n   the Device.\n\n   This document
    extends the HELD protocol to allow the location request\n   message to carry Device
    identifiers.  Privacy and security\n   considerations describe the conditions
    where requests containing\n   identifiers are permitted.\n\t "

  content: "   Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) authenticates and authorizes\n   organizations
    and individuals making and/or receiving telephone\n   calls.  This eliminates
    trust gaps that malicious parties exploit.\n   Like related technolgies such as
    SHAKEN, RCD, and BCID, VVP uses STIR\n   to bind cryptographic evidence to a SIP
    INVITE, and verify this\n   evidence downstream.  VVP can also let evidence flow
    the other way,\n   proving things about the callee.  VVP builds from different
    technical\n   and governance assumptions than alternatives, and uses stronger,\n
    \  richer evidence.  This allows VVP to cross jurisdictional boundaries\n   easily
    and robustly.  It also makes VVP simpler, more decentralized,\n   cheaper to deploy
    and maintain, more private, more scalable, and\n   higher assurance.  Because
    it is easier to adopt, VVP can plug gaps\n   or build bridges between other approaches,
    functioning as glue in\n   hybrid ecosystems.  For example, it may justify an
    A attestation in\n   SHAKEN, or an RCD passport for branded calling, when a call\n
    \  originates outside SHAKEN or RCD ecosystems.  VVP also works well as\n   a
    standalone mechanism, independent of other solutions.  An extra\n   benefit is
    that VVP enables two-way evidence sharing with verifiable\n   text and chat (e.g.,
    RCS and vCon), as well as with other industry\n   verticals that need verifiability
    in non-telco contexts.\n\n\t "

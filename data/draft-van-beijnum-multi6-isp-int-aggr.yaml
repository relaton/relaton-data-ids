  content: "Current 6bone backbone routing guidelines prohibit traditional\nmultihoming
    in IPv6, because current IPv4-style multihoming doesn't\nscale. This stands in
    the way of successful adoption of IPv6. The\nsolution outlined in this memo proposes
    aggregating the routing\ninformation for multihomed destinations inside service
    provider\nnetworks based on geography to accomplish scalable multihoming in IPv6\nusing
    current protocols and implementations. This solution does not\nrequire network
    operators to increase the density of interconnection;\nnor does it require significant
    cooperation or simultaneous adoption.\n\t "

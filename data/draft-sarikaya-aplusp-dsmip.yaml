  content: "This memo describes how to use IPv6 Port Range transition technique\nin
    mobile networks for Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6).  Using the\nclient based
    DSMIPv6, a mobile node (MN) which is a dual-stack node\ncan be assigned with a
    shared IPv4 Home Address (HA) together with a\nport range from the home agent.
    \ HA is co-located with Port Range\nRouter (PRR).  IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation
    is used to convey IPv4\ntraffic between the network and the mobile node (MN).
    \ HA, acting as\nPRR receives incoming IPv4 datagrams and determines the routing\nidentifier
    (IPv6 address) to use to forward the traffic to the\nappropriate MN among those
    sharing the same IPv4 address.  In the\nbinding mode, HA finds the binding cache
    entry for this MN and then\nencapsulates the IPv4 datagram in an IPv6 one and
    forwards the\nencapsulated datagram to MN.  The stateless mode is also described.\nWithin
    this memo, Mobile network could be WiMAX network or 3GPP Long\nTerm Evolution
    (LTE) network.\n\t "

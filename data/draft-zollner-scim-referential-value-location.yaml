- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management standard's schema RFC\n
    \  [RFC7643], as well as custom schemas, may have attribute values that\n   have
    a finite set of acceptable values.  These acceptable values are\n   frequently
    tied to a value on another resource.  For instance, an\n   organization may only
    allow values in the Enterprise User schema's\n   costCenter attribute that are
    valid identifiers of cost centers\n   defined in another location.  This draft
    aims to provide a way for a\n   SCIM client to determine if an attribute in a
    schema is limited to a\n   specific set of values, and where those values may
    be located on\n   another SCIM resource type.\n\n\t "

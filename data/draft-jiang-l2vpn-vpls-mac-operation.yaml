  content: "The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) using Label Distribution    \n
    \  Protocol (LDP) signaling is described in RFC 4762. That document   \n   describes
    a mechanism called MAC Address Withdrawal to remove or    \n   unlearn MAC addresses
    which have been dynamically learned in a VPLS   \n   instance. Further work in
    progress defines an extension to MAC \n   Address Withdrawal procedure which can
    greatly restrict the scope of \n   MAC flushing. This document provides a flushing-free
    mechanism which \n   removes the need for MAC address flushing in a VPLS instance.
    This \n   mechanism is called MAC Address Switching. \n\t "

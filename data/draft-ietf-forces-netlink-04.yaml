  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes Linux Netlink, which is used in Linux both as
    an intra-kernel messaging system as well as between kernel and user space.  The
    focus of this document is to describe Netlink's functionality as a protocol between
    a Forwarding Engine Component (FEC) and a Control Plane Component (CPC), the two
    components that define an IP service.  As a result of this focus, this document
    ignores other uses of Netlink, including its use as a intra-kernel messaging system,
    as an inter- process communication scheme (IPC), or as a configuration tool for
    other non-networking or non-IP network services (such as decnet, etc.).  This
    document is intended as informational in the context of prior art for the ForCES
    IETF working group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the architecture of a Suite B compliant implementation
    of the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol and the Secure Shell Authentication
    Protocol.  Suite B Secure Shell makes use of the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
    (ECDH) key agreement, the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA),
    the Advanced Encryption Standard running in Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM), two
    members of the SHA-2 family of hashes (SHA-256 and SHA-384), and X.509 certificates.
    \ This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.\n\t "

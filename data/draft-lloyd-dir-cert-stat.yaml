  content: "This Internet Draft specifies some proposed enhancements to the X.500\ninformation
    schema and matching rules to support Certificate path\n processing, certificate
    status and CRL mechanisms. These\n enhancements provide advantages over existing
    Certificate validation\n and CRL mechanisms.  In particular, the mechanisms proposed
    can:\n \n(a) reduce the need for unnecessarily fetching CRLs;\n(b) allow certificate
    status-CRL evaluation time to be improved;\n(c) provide a directory supported
    certificate test and fetch\n    capability;\n(d) better support use of certificates
    in multiple environments with\n    different CRL arrangements.\n(e) simplify the
    client software in the areas of certificate path,\n    certificate validity and
    CRL processing.\n(f) provide the client a range of trust options when validating\n
    \   certificates.\n(g) provide a range of implementation options so that gradual
    adoption\n    is possible.\n \nThis document is submitted for consideration as
    the basis of possible\nfuture IETF/ITU standardization.  Please send comments
    on this\ndocument to the ietf-pkix@imc.com mail list.\n\n\t "

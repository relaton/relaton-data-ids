  script: Latn
  content: "A Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture has been\n   specified
    for the computation of Traffic Engineering (TE) Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs)
    in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks
    in the context of single or\n   multiple domains (where a domain is referred to
    as a collection of\n   network elements within a common sphere of address management
    or path\n   computational responsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous\n   Systems).
    \ In PCE-based environments it is thus critical to monitor\n   the state of the
    path computation chain for troubleshooting and\n   performance monitoring purposes:
    liveness of each element (PCE)\n   involved in the PCE chain, detection of potential
    resource contention\n   states, statistics in term of path computation times are
    examples of\n   such metrics of interest.  This document specifies procedures
    and\n   extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order\n
    \  to gather such information.\n\t "

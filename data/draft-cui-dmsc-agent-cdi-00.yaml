abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a framework for enabling seamless cross-domain
    interoperability among AI agents operating across different networks, administrative
    domains, and heterogeneous platforms. The framework addresses the challenges of
    identity federation, trust establishment, policy harmonization, and secure communication
    that arise when AI agents from distinct administrative realms need to collaborate
    on shared tasks. It specifies mechanisms for agent discovery, capability negotiation,
    trust delegation, and federated policy enforcement, enabling scalable and secure
    multi-domain AI collaboration without requiring centralized control.</p>"

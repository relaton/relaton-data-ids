  content: "   Acknowledgement (ACK) is a basic function and implemented in most of\n
    \  the ordered and reliable transport protocols [RFC0793].  Traditional\n   ACK
    is designed with high frequency to guarantee correct interaction\n   between sender
    and receiver.  Delayed byte-counting ACK or periodic\n   ACK with large interval
    are proposed in prior work to reduce ACK\n   intensity.\n\n   High-throughput
    transport over wireless local area network (WLAN)\n   becomes a demanding requirement
    with the emergence of 4K wireless\n   projection, VR/AR-based interactive gaming,
    and more.  However, the\n   interference nature of the wireless medium induces
    an unavoidable\n   contention between data transport and backward signaling, such
    as\n   acknowledgement.\n\n   This document presents the problems caused by high-intensity
    ACK in\n   WLAN.  We also analyze the possibility of ACK optimization in WLAN\n
    \  and the compatibility issues with existing systems.\n\n\t "

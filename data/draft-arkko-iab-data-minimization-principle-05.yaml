  content: "   Data minimization is an important privacy technique, as it can reduce\n
    \  the amount information exposed about a user.  This document\n   emphasizes
    the need for data minimization among primary protocol\n   participants, such as
    between clients and servers.  Avoiding data\n   leakage to outside parties is
    of course very important as well, but\n   both need to be considered in minimization.\n\n
    \  This is because is necessary to protect against endpoints that are\n   compromised,
    malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with\n   the interests of users.
    \ It is important to consider the role of a\n   participant and limit any data
    provided to it according to that role.\n\n\t "

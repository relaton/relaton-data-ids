    algorithm by adding a mapping step which indicates where the\n   ENUM tree for
    a specific ENUM application is located.  A new DNS\n   record (IEBL, the Infrastructure
    ENUM Branch Location record) is\n   defined which provides an interim solution
    for the Infrastructure\n   ENUM tree location.\n\n\n\t "

    of a generic AAA environment. We will focus our attention on\nthat kind of policy
    that is evaluated in response to a request of a\nuser [OBJMSG]. That policy will
    determine all requirements that need\nto be fulfilled before the service asked
    for will be delivered.  We\nwill introduce the concept of a Driving Policy.\n\t "

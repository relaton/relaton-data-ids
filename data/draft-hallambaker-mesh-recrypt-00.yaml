abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A messaging infrastructure providing full end-to end security is\n
    \  presented.  Unlike existing approaches such as S/MIME and OpenPGP,\n   Mesh/Recrypt
    uses proxy re-encryption to preserve full end-to-end\n   security with individual
    user and device keys in situations such as\n   the user having multiple decryption
    devices and messages being set to\n   mailing lists.\n\n   This document shows
    the use of Mesh/Recrypt to address the principle\n   use cases Mesh/Recrypt is
    designed to address.  These include\n   asynchronous messaging such as mail and
    controlled documents and\n   synchronous messaging applications such as chat,
    voice and video.\n\n\t "

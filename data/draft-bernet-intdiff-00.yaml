  content: "In the past several years, work on QoS enabled networks led to the development
    of the Integrated Services (Intserv) architecture [12] and the RSVP signaling
    protocol [1]. RSVP addresses the needs of applications that require QoS, promising
    per-flow service. As the RSVP/Intserv (from here on abbreviated to intserv) work
    has proceeded, we have recognized barriers to the deployment of intserv. The reliance
    of intserv on per-flow state and per-flow processing is an impediment to its deployment
    in the Internet at large, and in particular in large carrier networks. Additionally,
    RSVP signaling is supposed to originate from hosts, which as of yet are not RSVP
    enabled in large numbers.\n \nRecently, attention has shifted to Differentiated
    services (diff-serv). Diff-serv promises to expedite the realization of QoS enabled
    networks by offering a significantly simpler alternative to intserv, which eliminates
    scalability concerns and which can be implemented and managed in large networks,
    without requiring end-to-end deployment. However, unlike intserv, diff-serv focuses
    on the needs of the large network.\n\nThis draft proposes a framework for end-to-end
    QoS, in which intserv and diff-serv are used together to meet the needs of large
    ISPs who manage the transit networks of the Internet, and the users of QoS applications
    and hosts, who are the ISPs' ultimate customers. This focus is important as we
    believe that in the coming years, there will be a proliferation of applications
    that depend on QoS and of hosts which are capable of QoS signaling. We envision
    the deployment of diff-serv capable core networks and intserv capable stub networks
    at the periphery. Our framework allows each to proceed at its own pace, providing
    immediate incremental benefits in areas of the network in which one or the other
    is deployed and additional benefits where both are deployed.\n\t "

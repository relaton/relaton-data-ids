  content: "   The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be used on\n
    \  networks, but the standards development process in the IETF does have\n   an
    impact on society through its normative standards setting process.\n   Among other
    things, the IETF's work affects what is perceived as\n   technologically possible
    and useful where networking technologies are\n   being deployed, and its standards
    reflect what is considered by the\n   technical community to be feasible and good
    practice.  Whereas there\n   might not be agreement among the Internet protocol
    community on the\n   specific political nature of the technological development
    process\n   and its outputs, it is undisputed that standards and protocols are\n
    \  both products of a political process, and they can also be used for\n   political
    means.\n\n\t "

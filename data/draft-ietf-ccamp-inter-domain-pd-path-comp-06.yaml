  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a per-domain path computation technique for establishing
    inter-domain Traffic Engineering (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this document, a domain
    refers to a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management
    or path computational responsibility such as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas
    and Autonomous Systems.\n\n Per-domain computation applies where the full path
    of an inter-domain TE LSP cannot be or is not determined at the ingress node of
    the TE LSP, and is not signaled across domain boundaries. This is most likely
    to arise owing to TE visibility limitations. The signaling message indicates the
    destination and nodes up to the next domain boundary. It may also indicate further
    domain boundaries or domain identifiers. The path through each domain, possibly
    including the choice of exit point from the domain, must be determined within
    the domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

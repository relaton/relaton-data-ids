  content: "   Today, low-latency transport protocols like RDMA over Converged\n   Ethernet
    (RoCE) can provide good delay and throughput performance in\n   small and lightly
    loaded high-speed datacenter networks due to\n   lossless transport based on priority-based
    flow control (PFC).\n   However, PFC suffers from various issues from performance
    degradation\n   and unreliability (e.g., deadlock), limiting the deployment of
    RoCE\n   to only small scale clusters (~1000).\n\n   This document presents LDCP,
    a new transport that scales loss-\n   sensitive transports, e.g., RDMA, to entire
    data-centers containing\n   tens of thousands machines, without dependency on
    PFC for\n   losslessness, i.e., PFC-free.  LDCP develops a novel end-to-end\n
    \  congestion control scheme and achieves very low queue occupancy even\n   under
    high network utilization or large traffic churns, resulting in\n   almost no packet
    loss.  Meanwhile, LDCP allows a new flow to jump\n   start at full speed at the
    very beginning and therefore minimizes the\n   latency for short RPC-style transactions.
    \ LDCP relies on only WRED\n   and ECN, two widely supported features on switches,
    so it can be\n   easily deployed in existing network infrastructures.  Finally,
    LDCP\n   is simple by design and thus can be easily implemented by\n   programmable
    or ASIC NICs.\n\n\t "

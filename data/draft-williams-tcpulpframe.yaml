abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a framing protocol for TCP which is designed\nto
    be fully compliant with applicable TCP RFC's and fully\ninteroperable with existing
    TCP implementations. The framing\nmechanism is designed to work as a 'shim' between
    TCP and higher-\nlevel protocols, preserving the reliable, in-order delivery of
    TCP\nwhile adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record\nboundaries
    if the record is less than or equal to the path MTU. The\nshim is designed to
    enable hardware acceleration of data movement\noperations (e.g. direct placement
    of receive TCP segments into\nhigher-level protocol buffers) for the protocols
    that use it, even\nif TCP segments are delivered out-of-order.\n\n\t "

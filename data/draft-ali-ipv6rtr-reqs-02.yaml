  content: "   The Internet is not one network, but rather a collection of networks.\n
    \  The interconnected nature of these networks, and the nature of the\n   interconneted
    systems that make up these networks, is often more\n   fragile than it appears.
    \ Perhaps \"robust but fragile\" is an\n   overstatement, but the actions of each
    vendor, implementor, and\n   operator in such an interconneted environment can
    have a major impact\n   on the stability of the overall Internet (as a system).
    \ The\n   widespread adoption of IPv6 could, particularly, disrupt network\n   operations,
    in a way that impacts the entire system.\n\n   This time of transition is an opportune
    time to take stock of lessons\n   learned through the operation of large scale
    networks on IPv4, and\n   consider how to apply these lessons to IPv6.  This document
    provides\n   an overview of the design and architectural decisions that attend\n
    \  IPv6 deployment, and a set of IPv6 requirements for routers,\n   switches,
    and middleboxes deployed in IPv6 networks.  The hope of the\n   editors and contributors
    is to provide the neccessary background to\n   guide equipment manufacturers,
    protocol implemenetors, and network\n   operators in effective IPv6 deployment.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a RELOAD Usage for managing shared write access\n
    \  to RELOAD Resources.  Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic\n   primitive
    for enabling various coordination and notification schemes\n   among distributed
    peers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a\n   hierarchical trust delegation scheme
    maintained within an access\n   list.  A new USER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows
    authorized peers to\n   write a Shared Resource without owning its corresponding
    certificate.\n   This specification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with
    a\n   variable name which is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous\n   processes
    are required.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines a new header field for use with SIP.  The \nCONGESTION
    header field is used to report insufficient resources to an \nupstream element.
    \ It provides a means for passing the congestion \ninformation, but does not dictate
    how the receiver of the information \nshould react to the information.  This header
    is intended to provide a \nmechanism for decreasing the dependence on the 503
    response code for \ndetermining an overloaded state.  In addition, it provides
    detailed \ncongestion awareness functionality, to compensate for current limited
    \ncapabilities in SIP.  This functionality can provide specific \ninformation
    regarding the cause of the congestion for custom \naplication treatment policies.
    \ \n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a network that\n
    \  has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that\n   implements
    BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple\n   routers to choose from.
    \ It also applies to other scenarios such as\n   the usage of stateful firewalls
    that effectively act as address-based\n   filters.  This host behavior may interact
    with source address\n   selection in a given implementation, but logically follows
    it.  Given\n   that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with\n
    \  multiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to\n   use
    a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all\n   neighboring
    routers are advertising that prefix in their Router\n   Advertisement Prefix Information
    Options, this document specifies to\n   which router a host should present its
    transmission.  It updates RFC\n   4861.\n\n\t "

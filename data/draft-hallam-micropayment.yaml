  content: "A protocol for transfer of payments through the services of a common broker
    is described. The processing demands of the protocol make it practical for small
    payment amounts. The latency makes it practical for use in interactive applications.
    The scheme thus satisfies the two key criteria for a micropayments scheme. MPTP
    implements a variation of the Pay-Word proposal of Rivest and Shamir [RivestSh95].
    It is also inspired by the Millicent proposal by Manasse [Manasse95] and the iKP
    proposal by Bellare et. al. [BellareEt95]. A proposal similar to the PayWord scheme
    by Torben Pedersen [Pedersen9?] was reported after this draft was begun.      For
    efficiency it is desirable to be able to combine transfer of payments instructions
    with those accomplishing the delivery of goods. For this reason MPTP may be layered
    on a variety of Internet protocols including HTTP and SMTP/MIME.\n\t "

    \n   of DHCP option 123, \"Location Configuration Information\", from a\n   DHCP
    client to a DHCP server.  Transmission of option 123 from a \n   client to a server
    allows a client that knows its location through \n   some other means to communicate
    that location to the DHCP server.\n\t "

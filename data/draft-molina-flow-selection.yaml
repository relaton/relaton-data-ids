  content: "Flow selection is the process of selecting only a limited number of \n\nflows
    out of all the flows observable/observed at an IPFIX device. \n\nThe selection
    can be done in the metering process, by selectively \n\naccounting only some of
    the incoming packets, in the flow recording \n\nprocess, by keeping only some
    of the created flow records, or in the \n\nexporting process, by exporting only
    some of the flow records of the \n\nflow recording process. This document describes
    the scenarios where \n\nflow selection can be applied, discusses what information
    about the \n\nflow selection process is beneficial to export and provides an \n\ninformation
    model for it. \n\t "

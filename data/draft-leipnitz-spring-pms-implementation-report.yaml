  content: "   This document reports round-trip delay measurements captured by a\n
    \  single MPLS Path Monitoring System (PMS) compared with results of an\n   IPPM
    conformant measurement system, consisting of three different\n   Measurement Agents.
    \ The measurements were made in a research\n   backbone with an LDP control plane.
    \ The packets of the MPLS PMS use\n   label stacks similar to those to be used
    by a segment routing MPLS\n   PMS.  The measurement packets of the MPLS PMS remained
    in the network\n   data plane.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Complex telephony networks using SIP signalling such as the IP\n   Multimedia
    Subsystem (IMS) of the Third Generation Partnership (3GPP)\n   serve diverse customer
    groups, including business and retail clients,\n   with various products like
    mobile, fixed, and PBX services.  Such\n   services have the problem of different
    handling of the services.\n   This may end up in a complex analysis of the signalling
    syntax before\n   starting the required procedures for calls based on their service\n
    \  provided to the customer.  With the introduction of microservice\n   based
    technologies the complexity increases.\n\n   This draft describes a generic identification
    mechanism for SIP\n   dialogs in using an identifier indicating the service/product
    which\n   the customer is using to allow an efficient processing of the SIP\n
    \  dialog and session.\n\n\t "

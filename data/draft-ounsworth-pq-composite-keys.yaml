  content: "   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history\n
    \  of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor\n   the
    new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the\n   required
    data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and\n   elliptic curve,
    may fall to quantum cryptalanysis, while the incoming\n   post-quantum algorithms
    face uncertainty about both the underlying\n   mathematics as well as hardware
    and software implementations that\n   have not had sufficient maturing time to
    rule out classical\n   cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.\n\n   Cautious
    implementers may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such\n   that an attacker
    would need to break all of them in order to\n   compromise the data being protected
    using either a Post-Quantum /\n   Traditional Hybrid, Post-Quantum / Post-Quantum
    Hybrid, or\n   combinations thereof.  This document, and its companions, defines
    a\n   specific instantiation of hybrid paradigm called \"composite\" where\n   multiple
    cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key,\n   signature, or
    key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) such that they can be\n   treated as a single
    atomic object at the protocol level.\n\n   This document defines the structures
    CompositePublicKey and\n   CompositePrivateKey, which are sequences of the respective
    structure\n   for each component algorithm.  Explicit pairings of algorithms are\n
    \  defined which should meet most Internet needs.\n\n   This document is intended
    to be coupled with corresponding documents\n   that define the structure and semantics
    of composite signatures and\n   encryption, such as [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs]
    and\n   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-kem].\n\n\t "

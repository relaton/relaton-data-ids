  script: Latn
  content: "   With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that\n
    \  rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or\n   tokens)
    for network access, the need for a standard credentials\n   provisioning layer
    is paramount.  In particular, since EAP is\n   deployed for authentication needs,
    the authors extend this use-case\n   by including support for provisioning and
    management of credentials.\n\n   In particular, this specification defines how
    to support the\n   provisioning of strong credentials to users and/or devices
    without\n   the need for providing IP connectivity.  The use of EAP not only for\n
    \  provisiong but also for managing network credentials provides a\n   general
    conduit that can be exploited in different environments\n   (e.g., Wired and WiFi
    networks credentials management).\n\n\t "

  content: "   IPv6 anycast addresses are chosen from within the existing IPv6\n   unicast
    address space, with the addresses nominated as anycast\n   addresses through configuration.
    \ An alternative scheme is to have a\n   special class of addresses for use as
    anycast addresses.  This memo\n   proposes a distinct general anycast addressing
    class and a more\n   specific scheme for functional anycast addresses.\n\n\t "

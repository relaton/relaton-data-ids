abstract:
- content: "<p>As the number of data center tenant increased, 4K VLANs, mobility,
    broadcasting issues have become the network bottleneck. VxLAN has being take into
    consideration in China Mobile IDC. There are two implementation solutions for
    VXLAN. The first one is that NVE resides in TOR (top of rack switch), another
    one is that NVE resides in V-Switch established in hypervisor of physical server.
    For virtualized network, it's much better to implement NVE in V- switch because
    it's directly connect with Virtual Machines and easier for business to carry on.
    As we research in VxLAN solution, some problems are take into our considerations.
    How much resources will be consumed by VxLAN in a virtualized network environment.
    This draft introduces the problem for VxLAN performance by test. There is no methodology
    which can effectively evaluate VxLAN forwarding performance. This draft also attempts
    to address this issue, give a VXLAN performance evaluation method, especially
    when VxLAN resides in the virtual switch.</p>"

  content: "This document introduces extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 that allows\nnetworks
    dynamically binding IP flows to different interfaces of a\nmobile node.  Mobile
    Access Gateways can move flows to other mobile\naccess gateways by establishing
    flow bindings at the local mobility\nanchor.  Local mobility anchor sends packets
    from the offloaded flow\nseamlessly to the new mobile access gateway.\n\t "

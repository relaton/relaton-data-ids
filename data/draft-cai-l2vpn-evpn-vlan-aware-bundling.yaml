  content: "   This document specifies E-VPN extensions to support the new VLAN\n
    \  aware bundling service interface type defined in [EVPN-REQ]. The new\n   service
    interface type provides advantages in reducing provisioning\n   overhead as well
    as E-VPN instances scale in environments where a\n   large number of VLANs need
    to be extended over an MPLS/IP network,\n   while maintaining traffic segregation
    among those VLANs. The VLAN\n   aware bundling service interface can handle the
    high scale\n   requirements of today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs
    over\n   a single WAN E-VPN instance used to interconnect those Data Center\n
    \  sites.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a data model for security management that is
    based on Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) by using Network Functions
    Virtualization (NFV). This document proposes a security management architecture
    based on I2NSF framework. Note that the I2NSF framework consists of I2NSF User,
    Security Management System (i.e., Security Controller and Developer's Management
    System), and NSF instances in the lowest layer of the framework. I2NSF User consists
    of Application Logic, Policy Updater, and Event Collector. Security Controller
    consists of Security Policy Manager and NSF Capability Manager. This document
    explains a data model to perform the missions for a security service (i.e., VoIP-VoLTE)
    in I2NSF security management system.</p>"

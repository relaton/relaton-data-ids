  content: "This document suggests public policy questions that the IETF should \nconsider
    and possibly address when developing new standards and \nprotocols, and modifying
    or enhancing old standards and protocols.  \nThis document contains questions
    to be considered, as opposed to \nguidelines or rules that should in all cases
    be followed.  This first \ndraft provides a framework for identifying and discussing
    questions \nof public policy concern, and invites members of the IETF community
    \nto contribute to the questions and discussions raised here. \n\t "

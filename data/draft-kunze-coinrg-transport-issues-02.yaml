  content: "   Today's transport protocols offer a variety of functionality based
    on\n   the notion that the network is to be treated as an unreliable\n   communication
    medium.  Some, like TCP, establish a reliable\n   connection on top of the unreliable
    network while others, like UDP,\n   simply transmit datagrams without a connection
    and without guarantees\n   into the network.  These fundamental differences in
    functionality\n   have a significant impact on how COIN approaches can be designed
    and\n   implemented.  Furthermore, traditional transport protocols are not\n   designed
    for the multi-party communication principles that underlie\n   many COIN approaches.
    \ This document discusses selected\n   characteristics of transport protocols
    which have to be adapted to\n   support COIN functionality.\n\n\t "

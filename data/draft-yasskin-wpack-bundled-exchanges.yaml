  content: "   Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses, with\n
    \  the request URLs and content negotiation that produced them, to\n   transmit
    or store together.  They can include multiple top-level\n   resources with one
    identified as the default by a primaryUrl\n   metadata, provide random access
    to their component exchanges, and\n   efficiently store 8-bit resources.\n\n\t "

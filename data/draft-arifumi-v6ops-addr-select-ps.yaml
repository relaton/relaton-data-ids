  content: "One physical network can carry multiple logical networks.  Moreover,\n
    \  we can use multiple physical networks at the same time in a host.  In\n   that
    environment, end-hosts might have multiple IP addresses and be\n   required to
    use them selectively.  Without an appropriate source/\n   destination address
    selection mechanism, the host will experience\n   some trouble in the communication.
    \ RFC 3484 defines both the source\n   and destination address selection algorithms,
    but the multi-prefix\n   environment considered here needs additional rules beyond
    the default\n   operation.  This document describes the possible problems that
    end-\n   hosts could encounter in an environment with multiple logical\n   networks.\n\t "

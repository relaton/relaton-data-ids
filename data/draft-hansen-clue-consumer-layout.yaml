  content: "   This draft is for discussion in the CLUE working group.  It proposes\n
    \  adding the ability for the consumer to provide specific information\n   to
    the provider.\n\n   This document proposes allowing consumers to include spatial\n
    \  parameters in their consumer requests to providers in order to\n   improve
    the provider's ability to assign media to streams in a way\n   that is helpful
    for rendering.  The solution proposed here is in\n   partial response to CLUE
    Task #10, Does Framework provide sufficient\n   info for receiver?\n\n\t "

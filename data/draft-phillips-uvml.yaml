  content: "   This document describes the Universal Voting Markup Language (UVML),\n
    \  a syntax for the structured representation of opinion in free text.\n   Using
    UVML, opinions can be encoded in text, image, or video, and\n   reliably interpreted
    by either human readers or automated-agents.\n   UVML supports both rating and
    ranking semantics.  Ratings may be\n   scored using symbols associated with the
    five most commonly used\n   opinion dimensions: quality(*), importance(!), outlook($),
    support-\n   opposition(+), and likelihood(%).  In addition, UVML defines a syntax\n
    \  for optionally including a demographic signature by which voters can\n   publish
    basic demographic information with their UVML votes.  The\n   design of UVML leverages
    cross-cultural sentiment and voting-systems\n   scholarship.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The \"Basic\" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not\n
    \  properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has lead to\n   a
    situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers\n   make different
    assumptions based on the locales they are running in.\n   There is little interoperability
    for the non-ASCII characters in the\n   ISO-8859-1 character set, and even less
    interoperability for any\n   characters beyond that.\n\n   This document defines
    a backwards-compatible extension to \"Basic\",\n   specifying the server's character
    encoding expectation, using a new\n   authentication scheme parameter.\n\n\t "

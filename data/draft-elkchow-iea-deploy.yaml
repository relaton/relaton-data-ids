  content: "International Email Addresses (IEA) are far from the global reality. The\ncurrent
    de-facto language of the Internet is English.  Even today, many\nof the users
    of the Internet do not speak English as their primary\nlanguage.  The next billion
    users of the Internet are likely to be even\nless familiar with English. IEA is
    probably the first application needed\nin a truly internationalized Internet.
    \  The Email Address\nInternationalization (EAI) Working Group defined the RFCs
    to support\ninternationalized email.  The time may now finally have come to develop\nbest
    practices and to discuss the deployment challenges for IEA.\n\n\t "

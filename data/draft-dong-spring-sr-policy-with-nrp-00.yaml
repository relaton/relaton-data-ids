  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each\n   consisting
    of one or more segment lists and the associated\n   information.  A Network Resource
    Partition (NRP) is a subset of the\n   network resources and associated policies
    in the underlay network,\n   which can be used to support one or a group of Enhanced
    VPN or RFC\n   9543 network slice services.  In SR networks where there are multiple\n
    \  NRPs, an SR Policy may be associated with a particular NRP.  Within\n   an
    NRP, SR Policy can be used for forwarding traffic which is mapped\n   to the NRP,
    so that the traffic can be provided with the subset of\n   network resources and
    policy of the NRP for guaranteed performance.\n   The association between SR Policy
    and NRP needs to be specified.\n\n   This document defines extensions to the SR
    Policy Architecture to\n   allow the association of the SR Policy candidate paths
    with NRPs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070] defines a\n
    \  data representation that provides a framework for sharing information\n   commonly
    exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams\n   (CSIRTs) about computer
    security incidents.  Since the IODEF model\n   includes a wealth of available
    options that can be used to describe a\n   security incident or issue, it can
    be challenging for implementers to\n   develop tools that can Leverage IODEF for
    incident sharing.  This\n   document provides guidelines for IODEF implementers.
    \ It will also\n   address how common security indicators can be represented in
    IODEF.\n   The goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption by vendors\n
    \  easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by\n   Computer
    Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.\n\n\t "

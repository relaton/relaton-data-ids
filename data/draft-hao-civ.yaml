  content: "   This document defines an extension to the INVITE header of the\n   Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) to support a Caller ID Verification\n   (CIV) method.
    \ CIV authenticates the caller ID of an incoming call\n   through a challenge-and-response
    process across both IP and non-IP\n   networks without requiring a trusted third
    party or a public key\n   infrastructure.  When receiving a call with a claimed
    phone number,\n   the called party holds the call and sends a quickly terminated
    INVITE\n   request (like a flash call) to that number, carrying a short 4-digit\n
    \  challenge embedded as part of the caller ID.  A genuine caller would\n   receive
    the challenge and respond by echoing the same digits, e.g.,\n   through DTMF (Dual-Tone
    Multi-Frequency).  The proposed extension\n   involves two changes to the INVITE
    header.  First, it adds a new\n   option tag, \"civ\", in the Supported header
    field of the INVITE\n   request.  This tag allows the calling party to indicate
    support for\n   CIV in the initial call.  Second, it adds a special value \"civ-veri-\n
    \  call\" for the Purpose parameter of the Call-Info header field.  This\n   value
    allows the called party to make a verification call, indicating\n   the purpose
    of the call is to transmit a challenge rather than\n   establish a phone conversation.
    \ CIV uses the standard Session-ID\n   header in the INVITE request to allow the
    calling party to explicitly\n   match the verification call with the initial call.
    \ Whilst this\n   document focuses on IP networks, the same CIV protocol also
    works\n   with non-IP networks (e.g., SS7) by including the \"civ\" tag, the\n
    \  \"civ-veri-call\" value and the session ID in the User-to-User\n   Information
    (UUI) parameter.\n\n\t "

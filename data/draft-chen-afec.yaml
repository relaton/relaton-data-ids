  content: "                    This document generally describes how to use an Adaptive
    Forward \n                    Error Correction (AFEC) algorithm to efficiently
    protect the \n                    compressed header vital data as well as UDP-Lite’s
    vital data for \n                    data transport in the radio-link layer of
    an error-prone wireless \n                    connection. Augmented with RoHC
    and UDP-Lite, for video \n                    transmissions over wireless channels
    in a heterogeneous wired-\n                    wireless environment, the erroneous
    packet payloads can be useful \n                    and the applications better
    able to cope with lost packets (native \n                    UDP case), by adopting
    some of the erasure and error resilient \n                    modes in the latest
    video codecs, such as H.264. The context \n                    transfer in the
    inter/intra handover is also covered. \n\n\t "

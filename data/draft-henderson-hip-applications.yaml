  content: "The Host Identity Protocol and architecture (HIP) proposes to add a\ncryptographic
    name space for network stack names.  From an\napplication viewpoint, HIP-enabled
    systems support a new address\nfamily (e.g., AF_HOST), but it may be a long time
    until such HIP-\naware applications are widely deployed even if host systems are\nupgraded.
    \ This informational document discusses implementation and\nAPI issues relating
    to using HIP in situations in which the system is\nHIP-aware but the applications
    are not.\n\t "

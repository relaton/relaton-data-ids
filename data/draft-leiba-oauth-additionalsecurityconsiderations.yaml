  content: "The Open Authentication Protocol (OAuth) specifies a security\nprotocol
    that involves significant end-user interaction -- the model\nis based on having
    the end-user approve the authorization that is\nbeing requested.  That aspect
    makes the user interaction a part of\nthe security model, and raises additional
    security considerations\nbeyond those that are typical for client/server protocols.
    \ This\ndocument describes those considerations.\n\t "

  content: "   6LoWPAN is defined in RFC 4944 in conjunction with a number of\n   specifications
    that are currently nearing completion.  The entirety\n   of these specifications
    may be hard to understand, pose specific\n   implementation problems, or be simply
    inconsistent.\n\n   The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents
    as\n   well as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in\n   combination.
    \ In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even\n   corrections to the
    specifications referenced.\n\n   This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress,
    i.e. a long-\n   lived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information
    becomes\n   available and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed.\n   Similar
    to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815, it might be\n   published as an RFC
    at some future time later in the acceptance curve\n   of the specifications.\n\n
    \  This document does not describe a new protocol or attempt to set a\n   new
    standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice in using\n   the existing
    specifications, but it may also document emerging\n   consensus where a correction
    needs to be made.\n\n   The current version -02 of this document is an early draft
    that is\n   intended to spark the further collection of relevant information.\n\n\t "

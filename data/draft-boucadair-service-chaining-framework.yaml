  content: "   IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced\n   functions
    (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions) for\n   the delivery of added
    value services.  This document defines a\n   framework to enforce Service Function
    Chaining (SFC) with minimum\n   requirements on the underlying network.\n\n   The
    proposed framework allows for Differentiated Forwarding\n   (DiffForward): packets
    are initially classified and marked at the\n   entry point of an SFC-enabled domain,
    and are then forwarded on a per\n   SF Map Index basis.\n\n\n\t "

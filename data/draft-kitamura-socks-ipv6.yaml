  content: "    This document describes three types of extensions of SOCKS Version
    5\n    protocol [RFC1928]. A new address type and a new command for Requests\n
    \   and Replies are introduced. These extensions supplement the\n    insufficient
    generic functions of the SOCKSv5 protocol.\n\n    These extensions enable a SOCKS
    server to be used as a translator for\n    IPv4 and IPv6 mixed heteregenous communications
    with ease.  In\n    addition, they make each homogeneous IPv4 and IPv6 communication\n
    \   efficient.\n\n\t "

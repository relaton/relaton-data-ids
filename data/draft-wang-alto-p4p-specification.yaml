    to work jointly and cooperatively to optimize\napplication communications.  The
    goals of this cooperation are to\nreduce network resource consumption and to accelerate
    applications.\nTo achieve these goals, P4P allows ISPs to provide network\ninformation
    and guidance to network applications, allowing clients to\nexchange data more

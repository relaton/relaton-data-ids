  content: "   The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable\n
    \  carrier-grade packet transport.\n\n   This document discusses and specifies
    the P2MP framework primarily\n   related to OAM and related management in MPLS-TP
    networks. This\n   document mainly refers to RFC5654 and RFC6371. The main focus
    is on\n   the details that are not covered or not clarified in relevant RFCs\n
    \  such as RFC5654, RFC5860, RFC5921, RFC5951, RFC6371, and RFC7167.\n\n   Note:
    This I-D was made and updated including the discussions in\n   ITU-T SG15, which
    were described in Liaison Statements such as\n   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1235/)\n\n
    \  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task\n   Force (IETF)
    / International Telecommunications Union\n   Telecommunications Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include\n   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3\n   architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a\n   packet transport network.\n\n\n\n\t "

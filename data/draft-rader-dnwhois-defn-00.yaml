  script: Latn
  content: "Efforts are currently being undertaken to review the role of Whois \n(as
    defined in RFC 954 [2] and formalize registry/registrar \ncommunications protocols
    in light of the current and evolving scope \nand utility of DNS, domain name registries
    and related entities. In \norder for this work to be truly effective and broadly
    applicable, it \nis important that accepted definitions act as the foundation.
    This \ndocument is an attempt to create a starting point for the requisite \ndialogue
    that will ultimately foster the determination and \nacceptance of these definitions.
    \ \n\n\t "

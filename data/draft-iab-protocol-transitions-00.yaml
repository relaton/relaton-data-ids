  content: "   Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol,\n
    \  we have seen a number of transitions, throughout the protocol stack,\n   from
    one protocol or technology to another.  Many protocols and\n   technologies were
    not designed to enable smooth transition to\n   alternatives or to easily deploy
    extensions, and thus some\n   transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6, have
    been difficult.\n   This document attempts to summarize some basic principles
    to enable\n   future transitions, and also summarizes what makes for a good\n
    \  transition plan.\n\n\t "

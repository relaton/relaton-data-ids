  content: "       ALC and FLUTE are reliable content delivery protocols designed
    mainly \n       for scalable multicast distribution. However, this does not preclude
    \n       their deployment in the Unicast distribution mode over connectionless
    \n       or connection-oriented transport protocols. A method for framing ALC
    \n       and FLUTE packets onto connection-oriented transport is presented. A
    \n       definition of the descriptors of the framing method for those \n       protocols
    is also given.    \n\n\t "

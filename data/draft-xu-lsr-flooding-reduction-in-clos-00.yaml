  content: "   For a given OSPF (or ISIS) router within the CLOS topology, it would\n
    \  receive multiple copies of exactly the same LSA (or LSP) from\n   multiple
    OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors.  In addition, two OSPF (or ISIS)\n   neighbors may send
    each other the same LSA (or LSP) simultaneously.\n   The unnecessary link-state
    information flooding wastes the precious\n   process resource of OSPF (or ISIS)
    routers.  This document proposes\n   extensions to OSPF (or ISIS) so as to reduce
    the OSPF (or ISIS)\n   flooding within such CLOS networks.  The reduction of the
    OSPF (or\n   ISIS) flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of CLOS\n
    \  networks.\n\n\n\t "

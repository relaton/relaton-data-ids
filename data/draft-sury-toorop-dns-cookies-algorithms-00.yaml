  content: "   [RFC7873] left the construction of Server Cookies to the discretion\n
    \  of the DNS Server (implementer) which has resulted in a gallimaufry\n   of
    different implementations.  As a result, DNS Cookies are\n   impractical to deploy
    on multi-vendor anycast networks, because the\n   Server Cookie constructed by
    one implementation cannot be validated\n   by another.\n\n   This document provides
    precise directions for creating Server Cookies\n   to address this issue.  Furthermore,
    [FNV] is obsoleted as a suitable\n   Hash function for calculating DNS Cookies.
    \ [SipHash-2.4] is\n   introduced as a new REQUIRED Hash function for calculating
    DNS\n   Cookies.\n\n   This document updates [RFC7873]\n\n\t "

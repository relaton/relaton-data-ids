  content: "Mobile IPv6 defines a set of signaling messages that enable the mobile
    node (MN) to authenticate and perform registration with its home agent (HA).  These
    authentication signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent are secured
    by an IPsec security association (SA) that is established between the MN and HA.
    \ The MIP6 working group has specified a mechanism to secure the Binding Update
    (BU) and Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) messages using an authentication option,
    similar to the authentication option in Mobile IPv4, carried within the signaling
    messages that are exchanged between the MN and HA to establish a binding.  This
    document provides the justifications as to why the authentication option mechanism
    is needed for Mobile IPv6 deployment in certain environments.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

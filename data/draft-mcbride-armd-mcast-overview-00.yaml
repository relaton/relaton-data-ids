abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts
    of\n   hosts in the data center.  There was a discussion, in ARMD, involving\n
    \  the issues with address resolution for non ARP/ND multicast traffic\n   in
    data centers with massive number of hosts.  This document provides\n   a quick
    survey of multicast in the data center and should serve as an\n   aid to further
    discussion of issues related to large amounts of\n   multicast in the data center.\n\n\t "

  content: "Mobile IPv6 [1] allows a MN to maintain its IPv6 communications while\n
    \  moving between subnets.  This document presents the problematic for a\n   MN
    that has multiple network interfaces.  It discusses how to perform\n   vertical
    handovers (flow redirection between interfaces) and propose\n   MMI (Mobile IPv6
    for Multiple Interfaces) which describes the use of\n   Mobile IPv6 to support
    multiple interfaces.  One one hand, these\n   extensions focus on the MN ability
    to use a backup interface for\n   communications and on the other hand to spread
    flows between the MN\n   own interfaces.\n\t "

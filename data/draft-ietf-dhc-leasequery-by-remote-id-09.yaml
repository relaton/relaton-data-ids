  script: Latn
  content: "Some relay agents extract lease information from the DHCP messages exchanged
    between the client and DHCP server.  This lease information is used by relay agents
    for various purposes like antispoofing and prevention of flooding.  RFC 4388 defines
    a mechanism for relay agents to retrieve the lease information from the DHCP server
    when this information is lost.  The existing lease query mechanism is data-driven,
    which means that a relay agent can initiate the lease query only when it starts
    receiving data to and from the clients.  In certain scenarios, this model is not
    scalable.  This document first looks at issues in the existing mechanism and then
    proposes a new query type, query by Remote ID, to address these issues. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

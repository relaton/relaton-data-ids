  content: "   This document defines a mechanism for TLS servers to request, and TLS\n
    \  clients to provide, Privacy Pass tokens as part of the Encrypted\n   Client
    Hello in the TLS handshake.  This creates a way to add support\n   for anonymous
    attestation and rate-limiting to servers that are\n   enforcing denial-of-service
    protections as part of processing TLS\n   handshakes.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n   improvements
    in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers.\n\n   This memo suggests that the existing
    threat model, while important\n   and still valid, is no longer alone sufficient
    to cater for the\n   pressing security issues in the Internet.  For instance,
    it is also\n   necessary to protect systems against endpoints that are compromised,\n
    \  malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with the interests\n   of
    the users.  While such protection is difficult, there are some\n   measures that
    can be taken.\n\n   It is particularly important to ensure that as we continue
    to develop\n   Internet technology, non-communications security related threats
    are\n   properly understood.  While the consideration of these issues is\n   relatively
    new in the IETF, this memo provides some initial ideas\n   about potential broader
    threat models to consider when designing\n   protocols for the Internet or when
    trying to defend against pervasive\n   monitoring.  Further down the road, updated
    threat models could\n   result in changes in RFC 3552 (guidelines for writing
    security\n   considerations) and RFC 7258 (pervasive monitoring), to include\n
    \  proper consideration of non-communications security threats.  It may\n   also
    be necessary to have dedicated guidance on how systems design\n   and architecture
    affects security.\n\n\t "

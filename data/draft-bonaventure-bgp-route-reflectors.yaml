  content: "The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the standard interdomain\n   routing
    protocol in the Internet. Inside an Autonomous System (AS),\n   the interdomain
    routes are often distributed by using BGP Route\n   Reflectors (RR). Today, most
    RR are simple BGP routers. We show that\n   by adding intelligence to the RR,
    it is possible to improve both the\n   routing and the packet forwarding in ASes.
    We show how a versatile RR\n   can help an AS to engineer the flow of its incoming
    or outgoing\n   interdomain traffic. We also discuss how a versatile RR could
    help to\n   reduce the BGP convergence time or reduce the size of the routing\n
    \  tables when  providing BGP/MPLS VPN services.\n\t "

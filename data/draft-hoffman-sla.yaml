abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "SLA is a new IKEv2 exchange that reuses most of the features of the\nIKEv2
    Initial (Phase 1) exchange but allows for legacy authentication\nthat is not susceptible
    to man-in-the-middle attacks. It has a flexible\nnumber of messages based on the
    type of authentication being used, and\nis extensible for new authentication mechanisms.
    SLA will work with\nremote access configuration in the same way as IKEv2's Initial
    exchange.\n\n\t "

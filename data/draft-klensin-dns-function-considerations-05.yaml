- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The basic design of the Domain Name System was completed almost 30 years
    ago.  The last half of that period has been characterized by significant changes
    in requirements and expectations, some of which either require changes to how
    the DNS is used or can be accommodated only poorly or not at all.  This document
    asks the question of whether it is time to either redesign and replace the DNS
    to match contemporary requirements and expectations (rather than continuing to
    try to design and implement incremental patches that are not fully satisfactory)
    or draw some clear lines about functionality that is not really needed or that
    should be performed in some other way.\n\t "

  content: "   Along as the adoption of TCP/IP in increasingly emerging scenarios,\n
    \  challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure.  To\n   still
    enable TCP/IP for networks that previously using exclusive\n   protocols, a flexible
    address structure would be highly preferred for\n   their particular properties.
    \ This document describes well-recognized\n   scenarios that typically require
    a flexible address structure, and\n   states the requirements of such flexible
    address structure.\n\n\t "

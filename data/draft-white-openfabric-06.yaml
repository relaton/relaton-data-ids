  content: "   Spine and leaf topologies are widely used in hyperscale and cloud\n
    \  scale networks.  In most of these networks, configuration is\n   automated,
    but difficult, and topology information is extracted\n   through broad based connections.
    \ Policy is often integrated into the\n   control plane, as well, making configuration,
    management, and\n   troubleshooting difficult.  Openfabric is an adaptation of
    an\n   existing, widely deployed link state protocol, Intermediate System to\n
    \  Intermediate System (IS-IS) that is designed to:\n\n   o  Provide a full view
    of the topology from a single point in the\n      network to simplify operations\n\n
    \  o  Minimize configuration of each Intermediate System (IS) (also\n      called
    a router or switch) in the network\n\n   o  Optimize the operation of IS-IS within
    a spine and leaf fabric to\n      enable scaling\n\n   This document begins with
    an overview of openfabric, including a\n   description of what may be removed
    from IS-IS to enable scaling.  The\n   document then describes an optimized adjacency
    formation process; an\n   optimized flooding scheme; some thoughts on the operation
    of\n   openfabric, metrics, and aggregation; and finally a description of\n   the
    changes to the IS-IS protocol required for openfabric.\n\n\t "

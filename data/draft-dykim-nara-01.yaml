- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed.\n
    \  The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous domains, each\n   being
    a collection of nodes.  Each domain is named by a global\n   address whereas each
    node by a local address.  Inter-domain routing\n   depends solely on domain addresses
    while intra-domain routing on node\n   addresses.  Routing based on node or domain
    addresses render inherent\n   mobility as well as seamless multi-homing capability.
    \ The model can\n   recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the
    network,\n   enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well\n
    \  as body area networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "Some IPv6 applications obtain IPv4 address literals and want to\ncommunicate
    with those IPv4 hosts through an IPv6/IPv4 translator.\nThe IPv6 application can
    send an IPv6 packet through the translator\nif it knows the IPv6 prefix of the
    IPv6/IPv4 translator.  In many\nIPv6/IPv4 translation deployments, that IPv6 prefix
    is not fixed;\nrather, the prefix is chosen by the network operator.  This\nspecification
    provides three methods for a host to learn the IPv6\nprefix of its IPv6/IPv4 translator.
    \ Unicast, any-source multicast\n(ASM), and source-specific multicast (SSM) are
    supported.\n\t "

  content: "In order to create forwarding state for a FEC received from a downstream\nLSR,
    LDP requires the presence of a matching entry in the routing table.\nThis document
    describes a mechanism that allows the creation of LDP\nsignaled LSPs for prefixes
    which are not present in the routing table.\nThis draft is applicable to address
    prefix FECs and host FECs associated\nwith either IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes.\n\t "

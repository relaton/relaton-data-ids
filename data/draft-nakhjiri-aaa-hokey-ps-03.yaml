  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a framework for\nperforming
    authentication and key management using the AAA\ninfrastructure.  The framework
    deals with a model which includes a\npeer, a pass-through authenticator and a
    backend authentication\nserver.\n\nSome of the emerging mobile networks use EAP
    in handover scenarios in\nways that go beyond currently defined EAP keying framework.
    \ This\ndocument provides a problem statement for the usage of EAP in these\nemerging
    mobile networks.\n\t "

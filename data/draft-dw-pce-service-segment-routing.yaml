  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages the source routing and\n
    \  tunneling paradigms where a source node can choose a path without\n   relying
    on hop-by-hop signaling.\n\n   This document specifies extensions to the Path
    Computation Element\n   Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and
    instantiate\n   SR-TE paths that also have a local service segments involved.\n\n\t "

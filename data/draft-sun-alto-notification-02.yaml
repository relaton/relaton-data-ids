  content: "The cooperation between Internet application and network enhances not\nonly
    the efficiency of network transportation but also the experiences\nof end users.
    To design the information exchanging protocol and\narchitecture that facilitate
    such cooperation is the objective of\nApplication-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    working group.\n\nCurrently, ALTO protocol adopts an efficient query/response
    message\nbased on the prevalent http protocol. However, such protocol cannot\nsupport
    rapid dispatch of ALTO information. Noted that many scenarios\nrequire the updated
    network information to be dispatched to clients as\nsoon as possible, such as
    when part of the network is congested, when a\nnew policy is to be deployed urgently,
    or when unexpected network\nmaintenance is required. To tackle such problem, this
    draft proposed a\nserver notification extension to the original query/response
    mechanism.\n\t "

  content: "   Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables services to be delivered by\n
    \  selective traffic steering through an ordered set of service\n   functions.
    \ Once classified into an SFC, the traffic for a given flow\n   is steered through
    all the service functions of the SFC for the life\n   of the traffic flow even
    though this is often not necessary.\n   Steering traffic to service functions
    only while required and not\n   otherwise, leads to optimal SFCs with improved
    latencies, reduced\n   resource consumption and better user experience.\n\n   This
    document describes the rationale, techniques and necessary\n   protocol extensions
    to achieve such optimization.\n\n\t "

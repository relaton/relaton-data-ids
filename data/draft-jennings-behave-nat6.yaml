abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This specification defines a NAT that allows IPv6-only hosts that are\ninside
    the NAT to operate with IPv4 hosts that are outside the NAT.\nIt requires no modifications
    to the v4 hosts or applications, or to\nthe operating system of v6 hosts, but
    it does require some changes to\nv6 applications.  Typically this specification
    would be used to allow\nthe hosts inside a NAT to connect to hosts outside it;
    but under some\nlimitations, it can also allow hosts outside to connect to hosts\ninside.\n\nThe
    goal of this draft is to consider what is the minimal feasible\napproach to this
    problem.  The current intention is to merge this\nwith the nat64 draft.  This
    draft is being discussed on the\nbehave@ietf.org list.\n\t "

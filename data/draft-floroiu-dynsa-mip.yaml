- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv4 base protocol\n[RFC2002]
    enabling mobile nodes and mobility agents to dynamically\nsetup security associations.
    Mobile IP is therefore employed as a\nsupporting protocol for SA negotiation.
    The proposed mechanism is\nbased on RSA cryptography [RSA78], entities acting
    as key\ndistribution centers and Diffie-Hellman exchanges [DH76].\n\n\t "

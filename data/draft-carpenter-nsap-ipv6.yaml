  content: "This document recommends that network implementors who have planned or
    deployed an OSI NSAP addressing plan, and who wish to deploy or transition to
    IPv6, should redesign a native IPv6 addressing plan to meet their needs.  However,
    it also defines a set of mechanisms for the support of OSI NSAP addressing in
    an IPv6 network.  These mechanisms are the ones that MUST be used if such support
    is required.  This document also defines a mapping of IPv6 addresses within the
    OSI address format, should this be required.                                                                  DISCUSSION

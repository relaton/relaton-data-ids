abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "     This document identifies the situations where a signature\n     verification
    fails in a recursive security aware DNS server, and\n     how DNS servers should
    handle these cases, and the errors that\n     should be reported to DNS resolvers.
    \ This document proposes a new\n     error to be returned by DNSSEC capable servers.\n
    \n     A DNSSEC server acting as a recursive server MUST validate the\n     signatures
    on RRsets in a response it passes on; this draft\n     addresses the case when
    the data it receives fails signature\n     verification.  The end resolver must
    be notified of this occurence\n     in such a way that it will not confuse it
    with another error.\n\n\t "

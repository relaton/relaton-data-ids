abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Historically, Internet Standards have been characterized by three\nprimary
    criteria: the specifications are stable, implementations of\nthem have been demonstrated
    to be interoperable, and they have\nachieved sufficient deployment to be considered
    useful.  The IETF has\ndeveloped specific rules for determining whether those
    criteria have\nbeen met, but the rules and their implementation have sometimes
    not\nadequately reflected those underlying criteria.  The result has been\nthat
    the application of the rules has not resulted in STDs for all\nprotocols that
    meet the underlying criteria.  This document proposes\na process experiment to
    reclassify standards-track documents whose\ninteroperability and utility have
    been demonstrated by the fact of\ndeployment and use in products being used by
    Internet users.\n\n\t "

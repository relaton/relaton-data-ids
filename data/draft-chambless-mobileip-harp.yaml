  content: "This document presents a protocol called the Home Agent Redundancy\n   Protocol
    or HARP.  HARP is an optional extension to Mobile-IP [RFC-\n   2002].  Mobile-IP
    includes the notion of a Home Agent which is\n   a host located on the home IP
    subnet for Mobile Nodes.  Home Agents\n   forward packets to Mobile Nodes that
    are away from home.  Since Mobile\n   Nodes are dependent on the Home Agent for
    connectivity when away from\n   home, the Home Agent represents a possible single
    source of failure for\n   the Mobile IP system.\n \n   HARP is a protocol which
    allows a pair (or set) of Home Agents\n   to cooperate and share Mobile-IP Mobile
    Node registration\n   information.  If one of the HARP peers should fail, the
    Mobile-IP\n   system will not necessarily fail, hence HARP introduces Home\n   Agent
    redundancy into the Mobile-IP system.  Mobile Nodes are\n   not aware that HARP
    exists, so HARP requires no changes to\n   Mobile-IP as a protocol.  In this document,
    we present the HARP\n   architecture and protocol.\n\t "

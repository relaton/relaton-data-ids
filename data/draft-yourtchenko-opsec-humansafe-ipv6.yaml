  content: "   Although the IPv6 address space within a single /64 subnet is very\n
    \  large, the typical distribution of the addresses in this space is\n   very
    non-uniform.  This non-uniformity, together with the dictionary-\n   based DNS
    brute-force enumeration, allows practical remote mapping of\n   the IPv6 addresses
    in these subnets.  This document proposes a\n   technique which can be used to
    decrease the exposure of the server\n   subnets to trivial scanning.  As a side
    effect, the proposed\n   technique allows to drastically simplify the address
    management.\n\n\t "

  content: "In delayed authentication in DHCPv6[RFC3315], the hardware \nidentifier
    is used to select the key, and the key is exchanged \nbetween the server and the
    client in advance. Therefore, when a user \ntries to use a new device, it is necessary
    to add key information to \nthe new device and DHCPv6 servers.  \nIn this document,
    we propose a procedure for introducing \nCHAP[RFC1994] into the DHCPv6 authentication
    procedure. This \nprocedure allows the client get the host configuration information
    \nrelated to the user and exchanges a secret key to use in later \nsequence.\n\t "

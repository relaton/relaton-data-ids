  content: "   This document is intended to introduce the challenges to overcome\n
    \  when network management problems may require to couple with AI\n   solutions.
    \ On the one hand, there are many difficult problems in\n   Network Management
    that to this date have no good solutions, or where\n   any solutions come with
    significant limitations and constraints.\n   Artificial Intelligence may help
    produce novel solutions to those\n   problems.  On the other hand, for several
    reasons (computational\n   costs of AI solutions, privacy of data), distribution
    of AI tasks\n   became primordial.  It is thus also expected that network SHOULD
    be\n   operated efficiently to support those tasks.\n\n   To identify the right
    set of challenges, the document defines a\n   method based on the evolution and
    nature of NM problems.  This will\n   be done in parallel with advances and the
    nature of existing\n   solutions in AI in order to highlight where AI and NM have
    been\n   already coupled together or could benefit from a higher integration.\n
    \  So, the method aims at evaluating the gap between NM problems and AI\n   solutions.
    \ Challenges are derived accordingly, assuming solving\n   these challenges will
    help to reduce the gap between NM and AI.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification provides a general framework for the use of\n   assertions
    as client credentials and/or authorization grants with\n   OAuth 2.0.  It includes
    a generic mechanism for transporting\n   assertions during interactions with a
    token endpoint, as wells as\n   rules for the content and processing of those
    assertions.  The intent\n   is to provide an enhanced security profile by using
    derived values\n   such as signatures or HMACs, as well as facilitate the use
    of OAuth\n   2.0 in client-server integration scenarios where the end-user may
    not\n   be present.\n\n   This specification only defines abstract messsage flow
    and assertion\n   content.  Actual use requires implementation of a companion
    protocol\n   binding specification.  Additional profile documents provide standard\n
    \  representations in formats such as SAML and JWT.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support\n
    \  some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent\n   performance
    requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the\n   overlay VPN and a particular
    set of resources in the underlay\n   network.  A Virtual Transport Network (VTN)
    is a virtual underlay\n   network which has a customized network topology and
    a set of network\n   resources allocated from the physical network.  A VTN could
    be used\n   to support one or a group of VPN+ services.\n\n   When Segment Routing
    is used as the data plane to provide VTNs, each\n   VTN can be allocated with
    a group of SIDs to identify the topology\n   and resource attributes of network
    segments in the VTN.  The\n   association between the network topology, the network
    resource\n   attributes and the SR SIDs may need to be distributed to a\n   centralized
    network controller.  For network scenarios where each VTN\n   can be identified
    by a unique Flex-Algo ID, this document describes a\n   mechanism to distribute
    the information of SR based VTNs using BGP-LS\n   with Flex-Algo.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines SIP extensions for session recording to meet\nthe
    requirements in the \"Requirements for SIP-based Media Recording\n(SIPREC)\" document.
    \ In particular, mechanisms to allow SIP elements\nto distinguish between the
    Recording Session and the Communication\nSession.  Also a mechanism for a UA to
    learn that the communication\nsession is being recorded is proposed.  The Metadata
    about the\nsession is not covered by this document.  SIP feature tags 'srs',\n'src',
    and 'recorded' are defined to identify the Session Recording\nServer, Session
    Recording Client, and the presence of recording in\nthe communication session.\n\t "

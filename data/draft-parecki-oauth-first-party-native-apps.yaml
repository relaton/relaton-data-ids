  content: "   This document defines the Authorization Challenge Endpoint, which\n
    \  supports a first-party native client that wants to control the\n   process
    of obtaining authorization from the user using a native\n   experience.\n\n   In
    many cases, this can provide an entirely browserless OAuth 2.0\n   experience
    suited for native applications, only delegating to the\n   browser in unexpected,
    high risk, or error conditions.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a new streaming report block for the Extended \nReport
    (XR) packet type for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [1].  \nXR packets are an
    extension to the reception report blocks of RTCP \nsender report (SR) or Receiver
    Report (RR) packets. In [1] seven report \nblocks are defined to receive various
    information that helps the sender \nto monitor the network and assess quality
    of VoIP delivery. In this \ndocument we define a new report block for the XR packet,
    namely the \nstreaming report block, to receive statistics about the quality of
    an \naudio and/or video streaming session.\n\t "

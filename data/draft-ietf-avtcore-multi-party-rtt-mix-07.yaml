  content: "   Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify the\n
    \  source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be\n   presented
    by endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the\n   same source.\n\n
    \  Regional regulatory requirements specify provision of real-time text\n   in
    multi-party calls.  RFC 4103 mixer implementations can use\n   traditional RTP
    functions for source identification, but the mixer\n   source switching performance
    is limited when using the default\n   transmission with redundancy.\n\n   Enhancements
    for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing is provided in this\n   document, suitable
    for a centralized conference model that enables\n   source identification and
    source switching.  The intended use is for\n   real-time text mixers and multi-party-aware
    participant endpoints.\n   Two mechanisms are provided.  The mechanisms builds
    on use of the\n   CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification.  One
    method\n   makes use of the same \"text/red\" format as for two-party sessions,\n
    \  while the other makes use of an extended packet format \"text/rex\" for\n   more
    efficient transmission.\n\n   A capability exchange is specified so that it can
    be verified that a\n   participant can handle the multi-party coded real-time
    text stream.\n   The capability for one method is by use of a media attribute
    a=rtt-\n   mix-rtp-mixer.  The other method is indicated by the media subtype\n
    \  \"text/rex\".\n\n   The document updates RFC 4102[RFC4102] and RFC 4103[RFC4103]\n\n
    \  A brief description about how a mixer can format text for the case\n   when
    the endpoint is not multi-party aware is also provided.\n\n\t "

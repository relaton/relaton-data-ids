  content: "   This document describes a set of strategies to allow clients to\n   submit
    new email messages incorporating content which resides on\n   locations external
    to the client.  This is the so-called 'IMAP\n   Pull' approach currently being
    considered by the LEMONADE working\n   group as one solution to the 'forward without
    download' problem\n   (that is, as a means for clients to send new messages consisting
    of\n   or containing all or parts of previously received messages without\n   having
    to download and upload the data).  Some of the strategies\n   in this document
    rely upon extensions to other protocols;\n   specifically URLAUTH and CATENATE
    in the IMAP protocol (RFC 3501)\n   and BURL in the SUBMIT protocol (RFC 2476).\n\t "

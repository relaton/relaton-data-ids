  content: "Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securing\nNeighbor
    Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats.  As\nspecified today, SEND
    assumes that the node advertising an address is\nthe owner of the address and
    is in possession of the private key used\nto generate the digital signature on
    the message.  This means that\nthe Proxy ND signaling initiated by nodes that
    do not possess\nknowledge of the address owner's private key cannot be secured
    using\nSEND.  This document extends the current SEND specification with\nsupport
    for Proxy ND, the Secure Proxy ND Support for SEND.\n\t "

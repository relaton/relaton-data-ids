abstract:
- content: "<p>The early policy for the RFC Series was that RFCs could only contain
    characters from the ASCII character set. Later policy, from RFC 7997, allowed
    more characters and enforced an encoding for RFCs of UTF-8. Since RFC 7997 was
    published, the IETF community has had much more experience of using non-ASCII
    characters in RFCs. The policy for the RFC Series is that all displayable text
    is allowed as long as the reader of an RFC can interpret that text. This policy
    does not change language policy of the RFC Series, namely that English is the
    required language for the series. This document obsoletes RFC 7997 and updates
    the RFC Style Guide (RFC 7322). [[ A repository for this draft can be found here
    (https://github.com/ paulehoffman/7997bis). ]]</p>"

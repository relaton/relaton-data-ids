  content: "   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n   improvements
    in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers.\n   Privacy has also been a key focus
    area, and understanding the privacy\n   implications of new Internet technology
    is an important factor when\n   IETF works on such technologies.  One key aspect
    of privacy is\n   minimization of data disclosed to other parties.\n\n   This
    document highlights the need for a particular focus with respect\n   to data minimization.
    \ Avoiding data leakage to outside parties is of\n   course important, but it
    can also be necessary to limit it among the\n   primary protocol participants.\n\n
    \  This is because is necessary to protect against endpoints that are\n   compromised,
    malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with\n   the interests of users.
    \ It is important to consider the role of a\n   participant and limit any data
    provided to it according to that role.\n\n\t "

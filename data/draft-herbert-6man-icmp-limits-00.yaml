- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Network nodes may discards packets if they are unable to process\n
    \  protocol headers of packets due to processing constraints or limits.\n   When
    such packets are dropped, the sender receives no indication so\n   it cannot take
    action to address the cause of discarded packets. This\n   document defines ICMP
    errors that can be sent by a node that discards\n   packets because it is unable
    to process the protocol headers. A\n   sender that receives such an ICMP error
    may be able to modify what it\n   sends in future packets to avoid subsequent
    packet discards.\n\n\t "

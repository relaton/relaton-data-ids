  content: "   When using a hyperlink to fetch a resource from the Internet, it is\n
    \  often useful to know if the resource has changed since the data was\n   published.
    \ Cryptographic hashes, such as SHA-256, are often used to\n   determine if published
    data has changed in unexpected ways.  Due to\n   the nature of most hyperlinks,
    the cryptographic hash is often\n   published separately from the link itself.
    \ This specification\n   describes a data model and serialization formats for
    expressing\n   cryptographically protected hyperlinks.  The mechanisms described
    in\n   the document enables a system to publish a hyperlink in a way that\n   empowers
    a consuming application to determine if the resource\n   associated with the hyperlink
    has changed in unexpected ways.\n\n\t "

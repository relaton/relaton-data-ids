  content: "This memo specifies a high-level application-oriented interface to\nthe
    Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) Architecture.  The\nabstract interface
    models the RTFM architecture while hiding many of\nthe details not relevant to
    an application programmer who want to\nintegrate IP traffic measurements into
    an application. Particularly\nthe interaction between manager, reader, and meter
    is hidden by the\ninterface, and rule sets used for traffic measurement specification\nare
    replaced by simpler data structures. Furthermore, the RTFM\ninterface supports
    complex actions like modifying a traffic\nmeasurement specification while it is
    already being applied. The\ninterface is defined in an abstract way.  It can be
    implemented by an\napplication programming interface as well as by a network protocol.\n\t "

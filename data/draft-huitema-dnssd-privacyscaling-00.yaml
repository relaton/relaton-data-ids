  content: "   DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information about\n
    \  both the devices offering services and the devices requesting\n   services.
    \ This information includes host names, network parameters,\n   and possibly a
    further description of the corresponding service\n   instance.  Especially when
    mobile devices engage in DNS Service\n   Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public
    hotspot, a serious privacy\n   problem arises.\n\n   The draft currently progressing
    in the DNSSD Working Group assumes\n   peer-to-peer pairing between the service
    to be discovered and each of\n   its client.  This has good security properties,
    but create scaling\n   issues.  Each server needs to publish as many announcements
    as it has\n   paired clients.  Each client needs to process all announcements
    from\n   all servers present in the network.  This leads to large number of\n
    \  operations when each server is paired with many clients.\n\n   Different designs
    are possible.  For example, if there was only one\n   server \"discovery key\"
    known by each authorized client, each server\n   would only have to announce a
    single record, and clients would only\n   have to process one response for each
    server that is present on the\n   network.  Yet, these designs will present different
    privacy profiles,\n   and pose different management challenges.  This draft analyses
    the\n   tradeoffs between privacy and scaling in a set of different designs,\n
    \  using either shared secrets or public keys.\n\n\t "

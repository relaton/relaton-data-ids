  content: "   This document defines a protocol that facilitates integration of\n
    \  tools into the design and run-time operations of AI Agents.  The\n   focus
    is on enterprise AI agents that need to make use of APIs\n   exposed by third
    party providers.  This protocol, called the Agent-\n   to-Tool (A2T) Protocol
    defines an OpenAI spec that has two principle\n   features - enumeration of tools
    and invocation of tools.  The\n   enumeration API enables a human - the AI Agent
    designer employed by\n   the enterprise - to select and include tools from third-party
    vendors\n   into operating procedures (also known as skills or instructions)\n
    \  which direct the behavior of AI Agents, including how and when to\n   invoke
    those tools.  The enumeration API can also be used\n   (optionally) at run-time
    for the LLM to obtain tool descriptions.\n   The second feature of the API - invocation
    - allows the AI Agent\n   executor to perform the inter-domain invocation of the
    tool at run\n   time.  By standardizing these two API functions, the time and
    cost of\n   integration of Internet APIs into AI Agents can be reduced.\n\n\t "

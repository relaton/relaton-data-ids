  content: "   The US-CERT alert (TA04-111A) shows that the well-known weakness in\n
    \  TCP's segment acceptance test is easier to exploit than previously\n   thought.
    \ While there are already mechanisms, such as RFC 2385 for\n   BGP and IPSEC,
    to defend against this kind of attack, we propose a\n   light weight method making
    use of TCP timestamp (RFC 1323) option as\n   an alternative.\n\t "

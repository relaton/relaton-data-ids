  script: Latn
  content: "   Since network operators are commonly assigned at least /48 IPv6\n   address
    prefixes, the operators and standards occasionally find\n   opportunities to devise
    addressing schemes that further assign\n   operational semantics to less significant
    bit ranges.  There is\n   currently no standard or interoperable textual representation
    of\n   addresses sharing bit patterns that are not prefixes.  This RFC\n   introduces
    IPv6 Address/Mask notation that allows one to represent\n   address groupings
    beyond \"all addresses that share a single prefix\".\n   The representation is
    similar to the IPv4 address/mask notation in\n   its expressiveness, but it is
    derived from the familiar address/\n   prefix-length notation for clarity and
    compatibility with existing\n   parsers.\n\n   For example, using this representation,
    both 2001:db8::/32 and\n   2001:db8:://ffff:ffff:: have the same meaning.  However,
    a group of\n   addresses having the first 32 bits \"2001:0db8::\" and the last
    16 bits\n   \"::1234\" requires the new representation:\n   2001:db8::1234//ffff:ffff::ffff
    or, equivalently,\n   2001:db8::1234//32+::ffff.\n\n\t "

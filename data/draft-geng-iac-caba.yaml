  content: "   [RFC5286] introduces Loop-Free Criterion (LFC) in detail, which is
    a\n   technology for local fast rerouting when network failures occur.\n   With
    LFC, alternate next hops are stored alongside with the default\n   next hops in
    a routers forwarding table, and can be immediately\n   activated to invoke a loop
    free repair path in face of link failure.\n   As long as not introducing routing
    loops, these alternative next hops\n   can also be used for multipath transmission
    if there are stringent\n   demands on bandwidth or load balancing.  However, in
    such link state\n   networks, computing loop free alternates typically requires
    one or\n   more rounds of full shortest path tree computation on a graph, and\n
    \  poses a heavy burden to both the processor load and the memory\n   consumption
    of a network equipment.  In this document, we describe an\n   efficient Loop-free
    Criterion (LFC) implementation method which is\n   based on incremental shortest
    path first (i-SPF), which is suitable\n   for practical deployment in large scale
    networks.  The computational\n   complexity of the method is independent of the
    average node degree of\n   the network.\n\n\t "

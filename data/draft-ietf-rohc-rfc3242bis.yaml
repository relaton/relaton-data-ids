  content: "This document defines a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile for compression
    of IP/UDP/RTP (Internet Protocol/User Datagram Protocol/Real-Time Transport Protocol)
    packets, utilizing functionality provided by the lower layers to increase compression
    efficiency by completely eliminating the header for most packets during optimal
    operation.  The profile is built as an extension to the ROHC RTP profile.  It
    defines additional mechanisms needed in ROHC, states requirements on the assisting
    layer to guarantee transparency, and specifies general logic for compression and
    decompression related to the usage of the header-free packet format.  This document
    is a replacement for RFC 3242, which it obsoletes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   Misconfiguration and malicious manipulation of BGP AS_Path may lead\n
    \  to route hijack.  This document proposes to enhance the BGP [RFC4271]\n   Inbound/
    Outbound route processing in the case of detecting an AS\n   loop.  It is an enhancement
    to the current BGP's Inbound/Outbound\n   processing and can be implemented directly
    on the device, and this\n   document also proposes a centralized usecase.  This
    could empower\n   networks to quickly and accurately figure out they're being\n
    \  victimized.\n\n   Two options are proposed for the enhancement, a) a local
    check at the\n   device; b) data collection/analysis at the remote network controller/\n
    \  server.  Both approaches are beneficial for route hijack detection.\n\n\n\t "

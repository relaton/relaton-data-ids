  content: "   DiffServ mechanisms have been developed to support Quality of Service\n
    \  (QoS).  However, the level of assurance that can be provided with\n   DiffServ
    without substantial over-provisioning is limited.  Pre-\n   Congestion Notification
    (PCN) investigates the use of per-flow\n   admission control to provide the required
    service guarantees for the\n\n   admitted traffic.  While admission control will
    protect the QoS under\n   normal operating conditions, an additional flow pre-emption
    mechanism\n   is necessary in the times of heavy congestion (e.g. caused by route\n
    \  changes due to link or node failure).\n\n   This document provides a problem
    statement on the addition of flow\n   admission control and flow pre-emption functionality
    to a DiffServ\n   network, in particular for the support of real time services
    such as\n   voice and video.\n\n\t "

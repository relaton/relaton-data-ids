- language: en

  content: "The purpose of this draft is to describe a methodology specific to \nthe
    benchmarking of MPLS forwarding devices. The scope of this \nbenchmarking will
    be limited to various types of packet-forwarding \nand delay measurements. It
    builds upon the tenets set forth in \n \n \n RFC2544 [RFC2544], RFC1242 [RFC1242]
    and other IETF Benchmarking \nMethodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts.  This
    document seeks to \nextend these efforts to the MPLS paradigm.\n\t "

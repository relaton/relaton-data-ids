abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   ''mtrace'' [1] is a very useful tool for diagnosing IP multicast rout-\n
    \  ing problems, such as multicast routing loops and misconfigured mul-\n   ticast
    routers, associated with source-rooted RPF-based distribution\n   trees.\n \n
    \  For ''mtrace'' to be useful in a shared tree environment (e.g. PIM [2],\n   CBT
    [3], GUM [4]) its behaviour must be modified. This draft speci-\n   fies that
    behaviour, which is sufficiently general to be applicable\n   to all shared tree
    types and operating modes.  A new ''wildcard'' mode\n   of behaviour is also described,
    which allows a trace of a complete\n   shared tree.  Authentication is recommended
    in this mode because of\n   its potential as a vehicle for denial of service attacks.\n
    \n   It is intended that this draft become a document of the Mbone Deploy-\n   ment
    (mboned) working group of the IETF. Therefore, comments are solicited and should
    be sent to mboned's mailing list <mboned@network-\n   services.uoregon.edu> and/or
    the author.\n\t "

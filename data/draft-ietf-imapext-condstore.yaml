  content: "Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to
    a common IMAP mailbox. Examples include different clients working on behalf of
    the same user, and multiple users accessing shared mailboxes. These clients need
    a mechanism to synchronize state changes for messages within the mailbox. They
    must be able to guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
    message flags) at any time. An example of such an application is use of an IMAP
    mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing clients.\n\n The Conditional
    Store facility provides a protected update mechanism for message state information
    that can detect and resolve conflicts between multiple writing mail clients.\n\n
    The Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly resynchronize mailbox
    flag changes.\n\n This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

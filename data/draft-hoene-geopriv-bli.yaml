  content: "Location Generators cannot always provide exact measures of \nparticular
    locations. Instead, they estimate the location of \nobjects. More precisely, they
    use filters to aggregate noisy sensor \ndata and to calculate probability density
    distributions of estimated \npositions. In location tracking applications, typically
    Kalman-type, \nGaussian-Sum, and Particle Filters are used.\n\n\nWe believe that
    it is reasonable to use the outputs of those filters \nto describe a location
    estimate and its uncertainty, because they \nare the natural result of location
    tracking algorithms. In addition, \nthe results of those filters can be feed into
    sensor fusion and \ndecision making engines easily. \n\nGeometric representations
    such as polygons or ellipses might be \ndemanded by an application. The output
    of filters can be converted \nto those application demanded shapes. However, these
    conversions \ncome at the loss of precision and are not well understood \nscientifically.
    Thus, we think that transmitting filter results is a \nsolution that is easier
    to implement.  \n\nIn this draft, we present a transmission format for PIDF-LO,
    which \nis based on the output of Kalman-type, Gaussian-Sum, and Particle \nFilters.\n\t "

  content: "   This draft presents a number of use cases of applications running on\n
    \  endpoints located in cellular networks and whose performances highly\n   depend
    on network information.  This document first, shows how the\n   performances of
    these applications can be further improved with ALTO\n   provided abstracted network
    information and transportation means\n   thereof.  Second, upon reviewing the
    existing ALTO capabilities, it\n   lists the ALTO features that need to be extended
    or defined to\n   support the presented use cases.\n\n\t "

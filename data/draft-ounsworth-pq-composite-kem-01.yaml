  content: "   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history\n
    \  of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor\n   the
    new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the\n   required
    data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and\n   elliptic curve,
    may fall to quantum cryptalanysis, while the incoming\n   post-quantum algorithms
    face uncertainty about both the underlying\n   mathematics as well as hardware
    and software implementations that\n   have not had sufficient maturing time to
    rule out classical\n   cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.\n\n   Cautious
    implementers may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such\n   that an attacker
    would need to break all of them in order to\n   compromise the data being protected
    using either a Post-Quantum /\n   Traditional Hybrid, Post-Quantum / Post-Quantum
    Hybrid, or\n   combinations thereof.  This document, and its companions, defines
    a\n   specific instantiation of hybrid paradigm called \"composite\" where\n   multiple
    cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key,\n   signature, or
    key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) such that they can be\n   treated as a single
    atomic object at the protocol level.\n\n   This document defines the structure
    CompositeCiphertextValue which is\n   a sequence of the respective ciphertexts
    for each component\n   algorithm.  Explicit pairings of algorithms are defined
    which should\n   meet most Internet needs.  The generic composite key type is
    also\n   defined which allows arbitrary combinations of key types to be placed\n
    \  in the CompositePublicKey and CompositePrivateKey structures without\n   needing
    the combination to be pre-registered or pre-agreed.  For the\n   purpose of combining
    KEMs, the combiner function from\n   [I-D.ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners] is used.\n\n
    \  This document is intended to be coupled with the composite keys\n   structure
    define in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys] and the CMS\n   KEMRecipientInfo mechanism
    in [I-D.housley-lamps-cms-kemri].\n\n\t "

  content: "   Intrusion prevention systems(IPSs) are a kind of systems that can \n
    \  keep away and interdict intrusions actively.  This document puts \n   forward
    some relevant solutions to the existing problems in IPSs at \n   present.  Zero-copy
    technology is adopted to reduce the system \n   expenses, in order to optimize
    communication performance; Load \n   balancing technology guarantees the flow
    distributed at each IPSs\n   engine even; Protocol analysis technology improves
    detection \n   efficiency to a certain degree.  The structure of detection engine
    \n   designed can be either a node of Large-scale Distributed Intrusion \n   Prevention
    Systems or an independent IPS.   \n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a solution for the discovery problem in MIMI\n
    \  (More Instant Messaging Interoperability).  The discovery problem is\n   the
    technique by which a user in one messaging provider can determine\n   the preferred
    messaging provider for a target user identified by an\n   email address or phone
    number.  The discovery problem has been the\n   subject of numerous - largely
    failed - standardization attempts at\n   the IETF.  This document outlines these
    attempts and hypothesizes the\n   reasons for their failure, using that to define
    a set of requirements\n   to avoid these failures in a next attempt.  The new
    proposed\n   solution, called Global Lookup and Discovery of Services (GLADOS),
    is\n   a distributed service wherein the data is stored and managed by local\n
    \  providers that exchange routing information to facilitate a global\n   lookup
    capability over a flat namespace.\n\n\t "

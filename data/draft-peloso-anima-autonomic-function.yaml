  content: "   While autonomic functions are often pre-installed and integrated with\n
    \  the network elements they manage, this is not a mandatory condition.\n   Allowing
    autonomic functions to be dynamically installed and to\n   control resources remotely
    enables more versatile deployment\n   approaches and enlarges the application
    scope to virtually any legacy\n   equipment.  The analysis of autonomic functions
    deployment schemes\n   through the installation, instantiation and operation phases
    allows\n   constructing a unified life-cycle and identifying new required\n   functionality.
    \ Thus, the introduction of autonomic technologies will\n   be facilitated, the
    adoption much more rapid and broad.  Operators\n   will benefit from multi-vendor,
    inter-operable autonomic functions\n   with homogeneous operations and superior
    quality, and will have more\n   freedom in their deployment scenarios.\n\n\n\t "

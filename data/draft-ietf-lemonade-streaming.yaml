    received by a resource- and/or network-constrained device from an IMAP server.
    It allows such clients, which often have limits in storage space and bandwidth,
    to play video and audio email content.\n\n The document describes a profile for
    making use of the URLAUTH- authorized IMAP URLs (RFC 5092), the Network Announcement
    SIP Media Service (RFC 4240), and the Media Server Control Markup Language (RFC
    5022). This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   Network equipments are often configured by a variety of network\n   management
    systems (NMS), protocols, and people.  If a network issue\n   arises because of
    a wrong configuration modification, it's important\n   to quickly identify the
    specific service request and obtain the\n   reason for pushing that modification.
    \ Another potential network\n   issue can stem from concurrent NMS's with overlapping
    intent, each\n   having their own tasks to perform: in such a case, it's important
    to\n   map the respective modifications to its originating NMS.  This\n   document
    specifies a mechanism to automatically map the configuration\n   modifications
    to their source, up to a specific NMS service request,\n   in the context of NETCONF.
    \ Such a mechanism is required for\n   autonomous networks, to trace the reason
    of a particular\n   configuration change that lead to an anomaly detection or
    a broken\n   SLA.  This mechanism facilitates the troubleshooting, the post mortem\n
    \  analysis, and in the end the closed loop automation required for\n   self-healing
    networks.  The specifications contain a new YANG module\n   mapping a local configuration
    change to the corresponding northbound\n   transaction, up to the controller or
    even the orchestrator.\n\n\t "

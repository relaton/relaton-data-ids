  script: Latn
  content: "   BGP Update includes the destination prefix and AS_PATH that records\n
    \  the AS number through which it passes.  The traffic routing to the\n   destination
    prefix should be forwarded along the AS sequence in\n   AS_PATH.  However, due
    to traffic redirection, route aggregation and\n   etc., the AS path of forwarding
    and the AS_PATH of BGP Update often\n   do not match.  The inconsistency leads
    to security risks such as\n   black holes, loops in inter-domain forwarding, and
    the possibility of\n   forwarding through malicious AS that source/upstream AS
    does not want\n   to pass through.\n\n\t "

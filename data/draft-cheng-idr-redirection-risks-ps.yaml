abstract:
- content: "<p>Redirection of network traffic on the Internet is a common technology.
    In operator network, there are complex scenarios, such as multi-domain interconnection
    and large scale network topology. Typo, limitation of out-of-band tool capabilities
    for configuration verification, network adjustment or failure may cause risks,
    such as traffic detour, traffic exposure, traffic black hole and traffic loops.

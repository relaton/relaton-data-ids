  content: "   Deploying a new network device in a location where the operator has\n
    \  no staff of its own often requires that an employee physically travel\n   to
    the location to perform the initial install and configuration,\n   even in shared
    facilities with \"remote-hands\" type support.  In many\n   cases, this could
    be avoided if there were an easy way to transfer\n   the initial configuration
    to a new device, while still maintaining\n   confidentiality of the configuration.\n\n
    \  This document extends existing vendor proprietary auto-install to\n   provide
    confidentiality to initial configuration during bootstrapping\n   of the device.\n\n

    it is conversational, and would\n   need to be firmed up before being published

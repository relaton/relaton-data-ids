abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification for enhanced mail system status codes, RFC 3463,
    establishes a new code model and lists a collection of status codes. While it
    anticipated that more codes would be added over time, it did not provide an explicit
    mechanism for registering and tracking those codes. This document specifies an
    IANA registry for mail system enhanced status codes, and initializes that registry
    with the codes so far established in published standards-track documents, as well
    as other codes that have become established in the industry. This document specifies
    an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.</p>"

  content: "   The Domain Name System (DNS) Resource Record TYPEs IANA registry\n
    \  reserves the range 128-255 for Q-TYPEs and Meta-TYPEs [RFC6895] -\n   Resource
    Records that can only be queried for or contain transient\n   data associated
    with a particular DNS message.\n\n   This document reserves a range of RR TYPE
    numbers for Covert-TYPEs -\n   types that are an integral part of the zone but
    cannot be accessed\n   via a normal QUERY operation.\n\n   Uses for such records
    could include zone comments that are\n   transferrable with the zone, expiry times
    for dynamically updated\n   records, or Zone Signing Keys for inline signing.
    \ This document,\n   however, does not define any specific Covert RR types.\n\n\t "

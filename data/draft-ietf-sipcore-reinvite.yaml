  content: "The procedures for handling SIP re-INVITEs are described in RFC 3261.
    \ Implementation and deployment experience has uncovered a number of issues with
    the original documentation, and this document provides additional procedures that
    update the original specification to address those issues.  In particular, this
    document defines in which situations a UAS (User Agent Server) should generate
    a success response and in which situations a UAS should generate an error response
    to a re-INVITE.  Additionally, this document defines further details of procedures
    related to target-refresh requests. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

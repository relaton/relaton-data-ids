  content: "   The rise in frequency, volume, and pernicious effects of DDoS attacks\n
    \  has elevated them from fare for the specialist to generalist press.\n   Numerous
    reports detail the taxonomy of DDoS types, the varying\n   motivations of their
    attackers, as well as the resulting business and\n   reputation loss of their
    targets.\n\n   BGP FlowSpec (RFC 5575, \"Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules\")\n
    \  can be used to rapidly disseminate filters that thwart attacks, being\n   particularly
    effective against the volumetric type.  Operators can\n   use existing FlowSpec
    components to match on pre-defined packet\n   header fields.  However recent enhancements
    to forwarding plane\n   filter implementations allow matches at arbitary locations
    within the\n   packet header and, to some extent, the payload.  This capability
    can\n   be used to detect highly amplified attacks, whose attack signature\n   remains
    relatively constant.\n\n   We define a new FlowSpec component, \"Flexible Match
    Conditions\", with\n   similar matching semantics to those of existing components.
    \ This\n   component will allow the operator to define bounded match conditions\n
    \  using offsets and bitmasks.\n\n\t "

  content: "RFC 2533, 'A syntax for describing media feature sets', defines a\nformat
    to express media feature sets that represent media handling\ncapabilities.  It
    also describes an algorithm for matching these\nfeature sets, which may be used,
    for example, to determine whether\nthe capabilities of a sender and receiver are
    compatible.\nThis memo describes a revised form of the feature set matching\nalgorithm,
    which incorporates lessons learned while implementing\nthe original algorthm.
    \ It is anticipated that this revised\nalgorithm description will be included
    in a future revision of RFC\n2533.  This memo does not affect any of the normative
    content of\nRFC 2533.\n\t "

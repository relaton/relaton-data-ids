  content: "   HTTP servers usually save session states in their persistent storage\n
    \  indexed by session cookies generated by the HTTP servers.  It is up\n   to
    the HTTP user-agent to send this session cookie on each HTTP\n   request.  Some
    HTTP servers check whether the cookie is associated\n   with the HTTP user-agent
    by the means of the user-agent IP address...\n\n   If the Happy Eyeball mechanism
    is used to select between IPv6 and\n   IPv4, it may happen that while using the
    same HTTP server, some HTTP\n   requests are done over IPv6 and the others over
    IPv4, which leads to\n   two different sets of session states in the HTTP server.
    \ This has\n   the consequence of inconsistencies at the HTTP server.\n\n   The
    only purpose of this document is to document this issue.\n\n   A similar problem
    arises with the use of non RFC 6888 compliant Large\n   Scale NAT (LSN) devices
    used to access an IPv4-only HTTP server.\n\n\t "

  content: "In current Internet, HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 protocol has limited methods to\ncontrol
    resource access. Usually it's achieved by modifying the\nconfiguration of the
    cache and proxy to enforce the access control\nrules. When original server's access
    control list (ACL) is updated,\na reconfiguration of cache and proxy systems on
    the chain is\nrequired for the change to take effect, which always impacts the\nnetwork
    stability. This document introduces a new access control\nmechanism, which introduces
    a new header field to dynamically\ncontrol resource access.\n\n\t "

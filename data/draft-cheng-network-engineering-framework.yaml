    It defines the Network Engineering function and discusses \nthe differences between
    Traffic Engineering (TE) and Network \nEngineering. It identifies network architecture
    and major functional \ncapabilities for Network Engineering. Network Engineering
    provides a \nnew set of capabilities that is utilized in conjunction with Traffic
    \nEngineering to optimize the network efficiency, operation, and \nutilization.\n\t "

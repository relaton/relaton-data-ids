  content: "   Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for\n
    \  inter-domain SIP federation.  ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks,\n   and
    SIP, and in doing so, addresses the phone number routing and VoIP\n   spam problems
    that have been a barrier to federation.  The ViPR\n   architecture uses a server,
    the ViPR server, which performs P2P and\n   validation services on behalf of call
    agents, which acts as clients\n   to the server.  Such an architecture requires
    a client/server\n   protocol between call agents and the ViPR server.  That protocol,\n
    \  defined here, is called the ViPR Access Protocol (VAP).\n\n\t "

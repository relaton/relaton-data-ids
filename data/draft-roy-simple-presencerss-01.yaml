  content: "   Web feeds (hereby referred to as 'feed') have always played an \n   important
    role in providing users content related updates of Websites \n   without having
    to visit those websites manually. Typical examples of \n   feed usage include
    users 'subscribing' to the feed of a website \n   (example, CNN.com) and thereby
    automatically receiving 'news \n   headlines' when the content changes. Recently,
    there have been \n   significant innovations (example [13][12]) where feeds from
    different \n   sources have been combined to produce new services in a 'Web Based
    \n   Service Creation Environment' model allowing users to create \n   interesting
    services building on top of 'primitives' that can be \n   represented on the Web.
    \  \n\n   This document describes the motivation for a feed for Presence \n   information,
    which the authors believe would be useful to create new \n   services using a
    similar environment described above. \n\n   NOTE 1:  Architecturally, it is also
    possible that the reverse \n   situation, i.e. feed converted to a Presence state
    is also useful, \n   typically for services that could be triggered at the Presentity
    \n   based on certain conditions. However, this document focuses on the \n   former,
    i.e. Presence state to feed.  \n\n   NOTE 2: It is not necessary that each PUA
    support the capability of \n   generating feeds. It is possible that a central
    aggregation server \n   generates the required feed on behalf of the PUAs.  \n\n\n\t "

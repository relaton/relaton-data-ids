  script: Latn
  content: "   Various technologies, including SRv6, allow to perform Traffic\n   Engineering
    (TE), steering IP traffic through a specific path.\n   However, there is no native
    mechanism in IP that allows to verify\n   whether or not a packet did follow the
    path it was supposed to.  This\n   document specifies a new TLV for the Segment
    Routing Header (SRH)\n   that allows to provide a cryptographically generated
    proof of transit\n   over the different segments.  The proposed mechanisms allows
    to\n   verify whether a packet did go through the segments listed in its SRH\n
    \  header in the intended order.\n\n\t "

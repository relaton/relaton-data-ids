  content: "IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4 counterpart.
    \ An IPv6 subnet of size /64 can (in theory) accommodate approximately 1.844 *
    10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than
    is typical in IPv4 networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or fewer unique
    addresses.  As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous
    effort to perform address-scanning attacks against IPv6 networks; therefore, IPv6
    address-scanning attacks have been considered unfeasible.  This document formally
    obsoletes RFC 5157, which first discussed this assumption, by providing further
    analysis on how traditional address-scanning techniques apply to IPv6 networks
    and exploring some additional techniques that can be employed for IPv6 network
    reconnaissance.\n\t "

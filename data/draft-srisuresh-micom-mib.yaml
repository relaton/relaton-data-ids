  script: Latn
  content: "Middlebox communication (midcom) was conceived to move application level
    gateway (ALG) intelligence out of middleboxes into application specific midcom
    agents. Midcom agents will be assumed to use midcom to control middlebox resources
    so as to permit applications to traverse a middlebox. The scope of the middleboxes
    is limited to NAT and firewall devices. This document defines SNMP managed midcom
    objects to control middlebox\nresources and justifies adapting SNMPv3 as the midcom
    protocol.\n\t "

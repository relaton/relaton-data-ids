  content: "Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has been developed by
    the IETF to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in a variety
    of data plane technologies and across several architectural models. The ITU-T
    has specified an architecture for the control of Automatically Switched Optical
    Networks (ASON).\n\n This document provides a lexicography for the interpretation
    of GMPLS terminology within the context of the ASON architecture.\n\n It is important
    to note that GMPLS is applicable in a wider set of contexts than just ASON. The
    definitions presented in this document do not provide exclusive or complete interpretations
    of GMPLS concepts. This document simply allows the GMPLS terms to be applied within
    the ASON context. This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create
    hypertext documents that are platform independent.  Initially HTML was designed
    primarily for Western European languages; most of the issues of basic internationalization
    to make HTML better usable for other languages have in the meantime been addressed.
    \ Ruby are important phonetic annotations used mainly for ideographic characters
    in East Asia. This document proposes markup for ruby in HTML and explains its
    usage.\n\t "

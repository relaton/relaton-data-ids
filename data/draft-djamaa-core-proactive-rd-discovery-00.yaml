  content: "   The CoRE working group has proposed a Resource Directory (RD)\n   solution
    to facilitate the discovery of the resources provided by\n   constrained sensor
    and actuator networks. For such a mechanism to be\n   effectively deployable,
    endpoints must first discover the existence\n   of an RD in the network before
    being able to exploit its\n   functionalities. This document presents Proactive
    RD Discovery\n   (PRD); a scalable and effective mechanism to discover RDs. To\n
    \  achieve such qualities, PRD follows an announce-based model that\n   builds
    upon CoAP Group Communication. PRD aims to provide important\n   performance in
    terms of energy consumption, generated traffic,\n   expressivity, and RD discovery
    time.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes stateful NAT64 translation, which allows IPv6-only
    clients to contact IPv4 servers using unicast UDP, TCP, or ICMP. One or more public
    IPv4 addresses assigned to a NAT64 translator are shared among several IPv6-only
    clients. When stateful NAT64 is used in conjunction with DNS64, no changes are
    usually required in the IPv6 client or the IPv4 server.</p>"

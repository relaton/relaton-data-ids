  content: "This is an extension to the [CAP] protocol and can be used within\n[iTIP]
    objects. A CU may wish to invite a UPN to an event where the\nUPN does not have
    a account on the CU's CS. This memo describes two\nmethods to dynamically create
    UPNs in order for those UPNs to gain\naccess to the 'Organizers' CS.\nThis memo
    also includes a description of how to include an [OTP]\nchallenge in an object
    directed to a CU. The CUA must compute the\npassword in order to respond to the
    object. This challenge and its\nresponse can be sent in the clear as the values
    are computed using a\nsecret that would not be known to anyone snooping the line.\n\t "

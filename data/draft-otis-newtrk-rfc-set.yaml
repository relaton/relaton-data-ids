  content: "   This document introduces a new document series called Set of RFC\n
    \  Documents (SRDs).  SRDs will be distinguished by names and serial\n   numbers.
    \ SRDs contain Extensible Markup Language (XML) which can\n   automatically produce
    HTML and plaintext versions for human\n   consumption\n\n   With many RFC being
    updated, this creates difficulty when determining\n   which RFCs are necessary
    as references when implementing or using\n   protocols.  Grouping RFC into sets
    that embody a specific endeavour\n   would permit stable references for those
    interested in discovering\n   related details.  The SRD name may also serve as
    a reference for\n   topical information stored in a database that is made available.\n\t "

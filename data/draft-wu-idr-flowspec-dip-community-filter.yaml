  content: "   BGP Flowspec mechanism (BGP-FS) propagates both traffic Flow\n   Specifications
    and Traffic Filtering Actions by making use of the BGP\n   NLRI and the BGP Extended
    Community encoding formats.  This document\n   specifies a new BGP-FS component
    type to support community-level\n   filtering.  The match field is the community
    of the destination IP\n   address that is encoded in the Flowspec NLRI.  This
    function is\n   applied in a single administrative domain.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   DNS payload size limitation constrains operational and policy choice\n
    \  for many years.  It is become increasingly notable in IPv6 transition\n   and
    DNSSEC development, specifically during Priming Exchange process.\n   Given that
    the load of priming exchange on the root system is\n   relatively low, this memo
    proposes using TCP by default in Priming\n   Exchange between resolver and root
    server.  This approach is aiming\n   to treat Priming Exchange as a special process
    which brings a little\n   change to the current root system and provide solution
    to the long-\n   term problems.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a DNS-native naming and resolution mechanism
    for AI agents. Building upon the DNS specification (RFC 1035) and leveraging Service
    Binding (SVCB) records (RFC 9460, RFC 9461), it defines how AI agents are identified
    using Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), how their identity and cryptographic
    keys are published via DNS TXT records, and how multi-version, multi-protocol
    service resolution is achieved using DNS SVCB records. The design philosophy emphasizes
    DNS as the authoritative source, protocol autonomy, and graceful degradation for
    legacy clients. When version is not explicitly specified, the highest priority
    (default) version is provided. This approach maximizes reuse of existing Internet
    infrastructure while enabling the rapid evolution of AI agent ecosystems.</p>"

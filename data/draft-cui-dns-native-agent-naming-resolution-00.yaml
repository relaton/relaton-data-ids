  content: "   This document specifies a DNS-native naming and resolution mechanism\n
    \  for AI agents.  Building upon the DNS specification (RFC 1035) and\n   leveraging
    Service Binding (SVCB) records (RFC 9460, RFC 9461), it\n   defines how AI agents
    are identified using Fully Qualified Domain\n   Names (FQDNs), how their identity
    and cryptographic keys are\n   published via DNS TXT records, and how multi-version,
    multi-protocol\n   service resolution is achieved using DNS SVCB records.  The
    design\n   philosophy emphasizes DNS as the authoritative source, protocol\n   autonomy,
    and graceful degradation for legacy clients.  When version\n   is not explicitly
    specified, the highest priority (default) version\n   is provided.  This approach
    maximizes reuse of existing Internet\n   infrastructure while enabling the rapid
    evolution of AI agent\n   ecosystems.\n\n\t "

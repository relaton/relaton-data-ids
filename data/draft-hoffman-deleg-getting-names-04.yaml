  content: "   The DELEG Working Group is soon going to be choosing a base protocol\n
    \  that describes how resolvers will be able to get a new DNS resource\n   record
    to create a new process for DNS delegation.  After a resolver\n   gets this new
    type of record, it needs to know how to process the\n   record in order to get
    a set of nameservers for a zone.  This\n   document lists many of the considerations
    for that process, including\n   many open questions for the DELEG Working Group.
    \ More considerations\n   and open questions might be added in later versions
    of this draft.\n\n   Note that this draft is _not_ intended to become an RFC.
    \ It is being\n   published so that the DELEG Working Group has a place to point
    its\n   efforts about how resolvers get nameservers for a zone while it\n   continues
    to work on choosing a base protocol.  The work that results\n   from this might
    be included in the base protocol specification, or in\n   a new draft authored
    by some of the many people who have done earlier\n   work in this area.\n\n\t "

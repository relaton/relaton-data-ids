  content: "In mobile IPv6 networks, a mobile node must register its new care of \naddress
    with its home agent after changing its attachment point, so \nthat it can maintain
    connectivity with peers. In the deployment of \nMIPv6, there may be multiple home
    agents for load balancing and/or \nreliability. In the case of load balancing,
    some mobile nodes may \nregister their care of addresses with one home agent,
    and other \nmobile nodes may register their care of addresses with other home
    \nagents. Some applications may need to query the MIPv6 service status \nof a
    mobile node from home agents, such as the care of address, the \nlife time of
    binding, or other information associated with mobile \nnode that is stored on
    home agents. In order to satisfy this \nrequirement, the first step is to locate
    which home agent the mobile \nnode belongs to, that is to say to confirm which
    home agent to query. \nThis document describes a protocol which can be used to
    locate the \nhome agent that a mobile node belongs to. \n\n\t "

  content: "   RFC 7556 [RFC7556] provides the essential conceptual guidance an API\n
    \  designer would need to support use of PvDs.  This document aims to\n   capture
    the requirements for an API that can be used by applications\n   that would be
    considered \"advanced\", according to section 6.3 [1] of\n   RFC 7556 [RFC7556].
    \ The \"basic\" [2] and \"intermediate\" [3] API\n   support levels can in principle
    be implemented by means of layers\n   wrapping the advanced API.\n\n\t "

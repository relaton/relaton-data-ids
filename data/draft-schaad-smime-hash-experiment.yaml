- language: en

  content: "New hash algorithms are being developed that may include parameters.  Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) has not currently defined any hash algorithms with parameters,
    but anecdotal evidence suggests that defining one could cause major problems.
    \ This document defines just such an algorithm and describes how to use it so
    that experiments can be run to find out how bad including hash parameters will
    be.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

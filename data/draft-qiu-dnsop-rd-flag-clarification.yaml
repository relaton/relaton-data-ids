abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document addresses inconsistencies observed in the handling of\n
    \  the Recursion Desired (RD) flag in DNS queries by various DNS\n   resolver
    implementations, particularly when the RD flag is cleared\n   (set to 0).  Such
    inconsistencies have been shown to be exploitable,\n   leading to potent Denial
    of Service (DoS) amplification attacks.\n   This document provides clear guidance
    and recommendations for DNS\n   resolver (including forwarding and recursive resolvers)
    behavior when\n   processing queries with different RD flag settings.  The goal
    is to\n   enhance DNS security, mitigate specific amplification attack vectors,\n
    \  and ensure more predictable and robust DNS operations.\n\n\t "

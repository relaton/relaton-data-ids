  content: "   This document specifies multipath extension for the QUIC protocol to\n
    \  enable the simultaneous usage of multiple paths for a single\n   connection.\n\n
    \  The extension is compliant with the single-path QUIC design.  The\n   design
    principle is to support multipath by adding limited extension\n   to QUIC-Transport
    [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].\n\n\t "

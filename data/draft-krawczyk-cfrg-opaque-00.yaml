  content: "   This draft describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric\n   password
    authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual\n   authentication in
    a client-server setting without any reliance on\n   PKI.  OPAQUE is the first
    PKI-free aPAKE to accommodate secret salt\n   and therefore is the first to be
    secure against pre-computation\n   attacks upon server compromise.  In contrast,
    prior aPAKE protocols\n   did not use salt and if they did, the salt was transmitted
    in the\n   clear from server to user allowing for the building of targeted pre-\n
    \  computed dictionaries.  OPAQUE security has been proven by Jarecki et\n   al.
    \ (Eurocrypt 2018) in a strong and universally composable formal\n   model of
    aPAKE security.  In addition, the protocol provides forward\n   secrecy and the
    ability to hide the password from the server even\n   during password registration.\n\n
    \  Strong security, good performance and an array of additional features\n   make
    OPAQUE a natural candidate for practical use and for adoption as\n   a standard.
    \ To this end, this draft presents several optimized\n   instantiations of OPAQUE
    and ways of integrating OPAQUE with TLS.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines the Prague congestion control scheme,\n
    \  which is derived from DCTCP and adapted for Internet traffic by\n   implementing
    the Prague L4S requirements.  Over paths with L4S\n   support at the bottleneck,
    it adapts the DCTCP mechanisms to achieve\n   consistently low latency and full
    throughput.  It is defined\n   independently of any particular transport protocol
    or operating\n   system, but notes are added that highlight issues specific to
    certain\n   transports and OSs.  It is mainly based on experience with the\n   reference
    Linux implementation of TCP Prague and the Apple\n   implementation over QUIC,
    but it includes experience from other\n   implementations where available.\n\n
    \  The implementation does not satisfy all the Prague requirements (yet)\n   and
    the IETF might decide that certain requirements need to be\n   relaxed as an outcome
    of the process of trying to satisfy them all.\n   Future plans that have typically
    only been implemented as proof-of-\n   concept code are outlined in a separate
    section.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a mechanism to extend LDP control plane with\n
    \  path control feature, improved remote LFA support and allow easier\n   monitoring
    of labelled packet flows in a LDP signaled MPLS network.\n   The mechanism introduces
    a method in LDP to propagate a label for\n   loopback address of a router such
    that each label identifies a LDP\n   speaking router in the network. The method
    enhances the scope of\n   unique label for loopback address of each LDP speaking
    router in a\n   network from a platform or an interface level to an autonomous\n
    \  system.\n\n   The procedures described in this mechanism apply to all LDP speaking\n
    \  routers running with ordered downstream unsolicited label\n   distribution.
    Extending these procedures to independent or downstream\n   on demand label distribution
    is a case of further study and thus\n   beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\t "

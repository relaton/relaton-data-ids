  content: "   This document describes the control plane protocol requirements when\n
    \  NVE is not co-located with the hypervisor on a server. A control\n   plane
    protocol (or protocols) between a hypervisor and its associated\n   external NVE(s)
    is used for the hypervisor to populate its virtual\n   machines states to the
    NVE(s) for further handling. This document\n   illustrates the functionalities
    required by such control plane\n   signaling protocols and outlines the high level
    requirements to be\n   fulfiled. Virtual machine states and state transitioning
    are\n   summarized to help clarifying the needed requirements.\n\n\n\n\t "

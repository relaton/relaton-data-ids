  content: "   This document defines a lightweight mechanism that allows explicit\n
    \  HTTP proxies to inform clients when their proxy configuration, such\n   as
    a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file or Provisioning Domain (PvD)\n   proxy configuration,
    is outdated.  Clients signal to the proxy the\n   configuration URL and the timestamp
    of when it was last fetched.  In\n   response, the proxy may indicate that a newer
    version of the\n   configuration is available.  This enables clients to refresh
    their\n   configuration without relying on frequent polling or short expiration\n
    \  intervals.  The mechanism is designed to be compatible with existing\n   proxy
    deployment models and supports both PAC-based and PvD-based\n   configurations.\n\n\t "

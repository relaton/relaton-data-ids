  content: "The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms
    in order to provide security services.  The Internet Key Exchange (IKE (RFC 2409)
    and IKEv2) provide a mechanism to negotiate which algorithms should be used in
    any given association.  However, to ensure interoperability between disparate
    implementations, it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms
    to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have
    available.  This document defines the current set of algorithms that are mandatory
    to implement as part of IKEv2, as well as algorithms that should be implemented
    because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

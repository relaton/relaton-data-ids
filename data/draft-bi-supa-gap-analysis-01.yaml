  content: "   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different\n   applications
    while maximizing network resources usage, there's\n   growing business pressure
    to minimize operational tasks and the\n   deployment time of new services.\n\n
    \  New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals,\n   including
    the optimization of network functions through application\n   control.  This control
    could be signaled directly by an application,\n   through a proxy or orchestrated
    in a centralized manner.\n\n   The purpose of SUPA is to develop a methodology
    by which network\n   services can be managed using standardized policy rules.
    \ SUPA will\n   focus in the first phase on inter-datacenter traffic management
    as\n   part of the distributed data center use case, including the automated\n
    \  provisioning of site-to-site virtual private networks of various\n   types.
    \ This memo analyses the current state of the art of the\n   industries in IETF
    and outside IETF.\n\n\t "

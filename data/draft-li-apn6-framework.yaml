  content: "   A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have\n
    \  varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet\n   loss,
    etc.  Some new emerging applications (e.g. 5G) have very\n   demanding performance
    requirements.  However, in current networks,\n   the network and applications
    are decoupled, that is, the network is\n   not aware of the applications' requirements
    in a fine granularity.\n   Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-granularity
    traffic\n   operations for the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a new framework, named Application-aware IPv6\n   Networking
    (APN6), which makes use of IPv6 encapsulation to convey\n   the application characteristic
    information such as application\n   identification and its network performance
    requirements into the\n   network to facilitate service provisioning, perform
    application-level\n   traffic steering and network resource adjustment.\n\n\t "

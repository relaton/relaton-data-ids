  content: "    The scale at which RSVP-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) get deployed\n
    \   is growing continually and the onus is on RSVP-TE implementations\n    across
    the board to keep up with this increasing demand.\n\n    This document makes a
    set of implementation recommendations to help\n    RSVP-TE deployments push the
    envelope on scaling and advocates the\n    use of a couple of techniques - \"Refresh
    Interval Independent RSVP\n    (RI-RSVP)\" and \"Per-Peer flow-control\" - for
    improving scaling.\n\n \n\t "

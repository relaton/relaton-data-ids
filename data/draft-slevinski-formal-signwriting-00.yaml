  content: "   Sutton SignWriting is the universal and complete solution for written\n
    \  sign language.  It has been applied by a wide and deep international\n   community
    of sign language users.  Sutton SignWriting is an\n   international standard for
    writing sign languages by hand or with\n   computers.  From education to research,
    from entertainment to\n   religion, SignWriting has proven useful because people
    are using it\n   to write signed languages.\n\n   Formal SignWriting (FSW) is
    a faithful character-encoding of Sutton\n   SignWriting based on 2-dimensional
    mathematics.  FSW defines a formal\n   language for written sign languages where
    any sign of any sign\n   language can be written as a string of ASCII characters.
    \ The\n   mathematical names are explained with tokens and regular expression\n
    \  patterns.  Symbol keys reference the Sutton SignWriting Characters.\n   Coordinates
    are used for 2-dimensional placement.  Signs are written\n   in a spatial SignBox,
    where each symbol is positioned with a\n   2-dimension coordinate.  For sorting,
    each sign can have an optional\n   temporal sequence of symbols that is outside
    of the SignBox.  To\n   create sentences, signs are written sequentially, interspersed
    with\n   punctuation symbols.\n\n   The styling string of Formal SignWriting uses
    a lite markup to define\n   a variety of styling options.  The entire sign can
    be customized for\n   padding, coloring, and size.  Individual symbols within
    a sign can be\n   customized for coloring and size.  For SVG, class names and
    IDs can\n   be defined.\n\n   The query language of Formal SignWriting uses a
    lite markup, similar\n   to FSW, to define a variety of searching possibilities.
    \ The spatial\n   SignBox can be searched for symbols or ranges of symbols.  For
    each\n   symbol or range, the search can specify if the symbol only needs to\n
    \  be found somewhere in the SignBox, or if the symbol needs to be found\n   near
    certain coordinates.  The temporal sequence can be searched for\n   starting symbols,
    written as a sequential list of symbols and ranges\n   of symbols.  When searching
    the temporal sequence, the search results\n   will be limited to signs that start
    with a matching temporal\n   sequence.  Each query string is transformed into
    one or more regular\n   expressions.  The regular expressions are used to quickly
    search\n   large amounts of data.\n\n   Formal SignWriting has been specifically
    designed to integrate with\n   standard browser technology.  Four main components
    make this\n   integration possible: 1) Font Technology, 2) Scalar Vector Graphics,\n
    \  3) HTML and CSS, and 4) a JavaScript Library.\n\n   Formal SignWriting is ASCII
    based, so it is compatible with and\n   optimized for UTF-8.  A Unicode character
    design is proposed that is\n   isomorphic to Formal SignWriting.\n\n   This memo
    defines a conceptual character encoding map for the\n   Internet community.  It
    is published for reference, examination,\n   implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution
    of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n\n\t "

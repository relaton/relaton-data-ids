  content: "This draft describes an architecture for intelligent optical \nnetworks.
    This architecture is called the automatic switched optical \nnetworks (ASON).
    ASON is a client-server architecture with well-\ndefined interfaces that allows
    clients to request services from the \noptical network (server). ASON architecture
    and its generic \nautomatic switched transport networks (ASTN) has been an active
    \nstudy area both at T1X1 and ITU [2].\n\t "

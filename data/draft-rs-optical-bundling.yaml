  content: "In an optical mesh network, two adjacent optical cross connects\n(OXCs)
    may have multiple, parallel, discrete bandwidth links\nconnecting them [1].  When
    a link state routing protocol is used,\nthese links may all be bundled together
    and advertised in a single\nlink state advertisement (LSA). This draft describes
    the\nrequirements, and proposes a method for bundling optical links. The\nproposed
    method aims to reduce the number of routing adjacencies\nbetween neighboring nodes,
    and works in conjunction with a link\nmanagement protocol (e.g., LMP [2]). The
    discussion in this draft is\nrelated specifically to OSPF.\n\t "

    systems.  The limitations of the existing presence system\nwith respect to continuous-valued
    data is examined.  Requirements are\nformulated that would enable the use of the
    presence system for this\ndata, with an emphasis on providing the watcher with
    a means of\ncontrol over the measurement process.\n\t "

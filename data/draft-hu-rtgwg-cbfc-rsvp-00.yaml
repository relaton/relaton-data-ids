  content: "   This draft defines the Credit-based flow control mechanism for WAN\n
    \  based on the RSVP protocol.  With the increasing demand for AI\n   computing
    power, the computing power of a single AIDC can no longer\n   meet the needs of
    large model training.  This has given rise to\n   cross-AIDC distributed model
    training, driving the demand for\n   transmitting RoCEv2 packets over WAN networks.
    \ AI training is\n   extremely sensitive to network packet loss, and even a small
    amount\n   of packet loss may lead to a significant decline in training\n   efficiency.
    \ In addition, the elephant flow and extreme concurrent\n   traffic also place
    higher demands on network performance.  Credit-\n   based flow control is a Backpressure-based
    traffic management\n   technology, which has high reliability and stability in
    practical\n   applications.  It can provide high-throughput and zero-packet-loss\n
    \  transmission guarantees for RoCEv2 traffic, effectively ensuring the\n   efficiency
    of cross-data center AI training.\n\n   This draft focuses on the scenario where
    RoCEv2 packets are\n   transmitted through SRv6 tunnels in the WAN and further
    expands the\n   capabilities of the RSVP protocol in WAN.  This draft introduces
    the\n   Credit-based flow control mechanism into the RSVP protocol to achieve\n
    \  precise traffic control and provides processing analysis.\n\n\t "

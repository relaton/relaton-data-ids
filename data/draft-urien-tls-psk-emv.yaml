abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft describes an authentication protocol based on TLS pre \n
    \  shared key (TLS-PSK), RFC 4279. Identity and psk attributes, defined \n   in
    TLS-PSK are extracted from EMV chips, which are widely deployed \n   for payments
    transactions. The goal of this protocol is to provide a \n   strong mutual authentication
    transparent for the end users and \n   guarantying the confidentiality and the
    integrity of exchanged data \n   over Internet network. \n   This is a new step
    avoiding the use of static passwords for on-line \n   services, such as electronic
    banking or electronic payment. \n\t "

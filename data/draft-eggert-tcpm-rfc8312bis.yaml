  content: "   CUBIC is an extension to the traditional TCP standards.  It differs\n
    \  from the traditional TCP standards only in the congestion control\n   algorithm
    on the sender side.  In particular, it uses a cubic\n   function instead of the
    linear window increase function of the\n   traditional TCP standards to improve
    scalability and stability under\n   fast and long-distance networks.  CUBIC has
    been adopted as the\n   default TCP congestion control algorithm by the Linux,
    Windows, and\n   Apple stacks.\n\n   This document updates the specification of
    CUBIC to include\n   algorithmic improvements based on these implementations and
    recent\n   academic work.  Based on the extensive deployment experience with\n
    \  CUBIC, it also moves the specification to the Standards Track,\n   obsoleting
    [RFC8312].\n\n\t "

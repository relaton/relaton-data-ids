abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP-TE relies on periodic refresh of RSVP messages to synchronize
    and maintain the LSP related states along the reserved path. In the absence of
    refresh messages, the LSP related states are automatically deleted. Reliance on
    periodic refreshes and refresh timeouts are problematic from the scalability point
    of view. The number of RSVP-TE LSPs that a router needs to maintain has been growing
    in service provider networks and the implementations should be capable of handling
    increase in LSP scale. RFC 2961 specifies mechanisms to eliminate the reliance
    on periodic refresh and refresh timeout of RSVP messages, and enables a router
    to increase the message refresh interval to values much larger than the default
    30 seconds defined in RFC 2205. However, the protocol extensions defined in RFC
    4090 for supporting fast reroute (FRR) using bypass tunnels implicitly rely on
    short refresh timeouts to cleanup stale states. In order to eliminate the reliance
    on refresh timeouts, the routers should unambiguously determine when a particular
    LSP state should be deleted. Coupling LSP state with the corresponding RSVP-TE
    signaling adjacencies as recommended in RSVP-TE Scaling Recommendations (draft-ietf-teas-rsvp-te-scaling-rec)
    will apply in scenarios other than RFC 4090 FRR using bypass tunnels. In scenarios
    involving RFC 4090 FRR using bypass tunnels, additional explicit tear down messages
    are necessary. Refresh-interval Independent RSVP FRR (RI- RSVP-FRR) extensions
    specified in this document consists of procedures to enable LSP state cleanup
    that are essential in scenarios not covered by procedures defined in RSVP-TE Scaling
    Recommendations.</p>"

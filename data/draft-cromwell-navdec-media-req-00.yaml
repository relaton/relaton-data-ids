  content: "   This document describes the functional requirements for protocol used\n
    \  by a call processing agent in a packet network to control an media\n   services
    function located in the same packet network or at the inter-\n   face of the packet
    network and the traditional telephone network. The\n   primary focus of the protocol
    is on audio, however the protocol could\n   be extended in the future to support
    other media streams such as\n   video.\n \n   The protocol provides the standard
    audio operations of play audio,\n   collect DTMF,  and record speech. It supports
    direct references to\n   simple audio as well as indirect references to simple
    and complex\n   audio. It provides multi-language audio variables, interruptibility\n
    \  of audio, digit buffer control, special key sequences, and support\n   for
    reprompting during data collection.\n\n   The approach used in specifying protocol
    functionality was to look at\n   several existing protocols currently in use in
    the telephone network,\n   taking the best concepts from each and attempting to
    avoid any limi-\n   tations.  The following protocols were examined:  ITU CS1-R
    [2], Nor-\n   tel Extended CS1-R [3], Bellcore GR-1129 [4], and Bellcore SR-3511\n
    \  [5].  The protocol described in this document provides at a minimum a\n   superset
    of the functionality of these protocols.\n\n\t "

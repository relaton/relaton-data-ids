  content: "The expansion of the IP address space provided by IPv6 makes it both \npossible
    and reasonable to allocate entire subnets to environments \nthat had been previously
    limited to a few individual IP addresses. \nOther protocols such as Neighbor Discovery
    and Stateless Address \nAutoconfiguration allow hosts within those subnets to
    be \nautomatically configured. The router between this subnet and the \nupstream
    world requires just one more piece to make this process \nautomatic, a network
    prefix. \nThis document describes a mechanism for the automated delegation of
    \nan IPv6 network prefix. It allows routers to request either a \nspecific prefix
    or any prefix. Upon authorizing the request the \ndelegating router then returns
    a prefix and a lifetime for the use \nof the prefix.  Optionally, the delegating
    and requesting routers \ncan exchange routing protocol information.\n\t "

  content: "Border Gateway Protocol [1] is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol
    designed for TCP/IP internets.                                             This
    document describes an extension to BGP which may be used to create a confederation
    of autonomous systems which is represented as one single autonomous system to
    BGP peers external to the confederation.              The intention of the proposed
    technique is to aid in policy administration and reduce the management complexity
    of maintaining a large autonomous system.\n\t "

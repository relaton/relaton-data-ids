  content: "   This document describes the extensions needed to OSPF for\n   advertising
    the constraints that exists in some OTN switches while\n   switching timeslots
    between ports. This advertisement would be\n   needed for computing path of LSP
    through these switches taking into\n   account the above mentioned constraint.\n\n
    \  This document proposes extensions to existing OSPF for advertising\n   the
    timeslots available on each OTN port in a new sub-tlv and the\n   connectivity
    matrix representing the capability of the device to\n   cross connect these timeslots
    in another new sub-tlv\n\n\t "

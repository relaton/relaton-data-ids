  content: "   BGP speakers at Internet Exchange Points typically exchange routes\n
    \  with a large number of peers.  To reduce the burden of maintaining\n   many
    sessions, IXPs implement and administrate BGP route servers.\n   Route servers
    announce to their clients the paths of multiple peers\n   by using a single eBGP
    session.  Route servers, however, are\n   restricted to propagating a single path
    per NLRI per eBGP session.\n   This constraint affects the diversity of paths
    received by clients.\n   To overcome this limitation, we propose the extension
    of ADD-PATH to\n   eBGP peers.  ADD-PATH allows a BGP speaker to send multiple
    paths for\n   the same NLRI, typically through different nexthops, over a single\n
    \  session with a peer.  By supporting ADD-PATH, a route server hence\n   allows
    a client to potentially select among all the available paths\n   for that NLRI,
    instead of the one arbitrarily chosen by the Route\n   Server.\n\n\t "

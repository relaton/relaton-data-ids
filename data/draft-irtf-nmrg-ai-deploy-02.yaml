abstract:
- content: "<p>As the development of AI technology has matured and AI technology has
    begun to be applied in various fields, it has changed from running only on very
    high-performance servers to running on commodity servers, with affordable, small-scale
    hardware, including microcontrollers, low-performance CPUs, and AI chipsets. This
    document outlines how to configure the network and system for an AI inference
    service, providing AI services in a distributed manner. It also outlines the factors
    to consider when a client connects to a cloud server and an edge device to requests
    an AI service. It describes some use cases for deploying network-based AI services,
    such as self-driving vehicles and network digital twins.</p>"

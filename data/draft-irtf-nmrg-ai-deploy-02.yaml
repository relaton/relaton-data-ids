  content: "   As the development of AI technology has matured and AI technology has\n
    \  begun to be applied in various fields, it has changed from running\n   only
    on very high-performance servers to running on commodity\n   servers, with affordable,
    small-scale hardware, including\n   microcontrollers, low-performance CPUs, and
    AI chipsets.  This\n   document outlines how to configure the network and system
    for an AI\n   inference service, providing AI services in a distributed manner.
    \ It\n   also outlines the factors to consider when a client connects to a\n   cloud
    server and an edge device to requests an AI service.  It\n   describes some use
    cases for deploying network-based AI services,\n   such as self-driving vehicles
    and network digital twins.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines the needs and requirements for a protocol to \ncontrol
    distributed speech processing of audio streams.  By speech \nprocessing, this
    document specifically means automatic speech \nrecognition and text-to-speech.
    \ Other IETF protocols, such as SIP \nand RTSP, address rendezvous and control
    for generalized media \nstreams.  However, speech processing presents additional
    \nrequirements that none of the extant IETF protocols address.\n\t "

  content: "   In order to support arbitrary network topologies and multi-homing the\n
    \  IETF Homenet Architecture [RFC7368] requires that a routing protocol\n   operates
    inside each home network.  For interoperability reasons it\n   is necessary for
    there be a single \"mandatory to implement\" routing\n   protocol.  With the Homenet
    Working Group unable to reach clear\n   consensus on which protocol that should
    be the Working Group Chairs\n   (with the support of the Internet Area Director)
    declared rough\n   consensus that the chosen protocol is BABEL [RFC6126].  This
    document\n   (not intended for publication as an RFC) serves as an additional\n
    \  record of that decision.\n\n\t "

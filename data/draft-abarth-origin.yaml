  content: "This document defines the concept of an \"origin\", which represents a\nweb
    principal.  Typically, user agents isolate content retrieved from\ndifferent origins
    to prevent a malicious web site operator from\ninterfering with the operation
    of benign web sites.  In particular,\nthis document defines how to compute an
    origin from a URI, how to\nserialize an origin to a string, and an HTTP header,
    named \"Origin\",\nfor indicating which origin caused the user agent to issue
    a\nparticular HTTP request.\n\t "

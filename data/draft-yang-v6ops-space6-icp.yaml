    \  standardized during the past few years, the migration of ICPs are\n   still
    much slower than expected, there is still a lack of a\n   comprehensive transition
    tool for them.  This document introduces a\n   solution to help ICPs expedite
    their procedures, SPACE6, stands for\n   Service-Provider Application Cloud-based
    Engine for IPv6.\n\n\t "

  content: "   While WebRTC has been very successful in a wide range of scenarios,\n
    \  its adoption in the broadcasting/streaming industry is lagging\n   behind.
    \ Currently there is no standard protocol (like SIP or RTSP)\n   designed for
    ingesting media into a streaming service using WebRTC\n   and so content providers
    still rely heavily on protocols like RTMP\n   for it.\n\n   These protocols are
    much older than WebRTC and by default lack some\n   important security and resilience
    features provided by WebRTC with\n   minimal overhead and additional latency.\n\n
    \  The media codecs used for ingestion in older protocols tend to be\n   limited
    and not negotiated.  WebRTC includes support for negotiation\n   of codecs, potentially
    alleviating transcoding on the ingest node\n   (which can introduce delay and
    degrade media quality).  Server side\n   transcoding that has traditionally been
    done to present multiple\n   renditions in Adaptive Bit Rate Streaming (ABR) implementations
    can\n   be replaced with simulcasting and SVC codecs that are well supported\n
    \  by WebRTC clients.  In addition, WebRTC clients can adjust client-\n   side
    encoding parameters based on RTCP feedback to maximize encoding\n   quality.\n\n
    \  Encryption is mandatory in WebRTC, therefore secure transport of\n   media
    is implicit.\n\n   This document proposes a simple HTTP based protocol that will
    allow\n   WebRTC based ingest of content into streaming services and/or CDNs.\n\n\t "

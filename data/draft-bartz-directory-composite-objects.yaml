  content: "Composite Objects for the Directory (COD) describes an abstraction\nlayer
    above the schema, content, and structure facilities of the\nDirectory. COD enables
    the construction of reusable information com-\nponents from schema primitives.
    These components include composite\nobjects, type-signed object references, graphs
    of object hierarchies,\nand object-oriented relationships among Directory objects.\nCOD
    also provides a repository of templates, or prototypes of the\ninformation components.
    This repository captures component design\ninformation which cannot be expressed
    in the Directory schema. This\nrepository allows the design of the components
    to be unequivocably\ndescribed and reused both within and beyond the immediate
    Directory\ninstance.\n\n\n\t "

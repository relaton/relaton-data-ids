  content: "   This specification describes an optional Topology Control (TC)\n   message
    that can be sent by an OLSRv2 router.  This is permitted, but\n   not suggested,
    by the existing protocol, but is here recommended for\n   use in some networks.
    \ The original motivation for this message came\n   from the circumstances of
    a mostly stable network, in the most\n   extreme case updated only by messages
    responding to the arrival and\n   departure of routers, in which case the additional
    TC message is not\n   just recommended but required.  However, the additional
    message could\n   be useful in reducing the routing convergence time in any network
    in\n   which messages are sent at lengthy intervals.\n\n   This specification
    updates RFC 7181 \"The Optimized Link State Routing\n   Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)\".\n\n\t "

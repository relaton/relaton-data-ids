  content: "   This document describes ICMPv6 compression with SCHC and how basic\n
    \  OAM is performed on Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) by\n   compressing
    ICMPv6/IPv6 headers and by protecting the LPWAN network\n   and the Device from
    undesirable ICMPv6 traffic.\n\n   With IP protocols now generalizing to constrained
    networks, users\n   expect to be able to Operate, Administer and Maintain them
    with the\n   familiar tools and protocols they already use on less constrained\n
    \  networks.\n\n   OAM uses specific messages sent into the data plane to measure
    some\n   parameters of a network.  Most of the time, no explicit values are\n
    \  sent is these messages.  Network parameters are obtained from the\n   analysis
    of these specific messages.\n\n   This can be used:\n\n   *  To detect if a host
    is up or down.\n\n   *  To measure the RTT and its variation over time.\n\n   *
    \ To learn the path used by packets to reach a destination.\n\n   OAM in LPWAN
    is a little bit trickier since the bandwidth is limited\n   and extra traffic
    added by OAM can introduce perturbation on regular\n   transmission.\n\n   Three
    main scenarios are investigated:\n\n   *  OAM reachability messages coming from
    internet.  In that case, the\n      SCHC core should act as a proxy and handle
    specifically the OAM\n      traffic.\n\n   *  OAM messages initiated by LPWAN
    devices: They can be anticipated\n      by the core SCHC.\n\n   *  OAM error messages
    coming from internet.  In that case, the SCHC\n      core may forward a compressed
    version to the device.\n\n   The primitive functionalities of OAM are achieved
    with the ICMPv6\n   protocol.\n\n   ICMPv6 defines messages that inform the source
    of IPv6 packets of\n   errors during packet delivery.  It also defines the Echo
    Request/\n   Reply messages that are used for basic network troubleshooting (ping\n
    \  command).  ICMPv6 messages are transported on IPv6.\n\n   This document also
    introduces the notion of actions in a SCHC rule,\n   to perform locally some operations.\n\n\t "

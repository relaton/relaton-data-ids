  content: "   This document details some best practices for Application Service\n
    \  Providers who allow associations between a global DNS domain name and\n   use
    case specific references using DNSSEC to provide a globally\n   consistent, cryptographically
    verifiable association.  Such a\n   mechanism is needed when nonce-based domain
    control validation is not\n   practical, such as use cases where each participant
    wants to confirm\n   the association independently.  As such, no single Application\n
    \  Service Provider exists to provide and validate a nonce to prove\n   domain
    control that would satisfy other participating Application\n   Service Providers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document examines the requirements for Distributed Conferencing\n
    \  (DCON).  Separate documents will map the requirements to existing\n   protocol
    primitives, define new protocol extensions, and introduce\n   new protocols as
    needed.  Together, these documents will provide a\n   guideline for building interoperable
    conferencing applications.  The\n   current works in SIPPING and XCON working
    groups marginally address\n   the matter, which is nonetheless considered as out-of-scope.
    \ The\n   requirements listed in this document are in part based on thoughts\n
    \  derived from the cited working groups activities.\n\n\t "

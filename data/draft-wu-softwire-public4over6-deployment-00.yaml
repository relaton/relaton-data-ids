- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Public 4over6 is a stateful transition mechanism which assigns public\n
    \  IPv4 address to CPE/host and uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  It doesn't\n   involve
    CGN as in DS-lite and reduces the mapping scale on the\n   Concentrator to per-subscriber
    level.  This document describers\n   deployment models for Public 4over6, and
    the deployment\n   considerations of the Public 4over6 architecture.\n\n\t "

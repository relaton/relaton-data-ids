  content: "This document discusses some security issues associated with IP over\n
    \  ATM operation. RFC1577 defines the Classic IP model for sending IP\n   traffic
    over ATM. However, security issues were not addressed in the\n   standard. Since
    internet is an open architecture, security measures\n   to protect network integrity
    are essential for normal operation. The\n   security loopholes in the current
    RFC 1577 model are analyzed and\n   discussed. Possible solutions are proposed.\n\t "

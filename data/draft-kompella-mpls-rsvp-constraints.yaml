  content: "Constraint-based routing is the computation of a path through a\nnetwork
    that satisfies some constraints.  Typically, some device A\nobtains the constraints
    (perhaps through configuration), and also\nknows the network topology and resources,
    and thereby computes the\npath.  However, in certain cases, the device A that
    knows the\nconstraints cannot compute the full path.  In such cases, it is\nuseful
    for A to be able to communicate the constraints to some other\ndevice B that can
    carry out or complete the computation, and\nmoreover, to communicate these constraints
    in an extensible,\ninteroperable fashion, and such that A's semantics are understood
    by\nB.  This document suggests one such means of constraint\ncommunication: use
    a signalling mechanism (such as RSVP) for carrying\nthe constraints, and carry
    the constraints as a program.\n\t "

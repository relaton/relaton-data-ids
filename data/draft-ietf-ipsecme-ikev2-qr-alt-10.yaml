  content: "   An Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) extension defined\n
    \  in RFC8784 allows IPsec traffic to be protected against someone\n   storing
    VPN communications today and decrypting them later, when (and\n   if) a Cryptographically
    Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is\n   available.  The protection is achieved
    by means of a Post-quantum\n   Preshared Key (PPK) which is mixed into the session
    keys calculation.\n   However, this protection does not cover an initial IKEv2
    Security\n   Association (SA), which might be unacceptable in some scenarios.\n
    \  This specification defines an alternative way to provide protection\n   against
    quantum computers, which is similar to the solution defined\n   in RFC8784, but
    also protects the initial IKEv2 SA.\n\n   RFC8784 assumes that PPKs are static
    and thus they are only used when\n   an initial IKEv2 SA is created.  If a fresh
    PPK is available before\n   the IKE SA expired, then the only way to use it is
    to delete the\n   current IKE SA and create a new one from scratch, which is\n
    \  inefficient.  This specification defines a way to use PPKs in active\n   IKEv2
    SAs for creating additional IPsec SAs and rekey operations.\n\n\t "

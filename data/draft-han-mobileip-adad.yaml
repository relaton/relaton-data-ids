- language: en

  content: "This document proposes to automatically allocate a care-of IPv6\naddresses
    (CoA) for the use of mobile nodes that want to be fast\nhandovered. Each access
    router maintains 'Passive Proxy Cache' of\nwhich each address is in advance generated
    and tested for its\nuniqueness by the access router. Also, the access router acts
    as\n'Passive Proxy' for an address reserved in 'Passive Proxy Cache' in\norder
    not to affect the destination cache and neighbor cache of its\nneighbor nodes
    and not to disturb the normal CoA configuration \nprocedure of the nodes which
    do not obey this draft. During L3  \nhandover, a mobile node, which obeys this
    draft, requests one of \nthe duplication-free addresses reserved by its target
    access router. \nAfter successfully acquiring the address, the mobile node assigns
    it\non its interface which attaches to the new link, without the RFC 2461\nDAD.
    Consequently, the proposed scheme can completely take off the \nDAD procedure
    and hence the time involved in the exsting L3 handover\nschemes\n\t "

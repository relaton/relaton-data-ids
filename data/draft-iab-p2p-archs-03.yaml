  content: "In this document, we provide a survey of P2P (Peer-to-Peer) systems.  The
    survey includes a definition and several taxonomies of P2P systems.  This survey
    also includes a description of which types of applications can be built with P2P
    technologies and examples of P2P applications that are currently in use on the
    Internet.  Finally, we discuss architectural trade-offs and provide guidelines
    for deciding whether or not a P2P architecture would be suitable to meet the requirements
    of a given application.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "The IPv4 Identification (ID) field enables fragmentation and\nreassembly,
    and as currently specified is required to be unique\nwithin the maximum lifetime
    on all IP packets. If enforced, this\nuniqueness requirement would limit all connections
    to 6.4 Mbps.\nBecause this is obviously not the case, it is clear that existing\nsystems
    violate the current specification. This document updates the\nspecification of
    the IP ID field to more closely reflect current\npractice and to more closely
    match IPv6, so that the field is defined\nonly when a packet is actually fragmented
    and that fragmentation\noccurs only at originating hosts or their equivalent.
    When\nfragmentation occurs, this document recommends that the ID field be\nunique
    within the reordering context, rather than an arbitrary,\nunenforced upper bound
    on packet lifetime.\n\t "

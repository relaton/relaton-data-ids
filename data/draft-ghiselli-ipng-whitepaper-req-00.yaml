  content: "This white paper is sent by INFN network team, the Italian National Institute
    for nuclear phisics, whose network, named INFNet, is a nationwide network founded
    to provide the access to existing national and international HEP laboratory and
    to facilitate communications between the researchers.                        With
    this  paper we would like to emphasize the key points that we would to consider
    if charged with  IPng plan. We do not really expect to add original items to the
    selection, but we think that it could be useful to submit the opinions and ideas
    that come from our network experience.\n\t "

  content: "This memo specifies modifications required to DS-Lite and 6RD so that\nboth
    IPv4/ IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4/ IPv6\nservers.\n\nThe DS-Lite
    solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand\nelement (B4) proxying IGMP
    and then tunneling IGMP messages to DS-\nLite Address Family Transition Router
    element (AFTR).  IPv4 multicast\ndata received at AFTR is tunneled to B$ and then
    delivered to the\nhosts.  IPv6 multicast and MLD can be supported in a similar
    way.\n\nThe 6RD protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6RD Customer Edge\nand
    then tunneling MLD messages to 6RD Border Relays where IPv6\nmulticast routing
    is supported.  Multicast data received at 6RD\nBorder Relay is tunneled to 6RD
    Customer Edge node and then delivered\nto the hosts.  We show that IPv4 multicast
    and IGMP can be supported\nin a similar way.\n\t "

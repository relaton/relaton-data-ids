abstract:
- content: <p>This document analyzes the applicability of the TCP Authentication Option
    (TCP-AO) to secure TCP-based network management protocols, specifically NETCONF
    and gNMI. It describes deployment profiles in which TCP-AO provides per-connection
    integrity and peer authentication with low operational overhead, either as an
    alternative to or in combination with TLS/SSH. This document gives guidance on
    key management (e.g., static keys and operational "key chains") and documents
    expected behaviors and benefits. No new protocol bits are defined and there are
    no IANA actions.</p>

  content: "This document defines route optimization protocol for Proxy Mobile\nIPv6.
    \ Proxy home test, concurrent proxy care-of test and handover\nprocedures based
    on Enhanced Route Optimization for Mobile IPv6 are\nexplained.  Mobile access
    gateway uses cryptographically generated\nhome addresses so that no more home
    test is needed after the initial\nhome test.  Handover home keygen token is used
    during handover in\norder to eliminate home test for the next mobile access gateway.
    \ The\nprotocol also supports IPv4 transport network operation.\n\t "

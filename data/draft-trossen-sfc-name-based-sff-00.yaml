abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Many stringent requirements are imposed on today's network, such as\n
    \  low latency, high availability and reliability in order to support\n   several
    use cases such as IoT, Gaming, Content distribution, Robotics\n   etc.\n\n   Adoption
    of cloud and fog technology at the edge of the network\n   allows operator to
    deploy a single \"Service Function\" to multiple\n   \"Execution locations\".
    \ The decision to steer traffic to a specific\n   location may change frequently
    based on load, proximity etc.  Under\n   the current SFC framework, steering traffic
    dynamically to the\n   different execution end points require a specific 're-chaining',\n
    \  i.e., a change in the service function path reflecting the different\n   IP
    endpoints to be used for the new execution points.  In order to\n   address this,
    we discuss separating the logical Service Function Path\n   from the specific
    execution end points.  This can be done by\n   identifying the Service Functions
    using a name rather than a routable\n   IP endpoint (or Layer 2 address).  This
    draft describes the necessary\n   extensions to the various concepts and methods
    of SFC, specifically\n   the SFF, in order to handle such name based relationships.\n\n\t "

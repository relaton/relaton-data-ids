  content: "   This document describes a protocol that provides IP reachability for\n
    \  mobile users. Like IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, each mobile node is\n   accessible
    by its home address, regardless of its current location in\n   the Internet. When
    away from home, the mobile node acquires a care-of\n   address indicating its
    current location. It registers the care-of\n   address with a registration server
    (RS). The RS setups a reverse\n   twice network address translation (RAT) table
    on a RAT device. The\n   RAT device transparently routes datagrams destined for
    the mobile\n   node's home address to the care-of address by reverse twice network\n
    \  address translation. The protocol requirements for the mobile node is\n   minimal.
    End-users can have mobility support easily as registration\n   is done using widely
    available applications.\n\n\t "

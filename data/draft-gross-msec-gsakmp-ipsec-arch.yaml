  content: "   The Group Security Association Key Management Protocol (GSAKMP)is a\n
    \  distributed secure multicast framework and key management protocol.\n   This
    specification defines the GSAKMP profile for the IP security\n   architecture
    version 2 and extends the base GSAKMP protocol with the\n   Security Association
    Management (SAM) message. The GSAKMP IPsec\n   policy token explicitly authorizes
    which group members may exercise\n   the speaker privilege. When an authorized
    group speaker endpoint\n   multicasts a SAM message to a GSAKMP group, the SAM
    message\n   configures that group's Security Policy Databases and Security\n   Association
    Databases in compliance to a template within the GSAKMP\n   IPsec policy token.
    In addition, this specification profiles the\n   three supporting components:
    RFC2401-bis compliant IP security\n   subsystem, Negative-acknowledgement Oriented
    Reliable Multicast\n   (NORM) protocol handler, and the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure.\n\t "

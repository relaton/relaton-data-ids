  content: "   Nowadays users consumption style for video and multimedia\n   applications
    is strongly changing.  Users are heavily counting on\n   wireless and mobile devices
    for video streaming and interactive video\n   and multimedia applications.  This
    can be implemented for instance by\n   having more intelligence in the service
    and the network\n   infrastructure to better suit a differentiated users consumption\n
    \  style.  This can be achieved through having: (i) a knowledge in the\n   network
    and service platform about the available device and network\n   conditions for
    the end-user and (ii) a knowledge in the network about\n   the content requirements
    in terms of devices capabilities and network\n   resources for content stored
    either in the network or in the\n   application server.  To obtain such knowledge
    with no need for\n   changing the current infrastructure and in a generalized
    way to all\n   applications, feedback/notification mechanisms between the end-user\n
    \  application, the network and the service platform is needed to\n   provide
    information helping the content delivery and adaptation\n   decisions.  This document
    is investigating such application-agnostic\n   track.\n\n   This document extends
    the Port Control Protocol (PCP) RFC 6887\n   [RFC6887] to allow: (i) the users
    application to notify the network\n   and application server about its available
    resources in terms of\n   devices capabilities and network conditions as well
    as information\n   about the user (e.g., location, mobility status) and (ii) the\n
    \  application server to notify the network about the requirements of\n   the
    content it stores in terms of devices and network resources.  A\n   new PCP option,
    denoted the FEEDBACK, is specified to allow such\n   feedback notification signaling.
    \ This option is used with both PEER\n   and MAP Opcodes.\n\n\t "

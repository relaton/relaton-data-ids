  content: "   This document specifies additional cryptographic attributes for\n   signaling
    additional Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)\n   cryptographic context
    information via the Session Description\n   Protocol (SDP) in alongside those
    defined by RFC4568.\n\n   The SDP extension defined in this document address situations
    where\n   the receiver needs to quickly and robustly synchronize with a given\n
    \  sender.  The mechanism also enhances SRTP operation in cases where\n   there
    is a risk of losing sender-receiver synchronization.\n\n\t "

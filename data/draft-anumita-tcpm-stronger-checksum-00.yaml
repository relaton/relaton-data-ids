  content: "There is a class of data serving protocols and applications that\ncannot
    tolerate undetected data corruption on the wire.  Data\ncorruption could occur
    at the source in software, in the network\ninterface card, out on the link, on
    intermediate routers or at the\ndestination network interface card or node.  The
    Ethernet CRC and the\n16-bit checksum in the TCP/UDP headers are used to detect
    data\nerrors.  Most applications rely on these checksums to detect data\ncorruptions
    and do not use any checksums or CRC checks at their\nlevel.  Research has shown
    that the TCP/UDP checksums are catching a\nsignificant number of errors, however,
    the research suggests that one\npacket in 10 billion will have an error that goes
    undetected for\nEthernet MTU frames (MTU of 1500).  Under certain situations,
    \"bad\"\nhosts can introduce undetected errors at a much higher frequency and\norder.
    \ With the use of Jumbo frames on the rise, and therefore more\ndata bits on the
    wire that could be corrupted, the current 16-bit\nTCP/UDP checksum, or the Ethernet
    32-bit CRC are simply not\nsufficient for detecting errors.  This document specifies
    a proposal\nto use stronger checksum algorithms for TCP Jumbo Frames for IPv4
    and\nIPv6 networks.  The Castagnoli CRC 32C algorithm used in iSCSI and\nSCTP
    is proposed as the error detection code of choice.\n\t "

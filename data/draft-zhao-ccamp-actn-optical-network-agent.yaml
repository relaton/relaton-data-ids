  content: "   With the growth of optical network scale, the complexity of network\n
    \  operation and maintenance has increased dramatically.  Enhancing the\n   intelligence
    level of optical network operation and management and\n   building high-level
    autonomous optical networks have become the\n   common vision of global operators.
    \ The development of AI, especially\n   large AI model technologies, provides
    a feasible technical path for\n   realizing autonomous perception, decision-making,
    analysis, and\n   execution.  The existing ACTN architecture provides network\n
    \  abstraction and control functions for optical networks but lacks\n   higher-level
    autonomous capabilities.\n\n   This document explores the introduction of AI based
    Network\n   Management Agent(NMA) functions into ACTN-based optical networks to\n
    \  achieve high-level autonomy of optical networks.  It discusses the\n   ACTN-enhanced
    architecture of optical networks after the introduction\n   of NMAs, including
    key components, interaction relationships, new\n   interface requirements in the
    enhanced architecture, as well as\n   typical use cases of agent-based autonomous
    operation and maintenance\n   for optical networks.  The document aims to improve
    the autonomy\n   level of optical networks and promote the realization of autonomous\n
    \  optical networks by extending the original ACTN architecture.\n\n\t "

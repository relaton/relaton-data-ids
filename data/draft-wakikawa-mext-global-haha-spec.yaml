  content: "   This document presents a revised version of the global HAHA protocol\n
    \  specification.  Global HAHA allows the deployment of Home Agents over\n   the
    Internet for reliability, scalability and performance purposes.\n   This version
    clarifies several issues that were vague in the original\n   specification.  Global
    HAHA makes use of the signaling defined by the\n   Home Agent Reliability protocol
    (HARP) although it is not designed to\n   operate in conjunction with HARP.\n\n\t "

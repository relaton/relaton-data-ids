  content: "It has often been the case that manageability considerations have\n   been
    retrofitted to protocols. This is sub-optimal.\n\n   Similarly, new protocols
    or protocol extensions are frequently\n   designed without due consideration of
    manageability requirements.\n\n   This document specifies the requirement for
    all new Internet-Drafts\n   in the PCE Working Group to include a \"Manageability
    Considerations\"\n   section, and gives guidance on what that section should contain.\n\t "

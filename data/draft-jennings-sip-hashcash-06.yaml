  script: Latn
  content: "   One of the techniques used in SPAM prevention and various solutions\n
    \  for denial of service attacks is to force the SIP client requesting a\n   service
    to perform a calculation that limits the rate and increases\n   the cost of the
    request.  This draft defines a way to allow a UAS to\n   ask the UAC to compute
    a computationally expensive hash based\n   function and present the result to
    the UAS.  Although the computation\n   is expensive for the UAC to compute, it
    is cheap for the UAS to\n   verify.  The solution also allows for proxies to compute
    and check\n   the puzzle on behalf of the UAC or UAS.\n\n   This draft currently
    outlines enough information to evaluate and\n   consider this approach or even
    run experiments.  It would need\n   finalization around the forking topics discussed
    in the open issues\n   before it would be implementable in production system.\n\n\t "

  content: "   As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid\n
    \  and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even\n   the
    simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the\n   ability to
    quickly interact with more complex operations such as\n   policy-based controls.\n\n
    \  In order to enable applications to have access to and control over\n   information
    in the Internet's routing system, we need a publically\n   documented interface
    specification.  The interface needs to support\n   real-time, transaction-based
    interactions using efficient data models\n   and encodings.  Furthermore, the
    interface must support a variety of\n   use cases including those where verified
    control feed-back loops are\n   needed.\n\n   This document expands upon these
    statements of requirements to\n   provide a problem statement for an interface
    to the Internet routing\n   system.\n\n\t "

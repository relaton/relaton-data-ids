  content: "Bump-in-the-Stack and Bump-in-the-API allow IPv4 applications to\naccess
    IPv6 servers, using an in-host NAT46 translator.  When used in\nconjunction with
    an in-network NAT64, it is also possible for the\nIPv4 application to access an
    IPv4 server via an IPv6-only network.\nThis document describes how these functions
    work in detail, and\ndiscusses some concerns especially around IPv4 applications
    accessing\nIPv6 servers.  These concerns can be reduced by not having IPv4\napplications
    access IPv6 servers.\n\t "

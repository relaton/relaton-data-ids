  content: "   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IPv6\n
    \  Mobile Object Networking (IPMON).  A moving object is a physically\n   movable
    networked device with 5G communication capability, such as a\n   terrestrial vehicle
    (e.g., car and motorcycle), a user's smart device\n   (e.g., smartphone, smart
    watch, and tablet), an aerial vehicle (e.g.,\n   drone and helicopter), and a
    marine vehicle (e.g., boat and ship).\n   These mobile objects are called vehicles
    in this document.  The main\n   scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V),\n   vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X)\n
    \  communications.  First, this document explains use cases using V2V,\n   V2I,
    and V2X networking over 5G.  Next, for IPv6-over-5G vehicular\n   networks, it
    makes a gap analysis of current IPv6 protocols (e.g.,\n   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery).\n\n\t "

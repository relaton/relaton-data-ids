  content: "   This document describes an architecture and a set of protocols for\n
    \  distributing Netnews [RFC0977, RFC1036] via IP multicast enabled\n   networks.
    \ The architecture is designed to be useful in the global\n   Internet.  In particular,
    it allows multiple news servers to\n   cooperate on multicasting each new article
    only once.  To facilitate\n   scalability to tens of thousands of news servers,
    it also provides\n   for receive-only multicast participants (that continue to
    send\n   articles via conventional NNTP).\n \n   This document is a submission
    to the IETF MNNP working group.\n   Comments are solicited and should be addressed
    to the working groups'\n   mailing list at ietf-mnnp@va.pubnix.com and/or the
    author.\n\n\t "

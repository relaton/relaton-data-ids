  content: "This document defines concepts and terminology for use of the Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the\n   traditional
    proxy-registrar function is replaced by a distributed\n   mechanism that might
    be implemented using a distributed hash table or\n   other distributed data mechanism
    with similar external properties.\n   This document includes a high-level view
    of the functional\n   relationships between the network elements defined herein,
    a\n   conceptual model of operations, and an outline of the related open\n   problems
    that might be addressed by an IETF working group.\n\t "

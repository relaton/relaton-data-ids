  content: "The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain\ncomputational
    and communication overhead with respect to the number\nof round-trips required
    and the cryptographic operations involved.\nIn remote access situations, the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol\nis used for authentication, which adds several more round
    trips and\ntherefore latency.\n\nTo re-establish security associations (SA) upon
    a failure recovery\ncondition is time consuming, especially when an IPsec peer,
    such as a\nVPN gateway, needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with various\nend
    points.  A high number of concurrent sessions might cause\nadditional problems
    for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment.\n\nIn many failure cases it would
    be useful to provide an efficient way\nto resume an interrupted IKE/IPsec session.
    \ This document proposes\nan extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish
    an IKE SA\nwith a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously\nestablished
    IKE SA.\n\nA client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected,\nor
    alternatively migrate to another gateway that is associated with\nthe previous
    one.  The proposed approach conveys IKEv2 state\ninformation, in the form of an
    encrypted ticket, to a VPN client that\nis later presented to the VPN gateway
    for re-authentication.  The\nencrypted ticket can only be decrypted by the VPN
    gateway in order to\nrestore state for faster session setup.\n\t "

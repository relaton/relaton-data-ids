    and accommodate requirements for Authentication,\nAuthorization, and Accounting.

    is already focused\non defining these requirements, this document attempts to
    leverage\nthat work.  It contains the requirements that would have to be\nsupported
    by a AAA service to formulate a solution for CDN peering.\n\n\t "

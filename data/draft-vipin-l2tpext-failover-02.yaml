  content: "L2TP is a connection-oriented protocol that has shared state between \nactive
    endpoints. Some of this shared state is vital for operation but \nmay be rather
    volatile in nature, such as packet sequence numbers used \non the L2TP Control
    Connection. When failure of one side of a control\nconnection occurs, a new control
    connection is created and associated \nwith the old connection by exchanging information
    about the old \nconnection. Such a mechanism is not intended as a replacement
    for an \nactive fail over with some mirrored connection states, but as an aid
    \njust for those parameters that are particularly difficult to have \nimmediately
    available. Protocol extensions to L2TP defined in this \ndocument are intended
    to facilitate state recovery, providing \nadditional resiliency in an L2TP network
    and improving a remote \nsystem's layer 2 connectivity.\n\t "

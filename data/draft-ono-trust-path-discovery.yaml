  content: "Chained or transitive trust can be used to determine whether incoming\ncommunication
    is likely to be desirable or not.  We can build a\nchained trust relationship
    by introducing friends to our friends, for\nexample.  We propose mechanisms for
    discovering trust paths and\nbinary responsive trustworthiness.  The trust paths
    are based on a\nchain of trust relationships between users, a user and a domain,
    and\ndomains.  We apply this model to establishing relatively low-value\ntrust
    suitable for deciding whether to accept communication requests\nsuch as emails,
    calls, or instant messages from strangers.\n\n\t "

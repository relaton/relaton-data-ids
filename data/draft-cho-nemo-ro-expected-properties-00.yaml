  content: "   This memo categorizes the route optimization problem of NEMO and\n
    \  clarifies the expected properties of the route optimization\n   protocols.
    \ The route optimization can be classified into NEMO\n   optimization and nested
    NEMO optimization.  Since NEMO basic support\n   protocol is based on bi-directional
    tunneling, the packets from the\n   CN to the MNN are suffer from inefficient
    routing all the cases.\n   This routing inefficiency is getting worse when a number
    of MRs are\n   nested.  This memo is especially interested in nested NEMO\n   optimization.
    \ To solve the routing inefficiency problem, there were\n   several proposals.
    \ However, those proposals could not be compared or\n   evaluated properly since
    there was no consensus on the expected\n   properties of nested mobile networks.
    \ This memo is willing to\n   suggest the expected properties of nested mobile
    networks, so as to\n   help coming route optimization proposals find their strength
    and\n   weakness according to the commonly accepted desirable properties.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the format of the data returned by a Time\nStamp
    Authority and the protocols to be used when communicating with it.\nThe time stamping
    service can be used as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) as\none component in building
    reliable non-repudiation services (see\n[ISONR]).  In order to reduce the amount
    of trust required of a TSA we\nintroduce (in Appendix C) the optional Temporal
    Data Authority (TDA)\nwhose function is to provide further corroborating evidence
    of the time\ncontained in the token.  We also give an example of how to place
    a\nsignature at a particular point in time, from which the appropriate\ncertificate
    status information (e.g. CRLs) may be checked.\n\n\t "

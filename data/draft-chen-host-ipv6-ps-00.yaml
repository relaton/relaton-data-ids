  content: "When operators start to customize user terminals, host-based IPv6\ntranslation
    will be feasible.  Host-based translation should overcome\nsingle-point failure
    problems and support various connections between\ntwo IP families networks simultaneously.
    \ In addition, legacy IPv4\napplications should not be modified.  This document
    will discuss\nhost-based translation applicable scenarios and corresponding issues.\n\t "

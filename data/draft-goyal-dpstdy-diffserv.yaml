  content: "This informational draft presents a simulation study to compare the\nperformance
    of two and three drop precedence levels in an Assured\nForwarding traffic class
    for mixed TCP/UDP traffic. This is a revised\nand comprehensive version of our
    previous study presented at the\nMarch 99 IETF Meeting at Minneapolis. For this
    study, we consulted\nthe principal authors of the Assured Forwarding Class to
    determine\nthe parameter set and configurations under which it would be\nbeneficial
    to have 3-drop preferences. The results presented here are\nbased on 1296 simulations
    (different parameter/traffic pattern\ncombinations). The results of the simulation
    study suggest that\noptimal number of drop precedence levels in a traffic class
    depends\non the traffic load and amount of reserved traffic. In a mixed TCP-\nUDP
    traffic scenario, best performance can be achieved with either 2\nor 3 levels
    of drop precedence if most of the TCP packets have\n'better' drop precedence than
    excess UDP packets.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "[RFC4201] provides a link bundle mechanism to improve routing\nscalability
    by reducing the amount of information that has to be\nhandled by IGP (OSPF and/or
    IS-IS).  This reduction is accomplished\nby performing information aggregation/abstraction.\n\nAs
    with any other information aggregation/abstraction, this results\nin losing some
    of important information.  In WSON and MRN, this lost\ninformation is very important
    for the path computation entity to\ncalculate an accurate path.  This document
    discusses some\nrequirements of link bundle for the new GMPLS networks (e.g.,
    WSON\nand MRN).  The draft gives some routing and signaling analysis for\nthis
    issue.\n\t "

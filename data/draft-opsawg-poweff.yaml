  content: "   This document specifies a device YANG “dashboard” data model that\n
    \  allows devices to report which power measurement and control\n   functions
    they offer.  This basic YANG model is applicable to any\n   kind of device, regardless
    of whether the device itself has any\n   support for YANG-based management interfaces
    or not.  The YANG model\n   simply allows a device to describe what it can report,
    and which\n   interfaces are available to request this data.  Devices that lack
    any\n   on-board YANG-based management interfaces provide this information in\n
    \  form of a YANG instance data file.  This file may be readable from an\n   on-board
    web server on the device, or hosted anywhere else.\n\n\t "

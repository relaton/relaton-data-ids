  script: Latn
  content: "   BGP flow specification version 1 (FSv1), defined in RFC 8955, RFC\n
    \  8956, and RFC 9117 describes the distribution of traffic filter\n   policy
    (traffic filters and actions) distributed via BGP.  During the\n   deployment
    of BGP FSv1 a number of issues were detected, so version 2\n   of the BGP flow
    specification (FSv2) protocol addresses these\n   features.  In order to provide
    a clear demarcation between FSv1 and\n   FSv2, a different NLRI encapsulates FSv2.\n\n
    \  The IDR WG requires two implementation Implementers feedback on FSv2\n   was
    that FSv2 has a correct design, but that breaking FSv2 into a\n   progression
    of documents would aid deployment of the draft.  The IDR\n   WG requires two implementation
    so This document is the first of the\n   series of documents indicating the basic
    FSv2 with user ordering of\n   filters added to FSv1 IP Filters and IP actions.\n\n\t "

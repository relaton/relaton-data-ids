  content: "   This document describes a YANG data model for Ethernet VPN services.\n
    \  The model is agnostic of the underlay. It apply to MPLS as well as to\n   VxLAN
    encapsulation. The model is also agnostic of the services\n   including E-LAN,
    E-LINE and E-TREE services. The merging of this\n   model with L2 services model
    is for future investigation. Any \"add-\n   on\" features such as EVPN IRB, EVPN
    overlay, etc. are for future\n   investigation. This document mainly focuses on
    EVPN instance\n   framework.\n\n\t "

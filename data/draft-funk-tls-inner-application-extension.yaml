  content: "This document defines a new TLS extension called \"Inner Application\".\nWhen
    TLS is used with the Inner Application extension (TLS/IA),\nadditional messages
    are exchanged after completion of the TLS\nhandshake, in effect providing an extended
    handshake prior to the\nstart of upper layer data communications.  Each TLS/IA
    message\ncontains an encrypted sequence of Attribute-Value-Pairs (AVPs) from\nthe
    RADIUS/Diameter namespace.  Hence, the AVPs defined in RADIUS and\nDiameter have
    the same meaning in TLS/AI; that is, each attribute\ncode point refers to the
    same logical attribute in any of these\nprotocols.  Arbitrary \"applications\"
    may be implemented using the AVP\nexchange.  Possible applications include EAP
    or other forms of user\nauthentication, client integrity checking, provisioning
    of additional\ntunnels, and the like.  Use of the RADIUS/Diameter namespace provides\nnatural
    compatibility between TLS/IA applications and widely deployed\nAAA infrastructures.\n\nIt
    is anticipated that TLS/IA will be used with and without\nsubsequent protected
    data communication within the tunnel established\nby the handshake.  For example,
    TLS/IA may be used to secure an HTTP\ndata connection, allowing more robust password-based
    user\nauthentication to occur than would otherwise be possible using\nmechanisms
    available in HTTP.  TLS/IA may also be used for its\nhandshake portion alone;
    for example, EAP-TTLSv1 encapsulates a\nTLS/IA handshake in EAP as a means to
    mutually authenticate a client\nand server and establish keys for a separate data
    connection.\n\n\t "

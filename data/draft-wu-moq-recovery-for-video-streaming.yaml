abstract:
- content: "<p>The current loss recovery in QUIC provides reliable delivery but is
    not optimized for latency, potentially hindering time-sensitive applications.
    The document analyzes the issues caused by the current QUIC recovery scheme during
    live video streaming and then proposes an enhanced QUIC recovery mechanism that
    leverages additional loss retransmissions for optimizing client-side QoE. At a
    high level, the QUIC sender performs additional recovery logic when transport
    runs into application limited state, which is for the lost data that has been
    retransmitted before but has not been acknowledged yet. This mechanism can act
    as a supplement to the existing recovery scheme that performs immediate loss retransmissions
    once a packet is detected lost.</p>"

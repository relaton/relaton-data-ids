  content: "   In this draft, we propose a guideline for an improved version of\n
    \  router handling procedures in RFC 2461 that allow for improved \n   default
    router acquisition performance when an active IP host moves\n   from one subnet
    to the other using the Path Computation Element \n   Metric Protocol (PCEMP).
    Router handling procedures can be improved\n   by a soft configuration of PCEMP
    support in the context of \n   real-time data driven strategy on individual PCE
    nodes and this\n   draft shows how PCEMP can support that. \n\n   This draft is
    an informational draft that shows a guideline to \n   specifications of modifying
    existing protocols to facilitate \n   communication between LSRs and PCEs, and
    between a PCE and other\n   PCEs. This can also be a guideline for mobile PCE
    nodes changing\n   respective PCEDAs and thus needing fast advertisements to the
    \n   corresponding LSRs and other PCE peers using IPv6 schemes. \n\t "

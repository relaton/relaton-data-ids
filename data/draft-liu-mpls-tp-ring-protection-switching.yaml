  content: "   according to RFC 5654 MPLS-TP Requirement, there is a paragraph for\n
    \  recovery requirements just as section 2.5.6.1 in RFC5654 describles:\n   within
    the context of recovery in MPLS-TP networks,the optimization\n   criteria considered
    in ring topologies are as follows: 1 minimize the\n   number of OAM entities that
    are needed to trigger the recovery\n   operation; 2 Minimize the number of elements
    of recovery in the ring;\n   3 Minimize the number of labels required for the
    protection paths\n   across the ring; 4 minimize the amount of control and management\n
    \  plane transactions during maintenance operation. this document will\n   describle
    two types of ring protection solutions to implement these\n   requirements.\n\n\t "

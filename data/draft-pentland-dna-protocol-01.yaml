  content: "   Efficient detection of network attachment in IPv6 needs the following\n
    \  two components: a method for the host to query routers on the link to\n   identify
    the link (Link Identification) and a method for the routers\n   on the link to
    consistently respond to such a query with minimal\n   delay (Fast RA).  Solving
    the link identification based strictly on\n   RFC 2461 is difficult because of
    the flexibilities offered to routers\n   in terms of prefixes advertised in a
    router advertisement (RA)\n   message.  Similarly, the random delay in responding
    to router\n   solicitation messages imposed by RFC 2461 makes to it difficult
    to\n   achieve fast RA.  A known set of solutions to these two problems was\n
    \  identified and catalogued by the DNA design team.  In this memo, an\n   integrated
    solution is presented, based on a sub-set of the\n   catalogued solutions.  This
    integrated solution consolidates most of\n   the advantages of all known solutions
    while addressing most of the\n   disadvantages.\n\t "

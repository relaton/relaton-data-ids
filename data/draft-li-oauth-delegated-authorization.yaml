- content: "<p>Delegated authorization enables a client to delegate a subset of its
    granted privileges to a subordinate access token (also known as a delegated access
    token). This mechanism allows the client to securely delegate authorization to
    a delegated party while maintaining fine-grained control over delegated permissions.</p>"

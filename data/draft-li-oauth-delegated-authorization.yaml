  content: "   Delegated authorization enables a client to delegate a subset of its\n
    \  granted privileges to a subordinate access token (also known as a\n   delegated
    access token).  This mechanism allows the client to\n   securely delegate authorization
    to a delegated party while\n   maintaining fine-grained control over delegated
    permissions.\n\n\t "

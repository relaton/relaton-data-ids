  content: "During the original design of Mobile IP, the potential need for an\nadministrative
    domain to be able to actively revoke a current Mobile\nIP registration was recognized.
    \ Due to the lack of a specific\nscenario requiring such a mechanism, it was decided
    that a passive\nmechanism, namely short registration lifetimes, and the denial
    of a\nsubsequent registration from a MN, would be sufficient for this\npurpose.\n\n\t "

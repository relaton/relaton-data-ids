  content: "  OSPF may form multiple equal cost paths between points.  This is true\n
    \ of any link state protocol.  In the absense of any explicit support\n  to take
    advantage of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily.  Tech-\n  niques have been
    utilized to divide traffic somewhat evenly among the\n  available paths.  These
    techniques have been referred to as Equal Cost\n  Multipath (ECMP). An unequal
    division of traffic among the available\n  paths is generally preferable.  Routers
    generally have no knowledge\n  of traffic loading on distant links and therefore
    have no basis to\n  optimize the allocation of traffic.\n  Optimized Mulitpath
    is a compatible extension to OSPF, utilizing the\n  Opaque LSA to distribute loading
    information, proposing a means to\n  adjust forwarding, and providing an algorithm
    to make the adjustments\n  gradually enough to insure stability yet provide reasonably
    fast ad-\n  justment when needed.\n\n\t "

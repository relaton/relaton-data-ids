  content: "This document presents a performance evaluation of the Routing Protocol
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for a small outdoor deployment of sensor
    nodes and for a large-scale smart meter network.  Detailed simulations are carried
    out to produce several routing performance metrics using these real-life deployment
    scenarios.  Please refer to the PDF version of this document, which includes several
    plots for the performance metrics not shown in the plain-text version.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

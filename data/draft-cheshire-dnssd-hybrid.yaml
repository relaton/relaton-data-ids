  content: "   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely link-local\n   Multicast
    DNS enables discovery of services that are on the local\n   link, but not (without
    some kind of proxy or similar special support)\n   of services that are outside
    the local link.  Using a very large\n   local link with thousands of hosts improves
    service discovery, but at\n   the cost of large amounts of multicast traffic.\n\n
    \  Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Unicast DNS is\n   more
    efficient, but requires configuration of DNS Update keys on the\n   devices offering
    the services, which can be onerous for simple\n   devices like printers and network
    cameras.\n\n   Hence a compromise is needed, that provides easy service discovery\n
    \  without requiring either large amounts of multicast traffic or\n   onerous
    configuration.\n\n\t "

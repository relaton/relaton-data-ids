  content: "   TBD: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports multiple\n   transports
    running both over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.  In more and\n   more cases, a SIP
    user agent (UA) is connected to network interfaces\n   with multiple address families.
    \ In these cases sending a message\n   from a dual stack client to a dual stack
    server may suffer from the\n   issues described in [RFC6555] (\"Happy Eyeballs\"):
    the UA attempts to\n   send the message using IPv6, but IPv6 connectivity is not
    working to\n   the server.  This can cause significant delays in the process of\n
    \  sending the message to the server.  This negatively affects the\n   user's
    experience.\n\n   TBD: This document builds on [RFC6555] by modifying the procedures\n
    \  specified in [RFC3263] and related specifications to require that a\n   client
    ensure that communication targets are accessible before\n   sending messages to
    them, to allow a client to contact targets out of\n   the order required by other
    specifications, and to require a client\n   to properly distribute the message
    load among targets over time.\n\n\t "

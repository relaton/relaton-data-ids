  content: "   This document describes CCFS(Congestion Control based on Forward path\n
    \  Status), rate adaptation scheme for interactive real-time media\n   applications,
    such as video conferencing. CCFS manages forward path's\n   status based on the
    estimated three major parameters - serving\n   bitrate, queue delay and queue
    delay by cross traffics. Considering\n   only forward path status minimizes the
    effects of backward path's\n   network event such as congestion. It also is free
    from compatibility\n   issues because it defines generalized feedback message
    and minimizes\n   receiver's role.\n\n\n\t "

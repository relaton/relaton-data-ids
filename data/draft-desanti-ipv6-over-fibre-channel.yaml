  content: "Fibre Channel (FC) is a high speed serial interface technology that   \nsupports
    several higher layer protocols including Small Computer \nSystem Interface (SCSI)
    and IPv4, as specified in [IP-FC].\nThe purpose of this document is to specify
    a way of encapsulating IP \nversion 6 [IPv6] over Fibre Channel and to describe
    a method of \nforming IPv6 link-local addresses [AARCH] and statelessly \nautoconfigured
    addresses on Fibre Channel networks.  This document \nalso describes the content
    of the Source/Target Link-layer Address \noption used in Neighbor Discovery [DISC]
    when the messages are \ntransmitted on a Fibre Channel network.\n\t "

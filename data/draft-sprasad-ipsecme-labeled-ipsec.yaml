  content: "   Some IPsec implementations support Security Labels otherwise known
    as\n   Security Contexts, to be configured as a selector within the Security\n
    \  Policy Database (SPD) for IPsec SAs.  This document adds support to\n   IKEv2
    to negotiate these Security Labels or Contexts using a new\n   Traffic Selector
    (TS) Type TS_SECLABEL.  The approach is named\n   \"Labeled IPsec\".  It assumes
    that the SPD processing of RFC 4303 is\n   already extended to support Security
    Labels.  This document only adds\n   the ability for IKE to negotiate the Security
    Labels used with the\n   SPD.\n\n\t "

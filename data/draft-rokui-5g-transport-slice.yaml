  content: "   The 5G Network slicing is an approach to provide separate independent\n
    \  E2E logical network from user equipment (UE) to applications where\n   each
    network slice has different SLA requirements.  Each E2E network\n   slice consists
    of multitude of RAN-slice, Core-slice and Transport-\n   slices, each with its
    own controller.  To provide automation,\n   assurance and optimization of the
    network slices, an E2E network\n   slice controller is needed which interacts
    with controller in RAN,\n   Core and Transport slices.  The interfaces between
    the E2E network\n   slice controller and RAN and Core controllers are defined
    in various\n   3GPP technical specifications.  However, 3GPP has not defined the\n
    \  same interface for transport slices.\n\n   The aim of this document is to provide
    the clarification of this\n   interface and to provide the information model of
    this interface for\n   automation, monitoring and optimization of the transport
    slices.\n\n\t "

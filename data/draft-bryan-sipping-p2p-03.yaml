  content: "This document outlines the motivation and requirements for a Peer-to-\n
    \  Peer (P2P) based approach for SIP registration and resource discovery\n   using
    distributed hash tables and presents the architectural design\n   for such a system.
    \ This design removes the need for central servers\n   from SIP, while offering
    full backward compatibility with SIP,\n   allowing reuse of existing clients,
    and allowing P2P enabled peers to\n   communicate with conventional SIP entities.
    \ A basic introduction to\n   the concepts of P2P is presented, backward compatibility
    issues\n   addressed, and the security considerations are considered.\n\n   This
    work is one possible implementation of the the protocol being\n   discussed for
    creation in the proposed P2PSIP WG.  In the context of\n   the work being proposed,
    this draft would represent a concrete\n   proposal for the P2PSIP Peer Protocol,
    using modified SIP as the\n   underlying protocol.  In this architecture, no P2PSIP
    Client Protocol\n   is needed, rather unmodified SIP is used for access by non-peers.\n\n
    \  This is early work, and is less secure in many ways than the\n   traditional
    approach to SIP, but has certain other interesting\n   characteristics that may
    make it desirable in some situations.  This\n   work is being discussed on the
    p2psip@cs.columbia.edu mailing list.\n\t "

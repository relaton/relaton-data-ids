    \  controller discovery in an IP network.  Broadcast service is being\n   developed

    service.  Dynamic Host Configuration\n   Protocol can be used to configure the
    controller IPv4 addresses or\n   fully qualified domain names in the user's devices.
    \ This document\n   defines the related options and option codes.\n\t "

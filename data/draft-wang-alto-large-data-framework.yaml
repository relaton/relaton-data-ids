  content: "   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol provides\n
    \  network information with the goal of improving both application\n   performance
    and network resource utilization.  As data transfers\n   become larger (e.g.,
    due to big data analysis), more data transfers\n   are concurrent but with service
    requirements, and more network\n   capabilities are emerging (e.g., SDN allowing
    a data transfer to\n   request specific routes or Qos), the management of large
    data\n   transfers has become an increasingly challenging issue.  This\n   document
    introduces Data Transfer Coordinator (DTC), a centralized\n   data transfer scheduling
    framework which provides Scheduling Hub\n   Service (SHS) to coordinate and schedule
    large data transfers.  DTC\n   considers all three components: data transfer requirements,
    (ALTO)\n   network information, and SDN control capabilities.  This document\n
    \  specifies not only the basic framework of DTC, but also a key\n   component,
    service API for SHS to specify data transfers and their\n   relations.\n\n\t "

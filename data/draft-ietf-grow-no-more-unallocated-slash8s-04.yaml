  content: "It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic from
    and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space. Now that there are no longer
    any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated, fragile, and expensive.
    Network administrators are advised to remove filters based on the registration
    status of the address space.\n\n This document explains why any remaining packet
    and BGP prefix filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border
    routers and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be routed across
    the public Internet. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a new IPv6 address state called \"Uncertain\"\n
    \  address state as an extension of IPv6 address state specification.\n   \"Uncertain\"
    address state is designed to introduce two\n   functionalities. One is to achieve
    \"Temporary Address Reservation\"\n   function. The other is to avoid a DAD (Duplicate
    Address Detection)\n   time consuming problem for dynamically created addresses.\n\n
    \  New \"Uncertain\" Address State is inserted between \"Tentative\"\n   address
    state and \"Valid\" address state. After \"Tentative\" address\n   state (DAD
    operation has finished) for a newly created address, its\n   state will enter
    to \"Uncertain\" address state. While an address\n   stay at \"Uncertain\" address
    state, the address is behaved as if it\n   is temporary reserved by the node exclusively.
    (The other nodes can\n   not obtain such a reserved address.) When it becomes
    really\n   necessary for the node to utilize the temporary reserved address,\n
    \  its address state is changed into \"Valid\" address state without\n   accompanying
    time consuming DAD operation. By these procedures, we\n   can avoid the DAD problem.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   DNSSEC as defined in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035 is based on\n   authenticated
    messages.  That design has allowed DNSSEC to be\n   deployed at the upper levels
    of the DNS tree, but operational issues\n   with message-based authentication
    has caused lower levels fo the DNS\n   tree to mostly forego DNSSEC.  This document
    extends DNSSEC with a\n   second type of authentication, based on session authentication
    from\n   TLS, that is easier to deploy by some (but certainly not all)\n   authoritative
    DNS servers.  The goal is to have many more zones be\n   DNSSEC-enabled.\n\n   Note
    that this document does _not_ replace current DNSSEC.  A\n   validating resolver
    needs to implement all of traditional DNSSEC, and\n   might also implement the
    protocol defined here.  A server might\n   protect the contents of DNS zones for
    which it is authoritative with\n   traditional DNSSEC, with the protocol defined
    here, or both.  The\n   protocol defined here is only useful for some authoritative
    servers,\n   and is explicitly not useful for others.\n\n   *** Notice for -00
    ***\n\n   This -00 draft is meant to engender discussion, particularly to find\n
    \  out if there is a good use case for this proposal.  This draft is\n   definitely
    not considered ready for consideration in an IETF WG.\n\n\t "

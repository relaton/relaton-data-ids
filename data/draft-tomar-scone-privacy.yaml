  content: "   This document discusses privacy properties of the SCONE metadata or\n
    \  network-to-host signals.  This covers questions that were raised\n   during
    the IETF 119 BoF and subsequent discussions.  It is not\n   intended to be published
    as a separate RFC but might be incorporated\n   as a part of the security considerations
    or other content within\n   eventual SCONE RFCs together with other documents
    covering security\n   considerations.  Other documents will address additional
    aspects of\n   the security considerations for SCONE metadata.\n\n\t "

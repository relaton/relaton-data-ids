  content: "   The \"Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)\" workshop
    was\n   convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on December 3-5,\n   2024
    as a three-day online meeting.  It builds on a previous 2002\n   workshop, the
    outcome of which was documented in RFC 3535 identifying\n   14 operator requirements
    for consideration in future network\n   management protocol design and related
    data models, along with some\n   recommendations for the IETF.  Much has changed
    in the Internet’s\n   operation and technological foundations since then.  The
    NEMOPS\n   workshop reviewed the past outcomes and identified any operational\n
    \  barriers that prevented these technologies from being widely\n   implemented.
    \ It sketched new requirements for future network\n   management operations collaboratively
    with the industry, network\n   operators and protocol engineers, and developed
    a suggested action\n   plan and recommendations for the IETF.\n\n   Note that
    this document is a report on the proceedings of the\n   workshop.  The views and
    positions documented in this report were\n   expressed during the workshop by
    participants and do not necessarily\n   reflect IAB's views and positions.\n\n\t "

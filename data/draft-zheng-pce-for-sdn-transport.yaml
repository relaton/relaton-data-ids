  content: "   This draft describes PCE architecture and protocol in SDN-based\n   transport
    network. It is demonstrated that PCE can fit in the\n   transport SDN architecture
    and complete corresponding requests. The\n   PCE and its protocol can satisfy
    the functional requirement in\n   several transport SDN applications.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   Many presence applications use availability information about a\n   presentity
    to show a watcher their readiness to communicate.  In the\n   case of real-time
    multimedia communications, the readiness of the\n   presentity to communicate
    does not entail that the network topography\n   will permit communication to occur.
    \ Accordingly, this document\n   specifies a means to integrate Interactive Connectivity
    Establishment\n   (ICE) with presence.  Presentities employing the Presence Information\n
    \  Data Format (PIDF) can use the extensions in this draft to advertise\n   their
    ability to undergo a preliminary ICE check, and thus allow\n   watchers to instigate
    ICE tests to ascertain whether or not the\n   intervening network is friendly
    to real-time multimedia\n   communication.  In a presence application, the results
    of this test\n   could be displayed to watchers as the relative \"connectivity
    status\"\n   of the presentity.\n\t "

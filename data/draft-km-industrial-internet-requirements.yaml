  content: "   Industry Control Networks host a diverse set of non-internet\n   protocols
    for different purposes.  Even though they operate in a\n   controlled environment,
    one end of industrial control applications\n   run over internet technologies
    (IT) and another over operational\n   technology (OT) protocols.  This memo discusses
    the challenges and\n   requirements relating to converegence of OT and IT networks.
    \ One\n   particular problem in convergence is figuring out reachability\n   between
    the these networks.\n\n\t "

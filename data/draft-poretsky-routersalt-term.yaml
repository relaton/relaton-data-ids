  content: "This terminology document provides the terms to be used for \nbenchmarking
    router software under accelerated stress conditions.\nA framework is defined to
    configure routing protocols, security \npolicies, traffic forwarding, and management.
    \ Conditions to \nproduce instability and accelerate operational conditions are
    \nalso defined.  Benchmarks for evaluating a router subjected to \nthe accelerated
    life test are introduced.  The DUT configuration\nand accelerated stress conditions
    emulate those of Internet \nCore routers.\n\t "

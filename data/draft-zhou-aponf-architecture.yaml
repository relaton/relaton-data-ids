  content: "   Currently, there are network management applications that present\n
    \  specific demands on a communication network.  This document describes\n   the
    APONF basic architecture, its elements and interfaces.  The main\n   APONF architecture
    entities are the Network Management Application\n   Agent (NMAA), which is a network
    entity that creates and runs network\n   services, and Application-based Policy
    Decision (ABPD), which\n   supports classified application models.  Each of these
    models support\n   application demands that are similar in nature and therefore
    can be\n   grouped/classified together.  Moreover, the ABPD maps the classified\n
    \  application models into network capabilities, e.g., network\n   management
    and controlling policies.\n\n\t "

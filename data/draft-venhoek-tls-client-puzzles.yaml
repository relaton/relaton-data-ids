  content: "   Client puzzles allow a TLS server to defend itself against asymmetric\n
    \  DDoS attacks.  In particular, it allows a server to request clients\n   perform
    a selected amount of computation prior to the server\n   performing expensive
    cryptographic operations.  This allows servers\n   to employ a layered defense
    that represents an improvement over pure\n   rate-limiting strategies.\n\n   Client
    puzzles are implemented as an extension to TLS 1.3 [RFC8446]\n   wherein a server
    can issue a HelloRetryRequest containing the puzzle\n   as an extension.  The
    client must then resend its ClientHello with\n   the puzzle results in the extension.\n\n\t "

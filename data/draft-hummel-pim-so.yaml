  content: "This draft addresses several aspects of multicast services like IP-\nbased
    TV but also like n-party conferences.  It breaks with\ntraditional concepts:\nAn
    IP-based TV-broadcast's delivery tree shall be identified by the\nsource address
    S and a Multicast-ID provided by S.  The same shall\napply to each from n well
    correlated point-to(n-1)point delivery\ntrees of a small n-party conference.  Consequently,
    a TV-host may\nsend out more than one program and any user-host may participate
    in\nmore than one conference.  Mapping to a globally unique multicast\ngroup address
    G is not needed, would be complex, and does not work.\nQoS/Policy-Routing, the
    degree of state (Layer-3, Layer-3 plus MPLS-\nlabel, or no state), and several
    more aspects need  to be respected\nHOMOGENEOUSLY all over the entire delivery
    tree. This cannot be\nprovided by reverse path setup while depending on each receiver's\nguesses.
    Therefore, the tree (i.e. an initial tree as well as\nadditional branches at a
    later time) must be established in\ndownstream direction.\nNo RP- and no BSR-routers
    are required.\n\t "

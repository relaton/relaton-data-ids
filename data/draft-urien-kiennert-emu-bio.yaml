  content: "   EAP-TTLS is an EAP method that provides secured authentication as \n
    \  described in RFC 5281. This method makes generally use of two phases \n   in
    order to complete authentication. The first one consists in the \n   authentication
    of the TTLS server to the client, established by a \n   TLS handshake between
    the client and the TTLS server. The handshake \n   may be either mutual or one-way.
    The authentication of the client to \n   the server may then be negotiated during
    phase two of EAP-TTLS, \n   thanks to widely-deployed authentication mechanisms
    such as CHAP, \n   PAP, MS-CHAP or MS-CHAP-V2. \n    \n   The purpose of EAP-BIO
    is to define how to use a biometric \n   authentication mechanism during phase
    two of EAP-TTLS. This \n   authentication mechanism ranges from physiological
    characteristics \n   such as fingerprint identification, to behavioral characteristics
    \n   such as voice or signature analysis. Hence, EAP-BIO combines the \n   security
    features of EAP-TTLS and biometric authentication.  \n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "It's been argued in the past and in some documents, such as RFC 3776,\nRFC
    4877 and RFC 5555, that an IPsec implementation needs to be\nmodified to afford
    security services to MIPv6 and DSMIPv6.  This\ndocument shows that it is possible
    to implement MIPv6 and DSMIPv6 in\na way that does not require change to a native
    or Bump-in-the-stack\n(BITS) IPsec implementation conformant to RFC 4301.\n\t "

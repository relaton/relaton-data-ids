  content: "   The REST architecture is extremely popular in modern computing\n   environments.
    \ A benefit it provides is that each request can be\n   serviced by independent
    server side components such as different\n   instances of web servers or different
    instances of serverless request\n   handlers.\n\n   The lack of any context associated
    with a request means that the\n   client has to provide the entire context with
    every request.  In\n   monolithic server-side architectures the client typically
    only\n   provides an identifier to a previously established \"session\" on the\n
    \  server side, which is retrieved from a persistent storage such as a\n   database.\n\n
    \  However, this strategy often does not work in microservices\n   architectures,
    where the persistent storage may be many hops away\n   from the server-side components
    that handle the incoming REST API\n   requests.  As a result, REST APIs are used
    between services and each\n   request is required to carry large context including
    tokens such as\n   Transaction Tokens [TRATS] (which assure the identity and context
    of\n   each request), SPIFFE [SPIFFE] tokens (which assures the service\n   identity)
    and possibly other context.\n\n   The Contextualized REST (CREST) architecture
    adds a cached context to\n   REST, with mechanisms to negotiate the establishment
    of the context\n   when it is not found.  Each request can refer to the context
    items it\n   depends upon instead of carrying the entire context with the request.\n
    \  The server can accept the reference to the context item or respond\n   with
    a specific error to prompt the client to reestablish the\n   context.  Clients
    can create new or delete existing context items in\n   separate requests or as
    a part of other requests.\n\n   The CREST architecture assumes the server holds
    the context across\n   different requests in a server-side cache.  Such a cache
    may be\n   typically shared across various applications and services within a\n
    \  VPC or a data center.  The possibility that subsequent requests from\n   the
    same client will reach different VPCs or data centers is low,\n   thus providing
    an efficiency optimization for the vast majority of\n   requests.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines the requirements and constraints that must be\n
    \  imposed when using the Bundle Protocol [2] in order to support the\n   best-effort
    multicast delivery of bundles within a Delay-Tolerant\n   Network (DTN).  The
    capabilities described herein enable a source\n   node to transmit a bundle to
    multiple destination nodes without\n   having to originate a separate bundle for
    each destination node.\n   These capabilities do not support custody transfer
    of bundles that\n   are being delivered via multicast.\n\t "

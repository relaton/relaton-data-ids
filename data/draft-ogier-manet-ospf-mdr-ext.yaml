abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes an extension of OSPF-MDR which allows the\n
    \  option of using multipoint relays (MPRs) to select the MANET\n   Designated
    Routers (MDRs), which form a CDS used for flooding LSAs.\n   This extension allows
    each router to decide independently whether or\n   not to select MPRs, so it provides
    additional flexibility without\n   having to specify OSPF-MDR so that it either
    requires or prohibits\n   MPRs.  The use of MPRs in OSPF-MDR may provide some
    advantages (e.g.,\n   a CDS with a smaller stretch factor), although this may
    come with\n   some costs in terms of overhead and/or response time.  Simulations\n
    \  are planned to compare the performance of OSPF-MDR with and without\n   MPRs.\n\t "

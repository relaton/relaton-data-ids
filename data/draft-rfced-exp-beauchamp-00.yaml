abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "As in RFC-1235, our implementation uses UDP [2] as the transport protocol
    but this is not a requirement of the protocol.  Any broadcast datagram protocol
    could be employed.  The satellite broadcast implementation assumes that there
    is only a single, unidirectional link (the satellite channel) between the source
    and recipient and that acknowledgment information from the recipient to the source
    is carried on a separate and independent media.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies how Dual Stack Lite or 4rd can be used to\n
    \  support IPv4 users in a cloud network that is IPv6 based.  The cloud\n   network
    is IPv6 only which simplifies the network operation and\n   management.  IPv4
    users are supported either one of the transition\n   technologies of DS-Lite or
    4rd.  This protocol is ideal for new cloud\n   deployments since no new public
    IPv4 addresses are needed.\n\n\t "

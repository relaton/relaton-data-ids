  content: "   This document outlines the tradeoffs involved in utilizing\n   Information
    Centric Networking (ICN) for the Internet of Things (IoT)\n   scenarios.  It describes
    the contexts and applications where the IoT\n   would benefit from ICN, and where
    a host-centric approach would be\n   better.  The requirements imposed by the
    heterogeneous nature of IoT\n   networks are discussed (e.g., in terms of connectivity,
    power\n   availability, computational and storage capacity).  Design choices\n
    \  are then proposed for an IoT architecture to handle these\n   requirements,
    while providing efficiency and scalability.  An\n   objective is to not require
    any IoT specific changes of the ICN\n   architecture per se, but we do indicate
    some potential modifications\n   of ICN that would improve efficiency and scalability
    for IoT and\n   other applications.\n\n   This document mainly serves as a problem
    statement and will not\n   present a conclusive architecture design.  It can be
    used as a basis\n   for further discussion and to design architectures for the
    IoT.\n\n\t "

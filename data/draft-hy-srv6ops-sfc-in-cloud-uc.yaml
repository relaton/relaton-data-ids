  content: "   This document outlines the usecase for implementing Service Function\n
    \  Chaining(SFC) based on SRv6 in cloud, motivated by the increasing\n   demand
    for collabration between cloud and network.  The capabilities\n   of SRv6 in most
    cloud service are not ready, such as SFC based on\n   SRv6.  If we want to realize
    these capabilities of SRv6 end-to-end,\n   virtual routers(VR) can be deployed
    as an agent which support SRv6 in\n   the cloud.\n\n\t "

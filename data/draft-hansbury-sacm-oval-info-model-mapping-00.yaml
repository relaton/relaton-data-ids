  content: "   The OVAL community has spent more than ten years developing and\n   employing
    the OVAL Language.  During this time, the community has\n   made a number of design
    decisions and learned a number of lessons\n   that should be leveraged as next
    generation endpoint posture\n   assessment is formulated.  There are a number
    of places throughout\n   the SACM Information Model document that could be fulfilled
    by\n   portions of the OVAL Language, either in its current state or, in\n   some
    cases, with modifications.  Another output of the work executed\n   under the
    OVAL project is a number of lessons that are applicable to\n   the SACM work.
    \ These lessons include a clear separation of data\n   collection and evaluation;
    a call to focus on ensuring both primary\n   source vendors and third party security
    experts feel invited to the\n   discussion and are empowered to leverage their
    unique domain\n   knowledge; and to strive for simplicity and flexibility, where\n
    \  possible.  Finally, the OVAL community has a set of clear\n   recommendations
    with respect to which parts of OVAL should be used by\n   SACM as a means to make
    best use of the efforts of those that have\n   worked on and supported OVAL over
    the past ten years.  Those\n   recommendations are:\n\n   o  Use the OVAL System
    Characteristics Model as a base data model for\n      at least one way to provide
    data collection.\n\n   o  Use the OVAL Definitions Model in parts as a base data
    model for\n      both evaluation and collection guidance.\n\n   o  Do not use
    the OVAL Results Model for a data model to encode\n      evaluation results.\n\n\t "

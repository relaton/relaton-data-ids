  content: "   TLS 1.2 is in widespread use and can be configured such that it\n   provides
    good security properties.  TLS 1.3 is also in widespread use\n   and fixes some
    known deficiencies with TLS 1.2, such as removing\n   error-prone cryptographic
    primitives and encrypting more of the\n   traffic so that it is not readable by
    outsiders.\n\n   Both versions have several extension points, so items like new\n
    \  cryptographic algorithms, new supported groups (formerly \"named\n   curves\"),
    etc., can be added without defining a new protocol.  This\n   document specifies
    that outside of urgent security fixes, no new\n   features will be approved for
    TLS 1.2.  This prescription does not\n   pertain to DTLS (in any DTLS version);
    it pertains to TLS only.\n\n\t "

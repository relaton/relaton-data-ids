  content: "This memo describes an experimental method for authentication and\nkeyexchange
    in the Secure Shell protocol.\nThe main virtue of the SRP protocol [SRP] is that
    it provides\nauthentication based on a small secret (typically a password). It
    is\nuseful in situations where no authentic host key is known. For Secure\nShell,
    it can be used as a bootstrapping procedure to get the host\nkey of a server in
    a safe way. SRP also provides authentication of\nthe user, which means that it
    might make sense to either skip the\nsecsh 'ssh-userauth'-service [SSH-USERAUTH]
    when using SRP, or allow\nlogin with the 'none' or 'external-keyx' method.\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces network-layer service announcement solutions\n
    \  based on architecture defined in [I-D.ldbc-cats-framework].  In\n   particular,
    the scheme describes how to disseminate computing service\n   information to clients
    and the control plane through service\n   announcement messages.  This draft also
    proposes to classify the\n   attributes used to describe computing services and
    analyzes several\n   service querying mechanisms.\n\n\t "

  content: "Legislators writing laws that would limit or prohibit the sending of\nunsolicited
    bulk email (UBE) or unsolicited commercial email (UCE) have\nbegun to include
    rules that require mail servers to include particular\nwording in the SMTP banner.
    To date, this wording has had two distinct\npurposes: to warn senders that they
    may not send UBE or UCE to that SMTP\nhost, and to state the physical location
    of the host so that the sender may\nknow which laws apply.\n \nThis document is
    meant to help clarify how such legislation might be\nworded, and to help increase
    interoperability of various laws. It is not\nmeant to be a standard of any kind,
    but is meant only for its informational\nvalue.\n\n\t "

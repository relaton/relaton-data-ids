  content: "   Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the processing of packets through\n
    \  a sequence of Service Functions (SFs) within an SFC domain by the\n   addition
    of path information and metadata on entry to that domain,\n   the use and modification
    of that path information and metadata to\n   step the packet through a sequence
    of SFs, and the removal of that\n   path information and metadata on exit from
    that domain. The IETF has\n   standardized a method for SFC using the Network
    Service Header\n   specified in RFC 8300.\n\n   There are requirements for SFC
    to process packets through parallel\n   sequences of service functions and to
    easily splice in additional\n   service functions or splice service functions
    out of a service chain.\n   This document provides use cases for these requirements
    and\n   extensions to SFC to support them.\n\n\n\t "

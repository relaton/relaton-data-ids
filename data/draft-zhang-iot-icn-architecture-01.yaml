  content: "   Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to\n
    \  Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different\n   domains,
    the current trend is to develop a unified IoT platform so\n   that objects can
    be made accessible to applications across\n   organizations and domains.  Towards
    this goal, quite a few proposals\n   have been made to build a unified IoT platform
    as an overlay on\n   today's Internet.  Such an overlay solution, however, is
    inadequate\n   to address the important challenges posed by a unified IoT system,\n
    \  especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and communication\n   reliability,
    due to the inherent inefficiencies of the current\n   Internet.  To address this
    problem, we propose to build a unified IoT\n   platform based on the Information
    Centric Network (ICN) architecture,\n   which we call ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages
    the salient features of\n   ICN, and thus provides seamless mobility support,
    scalability, and\n   efficient content and service delivery.\n\n   In this proposal,
    we first present a few popular IoT scenarios in\n   smart homes, smart grid, smart
    transportation, and smart healthcare.\n   Then we identify a list of important
    requirements with the unified\n   IoT architecture that promises to support tens
    of billions of\n   objects.  After discussing the weaknesses of the current overlay-\n
    \  based IoT solution, we propose an ICN-based solution, ICN-IoT, which\n   can
    sufficiently satisfy these requirements.  We present an example\n   ICN-IoT architecture
    and discuss how it supports efficient data\n   discovery, data processing and
    data distribution.  Finally, we show\n   that ICN-IoT efficiently supports context-
    based scenarios, which are\n   very common for many IoT applications.\n\n\t "

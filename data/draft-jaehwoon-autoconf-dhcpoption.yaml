  content: "The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a wireless network composed of\nmobile
    nodes which can communicate with each other via multiple\nwireless links. The
    modified MANET architecture is now standardizing\nthat can resolve the multi-link
    subnet issue. In this draft, we \ndefine two DHCP options in order that a MANET
    Router (MR) gets the \nnetwork prefix assigned to the connected MANET. The one
    is the MANET\nprefix request option used by a MR when it wants to know the network\npresix
    allocated to the MANET. The other is the MANET prefix option\nthat DHCP server
    provides the MANET prefix to the requesting MR.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of the privacy extensions for stateless address\nautoconfiguration
    [1] is to change the interface identifier (and\nthe global-scope addresses generated
    from it) over time in order\nto make it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other
    information\ncollectors to identify when different addresses used in different\ntransactions
    actually correspond to the same node.\nCurrent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
    [2] attacks employ\nforged source addresses which can also be in the same prefixes\nthan
    the real addresses of the compromised nodes used for attacks.\nIndeed, network
    ingress filtering defeats DDoS using 'random'\nforged source addresses.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft discusses some issues surrounding ingress filtering by \nIPs,
    site multihoming, and source address selection. The problem is \nthat in a site
    which has prefixes from multiple ISPs, the source \naddress selected by a host
    might be inconsistent with the egress ISP \nfor a particular destination address.
    If the ISP deploys source-\naddress-based ingress filtering, the host will be
    unable to \ncommunicate with the destination. The draft proposes some possible
    \napproaches towards a solution.\n\t "

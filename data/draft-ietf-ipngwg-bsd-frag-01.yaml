  content: "           There exists a class of applications which cannot accept Path\n
    \          MTU discovery [RFC-1981].  This is recommended to be turned on\n           by
    default for IPv6 [IPV6-SPEC-V2, 4.5, 5].  This document\n           describes
    an extension to the BSD API [RFC-2133] to inform the\n           kernel when it
    should be fragmenting at the network MTU rather\n           than trying to discover
    the path MTU.\n \n           Path MTU discovery works well when there is a stream
    of data.\n           However for distributed servers sending small answers larger\n
    \          than the network MTU to many clients the lack of fragmentation\n           in
    intermediate nodes is anathema.\n \n           RFC-1981 Section 5.6 recommends
    that a system utility be\n           provided to:\n \n           - Specify that
    Path MTU Discovery not be done on a given path.\n\n \n           - Change the
    PMTU value associated with a given path.\n \n           This documents specifies
    how to do the same at the application\n           level to a individual socket.\n\n\t "

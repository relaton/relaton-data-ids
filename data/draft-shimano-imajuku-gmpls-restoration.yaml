  content: "There are some efforts to categorize restoration schemes \n[Restoration-analysis].
    We consider that pre-planned restoration has \nsome advantages, for instance,
    enhancing the quickness to reduce \ndowntime, extensions to recovery classes,
    risk management, and \ntotally integrated distributed control. This document describes
    some \nrequirements and extended properties for message objects on RSVP-TE \n[RSVP-GMPLS],
    LSR procedures, and pre-planned GMPLS restoration. We \nappend a procedure to
    the recovery steps for working and restoration \nsetup. Some objects are additionally
    required with respect to \nestablishing working LSPs and reservation of restoration
    LSPs. This \ndocument shows that restoration activation is also needed and \nclarifies
    the required properties.\n\t "

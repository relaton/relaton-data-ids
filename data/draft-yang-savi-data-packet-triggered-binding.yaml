  content: "   This document specifies the procedure of data packet triggered\n   binding
    creation, which is suitable for DHCP assigned addresses,\n   stateless addresses
    and manually configured addresses. This procedure\n   can help minimize loss of
    legitimate packets as well as prevent the\n   use of forged or spoofed addresses.\n\n\t "

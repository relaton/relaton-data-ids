  content: "   [Editor's Note: This version is submitted for review.  A final, post-\n
    \  review version is anticipated that will supersede this version].\n\n   Portions
    of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use\n   but are unused
    or unoccupied at specific locations and times are\n   defined as \"white space.\"
    \ The concept of allowing additional\n   transmissions (which may or may not be
    licensed) in white space is a\n   technique to \"unlock\" existing spectrum for
    new use.  An obvious\n   requirement is that these additional transmissions do
    not interfere\n   with the assigned use of the spectrum.  One approach to using
    white\n   space spectrum at a given time and location is to verify spectrum\n
    \  availability with a database that manages spectrum sharing and\n   provides
    spectrum-availability information.\n\n   This document describes a number of possible
    use cases of white space\n   spectrum and technology as well as a set of requirements
    for the\n   database query protocol.  The concept of white spaces is described\n
    \  along with the problems that need to be addressed to enable white\n   space
    spectrum for additional uses without causing interference to\n   currently assigned
    use.  Use of white space is enabled by querying a\n   database that stores information
    about spectrum availability at any\n   given location and time.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Requirements concerning an energy-efficient network system such as
    a\n   cloud system are presented.  Specifically, a large-scale cloud\n   system,
    which is composed of multiple data centers (DCs) and a wide\n   area network (WAN)
    to connect these DCs, is focused on.  The problems\n   needed to be overcome in
    order to make the system energy efficient\n   are presented.  The requirements
    that must be satisfied in order to\n   solve these problems are also presented.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In interpersonal messaging, end-to-end encryption means for public\n
    \  key distribution and verification of its authenticity are needed; the\n   latter
    to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\n   This document proposes a new
    method to easily verify a public key is\n   authentic by a Handshake process that
    allows users to easily\n   authenticate their communication channel.  The new
    method is targeted\n   to Opportunistic Security scenarios and is already implemented
    in\n   several applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t "

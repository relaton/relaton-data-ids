  content: "   This document describes VP9, a video codec being developed\n   specifically
    to meet the demand for the consumption of video over the\n   Internet, including
    professionally and amateur produced video-on-\n   demand and conversational video
    content.  VP9 is an evolution of the\n   VP8 video codec that is described in
    [bankoski-rfc6386] and includes\n   a number of enhancements and new coding tools
    that have been added to\n   improve the coding efficiency.  The new tools that
    have been added so\n   far include: larger prediction block sizes up to 64x64,
    various forms\n   of compound INTER prediction, more modes for INTRA prediction,\n
    \  &#8539;-pel motion vectors, 8-tap switchable sub-pixel interpolation\n   filters,
    improved motion reference generation, improved motion vector\n   coding, improved
    entropy coding including frame-level entropy\n   adaptation for various symbols,
    improved loop filtering, the\n   incorporation of the Asymmetric Discrete Sine
    Transform (ADST),\n   larger 16x16 and 32x32 DCTs, and improved frame level segmentation.\n
    \  VP9 is under active development and this document provides only a\n   snapshot
    of the current state of the coding tools as they exist\n   today.  The finalized
    version of the VP9 bitstream may differ\n   considerably from the description
    contained herein and may encompass\n   the exclusion or modification of existing
    coding tools or the\n   addition of new coding tools.\n\n\t "

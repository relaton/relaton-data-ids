  content: "   Applications using the Internet already have access to topology\n   information
    of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  For\n   example, views to Internet
    routing tables at looking glass servers\n   are available and can be practically
    downloaded to many application\n   clients.  What is missing is knowledge of the
    underlying network\n   topologies from the point of view of ISPs (henceforth referred
    as\n   Providers).  In other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of\n   traffic
    optimization -- and a way to distribute it.\n\n   The Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) Service provides\n   network information (e.g., basic network
    location structure and\n   preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying
    network\n   resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving\n   application
    performance.  The basic information of ALTO is based on\n   abstract maps of a
    network.  These maps provide a simplified view,\n   yet enough information about
    a network for applications to\n   effectively utilize them.  Additional services
    are built on top of\n   the maps.\n\n   This document describes a protocol implementing
    the ALTO Service.\n   Although the ALTO Service would primarily be provided by
    the network\n   operator (e.g., an ISP), content service providers and third parties\n
    \  could also operate this service.  Applications that could use this\n   service
    are those that have a choice to which end points to connect.\n   Examples of such
    applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content\n   delivery networks.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs.\nThe
    model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975\nand RFC4976
    in the following ways: it uses COMEDIA for TCP connection\nestablishment, and
    it allows the usage of SDP in a more conventional\nway for conveying endpoint
    address information.  Because of this, the\nmodel also allows for the usage of
    generic mainstream mechanisms for\nNAT traversal, instead of using MSRP relays.\n\t "

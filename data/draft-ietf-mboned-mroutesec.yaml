  content: "This memo describes security threats for the larger (intra-domain or inter-domain)
    multicast routing infrastructures.  Only Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse
    Mode (PIM-SM) is analyzed, in its three main operational modes: the traditional
    Any-Source Multicast (ASM) model, the source-specific multicast (SSM) model, and
    the ASM model enhanced by the Embedded Rendezvous Point (Embedded-RP) group-to-RP
    mapping mechanism.  This memo also describes enhancements to the protocol operations
    that mitigate the identified threats.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

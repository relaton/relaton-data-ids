  content: "   This document specifies an Internet protocol that allows mobile nodes\n
    \  to move around in a local mobility domain, changing their point of\n   attachment
    within the domain, but without ever being aware at the IP\n   layer that their
    point of attachment has changed, and maintaining\n   seamless communication in
    the presence of such changes.  It defines\n   two protocol entities, a Mobile
    Access Gateway and a Local Mobility\n   Anchor, and a set of messages between
    them, that together make these\n   mobility events transparent to the mobile nodes
    at the IP layer, as\n   long as they remain within the local mobility domain.\n\n\n\t "

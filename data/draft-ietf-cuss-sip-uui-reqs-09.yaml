  script: Latn
  content: "This document introduces the transport of call control User-to-User Information
    (UUI) using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and develops several requirements
    for a new SIP mechanism.  Some SIP sessions are established by or related to a
    non-SIP application.  This application may have information that needs to be transported
    between the SIP User Agents during session establishment.  In addition to interworking
    with the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) UUI Service, this extension
    will also be used for native SIP endpoints requiring application UUI.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a mechanism called NAT-XC (for NAT with\nExplicit
    Control) for translating between IPv4 and IPv6.  NAT-XC is\ndistinguished from
    other IPv4/IPv6 translations schemes in that it\nseparates the translation between
    IPv4 and IPv6 from the management\nof address bindings for such a translation;
    and is designed to allow\napplications to be explicitly aware of, and control,
    their address\nbindings.  NAT-XC can be used by both IPv4 clients wishing to\ncommunicate
    via IPv6, and IPv6 clients wishing to communicate via\nIPv4.  NAT-XC appears to
    be usable in a wide variety of scenarios\nrequiring communication across IPv4/IPv6
    boundaries.\n\t "

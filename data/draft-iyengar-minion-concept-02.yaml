  script: Latn
  content: "   Minion uses TCP-format packets on-the-wire, to provide full\n   compatibility
    with existing NATs, Firewalls, and similar middleboxes,\n   but provides a richer
    set of facilities to the application.  Minion's\n   richer facilities include
    a message-oriented API rather than TCP's\n   unstructured byte-stream service
    model, multiplexing of multiple\n   messages (or message streams) on a single
    connection, interleaving of\n   multiplexed messages (to eliminate head-of-line
    blocking), message\n   cancellation, request/reply support, ordered and unordered
    messages,\n   superseding messages, chained messages, multiple priority levels
    with\n   byte-granularity preemption, and DTLS Security.  Minion can be\n   implemented
    entirely as a user-level library, without waiting for any\n   special support
    from OS vendors, and provides immediate benefits to\n   application developers.
    \ Additionally, Minion is able to take\n   advantage of some simple kernel extensions
    to provide enhanced\n   services that go beyond what is possible with traditional
    TCP.  These\n   kernel extensions are optional, and even without them, Minion
    offers\n   worthwhile benefits to application developers.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP).  The purpose of this extension is to provide an\nextensible framework for
    publication of SIP specific data.  This\nextension derives from the recent Internet
    Draft defining the PUBLISH\nmethod, but instead of using the SIP events framework,
    it introduces\na specific publication framework for the publish mechanism.  The
    main\nmotivations for decoupling publications from events are that the\nevent
    framework is not overloaded, and the applicability of the\nPUBLISH method to problem
    sets similar to those surfacing in the\npublication of event state is improved.
    \ The SIP publication\nframework is neither intended for general data manipulation,
    nor is\nit intended to foster any discussion on the issue of using SIP for\neverything.\n\t "

  content: "The IPv6 interim mechanism 6to4 (RFC3056) uses automatic IPv6-over-\nIPv4
    tunneling to interconnect IPv6 networks.  The architecture\nincludes Relay Routers
    and Routers, which accept and decapsulate IPv4\ntraffic from anywhere.  There
    aren't many constraints on the embedded\nIPv6 packets, or where IPv4 traffic will
    be automatically tunneled\nto.  These could enable one to go around access controls,
    and more\nlikely, being able to perform proxy Denial of Service attacks using\n6to4
    relays or routers as reflectors.  Anyone is also capable of\nspoofing traffic
    from non-6to4 addresses, as if it was coming from a\nrelay, to a 6to4 node.  This
    document discusses these issues in more\ndetail and tries to suggest enhancements
    to alleviate the problems.\n\n\t "

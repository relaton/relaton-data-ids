  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract\n
    \  view of the Service Provider network topology containing the points\n   from
    which its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity,\n   VPN, SDWAN).
    \ The data model augments the 'ietf-network' data model\n   by adding the concept
    of service-attachment-points.  The service-\n   attachment-points are an abstraction
    of the points to which network\n   services (such as L3 VPN or L2 VPN) can be
    attached.\n\n\t "

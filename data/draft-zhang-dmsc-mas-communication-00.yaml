  content: "   Multi-agents systems (MAS) increasingly cooperate through workflow,\n
    \  orchestrated, and mesh communication patterns.  While existing\n   Internet
    protocols provide confidentiality and endpoint\n   authentication, they were not
    designed for agent-native semantics\n   such as dynamic identity, computation-bounded
    requests, context\n   integrity, and intermediary trust.  This document analyzes
    security\n   risks in agent communication and identifies limitations in widely\n
    \  deployed protocols (TLS, HTTP, MQTT,A2A and etc.) and developer\n   framework
    (AutoGen and etc.).  This document intend to establish a\n   common problem statement
    and gap analysis to inform future IETF\n   standardization.\n\n\t "

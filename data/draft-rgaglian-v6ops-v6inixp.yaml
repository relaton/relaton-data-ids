  content: "   This document provides a guide for IPv6 deployment in Internet\n   Exchange
    Points (IXP).  It includes information about the switching \n   fabric configuration,
    the addressing plan options and general\n   organizational tasks to be performed.
    \ IXP are mainly a layer 2\n   device (the switching fabric) and in many case
    the best\n   recommendations state that IPv6 traffic and management should not
    be\n   handled differently than in IPv4.\n\t "

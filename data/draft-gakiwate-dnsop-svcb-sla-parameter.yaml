  content: "   This document defines a new SvcParamKey for use in Service Binding\n
    \  (SVCB) and HTTPS DNS resource records which enables authoritative DNS\n   servers
    to indicate that a service should be used by clients having\n   specific service
    levels or use types, such as \"interactive\",\n   \"background\" or \"realtime\".
    \ By providing this information, clients\n   can make informed decisions about
    which service endpoints to use\n   based on specific applications needs at that
    time of making\n   connections.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document states a traffic distribution problem in today's IP/MPLS\nnetwork
    when multiple links are configured between two routers. The\ndocument presents
    motivation, a framework and requirements. It defines a\ncomposite link as a group
    of parallel links that can be considered as a\nsingle traffic engineering link
    or as an IP link, and used for MPLS.\nThe document primarily focuses on MPLS traffic
    controlled through\ncontrol plane protocols, the advertisement of composite link
    parameter\nin routing protocols, and the use of composite links in the RSVP-TE
    and\nLDP signaling protocols. Interactions with the data and management plane\nare
    also addressed.  Applicability can be between a single pair of MPLS-\ncapable
    nodes, a sequence of MPLS-capable nodes, or a multi-layer\nnetwork connecting
    MPLS-capable nodes.\n\t "

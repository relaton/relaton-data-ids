abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   The process of producing today's Internet through a culture of open\n
    \  participation and diverse collaboration has proved strikingly\n   efficient
    and effective, and it is distinctive among standards\n   organizations.  For its
    early years, participation in the IETF and\n   its antecedent was almost entirely
    composed of well-funded, American,\n   white, male engineers, establishing a distinctive
    and challenging\n   group dynamic, both in management and in personal interactions.
    \ In\n   the case of the IETF, interaction style can often demonstrate\n   singularly
    aggressive behavior, often including singularly hostile\n   tone and content.
    \ Groups with greater diversity make better\n   decisions.  Obtaining meaningful
    diversity requires more than generic\n   good will and statements of principle.
    \ Many different behaviors can\n   serve to reduce participant diversity or participation
    diversity.\n   This paper discusses IETF participation, in terms of the nature
    of\n   diversity and practical issues that can increase or decrease it.\n\n\t "

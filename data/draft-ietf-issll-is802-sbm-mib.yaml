  content: "This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP/SBM server\nimplementations.
    These are in addition to those already described in RFC\n2206 and RFC 2213. Specifically,
    it describes parameters for control of\nthe base signaling protocols themselves,
    as well as some of the\nadmission control decisions.  These definitions are not
    intended to be\nexhaustive but they have been identified as useful for practical\nimplementations.\n\t "

  content: "   In \"Multicast Virtual Private Networks\" (MVPNs), customer multicast\n
    \  flows are carried in \"tunnels\" through a service provider's network.\n   The
    base specifications for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN\n   \"auto-discovery\" routes\",
    and specify how to use an auto-discovery\n   route to advertise the fact that
    an individual customer multicast\n   flow is being carried in a particular tunnel.
    \ However, those\n   specifications do not provide a way to specify, in a single
    such\n   route, that multiple customer flows are being carried in a single\n   tunnel.
    \ Those specifications also do not provide a way to advertise\n   that a particular
    tunnel is to be used by default to carry all\n   customer flows, except in the
    case where that tunnel is joined by all\n   the provider edge routers of the MVPN.
    \ This document eliminates\n   these restrictions by specifying the use of \"wildcard\"
    elements in\n   the customer flow identifiers.  With wildcard elements, a single\n
    \  auto-discovery route can refer to multiple customer flows, or even to\n   all
    customer flows.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document analyzes actions by or against a CA or independent\n
    \  repository manager in the RPKI that can adversely affect the Internet\n   Number
    Resources (INRs) associated with that CA or its subordinate\n   CAs.  The analysis
    is done from the perspective of an affected INR\n   holder.  The analysis is based
    on examination of the data items in\n   the RPKI repository, as controlled by
    a CA (or independent repository\n   manager) and fetched by Relying Parties (RPs).
    \ The analysis does not\n   purport to be comprehensive; it does represent an
    orderly way to\n   analyze a number of ways that errors by or attacks against
    a CA or\n   repository manager can affect the RPKI and routing decisions based
    on\n   RPKI data.\n\n\t "

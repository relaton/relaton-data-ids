  content: "   The Diameter Base specification offers security protection between\n
    \  neighboring Diameter peers using TLS, DTLS, and IPsec.  The\n   development
    of a solution to protect Diameter Attribute Value Pairs\n   between non-neighboring
    nodes is currently work in progress.\n\n   Diameter nodes maintain different types
    of databases, depending on\n   their functions.  Examples include the peer table
    and the realm-based\n   routing table.  This document describes a conceptual model
    for a\n   keying database as it would be used by a Diameter node to determine\n
    \  what AVPs to protect, and what keys / algorithms to use.  On the\n   receiving
    side it allows the receiving node to select the appropriate\n   security association
    for verifying the protected AVPs.  The design is\n   similar to IPsec and inspired
    by the routing protocol security key\n   table.\n\n\t "

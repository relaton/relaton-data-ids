  content: "The common thinking for the last 10+ years has been to say that dual\nstack
    was the answer to IPv6 transition and that most things would be\nconverted to
    dual stack way before we ran out of IPv4.  Well, it has\nnot happened.  We are
    going to run out of IPv4 addresses soon, way\nbefore any significant IPv6 deployment
    will have occured.  However,\nthe quasi totality of the Internet and most of the
    computers in the\nhome are still IPv4-only.  Several distributed NAT architectures,\nbased
    on different possible flavors of a carrier-grade NAT, are\npresented as solutions
    to maintain some form of connectivity between\nthose home environments and the
    legacy Internet.\n\t "

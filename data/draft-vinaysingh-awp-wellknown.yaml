  content: "   This document registers a Well-Known URI, /.well-known/awp.json, and\n
    \  a companion Link Relation Type, awp.  The resource exposes a small,\n   machine-readable
    description of common website workflows (states,\n   actions, and resulting events)
    so automated agents can act\n   predictably without scraping.  The format is JSON
    and intentionally\n   minimal.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document registers a Well-Known URI, /.well-known/awp.json, and
    a companion Link Relation Type, awp. The resource exposes a small, machine-readable
    description of common website workflows (states, actions, and resulting events)
    so automated agents can act predictably without scraping. The format is JSON and
    intentionally minimal.</p>"

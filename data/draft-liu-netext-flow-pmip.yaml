  content: "PMIPv6 is designed to provide network based mobility, it requries no\nchanges
    to the UE.  There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to support\nflow mobility.  Flow
    mobility requries the UE and the network having\ncommunication protocol to carry
    the flow control messages.  This\ndocument proposes to use the extended IKEv2
    protocol to carry the\nflow control messages between the UE and network.\n\t "

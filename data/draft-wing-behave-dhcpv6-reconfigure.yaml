  script: Latn
  content: "   Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and\n
    \  IPV6-only hosts at the same time.  This makes prioritizing the DNS\n   servers
    for hosts tricky due to a heterogeneous mix of protocol\n   stacks causing optimal
    behavior to occur only when the host stack re-\n   initializes.  The networks
    infrastructure is usually well equipped to\n   be aware of single/dual-stack nature
    of hosts.  This specification\n   extends DHCPv6 so that the DHCPv6 Relay Agent
    can dynamically\n   influence the priority of DNS servers provided to the host,
    so that\n   the host can use the optimal DNS server for resolution.\n\n\t "

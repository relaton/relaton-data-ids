  content: "   Segment Routing architecture supports the use of multiple routing\n
    \  algorithms, i.e, different constraint-based shortest-path\n   calculations
    can be supported.  There are two standard algorithms:\n   SPF and Strict-SPF,
    defined in Segment Routing architecture.  There\n   are also other user defined
    algorithms according to Flex-algo\n   applicaiton.  However, an algorithm identifier
    is often included as\n   part of a Prefix-SID advertisement, that maybe not satisfy
    some\n   scenarios where multiple algorithm share the same link resource.\n   This
    document complement that the algorithm identifier can be also\n   included as
    part of a Adjacency-SID advertisement\n\n\t "

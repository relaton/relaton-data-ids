  content: "RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing
    in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term \"enterprise network\"
    within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios,
    where an \"enterprise\" can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO)
    network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational
    corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require
    an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with
    accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming,
    and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments,
    but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture
    addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4
    coexistence.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

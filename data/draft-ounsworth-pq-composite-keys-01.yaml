- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come\n
    \  the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n   cryptographic
    algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum algorithms
    is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to be performed
    in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for holding composite
    keys, for\n   use with composite signature and encryption data.\n\n   This document
    defines the structures CompositePublicKey,\n   CompositePrivateKey, which are
    sequences of the respective structure\n   for each component algorithm.  This
    document makes no assumptions\n   about what the component algorithms are, provided
    that they have\n   defined algorithm identifiers.  The only requirement imposed
    by this\n   document is that all algorithms be of the same key usage; i.e. all\n
    \  signature or all encryption.  This document is intended to be coupled\n   with
    corresponding documents that define the structure and semantics\n   of composite
    signatures and encryption.\n\n\t "

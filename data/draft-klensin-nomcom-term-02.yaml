abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A consensus is emerging in the IETF that very long tenure in\n   leadership
    roles is not in the best interests of the community.\n   While, in theory, that
    advice could simply be given to the Nomcom,\n   there is reason to believe that
    a different model for consideration\n   of renewal or replacement for members
    of the leadership would be more\n   efficient for the Nomcom and would impose
    less hardship on incumbents\n   and the community.  This document outlines that
    alternate method.\n\n\t "

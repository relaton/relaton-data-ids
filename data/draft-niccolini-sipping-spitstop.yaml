  content: "This memo discusses the need for standards that support SPam over\nInternet
    Telephony (SPIT) prevention applications.  After explaining\nthe general need
    for SPIT prevention applications the memo provides a\nreference scenario for potential
    communication between entities that\nmay be involved in SPIT prevention.  Within
    this scenario the need\nfor standardizing communication is analyzed for each pair
    of\ncommunicating entities.  The analysis is intended to serve as a\nstarting
    point for discussing the requirements for signaling\nstandards as well as for
    architectural considerations, that support\nSPIT prevention applications.\n\nThis
    memo is not intended to suggest any solution of SPIT signaling\nissues.  Such
    work, if necessary at all, should be object of separate\ndocuments.\n\t "

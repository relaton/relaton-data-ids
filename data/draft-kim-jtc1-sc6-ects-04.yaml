  content: "This memo is the final Committee Draft of the Enhanced Transport  Service
    Definition under development within ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6/WG7 since\nlast several years
    in order to provide to the upper-layer applications\nenhanced transport services
    over the current OSI transport service;\nmajor enhancements include multicast
    services and enhanced QoS.\n \nThis memo is distributed to possibly interested
    grops within IETF,\nespecially to experts in Transport Area, to make noticed the
    efforts  being made within SC6 to come up with a new transport service definition
    meeting the wide range of requirements of the both current and future multimedia
    multicast applications. It is to be noted that a protocol maned ECTP(Enhanced
    Communications Transport Protocol) supporting this ECTS is also under development
    within SC6 and will be made public in the near future.\n  Experts interested in
    this topic might compare the services defined by\n  ECTS with those provided by
    more known protocols including RTP, MTP,\n  RMP, and RAMP. The ultimate apparent
    objective of ECTS is the\n  multimedia multicast transport service with varying
    degrees of\n  reliability and multicast QoS.\n\t "

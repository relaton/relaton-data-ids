  content: "   This document specifies methodology for benchmarking convergence of\n
    \  routers without making assumptions about relation and dependencies\n   between
    data- and control-planes.  Provided methodology is primary\n   intended for testing
    routers running BGP and some form of link-state\n   IGP with or without MPLS.
    \ It may also be applicable for environments\n   using MPLS-TE or GRE, however
    they're beyond scope of this document\n   and such application is left for further
    study.\n\n\t "

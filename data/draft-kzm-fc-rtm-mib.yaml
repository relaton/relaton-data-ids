  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n
    \  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n   In
    particular, it describes managed objects for information related\n   to routing
    within a Fibre Channel fabric which is independent of the\n   usage of a particular
    routing protocol.  At present, this memo is in\n   development as part of the
    SM-RTM project of T11.5\n   (http://www.t11.org).  The plan is that it will later
    become a work\n   item of IETF's IMSS working group.\n\t "

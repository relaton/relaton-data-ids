abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft describes some potential new privacy requirements for the\n
    \  future network.  We start from the data lifecycle and propose that\n   the
    privacy needs to be considered during the data is processing.  We\n   also introduce
    some new academic research results.  Some use cases\n   are proposed.  The goal
    is to attract IETF working or interest groups\n   in researching to these new
    requirements in protocol level for the\n   future network.\n\n\t "

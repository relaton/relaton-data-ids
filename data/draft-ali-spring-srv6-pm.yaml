- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and\n   accurate
    measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as\n   well as related
    metrics such as delay variation and channel\n   throughput in MPLS networks.  This
    document describes how these\n   mechanisms can be used for performance measurement
    of delay and loss\n   in Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) networks.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide mobility service to\nmobile
    nodes in the network domain which does not require the mobile\nnodes to be involved
    in IP mobility management.  In other words, the\nPMIPv6 can transparently support
    roaming within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e.\nintra-domain roaming, to mobile nodes.  However,
    if the mobile nodes\nmove to other PMIPv6 domains, the nodes should have additional\nprotocols
    for the inter-domain roaming although the domains also\nprovide the transparent
    mobility.  Hence, an inter-domain roaming\nsolution would be needed for providing
    transparent mobility to mobile\nnodes that only move around among PMIPv6 domains.
    \ This document\nspecifies the inter-domain roaming controlled by the networks\nadopting
    the PMIPv6.\n\t "

  content: "Developments in storage systems have made it important for\napplications
    to have control over the characteristics of the storage\nthat will be used for
    their particular files.  The development of\npNFS has added to the usefulness
    of such control mechanisms as it has\ncreated the opportunity for the hierarchical
    organization of file\nnames to be separated from the control of storage characteristics
    for\nindividual files, including the assignment to storage locations to\nreflect
    the performance or other needs of those specific files.  This\ndocument proposes
    extensions to NFS version 4 to allow storage\nrequirements to be communicated
    to the NFS version 4 server.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Web of Agents (WoA), a minimal JSON based
    description format and invocation convention that allows HTTP hosts to advertise
    AI agents and for clients to invoke those agents in a uniform way. A WoA document
    is typically served from a well known location on an HTTP origin and uses JSON
    Schema to describe agent inputs and outputs. WoA does not define a discovery protocol
    itself but is designed to be used as a host level primitive by higher level discovery
    systems.</p>"

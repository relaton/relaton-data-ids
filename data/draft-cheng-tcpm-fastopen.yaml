  content: "   TCP Fast Open (TFO) allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK\n
    \  packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial\n   connection
    handshake, thus providing a saving of up to one full round\n   trip time (RTT)
    compared to standard TCP requiring a three-way\n   handshake (3WHS) to complete
    before data can be exchanged.\n\nTerminology\n\t "

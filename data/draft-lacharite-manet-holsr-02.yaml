  content: "This document describes the Hierarchical Optimized Link State Routing\n(HOLSR)
    mechanism for heterogeneous mobile ad hoc networks.  In this\nspecification a
    heterogeneous mobile ad hoc network is defined as a\nnetwork of mobile routers
    that are characterized by different\ncommunication capabilities, such as communication
    channels,\nprocessing powers or energy levels.\n\nThe HOLSR mechanism is an extension
    to the OLSRv2 protocol.  HOLSR\ntakes advantage of the router's distinct communications
    capabilities\nto reduce the routing control overhead in large heterogeneous ad
    hoc\nnetworks, thus improving the performance of the routing mechanism.\nMore
    precisely, HOLSR defines a hierarchy in the network and presents\na routing scheme
    for this hierarchical structure with a better\nscalability.\n\t "

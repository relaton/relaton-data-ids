  content: "   This document investigates the requirements of a minimal architecture\n
    \  for the Static Context Header Compression (and fragmentation)\n   protocol
    (SCHC).  The intent is to identify the essential components\n   their relationships
    and interfaces.  To do so, the document considers\n   scenarios of increasing
    complexity involving the use of SCHC, from a\n   simple point-to-point communication
    to a more complex deployment\n   involving multiple SCHC Instances communicating
    with each other.  In\n   this process, the authors hope to identify the essential
    components\n   of a SCHC architecture and their relationships.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Privacy is an important issue concerning many governments and users\n
    \  with its importance becoming more evident every day. Nodes might\n   change
    their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked\n   by attackers.
    This frequent IP address change also helps in the\n   prevention of information
    being leaked by nodes. In IPv6 networks\n   there is currently one solution to
    maintain the privacy of nodes when\n   IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration
    (SLAAC) (RFC 4662) is used.\n   Unfortunately there are some problems associated
    with this solution\n   which entails the use of the Privacy Extension (RFC 4941).
    Some of\n   these problems are not generating a new Interface ID (IID) after\n
    \  changing the router prefix, the fact that nodes may use an IID that\n   was
    generated based on a MAC address and use this in their response,\n   the act of
    cutting the current connections to other nodes if the max\n   lifetime of the
    old IID has elapsed, and a need to have stable\n   storage for generating a randomized
    IID. The RFC also gives no\n   explanation as to how to use CGA in its randomizing
    solution when\n   stable storage is not available. The purpose of this document
    is to\n   address these issues and to update the current RFC.\n\n\n\n\t "

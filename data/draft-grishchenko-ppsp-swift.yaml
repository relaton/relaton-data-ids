  content: "   The Generic Multiparty Protocol (swift) is a peer-to-peer based\n   transport
    protocol for content dissemination. It can be used for\n   streaming on-demand
    and live video content, as well as conventional\n   downloading. In swift, the
    clients consuming the content participate\n   in the dissemination by forwarding
    the content to other clients via a\n   mesh-like structure.  It is a generic protocol
    which can run directly\n   on top of UDP, TCP, HTTP or as a RTP profile. Features
    of swift are\n   short time-till-playback and extensibility. Hence, it can use\n
    \  different mechanisms to prevent freeriding, and work with different\n   peer
    discovery schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash\n   Tables). Depending
    on the underlying transport protocol, swift can\n   also use different congestion
    control algorithms, such as LEDBAT, and\n   offer transparent NAT traversal. Finally,
    swift maintains only a\n   small amount of state per peer and detects malicious
    modification of\n   content. This documents describes swift and how it satisfies
    the\n   requirements for the IETF Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP)\n   Working
    Group's peer protocol.\n\n\n\t "

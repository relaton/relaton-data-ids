- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but communications\nare
    usually restricted to a single path per connection.  Resource\nusage within the
    network would be more efficient were it possible for\nthese multiple paths to
    be used concurrently.  Multipath TCP is a\nproposal to achieve multipath transport
    in TCP.\n\nNew congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport\nprotocols
    such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a\nseries of issues in the
    multipath context.  One of the prominent\nproblems is that running existing algorithms
    such as TCP New Reno\nindependently on each path would give the multipath flow
    more than\nits fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its\nsubflows.
    \ Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths\navailable will transfer
    more traffic using the least congested of the\npaths, hence achieving resource
    pooling.  This would increase the\noverall utilization of the network and also
    its robustness to\nfailure.\n\nThis document presents a congestion control algorithm
    which couples\nthe congestion control algorithms running on different subflows
    by\nlinking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the\noverall aggresiveness
    of the multipath flow.  The result is a\npractical algorithm that is fair to TCP
    at bottlenecks while moving\ntraffic away from congested links.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "  A fundamental concept in Label Distribution Protocol - Interior \n  Gateway
    Protocol (LDP-IGP) Synchronization is that LDP is fully \n  established before
    the IGP path is switched for IP forwarding. This \n  document proposes a mechanism
    to affirm the switching time accurately \n  by propagating a explicit notification
    from downstream. The \n  interoperability with other Label Switched Routers (LSRs),
    which may \n  not support the mechanism, is also considered. \n\n\t "

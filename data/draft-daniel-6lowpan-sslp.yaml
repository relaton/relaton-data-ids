  content: "The Simple Service Location Protocol (SSLP) provides a framework for\nthe
    discovery and selection of the services working on 6LoWPAN.  The\nprotocol has
    a simple structure that is easy to be implemented on\n6LoWPAN devices that are
    characterized by short range, low bit rate\nand low power.  The protocol also
    offers a mechanism for\ninteroperability with the IP networks under SLP.  It enables\ncommunication
    between 6LoWPAN and other IP networks.\n\t "

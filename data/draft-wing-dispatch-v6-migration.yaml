  content: "During the migration from IPv4 to IPv6, it is anticipated that an\nIPv6
    path might be broken for a variety of reasons, causing endpoints\nto not receive
    RTP data.  Connectivity checks would detect and avoid\nthe user noticing such
    a problem, but there is industry reluctance to\nimplement connectivity checks.\n\nThis
    document describes a mechanism allowing dual-stack SIP endpoints\nto attempt communications
    over IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 if the IPv6\npath is not working.  The mechanism
    does not require connectivity\nchecks.\n\t "

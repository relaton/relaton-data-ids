  content: "An Integrated Services router performs admission control and resource\n
    \  allocation based on the information contained in a TSpec (among other\n   things).
    \ As currently defined, TSpecs convey information about the\n   data rate (using
    a token bucket) and range of packet sizes of the\n   flow in question. However,
    the TSpec may not be an accurate\n   representation of the resources needed to
    support the reservation if\n   the router is able to compress the data at the
    link level.  This\n   draft describes an extension to the TSpec which enables
    a sender of\n   potentially compressible data to provide hints to int-serv routers\n
    \  about the compressibility they may obtain.  Routers which support\n   appropriate
    compression take advantage of the hint in their admission\n   control decisions
    and resource allocation procedures; other routers\n   ignore the hint.  An initial
    application of this approach is to\n   notify routers performing RTP header compression
    that they may\n   allocate fewer resources to RTP flows.\n\t "

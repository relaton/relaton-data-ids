  content: "In Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers\nmay
    limit them to maintaining at most a few routes.  In some\nconfigurations, it is
    necessary to use these memory constrained\nrouters to deliver datagrams to nodes
    within the LLN.  The Routing\nfor Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol
    can be used in some\ndeployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g.
    the\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or few routers and forward the\nIPv6 datagram
    using a source routing technique to avoid large routing\ntables on memory constrained
    routers.  This document specifies a new\nIPv6 Routing header type for delivering
    datagrams within a RPL\ndomain.\n\t "

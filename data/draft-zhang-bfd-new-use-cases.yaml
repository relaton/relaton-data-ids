  content: "   This document describes some use cases arising from the deployment
    of\n   BFD. These use cases are expected by ISPs but not supported by\n   current
    BFD yet. Requirements are developed on basis of these use\n   cases so that they
    can be taken into consideration in the future\n   update of the BFD protocol.\n\n\t "

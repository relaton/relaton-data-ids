  content: "   The AC-influenced DF Election (AC-DF) per [RFC8584] is too dependent\n
    \  on EAD/EVI routes.  For example, when no failures occured on an ESI,\n   that
    AC-DF procedures will give incorrect results if no EAD/EVI\n   routes are advertised.
    \ But in some light-weighted EVPNs (i.e.  PBB\n   EVPNs), no EAD/EVI routes will
    be advertised at all.\n\n   This draft proposes some new extensions to support
    AC-influenced DF\n   Election without any EAD/EVI routes advertised in advance
    of any\n   <ESI, EVI> failures.\n\n\t "

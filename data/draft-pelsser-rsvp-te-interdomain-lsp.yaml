  content: "We propose extensions to RSVP-TE to allow the establishment of\ntraffic
    engineered LSPs with fast restoration requirements.  We first\ndiscuss the problem
    of\nestablishing explicitly routed interdomain LSPs and show that the\ncurrent
    subobjects found in RSVP-TE are not sufficient to establish\ninterdomain LSPs
    because they do not take into account the policy\nconstraints of the interdomain
    environment. We then show how to\nextend the fast-reroute and detour objects to
    protect interdomain\nlinks and ASBRs on interdomain LSPs.  We also discuss the\nestablishment
    of disjoint interdomain LSPs for restoration and load\nbalancing purposes in the
    appendix.  Finally, we describe the\nnecessary RSVP objects and flags and discuss
    the  impact of the\nproposed solution on the syntax of existing RSVP-TE objects
    and the\nsyntax of new required objects are presented.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "A number of schemes have been proposed over the past year or so for assigning
    and resolving Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and for associating meta-information
    with URNs.  The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Working Group is currently faced
    with the task of evaluating these schemes.  The schemes all claim to satisfy the
    functional requirements for URNs stated in RFC 1737.  A number of additional issues
    that will be helpful to consider for purposes of evaluation are listed and discussed
    in this draft.  Although this draft is long on questions and short on answers,
    it attempts to distill the issues on which consensus (even if it's agreement to
    disagree) needs to be reached before progress on standardization can be made.\n\t "

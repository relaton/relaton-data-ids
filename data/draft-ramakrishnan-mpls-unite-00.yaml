  content: "Communication networks need to support a wide range of applications\n
    \  with diverse service quality requirements.  The current widespread\n   use
    of best-effort communication also suggests that the overhead\n   for establishing
    communication both in processing and latency needs\n   to be kept at a minimum.
    \ With ATM signaling, every flow, including\n   a best-effort flow, suffers the
    overhead of end-to-end connection\n   establishment.  ATM signaling complexity
    is further exacerbated by\n   having variable length messages with a large number
    of information\n   elements using a very flexible encoding, sent on a single control\n
    \  channel.  The inclusion of QoS processing and connectivity in\n   the initial
    setup of a connection requires sequential hop-by-hop\n   processing.  Variable
    length messages involves both a single point of\n   resequencing as well as relatively
    slow, software based processing.\n   In recognition of these shortcomings, the
    MPLS working group has\n   opted to use topology driven label distribution as
    its default\n   label distribution mechanism, while at the same time acknowledging\n
    \  the possible need for on-demand label distribution.  We see these\n   different
    approaches as points on a range of solutions and we do\n   not wish to open a
    debate concerning the relative merits of each\n   approach.  However, we believe
    that if there is a need for on-demand\n   label distribution, then there is a
    need to do this very efficiently.\n   In this light we have decided to bring to
    the MPLS working group our\n   architecture for lightweight signaling.  While
    in its current form it\n   is applicable to an ATM environment, we believe that
    it represent a\n   step forward in the evolution of signaling for high speed networks.\n
    \  It holds the promise of processing signaling in hardware, thereby\n   enabling
    substantial speed up of connection setup, so as to meet the\n   needs of contemporary
    applications.\n \n   Our proposed lightweight architecture f\n\t "

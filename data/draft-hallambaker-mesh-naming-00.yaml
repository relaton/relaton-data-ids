  content: "   The importance of naming in information systems is explained with\n
    \  reference to a typical use case.  Existing Internet naming systems\n   attempt
    to strike a balance between usability and machine\n   readability.  An alternative
    approach in which separate classes of\n   identifiers are introduced for human
    and machine interaction is\n   described.  Human Interaction Identifiers are interpreted
    in the\n   context in which they are used and are thus more compact and offer
    a\n   superior user experience.  Strong Internet Names are a form of\n   Machine
    Interaction Identifier that are backwards compatible with\n   existing Internet
    names that include a DNS address and are\n   cryptographically bound to a security
    policy governing\n   interpretation.  The application of these approaches in the\n
    \  Mathematical Mesh is described.\n\n   This document is also available online

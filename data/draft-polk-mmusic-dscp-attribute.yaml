  content: "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer model currently\nhas
    no mechanism for dynamic configuration of the Differentiated \nServices Codepoints
    (DSCP) for the media streams endpoints \nestablish.  This document creates such
    a mechanism within SDP, as \ngranular as at the media stream level where more
    than one stream can\nbe in an offer/answer exchange, to set a particular DSCP
    for the \ndesired Per Hop Behavior (PHB) of a media stream. This same \nmechanism
    can change a DSCP of an existing stream based on dynamic \nnetwork conditions.\n\t "

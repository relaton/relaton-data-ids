  content: "The use of 'administratively scoped' multicast address ranges (as described
    in [1]) leads to a multicast traffic scoping mechanism that is superior to the
    original 'TTL scoping' mechanism.                          Contrary to popular
    opinion, however, administrative (often abbreviated as 'admin') scoping does not
    truly *replace* TTL scoping.  In particular, multicast-based applications must
    still be aware of which TTL value(s) they use.                                                                  In
    this document, we note that each definition of a range of admin scoped multicast
    addresses should be accompanied by a corresponding 'maximum effective TTL' that
    should be used with these addresses.  We describe how these TTL values are used
    by applications, and how they may influence the configuration of multicast border
    routers.\n\t "

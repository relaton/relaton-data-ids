  content: "   As defined in [RFC5654] MPLS-TP transport path includes LSP and PW.\n
    \  And the possibility of transferring the ownership and control of an\n   existing
    and in-use path between the management plane and the control\n   plane, without
    actually affecting data plane traffic being carried\n   over it, is a valuable
    option for carrier.  [RFC5493] and [RFC5852]\n   describe the LSP transfer.  This
    memo gives the requirement and LDP\n   extensions for PW transfer in an MPLS-TP
    network.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) architectures have been implemented\n
    \  in the industry, e.g.  [TNC, NAP, NAC], to assess the software or\n   hardware
    configuration of endpoint devices for the purposes of\n   monitoring compliance
    of endpoints to an organization's policy for\n   access to the network, and optionally
    restricting or denying access\n   until the endpoint has been updated to satisfy
    the requirements.\n   While these architectures share common components and interfaces
    to\n   support network endpoint assessment, these components are not\n   interoperable
    because not all required protocols are standards.\n\n   This document describes
    the problem these architectures are intending\n   to address, defines common terminology
    and concepts, and identifies\n   interfaces that are candidates for standardization.\n\t "

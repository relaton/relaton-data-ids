  content: "The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661] defines a mechanism\nfor
    tunneling PPP sessions.  This document proposes mechanisms by\nwhich the L2TP
    tunneling scheme can be used to provide circuit\nemulation support for layer 2
    circuits (i.e. Frame Relay or ATM), as\nwell as TDM circuits (i.e. DS1 or DS3).
    \ L2TP is used to provide\ntunneling support and each circuit is encapsulated
    over a session\ninside the Tunnel.\nAn Encapsulation Services Protocol [RefESP]
    is used on top of the\nindividual L2TP sessions to support the circuit emulation
    of layer\n2 VCs or TDM circuits.  The purpose of this document is to explain\nthe
    L2TP modifications done to facilitate support of circuit \nemulation services,
    as well as to define the additional AVPs that can\nbe used to provide the service.\n\t "

  content: "The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through
    a consensus process, taking into account the different views among IETF participants
    and coming to (at least rough) consensus on technical matters. In particular,
    the IETF is supposed not to be run by a \"majority rule\" philosophy. This is
    why we engage in rituals like \"humming\" instead of voting. However, more and
    more of our actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we
    are letting the majority win the day without consideration of minority concerns.
    This document explains some features of rough consensus, what is not rough consensus,
    how we have gotten away from it, how we might think about it differently, and
    the things we can do in order to really achieve rough consensus.\n\n Note: This
    document is quite consciously being put forward as Informational. It does not
    propose to change any IETF processes and is therefore not a BCP. It is simply
    a collection of principles, hopefully around which the IETF can come to (at least
    rough) consensus.\n\t "

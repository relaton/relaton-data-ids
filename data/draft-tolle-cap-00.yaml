  content: "This document describes a UDP/IP adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4-\nbased
    ZigBee Application Protocol that enables IP hosts to\ncommunicate using the application
    profiles and data models described\nby that protocol, over a wide range of links.
    \ This modified version\nof the ZigBee Application Protocol is named CAP (Compact
    Application\nProtocol), and it is intended to provide a complete stack of\napplication
    profiles, data exchange, binding operations, security\nprotocols, and discovery
    to IP-networked hosts and embedded devices.\nThe protocol's domain of applicability
    includes IEEE 802.15.4-based\n6LoWPAN devices, but also those on conventional
    wired and wireless\nlinks and emerging powerline communication networks.\n\t "

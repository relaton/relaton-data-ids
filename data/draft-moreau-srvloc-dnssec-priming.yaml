  content: "     By assigning the SLP (Service Location Protocol, [RFC2608]) UA\n
    \    (User Agent) role to a DNS resolver, the present document opens the\n     door
    to selective deployment of DNS root nameservice within an\n     administrative
    domain. This SLP scheme directly addresses the DNS\n     resolver configuration
    scaling issue. Usage is limited to DNSSEC-\n     enabled root nameservice. Moreover,
    from the SLP security features,\n     the proposed scheme expands the set of DNS
    root trust anchor key\n     rollover options. Early DNSSEC support at the rot
    is made possible\n     with DNSSEC root nameservice substitution, as well as later\n
    \    transparent migration to a unique DNSSEC root.\n\n\t "

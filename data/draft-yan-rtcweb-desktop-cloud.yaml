  content: "   The Web Real-time Communications (WebRTC) provides the communication\n
    \  capabilities for real-time and peer-to-peer web-based applications.\n   This
    draft is meant to provide the structure for an idea of how\n   WebRTC works on
    the desktop cloud solution and gives guidance on how\n   to overcome the issues
    and challenges in implementing and deploying.\n   Also as discussed in the mail
    archive before, the use case for\n   desktop cloud or remote desktop sharing is
    suggested to be delayed\n   after WebRTC version 1.  So this draft is very early
    and far from\n   done.\n\n\n\t "

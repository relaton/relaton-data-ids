  content: "   The Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4] does not support\n   reporting
    spam on its own.  There are a number of solutions available\n   based on the multipart/report
    content type defined in [REPORT].\n   However, these solutions require including
    the message contents and\n   hence, consume bandwidth to transmit the entire message.
    \ In\n   bandwidth-constrained environments - such as mobile networks - it is\n
    \  highly desirable to send only a minimum set of information - a\n   reference
    - instead of the entire message.  Furthermore, it is\n   desirable to permit individual
    server implementations to handle spam\n   in any way these systems choose to:
    do nothing, flag, recommend\n   deletion or relocation, perform deletion or relocation,
    and, involve\n   any choice of spam aggregator services in the decision process,
    such\n   as [OMA-SPAMREP].  Solutions that exist today employ manipulating\n   proprietary
    flags in the IMAP storage to achieve the bare minimum,\n   however more advanced
    solutions cannot be developed by using flags\n   only; the IMAP server needs to
    be involved actively in the spam\n   reporting process.\n\n   This document specifies
    the syntax of the SREP command, which allows\n   a client to inform the server
    that the user considered a message (or\n   parts thereof) spam, or, that the user
    no longer considers a message\n   (or parts thereof) spam.  Since all information
    about the message is\n   readily available on the server, the command also allows
    the server\n   to implement a more intelligent and accurate decision logic, which\n
    \  may be invoked when the spam is reported and the server can respond\n   with
    its decision to the client.\n\n   Additionally, this document contains example
    flows, illustrating\n   various decisions that the server may choose to evaluate,
    including\n   invoking a service based on [OMA-SPAMREP].\n\n   This document focuses
    only on the client-server interactions and the\n   scope is limited to messages
    that either exist on the IMAP server,\n   or, exist elsewhere and the IMAP server
    is configured to access them.\n   Consequently, deposit-time filtering, messages
    that have been\n   deleted, or, exist in an external storage but are accessible
    via an\n   access protocol unknown to the IMAP server are out of scope.\n\n\t "

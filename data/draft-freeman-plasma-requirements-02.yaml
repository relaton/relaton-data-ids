- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There are many situations where organizations want to protect\n   information
    with robust access control, either for implementation of\n   intellectual property
    right protections, enforcement of contractual\n   confidentiality agreements or
    because of legal regulations.  The\n   Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME
    defines an access control\n   mechanism which is enforced by the recipient's client
    after\n   decryption of the message. The ESS mechanism therefore is dependent\n
    \  on the correct access policy configuration of every recipient's\n   client.
    This mechanism also provides full access to the data to all\n   recipients prior
    to the access control check, this is considered to\n   be inadequate due to the
    difficulty in demonstrating policy\n   compliance.\n\n   This document lays out
    the deficiencies of the current ESS security\n   label, and presents requirements
    for a new model for doing/providing\n   access control to messages where the access
    check is performed prior\n   to message content decryption. This new model also
    does not require\n   policy configuration on the client to simplify deployment
    and\n   compliance verification.\n\n   The proposed model additionally provides
    a method where non-X.509\n   certificate credentials can be used for encryption/decryption
    of\n   S/MIME messages.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document details concerns about how Internet of Things devices\n
    \  use IP addresses and DNS names.  The issue becomes acute as network\n   operators
    begin deploying RFC8520 Manufacturer Usage Description\n   (MUD) definitions to
    control device access.\n\n   This document explains the problem through a series
    of examples of\n   what can go wrong, and then provides some advice on how a device\n
    \  manufacturer can best make deal with these issues.  The\n   recommendations
    have an impact upon device and network protocol\n   design.\n\n   {RFC-EDITOR,
    please remove.  Markdown and issue tracker for this\n   document is at https://github.com/mcr/iot-mud-dns-considerations.git\n

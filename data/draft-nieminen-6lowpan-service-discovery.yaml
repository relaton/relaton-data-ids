  content: "   The number and type of Internet connected devices continues to grow\n
    \  rapidly.  Sensors are a new category of devices that are becoming\n   Internet
    connected.  While sensors have existed for a long time, it\n   is only now that
    we see sensors being capable of communicating via an\n   IP stack.  Sensors are
    used in a multitude of industries and\n   applications.  By enabling these devices
    to be Internet connected,\n   they open up new vistas in terms of applications
    and uses.  Most\n   sensors are generally small with minimal power and processing\n
    \  capabilities.  The ability to configure these devices is a challenge.\n   However,
    in order to make the usage and deployment of Internet\n   connected sensors easier,
    it is essential that there exist a well\n   defined configuration, control, and
    service discovery mechanism.\n   This document illustrates various use cases of
    sensors in different\n   types of deployments and a solution for configuring and
    controlling\n   them in addition to the ability for sensors and devices to discover\n
    \  services.\n\n\t "

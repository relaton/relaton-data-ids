  content: "   RFC 2026 places restrictions on how Internet-Drafts can be referred\n
    \  to in RFCs.  Over time, the way that the IETF community uses\n   Internet-Drafts
    has changed.  The restrictions from RFC 2026\n   sometimes make RFCs inaccurate
    (because many drafts that are referred\n   to are not actually \"works in progress\",
    and also make references to\n   Internet-Drafts nearly useless to RFC readers.
    \ This document updates\n   the one part of RFC 2026, and the one part of RFC
    7322, that covers\n   referencing Internet-Drafts.\n\n\t "

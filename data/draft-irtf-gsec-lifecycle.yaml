  content: "This Internet-Draft considers efficient key management for\nencrypted
    multicast traffic in large groups, where the group size\nand dynamics have a significant
    impact on the network load.  We\nconsider the life cycle key management costs
    of a multicast \nconnection, and show for a Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) how member\npre-registration
    and periodic admission reduces the initialization \ncost, and how the optimum
    outdegree of a hierarchical tree varies \nwith the expected member volatility
    and rekey factor.\n\t "

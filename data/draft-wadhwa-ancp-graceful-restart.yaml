  content: "        This document describes proposed extensions to ANCP (Access Node
    \n        Control Protocol) for supporting a graceful state resynchronization
    \n        between NAS (network access server) and AN (access node) upon control
    \n        plane restart. Base ANCP as a dedicated control protocol between a \n
    \       NAS and an AN, and its various use cases are defined in [1]. \n\n\t "

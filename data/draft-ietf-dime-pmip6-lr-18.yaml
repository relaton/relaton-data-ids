abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
    Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically tunneled to
    a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term \"localized routing\" refers
    to a method by which packets are routed directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG
    of its Correspondent Node (CN) without involving any LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6
    deployment, it may be desirable to control the establishment of localized routing
    sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring that the
    session be authorized.  This document specifies how to accomplish this using the
    Diameter protocol.\n\t "

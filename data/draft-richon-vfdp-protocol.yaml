  content: "The aim of the Versatile File Delivery Protocol is to deliver files \nfrom
    few octets up to few hundred gigaoctets over multicast \nnetworks. It works over
    UDP and uses IP multicast addresses. VFDP \ntransmissions have been designed to
    be as reliable as possible \naccording to various and strong network constraints,
    either by \nretransmitting the whole file or by sending only the missing packets
    \ndepending of a return channel existence.\n\t "

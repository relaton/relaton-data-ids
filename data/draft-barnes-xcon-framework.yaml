  content: "This document defines the framework for Centralized Conferencing\n   (XCON),
    which is applicable to participants using different call\n   control signaling
    protocols and exchanging media over networks with\n   potentially different characteristics.
    \ The XCON Framework defines\n   the XCON data model, the XCON logical entities,
    the naming\n   conventions, and outlines the standard conferencing protocols\n
    \  (complementary to the call control signalling protocols) for building\n   advanced
    conferencing applications.  The framework binds all the\n   defined components
    together for the benefit of conferencing system\n   builders.\n\t "

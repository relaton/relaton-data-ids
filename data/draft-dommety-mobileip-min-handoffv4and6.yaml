  content: "Currently Mobile  IP WG is carrying  out very interesting  work in the\narea
    of Fast/Low latency handoffs for Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4. The\nhigh  level
    goal  of this  work is  to reduce  the latency  during the\nchange  of point  of
    attachement  to the  Internet (AKA  Handoff) This\ndocument discusses  one simple
    \ case that in  the author's  opinion is\nvery common  and can be optimized  to
    achevie lower  latency than that\nproposed by the various solutions.  This scenario
    applies to both IPv6\nand  IPv4  work.  The solution  at  a  high  level  is the
    \ same,  but\nrealization  will be  different  as the  frame  work in  IPv6 case
    \ is\ndifferent from that of the IPv4 case.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a simple client/server model for supporting policy
    for RSVP, and is designed to be extensible so that other kinds of client types
    may be supported in the future. The model does not make any assumptions about
    the algorithm of the policy server, but is based on the server returning a single
    priority value in response to a policy request.  The objective is to use this
    very basic model to begin policy experimentation.\n\t "

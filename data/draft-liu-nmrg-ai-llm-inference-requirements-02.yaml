abstract:
- content: "<p>With the rise of ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and other Large Language Models,
    which is short for LLMs in the remaining part, as well as the proliferation of
    inference applications, inference serving oriented to large-scale users has become
    increasingly critical. However, due to the extreme demands on computing power
    and communication during inference, the large-scale service deployment of LLMs
    poses significant challenges. To address these challenges, different vendors have
    adopted diverse inference service architectures, such as vLLM, SGLang, Mooncake,
    etc. This paper investigates mainstream inference frameworks, summarizes their
    core design principle and research question, and analyzes the challenges and requirements
    they impose on network management. The goal is to lay a foundation for defining
    a unified LLM inference architecture in the future.</p>"

  content: "   This document focuses on developing a key expansion method based on\n
    \  the internet X.509 public key infrastructure and elliptic curve\n   cryptography,
    which is applied in the context of anonymous voting.\n   The method enables end
    entities to maintain anonymity from other end\n   entities, the registration authority,
    and the certificate authority,\n   while still allowing the validity of end entity
    certificates to be\n   verified, thereby facilitating anonymous voting services.\n\n\t "

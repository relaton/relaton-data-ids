  content: "IEEE 802.1 has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) facilities.  CFM messages are structured
    with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion of TLV-structured information.
    \ IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes and TLV Types to the IETF.  This
    document specifies the IANA considerations for the assignment of values from these
    blocks.\n\t "

  content: "   This paper extends Shanon's concept of a 'work factor' to provide an\n
    \  objective measure of the practical security offered by a protocol or\n   infrastructure
    design. Considering the hypothetical work factor based\n   on an informed estimate
    of the probable capabilities of an attacker\n   with unknown resources provides
    a better indication of the relative\n   strength of protocol designs than the
    computational work factor of\n   the best known attack.\n\n   The social work
    factor is a measure of the trustworthiness of a\n   credential issued in a PKI
    based on the cost of having obtained the\n   credential through fraud at a certain
    point in time. Use of the\n   social work factor allows evaluation of Certificate
    Authority based\n   trust models, peer to peer (Web of Trust) models to be evaluated
    in\n   the same framework. The analysis shows that each model has clear\n   benefits
    over the other for some classes of user but most classes of\n   user are served
    better by a combination of both.\n\n\t "

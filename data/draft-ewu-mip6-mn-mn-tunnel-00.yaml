  content: "   Mobile IPv6 provides mobility support for mobile devices moving\n   around
    the Internet.  It specifies that when a mobile host wishes for\n   peers to communicate
    directly to its visited location, that the peer\n   send packets using a Routing
    Header, Type 2.  Corresponding packets\n   from the mobile use a Home Address
    option.\n\n   When two moving devices communicate, they may wish to use a the
    most\n   direct data path between their respective locations.  Use of this\n   direct
    data path incurs the cost of both Routing Header and Home\n   Address Options,
    in each direction.  This document provides a simple\n   means of reducing this
    overhead.\n\t "

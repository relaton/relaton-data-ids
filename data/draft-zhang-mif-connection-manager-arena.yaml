  content: "This document presents a \"Connection Manager\" model implemented in \nthe
    platform Arena, a mobile OS based on Linux. The introduction of \nConnection Manager
    brings two major benefits in Arena. First, it \nlogically decouples the underlining
    connection approach with the \nconnection management. Second, it plays a central
    role which executes \nthe policy of OS, especially for multiple interfaces.\n\t "

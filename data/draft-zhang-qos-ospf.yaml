  content: "This document describes a series of extensions for OSPF[1] and MOSPF[2]\nthat
    can be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS) routing in\nconjunction with a
    resource reservation protocol such as RSVP[4] or\nother mechanisms that can notify
    routing of the QoS needs of a data\nflow. Advertisements indicating the resources
    available and the\nresources used are advertised to the OSPF routing domain and
    paths are\ncomputed based on topology information, link resource information,
    and\nthe resource requirements of a particular data flow.\n\t "

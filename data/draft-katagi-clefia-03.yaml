  content: "This document describes the specification of the blockcipher CLEFIA.  CLEFIA
    is a 128-bit blockcipher, with key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits, which is
    compatible with the interface of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  The
    algorithm of CLEFIA was published in 2007, and its security has been scrutinized
    in the public community.  CLEFIA is one of the new-generation lightweight blockcipher
    algorithms designed after AES.  Among them, CLEFIA offers high performance in
    software and hardware as well as lightweight implementation in hardware.  CLEFIA
    will be of benefit to the Internet, which will be connected to more distributed
    and constrained devices.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

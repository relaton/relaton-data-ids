  content: "   Applications such as e-mail track the reputation of the hosts that\n
    \  connect to them by IP address.  Since the IPv6 address space is so\n   large,
    a reputation system needs to aggregate the data for the IPs\n   useded by a single
    entity.  This document describes a file format a\n   network operator can use
    to describe the sizes of the IP prefixes it\n   allocates, for reputation systems
    to use to determine the aggregation\n   boundaries.\n\n   It also specifies an
    addition to the the Routing Policy Specification\n   Language (RPSL) inetnum:
    class to refer to the location of the\n   boundary file, and a method to sign
    boundary files.\n\n\t "

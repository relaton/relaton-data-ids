  content: "   The Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) manifest\n   provides
    a way for many different update and boot workflows to be\n   described by a common
    format.  However, this does not provide a\n   feedback mechanism for developers
    in the event that an update or boot\n   fails.\n\n   This specification describes
    a lightweight feedback mechanism that\n   allows a developer in possession of
    a manifest to reconstruct the\n   decisions made and actions performed by a manifest
    processor.\n\n\t "

  content: "With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes, it becomes
    increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance metrics with high precision.
    \ To do so in an interoperable manner, a common protocol for such measurements
    is required.  This document specifies requirements for a one-way active measurement
    protocol (OWAMP) standard.  The protocol can measure one-way delay, as well as
    other unidirectional characteristics, such as one-way loss.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

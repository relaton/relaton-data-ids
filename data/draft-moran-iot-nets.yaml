  content: "   The IETF has developed security technologies that help to secure the\n
    \  Internet of Things even over constrained networks and when targetting\n   constrained
    nodes.  These technologies can be used independenly or\n   can be composed into
    larger systems to mitigate a variety of threats.\n   This documents illustrates
    an overview over these technologies and\n   highlights their relationships.  Ultimately,
    a threat model is\n   presented as a basis to derive requirements that interconnect\n
    \  existing and emerging solution technologies.\n\n\t "

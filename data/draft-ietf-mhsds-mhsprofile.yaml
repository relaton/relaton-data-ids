  content: "The document ``MHS Use of Directory to support MHS Routing'' describes
    a comprehensive approach to MHS use of directory to support routing.  This document
    defines a strict subset of this document, which is intended to solve the most
    pressing problems.  It also defines a practical first step for implementation,
    such that this subset can be deployed prior to fuller implementation.                                                            This
    document does not repeat information in the other document.  Duplication would
    only lead to the possibility of inconsistency.           WARNING: This document
    must be read in the contex of the document it profiles.  It is meaningless as
    a standalone document.                     This draft document will be submitted
    to the RFC editor as a protocol standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

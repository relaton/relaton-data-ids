  content: "   This document defines the format of an electronic signature that can\n
    \  remain valid over long periods.  This includes evidence as to its\n   validity
    even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny\n   (i.e., repudiates
    the validity of the signature). The format can be\n   considered as an extension
    to RFC 3369 and RFC 2634, where, when\n   appropriate additional signed and unsigned
    attributes have been\n   defined.  The contents of this Informational RFC amounts
    to a \n   transposition of the ETSI TS 101 733 V.1.6.3 (CMS Advanced \n   Electronic
    Signatures - CAdES) and is technically equivalent to it.\n\t "

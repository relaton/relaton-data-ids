  content: "Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reserved\nresources
    in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if the\ncorrespondent node does not
    support QoS, it would be useful to be\nable to reserve at least local resources
    at the access network,\nespecially wireless link resources. Additionally, for
    mobile nodes\nthe continuity of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signalling
    or\nslow re-reservations of resources after each handover. This draft\nproposes
    a simple enhancement to RSVP, so that initial resource\nreservations and re-reservations
    due to host mobility can be done\nlocally in an access network.\n\t "

  content: "   An Omnibroker is an agent chosen and trusted by an Internet user to\n
    \  provide information such as name and certificate status information\n   that
    are in general trusted even if they are not trustworthy.  Rather\n   than acting
    as a mere conduit for information provided by existing\n   services, an Omnibroker
    is responsible for curating those sources to\n   protect the user.\n\n   The Omnibroker
    Protocol (OBP) provides an aggregated interface to\n   trusted Internet services
    including DNS, OCSP and various forms of\n   authentication service.  Multiple
    transport bindings are supported to\n   permit efficient access in virtually every
    common deployment scenario\n   and ensure access in any deployment scenario in
    which access is not\n   being purposely denied.\n\n\t "

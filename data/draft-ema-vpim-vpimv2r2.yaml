  content: "Voice messaging evolved as telephone answering service into a full\nsend,
    receive, and forward messaging paradigm with unique message\nfeatures, semantics
    and usage patterns. Voice messaging was\nintroduced on special purpose computers
    that interface to a telephone\nswitch and provide call answering and voice messaging
    services.\nTraditionally, messages sent from one voice messaging system to\nanother
    were transported using analog networking protocols based on\nDTMF signaling and
    analog voice playback.  As the demand for\nnetworking increases, there was a need
    for a standard high-quality\ndigital protocol to connect these machines.  VPIM
    has successfully\ndemonstrated its usefulness as this new standard.  VPIM is widely\nimplemented
    and is seeing deployment in early adopter customer\nnetworks. This document clarifies
    ambiguities found in the earlier\nspecification and is consistent with implementation
    practice. The\nprofile is referred to as VPIM (Voice Profile for Internet Mail)
    in\nthis document.\nThis second revision of the version 2 of obsoletes RFC 2421
    which\nless precisely describes version 2 of the profile.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and\n   Authorization
    for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework.  It\n   utilizes Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
    Over COSE (EDHOC) for achieving\n   mutual authentication between an OAuth 2.0
    Client and Resource\n   Server, and it binds an authentication credential of the
    Client to an\n   OAuth 2.0 access token.  EDHOC also establishes an Object Security\n
    \  for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) Security Context, which\n   is
    used to secure communications when accessing protected resources\n   according
    to the authorization information indicated in the access\n   token.  A resource-constrained
    server can use this profile to\n   delegate management of authorization information
    to a trusted host\n   with less severe limitations regarding processing power
    and memory.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the Null Scheme for use in Signed Objects in\n
    \  the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  The Null Scheme is a\n   niche
    signature scheme that can replace the redundant and costly use\n   of actual digital
    signatures from so-called \"one-time-use\" key pairs\n   in Signed Objects.  The
    Null Scheme has as public key the digest of\n   the message to be signed, and
    the signature is always empty.  When a\n   Null Scheme public key is the subject
    of a Signed Object's one-time-\n   use End-Entity (EE) certificate, it establishes
    a secure binding\n   between the issuer of the EE certificate and the message
    to be\n   signed.  This is cheaper in terms of size and verification time than\n
    \  using a real signature scheme, while providing the same security\n   guarantees.\n\n\t "

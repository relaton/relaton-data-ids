abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the Null Scheme for use in Signed Objects in
    the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The Null Scheme is a niche signature
    scheme that can replace the redundant and costly use of actual digital signatures
    from so-called "one-time-use" key pairs in Signed Objects. The Null Scheme has
    as public key the digest of the message to be signed, and the signature is always
    empty. When a Null Scheme public key is the subject of a Signed Object's one-time-
    use End-Entity (EE) certificate, it establishes a secure binding between the issuer
    of the EE certificate and the message to be signed. This is cheaper in terms of
    size and verification time than using a real signature scheme, while providing
    the same security guarantees.</p>

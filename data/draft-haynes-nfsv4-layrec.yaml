  content: "   The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows for a file's metadata\n
    \  (MDS) and data (DS) to be on different servers.  When the metadata\n   server
    is restarted, the client can still modify the data file\n   component.  During
    the recovery phase of startup, the metadata server\n   and the data servers work
    together to recover state (which files are\n   open, last modification time, size,
    etc).  A problem with servers\n   which do client side mirroring there is no means
    by which the client\n   can report errors to the metadata server.  As such, the
    metadata\n   server has to assume that file needs resilvering.  This document\n
    \  presents a refinement to RFC8435 to allow the client to update the\n   metadata\n\n\t "

  content: "Mobile IP [1] has been developed in the IETF for a number of years already.\nIt's
    simplicity and scalability give it a growing success within the \nIETF as several
    Internet drafts are proposed to extend various \nimprovements for Mobile IP and
    its counterpart designed \nfor IPv6, Mobile IPv6 [2].  Mobile IP suffers from
    several well-known \nweaknesses that have led to the definition of the macro/micro-mobility
    \ \narchitecture.  Such an architecture implies the division of the mobility \narchitecture
    into two different parts: mobility management at a \nlarge scale, between the
    different domains (macro-mobility), and, on the other hand, at a local scale,
    inside these domains (micro-mobility).  Each type of mobility is then managed
    by specific mechanisms and protocols.  \nThe macro-micro approach results in many
    advantages that all \nmicro-mobility protocols will have; thereby effectively
    addressing weaknesses that plague Mobile IP.\n\nThis document discusses the micro-mobility
    problem, and is an attempt to\nenumerate some of the concepts and approaches defining
    the micromobility\nproblem space.  This draft will serve to document the problem\nspace
    and definition of micro-mobility for discussion in the IRTF\nmicro-mobility working
    group.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Sieve Email Filtering \"include\" extension permits users to\ninclude
    one Sieve script inside another.  This can make managing\nlarge scripts or multiple
    sets of scripts much easier, as well as\nsupporting common 'libraries' of scripts.
    \ Users are able to include\ntheir own personal scripts or site-wide scripts provided
    by the local\nSieve implementation.\n\nChange History (to be removed prior to
    publication as an RFC)\n\nChanges from -05 to -06:\na.  Aaron Stone joins as author.\nb.
    \ Removed | characters from the script examples.\nc.  Updated draft references
    to published RFCs.\n\nChanges from -04 to -05:\na.  Fixed examples.\nb.  Relaxed
    requirement that imported/exported variables be set\n\n before being used.\n\nChanges
    from -03 to -04:\na.  Fixed missing 2119 definitions.\nb.  Defined interaction
    with variables through use of import and\n\n export commands.\n\nChanges from
    -02 to -03:\na.  Refreshing expired draft (updated for nits).\nb.  Syntax -> Usage.\nc.
    \ Updated to 3028bis reference.\n\nChanges from -01 to -02:\na.  Minor formatting
    changes only - refreshing expired draft.\n\nChanges from -00 to -01:\na.  Added
    IPR boiler plate.\nb.  Re-ordered sections at start to conform to RFC style.\nc.
    \ Moved recursion comment into General Considerations section.\nd.  Switched to
    using optional parameter to indicate personal vs\n\n global.\ne.  Explicitly state
    that an error occurs when a missing script is\n\n included.Open Issues (to be
    resolved prior to publication as an RFC)\n\na.  Interaction with variables (scoping).
    \ Should variables be\n\n carried over between scripts that are included?  Or
    should\n\n variables defined in an included script be local to that script\n\n
    only?\n\t "

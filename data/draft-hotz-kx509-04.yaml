  content: "   This document describes a protocol, called kx509, for using Kerberos\n
    \  tickets to acquire X.509 certificates.  These certificates may be\n   used
    for many of the same purposes as X.509 certificates acquired by\n   other means,
    but if a Kerberos infrastructure already exists then the\n   overhead of using
    kx509 may be much less.\n\n   While not (previously) standardized, this protocol
    is already in use\n   at several large organizations, and certificates issued
    with this\n   protocol are recognized by the International Grid Trust Federation.\n\n\t "

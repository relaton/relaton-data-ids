  content: "   BGP is commonly used with network operators in order to distribute\n
    \  routing information for both infrastructure routes as well as service\n   routing
    information.  BGP is used due to its ability to handle high\n   amounts of prefixes
    and paths information coupled with administrative\n   attributes, such as communities,
    in a reliable and scalable manner.\n\n   A route-reflector is a key network component
    of BGP as it propose an\n   alternative to internal border gateway protocol (iBGP)
    fully-meshed\n   peering requirement.  By acting as a concentration point it learns,\n
    \  process, and reflect prefixes from and to all its iBGP Peers also\n   referred
    as route-reflector clients, and is a key element of such\n   networks performances.\n\n
    \  As today networks grow in terms of size and offered services, this\n   translates
    into more prefixes to be handled by BGP Route-Reflectors,\n   and there is a demand
    by service providers to be able to benchmark\n   this key function in a realistic
    and consistent manner.\n\n   This document covers how to provide an accurate BGP
    route-reflector\n   benchmark.\n\n\t "

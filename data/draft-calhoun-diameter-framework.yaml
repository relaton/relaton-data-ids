  content: "Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks by\nusing
    the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication,\nAuthorization and Accounting
    (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recent\nwork done in the Roaming Operations
    (ROAMOPS) Working Group was to\ninvestigate whether RADIUS could be used in a
    roaming network, and\nconcluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain purposes.\nThe
    IETF has formed a new NAS Requirements Working Group, and part of\ntheir charter
    is to document the next generation NAS' AAA\nrequirements.  Recently, the Mobile-IP
    Working Group also documented\ntheir own AAA requirements that would help Mobile
    IP scale for\nInter-Domain mobility.\nThe DIAMETER protocol is a follow-on to
    the RADIUS protocol. DIAMETER\naddresses the known RADIUS deficiencies, and is
    intended for use with\nthe NASREQ and Mobile IP application space.\n\t "

  content: "Modern data center networks face a number of scale challenges.  One\nsuch
    challenge for so-called \"massive\" data center networks is\naddress resolution,
    such as is provided by ARP and/or ND.  This\ndocument describes the problem of
    address resolution in massive data\ncenters.  It discusses the network impact
    of various data center\ntechnologies including server virtualization, illustrates
    reasons\nwhy it is still desirable to have multiple hosts on the same Layer 2\ndata
    center network, and describes potential address resolution\nproblems this type
    of Layer 2 network will face.\n\t "

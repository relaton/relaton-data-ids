  content: "This document is one of two reports on the Integrated ISIS protocol. The
    other report documents an analysis of the protocol. These two reports are required
    by the IAB/IESG in order for an Internet routing protocol to advance to Draft
    Standard Status. Integrated ISIS is an Interior Gateway Protocol and is designed
    to carry both IP and ISO CLNP routing information.                                                               Integrated
    ISIS is currently designated as a Proposed Standard. The protocol was first published
    in RFC 1195. Internet Draft [2] was published subsequently to RFC 1195 and documents
    the current version of the protocol.                                                              This
    report documents experience with Integrated ISIS. This includes reports on interoperability
    testing, field experience and the current state of Integrated ISIS implementations.
    It also presents a summary of the Integrated ISIS Management Information Base
    (MIB), and a summary of the Integrated ISIS authentication mechanism.                              Please

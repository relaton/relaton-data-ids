  content: "   This memo discusses the problems of audio codecs with variable \n   external
    sampling rates.  Historically, for audio codecs, the RTP \n   timestamp frequency
    was chosen to match the sampling rate of the \n   audio codec.  However, this
    choice is nowadays more difficult to \n   justify, because of the advent of audio
    codecs (and, even more \n   important, practical use cases) that support multiple
    sample rates \n   and the switch between the sample rates during the lifetime
    of an \n   RTP session.  This Internet draft addresses the problem by \n   suggesting
    that RTP Payload RFCs for such codecs to utilize a \n   single, high, unified
    RTP timestamp frequency.\n\t "

  content: "   This document contains a specification for a token authentication\n
    \  mechanism that is sufficiently resource-friendly to use it on small\n   embedded
    or mobile devices.  The three involved parties are a service\n   consumer (CON)
    a service provider (SP) and an authentication provider\n   (AP).  The authentication
    provider decouples authentication and the\n   actual service that is consumed.
    \ It also serves as anonymizer.  The\n   consumer authenticates at the authentication
    provider, requests one\n   or more authorization tokens and redeems those tokens
    when accessing\n   the service provider's offered services.\n\n\t "

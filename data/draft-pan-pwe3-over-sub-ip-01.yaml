  content: "Several recent developments have significantly affected the carrier\naccess
    networks.  First, all large carrier backbones have migrated to\nMPLS. Second,
    carriers are upgrading access circuits with less expensive\nand high-speed Ethernet.
    Finally, the carriers will be offering advanced\ndata services over the access
    network infrastructure. Subsequently, the\ncarriers have to face challenges in
    migration cost, data transport\nefficiency and edge-to-edge user traffic management.\n\nThe
    Dry-Martini architecture is designed to help the carriers to\nalleviate these
    challenges. It provides an approach to establish and\nmaintain pseudo-wires over
    any access network infrastructure, while\nstripping off much of the IP/MPLS routing
    and signaling features that\nare irrelevant in access network. As a result, all
    the existing\ntransport equipment, such as SONET/SDH MSPP, can provide MPLS pseudo-\nwire
    functionality without much change to the existing platform.\nFurther, due its
    simplicity, this approach allows the new access\ndevices, such as PON’s and Ethernet
    CPE’s, to maintain low cost, while\nbeing able to interface with MPLS networks.\n\nThis
    document assumes that the reader has at least some familiarity with\nMPLS and
    pseudo-wire technologies.\n\t "

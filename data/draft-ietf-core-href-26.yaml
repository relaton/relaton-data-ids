abstract:
- content: '<p>The Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) is a complement to the Uniform
    Resource Identifier (URI) that represents the URI components in Concise Binary
    Object Representation (CBOR) rather than as a sequence of characters. This approach
    simplifies parsing, comparison, and reference resolution in environments with
    severe limitations on processing power, code size, and memory size. This RFC updates
    RFC 7595 by adding a column on the "URI Schemes" registry as well as a note on
    how that registry cooperates with the "CRI Scheme Numbers for Certain Unregistered
    Scheme Names" registry created by the present RFC. // (This "cref" paragraph will
    be removed by the RFC editor:) The // present revision -26 is taking on the results
    from the 2025-10-09 // IESG telechat (issue #140), by integrating the CRI scheme
    number // column into the URI scheme registry created by RFC 7595 and // keeping
    the URI-Scheme registration process essentially unchanged // from the point of
    view of a registrant that does not have any // special requirements on the CRI
    scheme number assigned. Also, the // cri'''' application-extension syntax has
    been moved to draft-ietf- // cbor-edn-literals, which is currently lagging behind
    in the // approval process.</p>'

  content: "This document specifies a mechanism of dual stack hosts using the\ntechnique
    called 'Bump-in-the-API' which allows for the hosts to\ncommunicate with other
    IPv6 hosts using existing IPv4 applications.\nThe goal of this mechanism is the
    same as the Bump-in-the-stack\nmechanism [BIS], but this mechanism provides the
    translation method\nbetween the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs. So that the goal is achieved\nsimply
    without IP header translation.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft discusses the interaction of Differentiated Services\n(diffserv)
    [RFC-2474, RFC-2475] with IP tunnels of various forms.\nThe discussion of tunnels
    in the diffserv architecture [RFC-2475]\nhas been found to provide insufficient
    guidance to tunnel designers\nand implementers.  With the aim of providing such
    guidance, this\ndocument describes two conceptual models for the interaction of\ndiffserv
    with IP tunnels and employs them to explore the resulting\nconfigurations and
    combinations of functionality.  An important\nconsideration is how and where diffserv
    traffic conditioning should\nbe performed in the presence of tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation.\nA
    few simple mechanisms are also proposed that limit the complexity\nthat tunnels
    would otherwise add to the diffserv traffic\nconditioning model; these mechanisms
    are also generally useful in\nsituations where more general traffic conditioning
    is inappropriate\nor unavailable.  Security considerations for IPsec tunnels place\nsome
    limits on possible functionality in some circumstances.\nWARNING: The current
    status of this draft is highly preliminary; its\nmajor purpose is to foster discussion
    within the working group.\nAbove and beyond the usual cautionary notice about
    not relying on\nInternet-Drafts, implementers are specifically warned that\nsignificant
    changes are expected to the contents of this draft.\n\t "

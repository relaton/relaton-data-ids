abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines OODA-HTTP, a protocol extension and adaptive
    security framework that applies the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop to HTTP/HTTPS
    communications. Each HTTP request is transformed into an observation signal, a
    decision vector, and an opportunity for active defense. OODA-HTTP extends the
    traditional 4-phase loop into 7 phases: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, Memorize,
    Adjust, and Cooperate - allowing systems to evolve and adapt during communication.
    The protocol introduces a structured header, 'OODA-Action', that carries context-driven
    actions between endpoints. OODA-HTTP offers compatibility with existing infrastructure
    (e.g., TLS, HTTP/2/3), while enabling resilience against classical, behavioral,
    and quantum threats. It supports inter-protocol cooperation with DOTS, STAMP,
    SIEMs, and behavioral inference engines such as SVDD and PSLPSO. This document
    defines protocol behavior, header format, core logic, and interoperability strategy.</p>"

  content: "On July 24-26, 1990, an invited panel met at the Corporation for National
    Research Initiatives in Reston Virginia to consider the issues involved with interworking
    between protocol stacks based on Connection-mode Network Service (CONS, or CO)
    and Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS, or CL).  The main example of a
    CO stack is OSI TP0 over X.25.   Examples of CL protocolstacks include OSI TP4
    over CLNP and TCP over IP.                                                                                          The
    workshop was convened at the direction of RARE and the U.S. Federal Networking
    Council (FNC).  The meeting was organized and co-chaired by Les Clyne (UK Joint
    Network Team) and Phillip Gross(Corporation for National Research Initiatives).
    \ An electronic mailing list was established for use by both attendees and a wider
    audience of experts.                                                                                                    This
    report gives an overview and synopsis of the deliberations at the meeting, and
    it describes the outcome.\n\t "

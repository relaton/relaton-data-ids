  content: "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be used to provide means of\npersonal,
    terminal, and service mobility in a mobile Internet. This\ndocument describes
    two schemes for supporting service mobility in a\nSIP environment. The first assumes
    that call states are maintained\nand stored within the network and home network
    always controls calls\nand services of its subscribers. The second assumes that
    call states\nare stored in the mobile stations (MSs) and managed in a distributed\nmanner,
    and the visited network controls users' calls and services.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an efficient identity-based key management
    (IBKM) scheme in wireless sensor networks (WSNs),where the nodes are resource-limited,
    i.e., low computing capacity, small memory, power supply limitations and price,etc.
    This scheme exploits the Bloom filter to authenticate the communication sensor
    node with storage efficiency. The security analysis shows that IBKM can prevent
    several attacks effectively with acceptable computation and communication overhead.</p>"

  content: "[PWE3 Control] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing \npoint-to-point
    pseudowires between two provider edge (PE) nodes. The \nGeneralized ID FEC element
    contained in PWE3 signaling protocols \ninclude TLV fields that identify pseudowire
    endpoints called \nattachment individual identifiers (AII). This document defines
    an AII \nstructure in the form of new AII type-length-value fields that \nsupports
    AII aggregation for improved scalability. It is envisioned \nthat this would be
    useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire \nservice networks where pseudowires
    are established between selected \nlocal and remote PE nodes based on customer
    need. \n\t "

  content: "   In virtualized networks, machines with processing and storage are\n
    \  virtualized resources on which network functional entities can be\n   allocated
    and relocated dynamically.  Such dynamic allocation and\n   relocation of network
    entities imposes the challenge of service\n   mobility, i.e., how to maintain
    not only coupling relations between\n   those network entities but also sessions
    established between those\n   entities in a virtualized environment.  This document
    provides a\n   reference model for managing service mobility in the virtual\n
    \  environment and defines the control protocol between the virtualized\n   platform
    and the managing controller to realize service mobility.\n   Such capability is
    especially longed for realizing more scalable and\n   reliable telecom networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Simple Commerce Messaging Protocol (SCMP) is a general-purpose \nelectronic
    commerce message protocol for secure, real-time \ncommunication of a set of data
    from a sending agent's application \nto a receiving agent's server. Additionally
    the response by the \nreceiving agent's server to the sending agent is the reply
    from the \nrequest represented by the set of data in the message's payload. The
    \nintent of this protocol is to define a method where trading partners \ncan perform
    on-line business requests in an environment where the sending partner is fully
    authenticated, and the message cannot be repudiated.\n\t "

  content: "   [RFC3552] provides guidance to authors in crafting RFC text on\n   Security
    Considerations. The RFC is more than fifteen years old.\n   With the threat landscape
    and security ecosystem significantly\n   changed since the RFC was published,
    RFC3552 is a candidate for\n   update. This draft proposes that, prior to drafting
    an update to\n   RFC3552, an examination of recent, published Security Considerations\n
    \  sections be carried out as a baseline for how to improve RFC3552. It\n   suggests
    a methodology for examining Security Considerations\n   sections in published
    RFCs and the extraction of both quantitative\n   and qualitative information that
    could inform a revision of the\n   older guidance. It also reports on a recent
    experiment on textual\n   analysis of sixteen years of RFC Security Consideration
    sections.\n\n\t "

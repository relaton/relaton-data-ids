  content: "Optical transport networks require fast restoration mechanisms with \ntight
    time bounds in order to recover from resource failures in a \ntimely manner.  These
    failures may include fiber cuts, transponder \nfailure and node failures.  Time-bounded
    recovery is challenging in \nmesh-based transport networks with shared protection.
    \ This draft \ndiscusses some currently available mechanisms and their limitations,
    \nand explains the need for an expedited flooding mechanism to \naccomplish this
    objective.  The draft also highlights some \nchallenges, mitigating factors, and
    possible solutions in the \nimplementation of an expedited flooding protocol.\n\t "

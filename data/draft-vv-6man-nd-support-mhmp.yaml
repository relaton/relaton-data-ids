  content: "   Multi-home Multi-prefix (MHMP) IPv6 environment is the norm for\n   businesses
    that need to have uplink resiliency.\n   Several solutions have been already discussed
    and proposed to\n   address MHMP and how it can be enabled in different network\n
    \  contexts. This draft looks at MHMP from the perspective of Neighbour\n   Discovery
    Protocols (NDP).\n\n   For any considered destination, the MHMP challenge may
    be split into\n   3 sub-challenges (important to solve in the below order):\n
    \  1) the host should choose the proper source address for the packet,\n   2)
    the host should choose the best default router as the next hop,\n   3) site topology
    may be complicated and may need the source routing\n   through the site.\n\n   This
    draft is concerned with the solution for the first two problems\n   that need
    improvement for the ND (RFC 4861) SLAAC (RFC 4862) and\n   Default Address Selection
    (RFC 6724). The last problem is considered\n   as properly discussed by Multihoming
    in Enterprise (RFC 8678).\n\n\t "

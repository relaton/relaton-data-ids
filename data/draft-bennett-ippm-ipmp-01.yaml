- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The practice and need for active network measurement is well \nestablished,
    however current tools are not well suited to this task, \nmostly because the protocols
    which they employ have not been designed \nfor measurement of the modern Internet.
    \nThe IP Measurement Protocol (IPMP) is based on packet-probes, and is \ndesigned
    to allow routers to participate in measurements by the \ninsertion of path information
    as the probe passes between a pair of \nhosts.\n\t "

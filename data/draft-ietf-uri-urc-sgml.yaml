  content: "The URI Working Group has been developing an architecture where Internet
    resources are identified using a Uniform Resource Name (URN), and retrieved using
    a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Mapping URNs to URLs is the job of the Uniform
    Resource Characteristics (URC) service, whose requirements were given in [1].
    \ This paper presents one possible specification for the URC service.  This spec
    provides the means for the URC service to formally specify new capabilities, while
    retaining the speed that is paramount to the fundamental use of the URC service
    as the means for URN to URL resolution.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "During the next few years, as the Ipv4 address space moves toward \nexhaustion,
    it is likely that the deployment of NAT will accelerate. \nBy 2005, millions of
    NAT devices will likely be deployed on the \nInternet, both within enterprises
    and consumer households. Should \nthose NAT devices not support either native
    Ipv6, or IPv6 transition \nmechanisms such as 6 to 4, the result would be significant
    delays in \nthe deployment of IPv6. \n\n\t "

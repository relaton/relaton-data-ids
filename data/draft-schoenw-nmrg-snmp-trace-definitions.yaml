  content: "   The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an activity to\n
    \  collect traces of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) from\n   operational
    networks.  To analyze these traces, it is necessary to\n   split potentially large
    traces into more manageable pieces that make\n   it easier to deal with large
    data sets and simplify the analysis of\n   the data.\n\n   This document provides
    some common definitions that have been found\n   useful for implementing tools
    to support trace analysis.  This\n   document mainly serves as a reference for
    the definitions underlying\n   these tools and it is not meant to explain all
    the motivation and\n   reasoning behind the definitions.  Some of this background\n
    \  information can be found in other research papers.\n\t "

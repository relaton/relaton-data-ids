  content: "This document provides a summary of the \"Workshop on Internet of Things
    (IoT) Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI)\", which took place in Santa Clara, California
    March 17-18, 2016.  The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion on
    the different approaches used by companies and Standards Developing Organizations
    (SDOs) to accomplish interoperability at the application layer.  This report summarizes
    the discussions and lists recommendations to the standards community.  The views
    and positions in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not
    necessarily reflect those of the authors or the Internet Architecture Board (IAB),
    which organized the workshop.  Note that this document is a report on the proceedings
    of the workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are those
    of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.\n\t "

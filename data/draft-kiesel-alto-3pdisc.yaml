  content: "The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to\nprovide
    guidance to applications, which have to select one or several\nhosts from a set
    of candidates that are able to provide a desired\nresource.\n\nEntities seeking
    guidance need to discover and possibly select an\nALTO server to ask.  This is
    called ALTO server discovery.  This memo\ndescribes an ALTO server discovery mechanism
    based on several\nalternative mechanisms that are applicable in a diverse set
    of ALTO\ndeployments.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the functional requirements for a protocol\nused
    by a call processing agent in a packet network to control an\ninteractive voice
    response function located in the same packet net-   work or at the interface of
    the packet network and the traditional\ntelephone network. These requirements
    focus primary on audio, however   the protocol could be extended in the future
    to support other media\nstreams such as video.\n\t "

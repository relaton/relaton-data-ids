  content: "Full use of electronic mail throughout the world requires that people\nbe
    able to use their own names, written correctly in their own\nlanguages and scripts,
    as mailbox names in email addresses.  This\ndocument introduces a series of specifications
    and operational\nsuggestions that define mechanisms and protocol extensions needed
    to\nfully support internationalized email addresses.  These changes\ninclude an
    SMTP extension and extension of email header syntax to\naccommodate UTF-8 data.
    \ The document set also will include\ndiscussion of key assumptions and issues
    in deploying fully\ninternationalized email.\n\n\n\t "

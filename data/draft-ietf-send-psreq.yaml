  content: "The existing IETF standards specify that IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
    and Address Autoconfiguration mechanisms may be protected with IPsec Authentication
    Header (AH).  However, the current specifications limit the security solutions
    to manual keying due to practical problems faced with automatic key management.
    \ This document specifies three different trust models and discusses the threats
    pertinent to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.  The purpose of this discussion is to define
    the requirements for Securing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

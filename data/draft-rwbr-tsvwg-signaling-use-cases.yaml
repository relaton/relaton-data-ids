  content: "   Host-to-network (and vice versa) signaling can improve the user\n   experience
    by informing the network which flows are more important\n   and which packets
    within a flow are more important without having to\n   disclose the content of
    the packets being delivered.  The\n   differentiated service may be provided at
    the network (e.g., packet\n   discard preference), the sender (e.g., adaptive
    transmission or\n   session migration), or through cooperation of both the host
    and the\n   network.\n\n   This document lists use cases demonstrating the need
    for a mechanism\n   to share metadata about flows between a receiving host and
    its\n   networks to enable differentiated traffic treatment for packets sent\n
    \  to the host.  Such a mechanism is typically implemented using a\n   signaling
    protocol between the host and a set of network elements.\n\n\t "

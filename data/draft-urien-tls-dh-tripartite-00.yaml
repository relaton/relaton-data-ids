  content: "Most of privacy exchanges over the Internet rely on the TLS protocol.
    \nAccording to this protocol two entities the client and the server \ncomputes
    a master secret from which are deduced cryptographic keys \nused for data privacy
    and security. Digital transactions may deal \nwith critical information (payments
    ...) that need to be recorded for \ntraceability issues or for legal requirements.
    However messages are \nsecured by the TLS protocol, so it is not possible for
    a third party \nthat logs packets to perform decryption operations upon legitimate
    \nrequests. \n    \nThe goal of this draft is to support a Trusted Third Party
    (TTP) that \ncould recover the protected information when needed. The proposed
    \nprotocol uses the Tripartite Diffie-Hellman (tdh) algorithm based on \nbilinear
    pairings over elliptic curves. \n\n\t "

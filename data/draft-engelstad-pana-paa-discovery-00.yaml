  content: "A PANA authentication protocol is under development in the PANA\nWorking
    Group. It will allow hosts to authenticate with PANA\nAuthentication Agents (PAAs).
    The protocol is expected to run over\nsome IP-based transport protocol, such as
    ICMP, UDP, TCP or SCTP.\nBefore a host can authenticate with a PAA, it must obtain
    an IP-\naddress of the PAA. This document specifies such a 'discovery'\nmechanism
    by defining extensions (or options) to Router\nAdvertisements and DHCP messages
    for both IPv4 and IPv6. Hosts MAY\nalso obtain an identity of a PAA and other
    information during the\ndiscovery process. The proposed discovery mechanism makes
    no\nassumptions about the location of a PAA, and more than one PAA may\nbe discovered.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their role
    in\n   the NFSv4 security architecture.  While their role in providing a\n   more
    flexible approach to file access authorization than is made\n   available by the
    POSIX-derived authorization-related attributes, the\n   potential provision of
    other security-related functionality is\n   covered as well.\n\n   While the goals
    of the description are similar to that used in\n   previous specficaion, the approach
    taken is substantally different,\n   in that a core set of functionality, derived
    form the the now-\n   withdrawn POSIX draft ACLs is the conceptual base of the
    feature set\n   while extensions to that functionality are made available as OPTIONAL\n
    \  extensions to that core.\n\n   The current version of the document is intended,
    in large part, to\n   result in working group discussion regarding existing NFSv4
    security\n   issues and to provide a framework for addressing these issues and\n
    \  obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary changes.\n\n   When the
    resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it\n   will supersede the
    descriptions of ACL structure and semantics\n   appearing in existing minor version
    specification documents such as\n   RFCs 7530 and 8881, thereby updating RFC7530
    and RFC8881.\n\n\t "

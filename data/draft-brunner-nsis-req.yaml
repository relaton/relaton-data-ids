  content: "This draft proposes a set of requirements for signaling QoS across\ndifferent
    network environments. To achieve wide applicability of the\nrequirements, the
    starting point is a diverse set of user scenarios\nconcerning both access and
    core networks, application interactions,\nand use within cellular networks.  We
    also provide an outline\nstructure for the problem, including QoS related terminology.\n\t "

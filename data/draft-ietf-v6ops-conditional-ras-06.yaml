  content: "   This document discusses the most common scenarios of connecting an\n
    \  enterprise network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned\n   by
    an ISP and how the approach proposed in the \"ietf-rtgwg-\n   enterprise-pa-multihoming\"
    draft could be applied in those scenarios.\n   The problem of enterprise multihoming
    without address translation of\n   any form has not been solved yet as it requires
    both the network to\n   select the correct egress ISP based on the packet source
    address and\n   hosts to select the correct source address based on the desired\n
    \  egress ISP for that traffic.  The \"ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-\n   multihoming\"
    document proposes a solution to this problem by\n   introducing a new routing
    functionality (Source Address Dependent\n   Routing) to solve the uplink selection
    issue and using Router\n   Advertisements to influence the host source address
    selection.  While\n   the above-mentioned document focuses on solving the general
    problem\n   and on covering various complex use cases, this document adopts the\n
    \  approach proposed in the \"ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming\" draft\n   to
    provide a solution for a limited number of common use cases.  In\n   particular,
    the focus is on scenarios where an enterprise network has\n   two Internet uplinks
    used either in primary/backup mode or\n   simultaneously and hosts in that network
    might not yet properly\n   support multihoming as described in RFC8028.\n\n\t "

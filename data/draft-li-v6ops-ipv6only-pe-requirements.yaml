  content: "   This document specifies the basic requirements for multi-domain\n   IPv6-only
    Provider Edge (PE) routers.  The requirements cover several\n   key aspects: support
    for fundamental IPv6 protocols, such as, MP-BGP\n   and ICMPv6, implementation
    of 4map6 based MP-BGP extensions,\n   stateless encapsulation and translation
    functions using IPv6 mapping\n   prefixes as well as support for SRv6 and NAT64
    functionalities.  By\n   defining these requirements, this document aims to facilitate
    the\n   development, deployment and interoperability of such PE routers,\n   thereby
    promoting the smooth establishment and operation of multi-\n   domain IPv6-only
    Networks.\n\n\t "

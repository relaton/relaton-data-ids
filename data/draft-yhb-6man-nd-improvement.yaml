  content: "This document describes the improvement to neighbor discovery. When\n
    \  an IPv6 address is deleted on a node, the node will send a neighbor \n   advertisement
    with a \"Deleted\" flag set to all link-local nodes.\n   If the IPv6 address has
    been configured on another node, and it is\n   in duplicate state, it will perform
    DAD(Duplicate Address Detection)\n   again. If DAD succeeds, the IPv6 address
    will be assigned to the  \n   node.\n   If the IPv6 address exists in the neighbor
    cache on the other nodes,\n   when the neighbor advertisement with deleted flag
    set arrived, they \n   know the neighbor is unreachable and delete the neighbor
    cache entry.\n\n\t "

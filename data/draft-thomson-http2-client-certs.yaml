  content: "   Some HTTP servers provide a subset of resources that require\n   additional
    authentication to interact with.  HTTP/1.1 servers rely on\n   TLS renegotiation
    that is triggered by a request to a protected\n   resource.  HTTP/2 made this
    pattern impossible by forbidding the use\n   of TLS renegotiation.  While TLS
    1.3 provides an alternate mechanism\n   to obtain client certificates, this mechanism
    does not map well to\n   usage in TLS 1.2.\n\n   This document describes a how
    client authentication might be\n   requested by a server as a result of receiving
    a request to a\n   protected resource.\n\n\t "

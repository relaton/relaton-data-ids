  content: "   Recently, a number of problems related to RTP scalability to large\n
    \  multicast groups have been identified. The main problem, congestion\n   of
    RTCP packets due to near-simultaneous joins, has been resolved in\n   previous
    work. In this document, we present some additional problems\n   and describe the
    solutions. In particular, we discuss the problem of\n   BYE floods and premature
    timeouts. To resolve the BYE flood problem,\n   we propose a BYE reconsideration
    mechanism. To help alleviate prema-\n   ture timeouts, we propose a reverse timer
    reconsideration algorithm.\n   Both algorithms are simple, and require minimal
    state and computa-\n   tion.\n\n\t "

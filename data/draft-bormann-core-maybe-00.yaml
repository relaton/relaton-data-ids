  content: "   Many media types may be used in situations where it may beneficial
    to\n   indicate that the object represented in this media type is not yet\n   (or
    no longer) present.\n\n   The Observe option introduced in Observing Resources
    in the\n   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) (RFC7641) requires sequences\n
    \  of responses (notifications) to carry the same Content-Format.\n\n   The application/maybe
    media type provides a way to use a single media\n   type (and thus Content-Format)
    to express presence or absence of\n   information in a specific media type.\n\n\t "

  content: "   GMPLS provides general connection control functionality supporting
    \n   different network technologies. This memo specifies a further \n   generalization
    to support bidirectional LSPs with asymmetric \n   requirements. The extension
    improves the flexibility of bidirectional \n   LSP establishment and at the same
    time simplifies the control and \n   management of asymmetric services.  \n\n\t "

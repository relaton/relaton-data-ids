  content: "   The document details use cases to mitigate DDoS attacks.  These use\n
    \  cases are expected to illustrates involved communications to detect\n   and
    mitigate DDoS attacks.  It is expected that these communications\n   will be in
    the future handled by the DDoS Open Threat Signaling\n   (DOTS).  These scenarios
    are intended to be useful to derive\n   requirements for the design of DDoS Open
    threat Signaling.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Internet is currently being confronted with service demands from a
    new generation of applications.  Supporting these applications effectively and
    efficiently will require extending the current Internet 'best-effort' service
    model to one that offers an integrated suite of services.  The purpose of this
    memo is to describe a proposed 'core' service model for an integrated services
    Internet.  In the Appendix we discuss the process by which such a service model
    could be standardized by the IETF.\n\t "

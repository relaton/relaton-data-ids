- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "RFC 2482, \"Language Tagging in Unicode Plain Text\", describes a mechanism
    for using special Unicode language tag characters to identify languages when needed
    without more general markup such as that provided by XML.  The Unicode Consortium
    has deprecated that facility and strongly recommends against its use.  RFC 2482
    has been moved to Historic status to reduce the possibility that Internet implementers
    would consider that system an appropriate mechanism for identifying languages.
    \ This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.\n\t "

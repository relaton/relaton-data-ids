abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the reservation of the IPv6 address block 44::/16
    for use by the global amateur radio community. The allocation would serve as the
    IPv6 successor to the legacy IPv4 network 44.0.0.0/8, historically known as AMPRNet
    or 44Net, which has provided a unified, non-commercial address space for amateur
    radio digital communications for more than four decades. The goal of this proposal
    is to maintain global cohesion and routing consistency for amateur radio networks
    as they transition to IPv6, while preserving the service's unique social and regulatory
    context. Amateur networks operate under national licensing frameworks and are
    limited to educational, experimental, and public-service purposes, distinguishing
    them from commercial Internet use. The proposed prefix would remain part of the
    global unicast routing table, enabling interoperability, research, and gateway
    connectivity between amateur systems and the wider Internet. This document outlines
    the historical rationale for an amateur radio IPv6 allocation, describes the technical
    and governance considerations for maintaining a contiguous and hierarchically
    managed address space, and specifies the IANA action required to reserve 44::/16
    as a special-purpose global IPv6 prefix for amateur radio use.</p>"

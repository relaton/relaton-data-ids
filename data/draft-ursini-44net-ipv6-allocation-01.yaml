  content: "   This document proposes the reservation of the IPv6 address block\n
    \  44::/16 for use by the global amateur radio community.  The\n   allocation
    would serve as the IPv6 successor to the legacy IPv4\n   network 44.0.0.0/8, historically
    known as AMPRNet or 44Net, which has\n   provided a unified, non-commercial address
    space for amateur radio\n   digital communications for more than four decades.\n\n
    \  The goal of this proposal is to maintain global cohesion and routing\n   consistency
    for amateur radio networks as they transition to IPv6,\n   while preserving the
    service's unique social and regulatory context.\n   Amateur networks operate under
    national licensing frameworks and are\n   limited to educational, experimental,
    and public-service purposes,\n   distinguishing them from commercial Internet
    use.  The proposed\n   prefix would remain part of the global unicast routing
    table,\n   enabling interoperability, research, and gateway connectivity between\n
    \  amateur systems and the wider Internet.\n\n   This document outlines the historical
    rationale for an amateur radio\n   IPv6 allocation, describes the technical and
    governance\n   considerations for maintaining a contiguous and hierarchically\n
    \  managed address space, and specifies the IANA action required to\n   reserve
    44::/16 as a special-purpose global IPv6 prefix for amateur\n   radio use.\n\n\t "

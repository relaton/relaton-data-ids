  content: "The IEEE 802.1X protocol provides authenticated layer 2 network\naccess.
    \ As part of the authentication for 802.1X, a device such as a\nswitch or a wireless
    LAN access point can receive credentials from\nthe authentication authority identifying
    the user of a device\nrequesting access.  These credentials can then be used by
    a DHCP\nserver in the selection of an IP address for assignment to the device\nthrough
    its DHCP client.  The 802.1X Credentials sub-option allows an\naccess device that
    implements 802.1X and that can create DHCP Relay\nAgent options to pass along
    credentials for the user of a device\nreceived during 802.1X authentication to
    a DHCP server.\n\n\t "

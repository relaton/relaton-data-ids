abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] is based on HTTP/1.x, designed for
    the simple, sequential request-reply use case, in which an ALTO client requests
    a sequence of information resources, and the server sends the complete content
    of each information resource to the client one by one. To support the use case
    that an ALTO client can monitor multiple resources at the same time and the ALTO
    server sends only their updates, the ALTO Working Group introduced ALTO/SSE [RFC8895],
    which defines a new, SSE-based multiplexing protocol on top of HTTP/1.x, to allow
    the server to concurrently, and incrementally push updates to the client whenever
    monitored network information resources change. However, newer versions of HTTP
    (e.g., HTTP/2 [RFC7540]) already support concurrent, non-blocking transport of
    multiple streams in the same HTTP connection. This document introduces the ALTO
    transport information publication service (TIPS), which allows the naming of (i.e.,
    assigning resource identifiers to) individual incremental updates to multiple
    ALTO information resources and the distribution of the naming, enabling ALTO to
    take advantage of newer HTTP versions. In particular, it gives an ALTO client
    the new capability to explicitly request (pull) a specific incremental update.
    It also provides an ALTO server the new capability to push a specific incremental
    update using native HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 server push. This document defines TIPS as
    a service, independent of client pull or server push. A companion document [draft-schott-alto-new-transport-push]
    defines the complete server- push ALTO transport based on ALTO TIPS.</p>"

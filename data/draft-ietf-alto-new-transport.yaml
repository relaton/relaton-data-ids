abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] is based on HTTP/1.x, focusing on
    the simple, sequential request-reply use case, in which an ALTO client requests
    a sequence of information resources, and the server sends the complete content
    of each information resource to the client one by one. ALTO/SSE [RFC8895] defines
    a new transport design to allow an ALTO client to request the monitoring of multiple
    resources, and the server can then continuously, concurrently, and incrementally
    push updates whenever monitored network information resources change. But ALTO/SSE
    assumes an HTTP/1.x setting, and essentially designs a new concurrent transport
    protocol on top of a sequential HTTP/1.x connection, but newer versions of HTTP
    (e.g., HTTP/2 [RFC7540]) already support concurrent, non-blocking transport of
    multiple streams in the same HTTP connection. This document introduces the ALTO
    transport information publication service (TIPS), which allows the naming of individual
    incremental updates to multiple ALTO information resources and the distribution
    of the naming, enabling ALTO to take advantage of newer HTTP versions. In particular,
    it gives an ALTO client the new capability to explicitly request (pull) a specific
    incremental update. It also provides an ALTO server the new capability to push
    a specific incremental update using native HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 server push. This
    document defines TIPS as a service, independent of client pull or server push.
    A companion document [draft-schott-alto-new-transport-push] defines server-push
    ALTO transport based on ALTO TIPS.</p>"

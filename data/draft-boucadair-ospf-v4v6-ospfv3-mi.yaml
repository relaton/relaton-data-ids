  content: "This memo defines two new Instance Identifiers (Instance IDs) in\nOSPFv3
    [RFC2740]).  These new Instance IDs [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt] are\nmeant to instantiate
    distinct OSPFv3 instances to convey routing\ninformation which is specific to
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 address Address\nFamily [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].  The
    goal of running\nseparate instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 is to distinguish the
    native\nIPv6 routing topology from the IPv4 routing topology.  Separate\ninstances
    are also meant to prevent any overload of the native IPv6\nrouting tables by IPv4-mapped
    IPv6 routes.  This isolation is\nmotivated also from an operational perspective
    to enforce specific\nrouting policies for each topology.\n\t "

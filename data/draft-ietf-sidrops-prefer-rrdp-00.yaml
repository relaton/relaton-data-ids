  content: "   This document formulates a plan of a phased transition to a state\n
    \  where RPKI repositories and Relying Party software performing RPKI\n   Validation
    will use the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)\n   [RFC8182] as the only mandatory
    to implement access protocol.\n\n   The first objective is to make RRDP the preferred
    access protocol,\n   and require rsync as a fallback option only.  This will greatly\n
    \  reduce the operational burden and concerns for RPKI repository\n   operators.\n\n
    \  In phase 0, today's deployment, RRDP is supported by most, but not\n   all
    Repositories, and most but not all RP software.\n\n   In the proposed phase 1
    RRDP will become mandatory to implement for\n   Repositories, in addition to rsync.
    \ This phase can start as soon as\n   this document is published.\n\n   Once the
    proposed updates are implemented by all Repositories phase 2\n   will start.  In
    this phase RRDP will become mandatory to implement\n   for all RP software, and
    rsync will be required as a fallback option\n   only.\n\n   It should be noted
    that although this document currently includes\n   descriptions and updates to
    RFCs for each of these phases, we may\n   find that it will be beneficial to have
    one or more separate\n   documents for these phases, so that it might be more
    clear to all\n   when the updates to RFCs take effect.\n\n   Furthermore, this
    document currently includes an early discussion of\n   a future objective, which
    would be to change the RPKI standards such\n   that names in RPKI objects are
    no longer tightly coupled to rsync.\n   By using transport independent names and
    validation, we will obtain\n   the agility needed to phase out rsync altogether
    and/or introduce\n   other future access protocols.\n\n\t "

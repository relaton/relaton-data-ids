  content: "   The proposal specifies a means for NTP instances that can establish
    a\n   TCP connection between themselves to create secure ephemeral keys.\n   With
    the known weaknesses of the public-key security protocol,\n   Autokey, which is
    defined by RFC 5906 [RFC5906], a replacement for\n   Autokey that supports at
    least Client/Server and Symmetric modes must\n   be provided.\n\n\t "

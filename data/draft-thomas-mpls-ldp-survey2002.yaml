  content: "   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for forwarding\n   packets
    that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets,\n   called labels, to
    determine packet nexthops [RFC3031]).  A\n   fundamental concept in MPLS is that
    two Label Switching Routers\n   (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels
    used to forward\n   traffic between and through them.  This common understanding
    is\n   achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution\n   protocol,
    by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has\n   made.  One such
    protocol called LDP [RFC3036] is used by LSRs to\n   distribute labels to support
    MPLS forwarding along normally routed\n   paths.  This document reports on a survey
    of LDP implementations\n   conducted in August 2002 as part of the process of
    advancing LDP from\n   proposed to draft standard.\n\t "

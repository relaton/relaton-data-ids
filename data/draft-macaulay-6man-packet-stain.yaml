  content: "   This document specifies the application of security staining on an\n
    \  IPv6 datagrams and the minimum requirements for IPv6 nodes staining\n   flows,
    IPv6 nodes forwarding stained packets within a given domain of\n   control, and
    nodes interpreting stains on flows.\n\n   The usage of the packet staining destination
    option enables proactive\n   delivery of security intelligence to IPv6 nodes such
    as firewalls and\n   intrusion prevention systems, and end-points such servers,\n
    \  workstations, mobile and smart devices and an infinite array of as-\n   yet-to-be-invented
    sensors and controllers.\n\n   The usage of packet staining is not intended for
    use across the open\n   internet, where fragmentation issues associated with increased
    header\n   size may induce service degradation; packet staining is intended as
    a\n   security adjunct within a given doamin of control such as an carrier\n   or
    enterprise network.\n\n\t "

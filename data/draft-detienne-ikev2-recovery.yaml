- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) suffers from the\nlimitation
    of not having a means to quickly recover from a stale\nstate known as dangling
    Security Associations (SA's) where one side\nhas SA's that the corresponding party
    does not have anymore.\n\nThis Draft proposes to address the limitation by offering
    an\nimmediate, DoS-free recovery mechanism for IKE that can be used in\nall failover
    or post-crash situations.\n\t "

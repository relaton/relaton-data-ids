abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines statistics reports that provide
    periodic snapshots of various BGP-related metrics. When statistics are reported
    periodically, the snapshot values may not reflect the variations that occurred
    between reporting intervals. This document defines a Statistics Information TLV
    that can be used to convey additional statistical information about BMP gauge-type
    statistics during the reporting period. This TLV reports the minimum and maximum
    values observed (with timestamps indicating when they occurred), along with additional
    statistical measures such as average, median, or snapshot values. This enables
    BMP collectors to better understand the dynamics of monitored statistics even
    when the reported snapshot values appear constant.</p>"

  content: "   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines statistics reports that\n
    \  provide periodic snapshots of various BGP-related metrics.  When\n   statistics
    are reported periodically, the snapshot values may not\n   reflect the variations
    that occurred between reporting intervals.\n   This document defines a Statistics
    Information TLV that can be used\n   to convey additional statistical information
    about BMP gauge-type\n   statistics during the reporting period.  This TLV reports
    the minimum\n   and maximum values observed (with timestamps indicating when they\n
    \  occurred), along with additional statistical measures such as\n   average,
    median, or snapshot values.  This enables BMP collectors to\n   better understand
    the dynamics of monitored statistics even when the\n   reported snapshot values
    appear constant.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a standard profile for Bogon Origin\nAttestations
    (BOAs).  A BOA is a digitally signed object that\nprovides a means of verifying
    that an IP address block holder has not\nauthorized any Autonomous System (AS)
    to originate routes that are\nequivalent to any of the addresses listed in the
    BOA, and also\nprovides a means of verifying that BGP speaker is not using an
    AS as\na BGP speaker without appropriate authority to use that AS.  The\nproposed
    application of BOAs is intended to fit within the\nrequirements for adding security
    measures to inter-domain routing,\nincluding the ability to support incremental
    and piecemeal deployment\nof such measures, and does not require any changes to
    the\nspecification of BGP.\n\t "

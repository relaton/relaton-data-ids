  content: "   This document describes the Secure Object Delivery Protocol (SODP).\n
    \  SODP enables clients to obtain secured packages from a Secure Object\n   Management
    System (SOMS).  Packages supported by a SOMS server\n   include but are not limited
    to: firmware packages [RFC4108], trust\n   anchor (TA) packages [RFC5934], symmetric
    key packages [RFC6031],\n   asymmetric key packages [RFC5958], encrypted key packages
    [RFC6031],\n   public key certificate enrollment packages [RFC5272], public key\n
    \  certificates [RFC5280], and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)\n   [RFC5280].
    \ Client access is ideally direct and web-based, but access\n   via agents acting
    on behalf of clients is supported.\n\n\n\t "

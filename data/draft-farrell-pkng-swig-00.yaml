abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Current Internet protocols tend to be based on either X.509 based\nPKI,
    or Kerberos.  Both have limitations and age-related issues.  In\nthis draft, we
    outline a possible approach to providing similar, and\nadditional, functionality
    based on an abstract device that always\nsigns whatever its given, and that may
    additionally annotate or\nmodify its input in order to fulfill the security needs
    of other\nprotocols.  This draft describes a SWIG service and how it can be\nused
    to conduct research into a number of important problems in\nInternet trust and
    identity management today.\n\t "

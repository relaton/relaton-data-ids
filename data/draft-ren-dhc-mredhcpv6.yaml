  content: "   This memo provides multi-requirement extensions for DHCPv6, which\n
    \  allow hosts to generate or fetch addresses according to the user or\n   network
    requirements, and DHCP servers to centrally manage all types\n   of addresses
    including SLAAC-configured addresses, DHCPv6-configured\n   addresses, and manual-configured
    addresses.  Moreover, a general\n   extension for address generation is designed
    to allow multiple types\n   of requirements to be introduced into the DHCPv6 exchanges.\n\n\t "

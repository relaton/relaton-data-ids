  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each\n   consisting
    of one or more segment lists and the associated\n   information.  The header of
    a packet steered in an SR Policy is\n   augmented with an ordered list of segments
    associated with that SR\n   Policy.  In scenarios where multiple Virtual Transport
    Networks\n   (VTNs) exist in the network, the VTN in which the SR policy is\n
    \  instantiated may also need to be specified, so that the header of the\n   packet
    can also be augmented with the information associated with the\n   VTN.  An SR
    Policy candidate path can be distributed using BGP SR\n   Policy.  This document
    defines extensions to BGP SR policy to specify\n   the VTN associated with the
    SR policy.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to a licensed,\n
    \  primary use but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and\n   times
    are defined as \"white space\".  White space devices can make use\n   of this
    spectrum; however, they must first determine which spectrum\n   is unused or unoccupied
    by a primary user at their current location.\n   A white space database can be
    consulted that holds information about\n   primary users of the spectrum and that
    returns information about\n   white space.  In this document we introduce a Protocol
    for Access to\n   WhiteSpace database (PAWS) which is for use between a white
    space\n   device and a white space database.  We give a framework for PAWS, a\n
    \  protocol stack that defines the interface between the white space\n   device
    and the white space database, the parameters of the protocol,\n   an XML schema
    that can encode the parameters, and example messages.\n   The realization of the
    database and the calculation of protected\n   contour are not considered in this
    framework draft.\n\n\t "

  content: "   OSPF [Ref1] is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used for\n
    \  routing in IP networks. Though the definition of the ABR in the\n   current
    OSPF specification does not require a router with multiple\n   attached areas
    to have a backbone connection, it is actually\n   necessary to provide successful
    routing to the inter-area and\n   external destinations. If this requirement is
    not met all traffic,\n   destined for the areas not connected to such ab ABR or
    out of the\n   OSPF domain, is dropped. The rules of originating and processing\n
    \  Summary-LSAs given in the current OSPF standard [Ref1] can also\n   result
    in suboptimal inter-area routing. Though all these problems\n   can be fixed using
    virtual links, this memo describes an alternative\n   implementation of the OSPF
    ABR behavior, which allows the\n   administrator to avoid it or, if virtual links
    are still used, to\n   decrease the number of configured virtual links.\n \n   This
    memo also describes possible situations where the proposed\n   implementation
    can be used.\n\n\t "

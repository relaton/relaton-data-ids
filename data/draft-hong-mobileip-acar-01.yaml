  content: "This document proposes Access Router (AR) based movement detection \nand
    Care-of Address (CoA) configuration for fast handover in Mobile \nIPv6. An Active
    Access Router (AcAR) which will serve a Mobile Node \n(MN) performs movement detection,
    formulates a new CoA of the MN and \ndoes Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) on
    behalf of the MN. After \nconfirming the uniqueness of the new CoA, the AcAR sends
    it through a \nRA message. Since an AcAR can quickly determine the L3 movement
    by \nthe comparison between neighbor caches and L2 information of a MN, a \nMN
    does not have to wait to receive RA messages from ARs. Thus, the \nmovement detection
    delay is reduced. Since DAD is performed by an \nAcAR in advance, a MN does not
    have to do normal DAD and it can use \nthe new CoA for its interface directly.\n\t "

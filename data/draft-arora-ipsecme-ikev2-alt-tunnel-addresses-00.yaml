abstract:
- content: "<p>IKEv2 is a protocol for setting up Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels
    from a remote location to a gateway so that the VPN client can access services
    in the network behind the gateway. Currently the IKE SAs and tunnel mode Ipsec
    SA's are created implicitly between the IP addresses that are used when the IKE_SA
    is established. These IP addresses are then used as the outer (tunnel header)
    addresses for tunnel mode IPSEC packets (transport mode IPsec SAs are beyond the
    scope of this document). This document defines an IKEv2 extension that allows
    the outer tunnel header addresses for the tunnel mode IPSEC packets to be different
    than the IKE peer IP addresses.</p>"

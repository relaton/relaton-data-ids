  content: "   Internet privacy has become a major concern over the past few years.\n
    \  Users are becoming more aware that their online activity leaves a\n   vast
    digital footprint, that communications are not always properly\n   secured, and
    that their location and actions can be easily tracked.\n   One of the main factors
    for the location tracking issue is the wide\n   use of long-lasting identifiers,
    such as MAC addresses.\n\n   There have been several initiatives at the IETF and
    the IEEE 802\n   standards committees to overcome some of these privacy issues.
    \ This\n   document provides an overview of these activities, with the intention\n
    \  to inform the technical community about them, and help coordinate\n   between
    present and future standardization activities.\n\n\t "

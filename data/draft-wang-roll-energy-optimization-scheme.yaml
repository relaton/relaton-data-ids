  content: "   Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are composed of devices that\n
    \  have constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery\n   power).
    It is obvious that conserving energy is especially important\n   in the LLNs.
    This document is aimed at proposing an efficient and\n   effective scheme to optimize
    the energy in the process of seeking\n   the DAG root node.\n\n\t "

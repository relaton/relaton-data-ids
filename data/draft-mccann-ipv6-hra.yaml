  content: "This document describes a mechanism that can be used by IPv6 hosts to
    communicate information about their address configuration to neighboring routers.
    \ In particular, this mechanism is intended to allow multihomed hosts and hosts
    with anycast addresses to communicate this information to their neighboring routers.
    \ This document defines a new ICMPv6 informational message type, a 'Host Reachability
    Advertisement' to carry this information.  It also defines a second ICMPv6 message,
    a 'Host Reachability Solicitation', that can be used to trigger Host Reachability
    Advertisements.\n\t "

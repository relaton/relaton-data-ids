  content: "   One of the biggest challenges faced by GMPLS technology is “how it
    \n   can be deployed” in a manner least impacting to existing IP/ MPLS \n   networks.
    GMPLS architecture document lists [RFC3945] three different \n   scenarios in
    which GMPLS technology can be deployed: overlay, \n   augmented and integrated.
    Reference [GMPLS-mig] addresses the problem \n   of migration from MPLS to GMPLS
    networks using the integrated model. \n   This draft addresses the same problem
    space for augmented model and \n   illustrates the applicability of augmented
    model in deploying GMPLS \n   technology in existing IP/ MPLS networks.  \n\t "

  content: "The statistical properties of packet delays for transmission across the\nInternet
    are investigated, based on analysis of three datasets obtained\nusing CQOS cNodes,
    each measured over several days of continuous transmission.Two of these sets comprise
    high and low bandwidth measurement data for vectors (defined here as a cNode to
    cNode link) from CQOS headquarters to the Irvine Data Center, while the third
    is a low-bandwidth dataset obtained from a CQOS-Irvine  to London vector.\n\t "

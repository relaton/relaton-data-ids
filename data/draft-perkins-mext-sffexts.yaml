  content: "A mobile node with multiple radio interfaces running in single-radio\n
    \  mode will typically need IP address continuity as it migrates from\n   one
    4G wireless network to another; Mobile IPv6 is very well suited\n   for that purpose.
    \ For such mobile nodes using Mobile IP, mobility\n   management by the home agent
    can be extended to provide necessary\n   information about the Signal Forwarding
    Functions (SFFs) that have\n   been defined for WiMAX and for eHRPD/CDMA networks.
    \ In this\n   document, we explain the operations required to support single-radio\n
    \  mobile nodes and specify new extensions to Mobile IPv6 Binding Update\n   and
    Binding Acknowledgement for supporting ease of access between\n   mobile nodes
    and SFFs.\n\n\t "

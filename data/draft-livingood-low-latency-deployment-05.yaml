  content: "   The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized\n   experimental
    RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput\n   (L4S) and new Non-Queue-Building
    (NQB) per hop behavior.  These\n   documents do a good job of describing a new
    architecture and protocol\n   for deploying low latency networking.  But as is
    normal for many such\n   standards, especially those in experimental status, certain\n
    \  deployment decisions are ultimately left to implementers.  This\n   document
    explores the potential implications of key deployment\n   decisions and makes
    recommendations for those decisions that may help\n   drive adoption.\n\n\t "

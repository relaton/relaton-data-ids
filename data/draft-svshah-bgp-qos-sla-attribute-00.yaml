  script: Latn
  content: "   Out-of-band manual learning of SLA details and provisioning them in\n
    \  general can be complex work for network administrators.  For example,\n   Enterprise
    network administrators not only have to know what is their\n   SLA, for voice,
    video etc application traffic, with their Provider,\n   but they also require
    translating application groups to Classifier\n   groups as per provider's definition
    as well translate SLA to vendor\n   specific provisioning language.  An in-band
    method of QoS signaling\n   can help to simplify some of the complexities.  An
    optional\n   transitive BGP attribute proposed in this document intends to signal\n
    \  SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as\n   Autonomous
    Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up some of the\n   complex tasks.\n\n   Though
    the use-case with the proposed attribute is explicitly defined\n   in this document,
    purpose of this attribute is not limited to this\n   use-case only.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The proliferation of AI agents requires robust mechanisms for secure\n
    \  discovery.  This document introduces the Agent Name Service (ANS), a\n   novel
    architecture based on DNS addressing the lack of a public agent\n   discovery
    framework.  ANS provides a protocol-agnostic registry\n   mechanism that leverages
    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates\n   for verifiable agent identity
    and trust.  The architecture features\n   several key innovations: a formalized
    agent registration and renewal\n   mechanism for lifecycle management; DNS-inspired
    naming conventions\n   with capability-aware resolution; a modular Protocol Adapter
    Layer\n   supporting diverse communication standards (A2A, MCP, ACP, etc.); and\n
    \  precisely defined algorithms for secure resolution.  This\n   specification
    describes structured communication using JSON Schema\n   and includes a comprehensive
    threat analysis.  The result is a\n   foundational agent directory service protocol
    addressing the core\n   challenges of secure discovery and interaction in multi-agent\n
    \  systems, paving the way for future interoperable, trustworthy, and\n   scalable
    agent ecosystems.\n\n\t "

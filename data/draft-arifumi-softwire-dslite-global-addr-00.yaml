  content: "When an ISP tries to deploy IPv6 and take an action for IPv4 address\ndepletion,
    DS-Lite is reasonable approach for solving both of the\nproblems.  However, it
    is troublesome for an ISP to have the existing\nIPv4 service facilities and DS-Lite
    facilities at the same time for\nnot a short period of time.  This document proposes
    a mechanism to\nassign an IPv4 global address in DS-Lite framework, which makes
    every\ncustomer to move to DS-Lite based network, and enables an ISP to\nmaintain
    single facility of the service network.\n\t "

  content: "IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover other
    \nnodes on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, to\nfind
    routers and to maintain reachability information about the paths \nto active neighbors.
    The original ND specifications called for the\nuse of IPsec for protecting the
    ND messages. However, in this\nparticular application the use of IPsec may not
    always be feasible,\nmainly due to difficulties in key management. If not secured,
    ND\nprotocol is vulnerable to various attacks. This document specifies a \nightweight
    security solution for ND that does not rely on pre-\nconfiguration or trusted
    third parties. The presented solution uses \nCryptographically Generated Addresses.

  content: "This note describes two RTP payload formats for in-band telephony\nsignal
    events (TSE) such as DTMF, dial-tone, ring-tone, off-hook, SIT, etc.\nOne payload
    is designed to carry a named signal, and the other is designed\ncarry a compact
    representation of actual audio waveform cadence to be played.\nThe two formats
    are independent, but they can be used together very usefully\nwithin redundant
    audio payloads; this enables highly efficient and robust\ntransport of telephony
    network signal events along with a representation of\nthe actual audio media associated
    to the signal events.\n \n \nAcknowledgements: This internet draft is an extension
    of H. Schulzrinne's\ndraft ietf-avt-dtmf-00.txt and borrows heavily from it (including
    copying\nactual text). The main extensions appearing in this draft are as follows:\n
    \na) many other telephony call progress tones and signal events have been\nadded
    to the original DTMF and flash-hook of ietf-avt-dtmf-00.txt (an\nattempt has been
    made to align this with [MGCP] and [E.180 supp2]\nb) a second payload is defined
    which carries a highly compact\nfrequency representation of the audio waveform
    of the signal;\nc) a few clarifications about reliability and redundancy, including
    how\nthe two payloads will work together.\n \nAcknowledgement is also due to [MGCP];
    part of this draft is an attempt\nto use RTP to provide the signal transport required
    by MGCP, in a way\nwhich can be reused by a large class of applications.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight Location-tracking Tags are in wide use to allow users to
    locate items. These Tags function as a component of a Crowdsourced Network in
    which Devices belonging to other network users (e.g., phones) report which Tags
    they see and their location, thus allowing the Owner(s) of the Tag to determine
    where their Tag was most recently seen. While there are many legitimate uses of
    these Tags, they are also susceptible to misuse for the purpose of stalking and
    abuse. A protocol that allows others to detect Unwanted Tracking must incorporate
    an understanding of the Unwanted Tracking landscape today. This document provides
    a threat analysis for this purpose, including a taxonomy of Unwanted Tracking
    and potential attacks against Detection of Unwanted Location Tracking (DULT) protocols.
    The document defines what is in and out of scope for the Unwanted Tracking protocols,
    and provides design requirements, constraints, and considerations for implementation
    of protocols to detect Unwanted Tracking.</p>"

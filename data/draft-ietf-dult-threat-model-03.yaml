  content: "   Lightweight Location-tracking Tags are in wide use to allow users to\n
    \  locate items.  These Tags function as a component of a Crowdsourced\n   Network
    in which Devices belonging to other network users (e.g.,\n   phones) report which
    Tags they see and their location, thus allowing\n   the Owner(s) of the Tag to
    determine where their Tag was most\n   recently seen.  While there are many legitimate
    uses of these Tags,\n   they are also susceptible to misuse for the purpose of
    stalking and\n   abuse.  A protocol that allows others to detect Unwanted Tracking\n
    \  must incorporate an understanding of the Unwanted Tracking landscape\n   today.
    \ This document provides a threat analysis for this purpose,\n   including a taxonomy
    of Unwanted Tracking and potential attacks\n   against Detection of Unwanted Location
    Tracking (DULT) protocols.\n   The document defines what is in and out of scope
    for the Unwanted\n   Tracking protocols, and provides design requirements, constraints,\n
    \  and considerations for implementation of protocols to detect Unwanted\n   Tracking.\n\n\t "

  content: "This note defines the Compressed X.509 Format (CXF), a compact format\nfor
    X.509 certificates and CRLs, and a way to translate between the\ncompact format
    and standard X.509 encoding.  The translation consists\nof the lossless compression
    algorithm DEFLATE with a particular\npredefined dictionary.  Protocol bindings
    for TLS and IKE are\ndesignated.\n\nThis format is useful in a constrained environment,
    where bandwidth\nand/or storage is low, and it preserves interoperability with\nstandards-compliant
    X.509 certificates and the systems for\ncertificate processing, issuance, and
    management.\n\t "

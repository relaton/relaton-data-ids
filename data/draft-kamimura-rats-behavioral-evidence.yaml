abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an informational discussion of the conceptual
    relationship between remote attestation, as defined by the RATS (Remote ATtestation
    ProcedureS) Working Group, and behavioral evidence recording mechanisms. It observes
    that attestation and behavioral evidence recording address fundamentally different
    verification questions and can serve as complementary layers in comprehensive
    system accountability frameworks. This document is purely descriptive and does
    not propose any modifications to RATS architecture, define new attestation mechanisms,
    or establish normative requirements.</p>"

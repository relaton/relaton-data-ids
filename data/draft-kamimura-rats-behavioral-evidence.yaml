- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document provides an informational discussion of the conceptual\n
    \  relationship between remote attestation, as defined in RFC 9334 (RATS\n   Architecture),
    and behavioral evidence recording mechanisms.  It\n   observes that these two
    verification capabilities address\n   fundamentally different questions - attestation
    addresses \"Is this\n   system in a trustworthy state?\" while behavioral evidence
    addresses\n   \"What did the system actually do?\" - and discusses how they could\n
    \  conceptually complement each other in accountability frameworks.\n   This document
    is purely descriptive: it does not propose any\n   modifications to RATS architecture,
    define new mechanisms or\n   protocols, or establish normative requirements.  It
    explicitly does\n   not define any cryptographic binding between attestation and\n
    \  behavioral evidence.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: '<p>This document provides an informational discussion of the conceptual
    relationship between remote attestation, as defined in RFC 9334 (RATS Architecture),
    and behavioral evidence recording mechanisms. It observes that these two verification
    capabilities address fundamentally different questions - attestation addresses
    "Is this system in a trustworthy state?" while behavioral evidence addresses "What
    did the system actually do?" - and discusses how they could conceptually complement
    each other in accountability frameworks. This document is purely descriptive:
    it does not propose any modifications to RATS architecture, define new mechanisms
    or protocols, or establish normative requirements. It explicitly does not define
    any cryptographic binding between attestation and behavioral evidence.</p>'

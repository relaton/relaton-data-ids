  content: "   This document explains the need for network instrumentation that\n
    \  allows to assess a number of sustainability-related attributes such\n   as
    power consumption, energy efficiency, and carbon footprint\n   associated with
    a network, its equipment, and the services that are\n   provided over it.  It
    also suggests a set of related metrics that,\n   when provided visibility into,
    can help to optimize a network's\n   \"greenness\" accordingly.\n\n\t "

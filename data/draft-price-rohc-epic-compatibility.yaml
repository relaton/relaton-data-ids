  content: "The Efficient Protocol Independent Compression [EPIC] scheme is a \ngeneral
    mechanism for providing additional profiles for use within \nthe [ROHC8] framework.
    The EPIC inputset is a list of fields from \nthe protocol stack to be compressed,
    and for each field a choice of \nencoding techniques together with the probabilities
    that they will \nbe used. The output of EPIC is a set of optimally efficient \ncompressed
    header formats for the chosen protocol stack, and an \nautomatic mechanism for
    translating between compressed and \nuncompressed packet formats.\n\t "

  content: "   4rd-U is proposed as an effort of unifying encapsulation and double\n
    \  translation solutions for the softwire of IPv4 over IPv6 domain.\n   This attempt
    introduces new behaviors in the Internet transition\n   architecture as well as
    semantics other than that of well-known\n   Internet protocols.  This documents
    provides a commentary on the\n   semantic changes and their impacts.\n\n\t "

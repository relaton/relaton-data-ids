  content: "   JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWTs [RFC7519], are URL-safe JSON-\n
    \  based security tokens that contain a set of claims that can be signed\n   and/or
    encrypted.  JWTs are being widely used and deployed as a\n   simple security token
    format in numerous protocols and applications,\n   both in the area of digital
    identity, and in other application areas.\n   The goal of this Best Current Practices
    document is to provide\n   actionable guidance leading to secure implementation
    and deployment\n   of JWTs.\n\n\t "

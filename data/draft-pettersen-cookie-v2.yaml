  content: "This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with\nHypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and responses.  It\ndescribes three HTTP headers,
    Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, which\ncarry state information between participating
    origin servers and user\nagents.  The method described here differs from both
    Netscape's\nCookie proposal [Netscape], and [RFC2965], but it can, provided some\nrequirements
    are met, interoperate with HTTP/1.1 user agents that use\nNetscape's method.  (See
    the HISTORICAL section.)\n\nThis document defines new rules for how cookies can
    be shared between\nservers within a domain.  These new rules are intended to address\nsecurity
    and privacy concerns that are difficult to counter for\nclients implementing Netscape's
    proposed rules or the rules specified\nby RFC 2965.\n\nThis document reflects
    implementation experience with RFC 2965 and\nobsoletes it.\n\t "

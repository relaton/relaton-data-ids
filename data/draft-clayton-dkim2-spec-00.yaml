  content: "   DomainKeys Identified Mail v2 (DKIM2) permits a person, role, or\n
    \  organization that owns a signing domain to document that it has\n   handled
    an email message by associating their domain with the\n   message.  This is achieved
    by applying a cryptographic signature to\n   the message.  Verification is performed
    by querying an entry within\n   the signing domain's DNS space to retrieve an
    appropriate public key.\n   As a message is transferred from author to recipient
    further\n   signatures will be added to provide a validatable \"chain\".  This\n
    \  permits validators to identify when messages have been unexpectedly\n   \"replayed\"
    and can ensure that delivery status notifications are only\n   sent to entities
    that were involved in the transmission of a message.\n\n\t "

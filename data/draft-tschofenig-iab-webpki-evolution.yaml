  content: "   The problems with the WebPKI have received the attention by the\n   Internet
    security community when DigiNotar, a Dutch certification\n   authority, had a
    security breach in 2011 and in the same year a\n   Comodo affiliate was compromised.
    \ Both cases led to fraudulent\n   issuance of certificates and raise questions
    regarding the strength\n   of the WebPKI used by so many applications.\n\n   Almost
    2 years have passed since these incidents and various\n   standardization activities
    have happened in the meanwhile offering\n   new technical solutions to make the
    public key infrastructure more\n   resilient.\n\n   The important question, however,
    is which of the technical solutions\n   will get widespread deployment?  In this
    document we compare the\n   different technical solutions in an attempt to engage
    the impacted\n   stakeholders to trigger deployment actions to improve the status
    quo.\n   This document does not include any recommendations what techniques to\n
    \  use.\n\n\t "

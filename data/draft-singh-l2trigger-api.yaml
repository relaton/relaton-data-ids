  content: "To enable seamless L3 handover of a MN from one subnet to other, the \nMN
    or the AR is required to anticipate the identity of the target AR \nprior to initiation
    of the L3 handoff.  To anticipate the identity of \ntarget AR, the L3 is required
    to receive a notification from L2 about \nthe appropriate identity of target AP
    as soon as the L2 handoff is \ndetected.  To further optimize the L3 handoff,
    L3 is also required to \nreceive indications about Link Up and Link Down events
    as soon as \nsuch events are detected by L2. The Link Down event is detected by
    L2 \nas soon as the MN loses connection with current AP. Similarly, the \nLink
    Up event is detected as soon as the MN re-connects with new AP. \nDepending upon
    the nature of access technologies, some of the various \ntriggers can be available
    at MN, AR or both. \n \n\t "

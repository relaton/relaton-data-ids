  content: "The HTML format for RFCs assigns style guidance to a Cascading Style Sheet
    (CSS) specifically defined for the RFC Series.  The embedded, default CSS as included
    by the RFC Editor is expected to take into account accessibility needs and to
    be built along a responsive design model.  This document describes the requirements
    for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor.  The class names are based on the
    classes defined in \"HTML for RFCs\" (RFC 7992).\n\t "

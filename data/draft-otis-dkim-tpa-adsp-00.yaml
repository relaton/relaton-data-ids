  content: "TPA-label is a DNS-based prefix mechanism for DKIM policy records as\na
    means to authorize Third-Party domains.  This mechanism allows\nfirst-party domains
    to autonomously authorize a range of third-party\ndomains in a scalable, individual
    DNS transaction.  This\nauthorization extends the scope of DKIM policy assertions
    to supplant\nmore difficult to administer mechanisms.  Alternatives for\nfacilitating
    third-party authorizations currently necessitate the\ncoordination between two
    or more domains by setting up selector/key\nDNS records, DNS zone delegations,
    or the regular exchange of public/\nprivate keys.\n\nChecking DKIM policies may
    occur when a From header email-address is\nnot within the domain of a valid DKIM
    signature.  When a Third-Party\nsignature is found, TPA-labels offer an efficient
    means for email\naddress domains to authorize specific third-party signing domains.\nThe
    scope of the authorization may separately assert identity\nauthentication for
    From and Sender and Resent-* headers for email-\naddresses within the authorizing
    domain.  Identity authentication can\nbe asserted by the scope of the authorization,
    even when signed by a\nThird-Party domain.  In addition, the RFC2821.MailFrom
    domain can\nauthorize domains for controlling DSNs.\n\t "

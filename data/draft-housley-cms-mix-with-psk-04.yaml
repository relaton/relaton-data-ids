  content: "   The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious\n
    \  challenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed\n   today.
    \ The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport\n   and key agreement
    algorithms that could be broken by the invention of\n   such a quantum computer.
    \ By storing communications that are\n   protected with the CMS today, someone
    could decrypt them in the\n   future when a large-scale quantum computer becomes
    available.  Once\n   quantum-secure key management algorithms are available, the
    CMS will\n   be extended to support them, if current syntax the does not\n   accommodated
    them.  In the near-term, this document describes a\n   mechanism to protect today's
    communication from the future invention\n   of a large-scale quantum computer
    by mixing the output of key\n   transport and key agreement algorithms with a
    pre-shared key.\n\n\t "

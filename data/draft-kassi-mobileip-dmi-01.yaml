  content: "This draft introduces a different mode for the mobility usage in IP networks.\nThis
    mode does not modify the Mobile IP protocol specifications [2], but makes their
    use more efficient according to the movements of the mobile node as far  as its
    communications are concerned. \nThe Mobile IP mechanisms will be used only for
    the ongoing communications while the mobile node is in motion. That is, the Mobile
    IP mechanisms will be used for the communications established from an IP sub-network
    and which continue whenever the mobile node moves to another IP sub-network. For
    all the communications that are opened and closed in the same IP sub-network there
    is no need to use Mobile IP mechanisms even if the mobile node is away from its
    home network. \n\t "

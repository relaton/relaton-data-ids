  content: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
    with the lightness and speed necessary for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia
    information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-oriented protocol which
    can be used for many tasks, such as name servers and distributed object management
    systems, through extension of its request methods (commands). A feature of HTTP
    is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built
    independently of the data being transferred.                               HTTP
    has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990.
    This specification reflects preferred usage of the protocol referred to as 'HTTP/1.0',
    and is compatible with the most commonly used HTTP server and client programs
    implemented prior to November 1994.\n\t "

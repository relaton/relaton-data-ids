abstract:
- content: "<p>Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides means for network
    applications to obtain network information. In the definitions of ALTO services
    ([RFC7285] and existing extensions), there is no requirement on whether the source
    and the destination endpoints must belong to the same autonomous network, which
    is a single-domain setting, or they can belong to different autonomous networks,
    which is a multi-domain setting. This document explains problems of realizing
    ALTO in multi-domain settings and then presents 3 potential solutions to realize
    ALTO multi-domain services.</p>"

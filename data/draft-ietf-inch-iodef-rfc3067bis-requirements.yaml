  content: "The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format is
    \nto define a common data format for describing and exchanging incident \ninformation
    between collaborating Computer Security Incident Response \nTeams (CSIRTs). The
    specific goals and requirements of the IODEF are \ndescribed in [2]. One of the
    design principles in the IODEF is \ncompatibility with the Intrusion Detection
    Message Exchange Format \n(IDMEF) [3] developed for intrusion detection systems.
    For this \nreason, IODEF is heavily based on the IDMEF and provides upward \ncompatibility
    with it.\n\t "

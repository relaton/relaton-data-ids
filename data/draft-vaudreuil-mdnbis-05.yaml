  content: "This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail user
    agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a message
    after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.  This content-type is
    intended to be machine-processable.  Additional message headers are also defined
    to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender
    of a message.  The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality
    often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary \"LAN-based\"
    systems, and often referred to as \"read receipts,\" \"acknowledgements\", or
    \"receipt notifications.\" The intention is to do this while respecting privacy
    concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed
    in the past.  Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging
    systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary \"LAN-based\" systems), the MDN protocol
    is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end,
    the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of \"foreign\" addresses,
    in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.  Additional attributes may
    also be defined to support \"tunneling\" of foreign notifications through Internet
    Mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

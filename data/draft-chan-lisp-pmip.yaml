  content: "PMIP and LISP are both network-based.  Integration of PMIP with a\nhierarchical
    design into the LISP network provides network-based\nfast-mobility support to
    enable a mobile node to perform handover in\nboth LISP and non-LISP networks,
    and non-optimal PMIP routes in the\nLISP network are avoided.\n\t "

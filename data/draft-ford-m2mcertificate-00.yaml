  script: Latn
  content: "   The X.509 public key certificate format is overly verbose for\n   Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) constrained environments, where nodes with\n   limited memory and networks
    with limited bandwidth are not uncommon.\n   The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) certificate
    format is a pruned down and\n   encoding-optimized replacement for X.509, which
    reuses much of the\n   X.509 semantics but reduces certificate sizes by typically
    40%.  We\n   are proposing that IETF recognize the M2M format as an optional\n
    \  replacement for X.509 in Internet applications including, but not\n   limited
    to, TLS and DTLS.\n\n\t "

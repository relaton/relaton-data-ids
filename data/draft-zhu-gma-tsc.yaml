  content: "   This document specifies the GMA (Generic Multi-Access) traffic\n   splitting
    control algorithm. The receiving endpoint measures one-\n   way-delay, round-trip
    time, and delivery rate for multiple\n   connections and determines how a data
    flow is split across them.\n   When update is needed, it will send out a control
    message, aka\n   Traffic Splitting Update (TSU), to notify the transmitting\n
    \  endpoint of the new traffic splitting configuration. Compared to\n   other
    sender-based multi-path transport protocols, e.g. MPTCP,\n   MPQUIC, the GMA traffic
    splitting algorithm is receiver-based and\n   does not require per-packet feedback,
    e.g. Ack. It is designed\n   specifically to support the Generic Multi-Access
    (GMA) convergence\n   protocol as introduced in [MAMS] [GMA]. The solution has
    been\n   developed by the authors based on their experiences in multiple\n   standards
    bodies including IETF and 3GPP, is not an Internet\n   Standard and does not represent
    the consensus opinion of the IETF.\n\n\t "

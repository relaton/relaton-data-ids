  content: "   The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe a set of\n
    \  conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as\n   barriers
    to the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end-\n   to-end messaging.
    \ These include, but are not limited to, key\n   management, key discovery, and
    private key handling (including peer-\n   to-peer synchronization of private keys
    and other user data across\n   devices).\n\n   This document specifies the pEp
    KeyReset protocol that allows\n   applications to provide simple high-level functionality
    to users\n   needing to perform some of the aforementioned functions while still\n
    \  ensuring that the appropriate low-level changes in keyrings and trust\n   management
    are handled consistently, and that communication of these\n   changes to active
    partners (where necessary) happens seamlessly,\n   without explicit action on
    the part of the user.\n\n\t "

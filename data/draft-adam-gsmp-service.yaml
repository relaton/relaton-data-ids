  content: "The basic set of ATM switch services useful for streaming media such \nas
    video and audio are virtual circuit segments, virtual path \nsegments, and multicast
    segments with quality of service support. \nThese services are specified using
    the concept of traffic classes.  A \ndefinition of traffic classes different from
    that used by other bodies \nis provided here.  The present Internet Draft is based
    on the \ncorresponding set of services that are being considered by the IEEE \nP1520
    working group.\n\t "

  content: "   Network Address Translators (NATs) are widely deployed to share\n   scarce
    public IPv4 addresses among mutiple end hosts.  They overwrite\n   IP addresses
    and ports in IP packets to do so.  QUIC is a protocol on\n   top of UDP that provides
    transport-like services.  QUIC is better-\n   behaved in the presence of NATs
    than older protocols, and existing\n   UDP NATs should operate without incident
    if unmodified.  QUIC offers\n   additional features that may tempt NAT implementers
    as potential\n   optimizations.  However, in practice, leveraging these features
    will\n   lead to new connection failure modes and security vulnerabilities.\n\n\t "

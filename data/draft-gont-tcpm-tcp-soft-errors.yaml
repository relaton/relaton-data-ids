  content: "   This document discusses the problem of long delays between connection\n
    \  establishment attempts that may arise in a number of scenarios,\n   including
    that in which dual stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by\n   default are deployed
    in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments.\n   Additionaly, it describes a modification
    to TCP's reaction to soft\n   errors that has been implemented in a variety of
    TCP/IP stacks to\n   help overcome this problem.\n\t "

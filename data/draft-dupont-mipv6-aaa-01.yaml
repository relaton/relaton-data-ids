  content: "IPv6 mobility [5] has many security requirements which can be\nroughly
    divided into security of signaling with common\ncorrespondent nodes [6] and security
    between the mobile node and\nits home agent. If IPsec [1] is not so usable in
    the first case\nit remains the solution of choice in the second. Unfortunately\nIPsec
    does not allow reasonable performance in some common\nsituations. One of the main
    problems is the lack of integration\nwith a modern network access service security
    like the one provided\nby AAA [7].\n\t "

  content: "The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format\nfor
    representing presence information for a presentity.  Presentities\npublish their
    presence information, typically towards presence\nagents.  PIDF has been extended
    to provide rich presence information,\nincluding, for example, the location of
    the presentity, their\nactivities, mood, the capabilities of their user agents,
    etc.\nPresentities are willing to provide the description of available\nfiles
    at watcher's disposal.  This might be the case for photographs\ntaken with a mobile
    device, a recorded lecture audio file, etc.  This\ndocument extends the PIDF to
    provide the syntax and format for the\ndescription of files within the PIDF.\n\t "

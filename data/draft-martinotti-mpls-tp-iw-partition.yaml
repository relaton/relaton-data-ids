  content: "Purpose of this ID is to illustrate deployment scenarios between\n   network
    supporting MPLS-TP and network supporting IP/MPLS, where\n   there is a network
    partitioning relationship between them.  Main\n   interworking aspects, issues
    and open points are highlighted.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet
    Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network.\n\n\t "

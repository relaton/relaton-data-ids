  content: "   Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you roam from\n
    \  network to hot spot is the Internet equivalent of walking around with\n   a
    name tag affixed to your lapel.  The practice can significantly\n   compromise
    your privacy, and should stop.\n\n   There are several possible remedies, such
    as fixing a variety of\n   protocols or avoiding disclosing a hostname at all.
    \ This document\n   studies another possible remedy, which is to replace the static\n
    \  hostnames by frequently changing randomized values.  This idea\n   obviously
    needs more work.\n\n\t "

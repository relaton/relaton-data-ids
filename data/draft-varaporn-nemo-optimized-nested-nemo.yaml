  content: "   In nested mobile networks (NEMO), packets that are routed from/to any
    \n   nodes inside the nested NEMO have additional overheads (i.e., bi-\n   directional
    tunnels) and delays. These additional overheads and \n   delays increase respectively
    to the depth of the current location of \n   the node in nested NEMO since the
    packets have to go through all the    HAs of the MRs along the path to an endpoint.
    This draft provides a \n   solution to this problem, providing optimizations to
    the nested NEMO \n   concept thereby making it worthwhile to implement the nested
    NEMO \n   concept.  \n\n\n\t "

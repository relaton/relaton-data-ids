- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "With the current multicast address architecture and the proposed \nmulticast
    address architecture, a set of guidelines is needed for \nmulticast address allocation
    servers to use in assigning IPv6 multicast \naddresses.  The purpose of these
    rules is to reduce the possibility of \naddress collision not only at layer 3,
    but also on devices at layer 2.\n\t "

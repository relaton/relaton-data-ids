  content: "Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a Small Computer
    Systems Interface (SCSI) transport protocol designed to run on top of TCP.  The
    iSCSI session abstraction is equivalent to the classic SCSI \"I_T nexus\", which
    represents the logical relationship between an Initiator and a Target (I and T)
    required in order to communicate via the SCSI family of protocols.  The iSCSI
    session provides an ordered command delivery from the SCSI initiator to the SCSI
    target.  This document goes into the design considerations that led to the iSCSI
    session model as it is defined today, relates the SCSI command ordering features
    defined in T10 specifications to the iSCSI concepts, and finally provides guidance
    to system designers on how true command ordering solutions can be built based
    on iSCSI.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

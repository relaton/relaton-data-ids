  content: "This document details a protocol that can be used to capture and\nsample
    frames on a remote device. This protocol could be a possible\nsolution for the
    'Report format and report stream format document'\nmilestone of the PSAMP Working
    Group.\nThis protocol defines a control connection, which is used to control\nthe
    remote device, and a data connection, which is used to transport\nback the sampled
    data. This protocol includes has a set of optional\nparameters that allows customizing
    the behavior of the sampling\nprocess. This protocol can be used also for packet
    capture and it\nshould be possible to implement it on both network devices (router\nand
    switches) and workstation hosts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t "

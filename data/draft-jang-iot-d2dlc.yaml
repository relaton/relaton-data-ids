  content: "Recently, D2D communication is drawing attention as a technology\ncapable
    of reducing an excessive load on a network infrastructure and\nincreasing network
    coverage. When using heterogeneous wireless\ncommunication technologies such as
    WiFi and Bluetooth, which are\nbasically provided to user terminals such as smartphones,
    the\nconnectivity of D2D communication can be further strengthened.\nIn this paper,
    we propose a multi-hop communication technique using\nheterogeneous wireless communication
    technologies.\n\n\t "

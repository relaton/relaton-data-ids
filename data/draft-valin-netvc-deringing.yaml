  content: "   This document describes a deringing filter that takes into account\n
    \  the direction of edges and patterns being filtered.  The filter works\n   by
    identifying the direction of each block and then adaptively\n   filtering along
    the identified direction.  In a second pass, the\n   blocks are also filtered
    in a different direction, with more\n   conservative thresholds to avoid blurring
    edges.  The proposed\n   deringing filter is shown to improve the quality of both
    Daala and\n   the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) video codec.\n\n\t "

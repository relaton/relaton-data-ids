  content: "This draft describes an authentication mechanism based on enhancing \nCHAP
    [RFC 1994] with a Diffie-Hellman Exchange (see Section 22.1 of \n[Schneier] in
    order to prevent a passive eavesdropper from \nacquiring sufficient information
    to perform an off-line dictionary \nattack on the CHAP secret.  The use of this
    authentication \nmechanism with iSCSI [iSCSI] is discussed, along with a brief
    \ncomparison to the existing CHAP and SRP authentication mechanisms \nin iSCSI.
    \nCaution should be exercised in drawing inferences from the fact \nthat the author
    of this draft is one of the chairs of the IP \nStorage Working Group.  This draft
    is an individual submission that \nthe IP Storage Working Group is free to adopt,
    modify, reject, \nfold, spindle, and/or mutilate as it sees fit.\n\t "

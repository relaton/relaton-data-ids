- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The use of IPSec ESP protocol in the Mobile IP packet redirection\n   tunnels
    will protect the redirected packets against both passive and\n   active attacks
    launched and aid these packets to traverse the\n   firewalls surrounding both
    the home and the foreign subnets \n   visited by the mobile nodes.\n \n   This
    document proposes a scheme to negotiate the use of IPSec ESP on\n   selected Mobile
    IP tunnels and a procedure to establish these tunnels\n   with the aid of automatic
    key and security association management\n   protocol such as ISAKMP.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes extensions to the ISIS (ISIS) protocol to\n
    \  support Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS\n   (GMPLS)
    Traffic Engineering (TE) for multiple Autonomous Systems\n   (ASes).  It defines
    ISIS-TE extensions for the flooding of TE\n   information about inter-AS links,
    which can be used to perform inter-\n   AS TE path computation.\n\n   No support
    for flooding information from within one AS to another AS\n   is proposed or defined
    in this document.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The goal of standards for LDAP replication is to allow interoperable \nreplication
    among products from many different vendors.  Defining the \nmechanism to move
    data among replicas is a necessary part of this work, \nbut management of the
    replicated environment must also be standardized \nfor replication to be truly
    interoperable. \n \nThis document presents the replication management functions
    that must \nbe performed.  Whenever possible, these functions are defined in terms
    \nof existing LDAP functionality using existing LDAP operations and \nexisting
    data definitions.  In some cases, changes or additions to the \nexisting model
    are required, and specifications for these changes are \nincluded in this document\n\t "

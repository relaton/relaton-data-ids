  content: "Reverse tunneling in RFC3024 [RevTun] introduces new packet loss   \nscenarios
    at the HA and also incurs similar packet routing issues as \nRFC3220 [MIPv4] between
    Foreign Agents, during a handoff. Whether a Co-\nlocated Care-of-Address or a
    Foreign Agent Care-of-Address is used \nduring Mobile IP registration, any packets
    from the new Foreign that \nare received at the Home Agent before the visitor
    list has been updated \nwill be dropped. In addition, any in-flight packets from
    the old \nForeign agent will be dropped once the visitor list has been updated.\n\t "

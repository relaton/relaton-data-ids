  content: "     This document proposes a Dynamic Virtual Link (DVL) algorithm to\n
    \    dynamically detect and fix OSPF backbone area partition.\n \n     In the
    DVL algorithm, each ABR periodically checks if it can reach\n     via backbone
    area all other ABRs that it can reach via its transit\n     areas. If not, it
    knows that a backbone partition has occurred and\n     a spanning tree of Dynamic
    Virtual Links are created. When the\n     DVLs are not needed, they are automatically
    deleted.\n\n\t "

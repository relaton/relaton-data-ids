  content: "The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is susceptible to brute-force attacks,
    which are well within the reach of a modestly financed adversary.  As a result,
    DES has been deprecated, and replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
    \ Nonetheless, many applications continue to rely on DES for security, and designers
    and implementers continue to support it in new applications.  While this is not
    always inappropriate, it frequently is.  This note discusses DES security implications
    in detail, so that designers and implementers have all the information they need
    to make judicious decisions regarding its use.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

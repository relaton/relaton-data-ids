  content: "Optical networks could have been reduced to point-to-point links but\ntechnology
    evolution led the way to an evolution trend. The concept\nof optical transparency
    first took shape through the development of\nphotonic switching fabrics and is
    now being reinforced by the\ncontinuous efforts produced to increase transmission
    distances.\nOptical networking obviously can not be left aside of such\nevolutions
    and so it is for the (in particular, GMPLS-based)\nprotocols that control these
    photonic networks. This document\nhighlights the enhancements that seem to be
    necessary for GMPLS to\ncover these emerging trends (transparency, hybrid nodes)
    and fulfil\nits role of a generalized control plane.\n\t "

  content: "   With the need to evolve the cryptography used in today applications,\n
    \  devices, and networks, there are many scenarios where the use of a\n   single-algorithm
    is not sufficient.  For example, there might be the\n   need for migrating between
    two existing algorithms because of a\n   weakening of earlier generations (e.g.,
    from classic or traditional\n   to post-quantum or quantum-safe).  Another example
    might involve the\n   need to test, instead, the capabilities of devices via test
    drivers\n   and/or non-standard algorithms.  Another very common case is the need\n
    \  to combine certified cryptography (e.g., FIPS) with newer algorithms\n   that
    are not yet certified or that are not planned for certification.\n\n   This work
    extends the options provided by Explicit Composite, defined\n   in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs],
    by providing a mechanism to\n   manage backward and forward compatibility via
    k-of-n signature\n   validation procedures.\n\n   This document provides the definition
    of a new type of the kofn-\n   CompositePublicKey and kofn-CompositeSignature
    which are aligned with\n   the definitions of the respective structures for Explicit
    Composite\n   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs].\n\n\t "

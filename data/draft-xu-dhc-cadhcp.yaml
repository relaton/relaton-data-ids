  content: "   This document defines a technique that can provide both entity\n   authentication
    and message authentication based on certificate.  This\n   protocol combines three
    existing options, authentication option as\n   specified in delay authentication
    mechanism in [RFC3118] and the user\n   authentication protocol option defined
    in [RFC2485].  The goal of\n   this specification is to define methods based certificate
    to protect\n   the integrity of DHCP message and stop the gaps of the existing
    delay\n   authentication mechanism.  In order to meet these goals, we use the\n
    \  asymmetrical cryptography protection and some options about\n   authentication
    that have been defined in other specifications.\n\n\t "

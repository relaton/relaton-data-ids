  content: "The DiffServ Working Group will produce PHBs (Per Hop Behaviors)\n   used
    to provide differentiated services.  Some of these are to be\n   standardized,
    others may have widespread use and still others may\n   remain experimental.  The
    encoding of the PHB into a codepoint of\n   the DS Field will not be standardized,
    except for the legacy,\n   precedence PHBs.  Therefore a method is needed to coordinate
    the\n   use of PHBs and codepoints, even if only for the purpose of\n   discussing
    them.  This draft addresses this coordination issue.\n\t "

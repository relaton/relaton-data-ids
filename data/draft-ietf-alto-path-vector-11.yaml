- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization protocol [RFC7285].  The current ALTO Cost Services only\n   allow
    applications to obtain cost values on an end-to-end path\n   defined by its source
    and destination.  The present extension\n   provides abstracted information on
    particular network components or\n   elements traversed by a path between its
    source and destination.\n   Examples of such abstracted components are networks,
    data centers or\n   links.  This is useful for applications whose performance
    is impacted\n   by particular network components they traverse or by their\n   properties.
    \ Applications having the choice among several connection\n   paths may use this
    information to select paths accordingly and\n   improve their performance.  In
    particular, they may infer that\n   several paths share common links and prevent
    traffic bottlenecks by\n   avoiding such paths.  This document introduces a new
    cost type called\n   Path Vector.  A Path Vector is an array of entities that
    each\n   identifies an abstracted representation of a network part and that\n
    \  are called Abstract Network Element (ANE).  Each ANE is defined by a\n   set
    of properties.  ANE properties are conveyed by an ALTO\n   information resource
    called \"Property Map\", that can be packed\n   together with the Path Vectors
    in a multipart response.  They can\n   also be obtained via a separate ALTO request
    to a Property Map. An\n   ALTO Property Map is an extension to the ALTO protocol,
    that is\n   specified in another document entitled \"Unified Properties for the\n
    \  ALTO Protocol\" [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].\n\n\t "

  content: "This document gives an overview of how Uniform Resource Names (URNs) will
    be resolved. It describes how different URN resolution schemes will fit together,
    the requirements for the multiple URN schemes, expectations for URN clients, and
    other general resolution issues.                          This document does not
    cover any specific resolution schemes, the syntax for URNs, or the format of resolution
    results. It is expected that these issues (and other URN-related topics) will
    be covered in different Internet Drafts submitted to the IETF URI Working Group.\n\t "

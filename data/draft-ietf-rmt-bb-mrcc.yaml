  content: "This document describes MRCC, a scalable multirate congestion control\nbuilding
    block for multicast.  MRCC is an approach that allows multiple\nreceivers to concurrently
    receive packets from a single sender at vary-\ning rates depending on individual
    bandwidth connections and network con-\nditions.  Two basic goals of the approach
    are to allow each receiver to\nobtain the full benefit of the available bandwidth
    to the sender and to\nbe fair to other flows in the network.\n\t "

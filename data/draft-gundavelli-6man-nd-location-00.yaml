  content: "   The physical location of a network device plays a crucial role in\n
    \  various applications, particularly in emergency calling, where\n   precise
    caller location information is essential for prompt and\n   effective emergency
    response.\n\n   RFC 4676 has standardized DHCP options for delivering the Civic\n
    \  Location of the client, while RFC 6225 has defined DHCP options for\n   delivering
    the Geospatial coordinates of the client.  However, these\n   corresponding options
    are missing in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\n   protocols.\n\n   This proposal aims
    to address this gap by introducing the necessary\n   options for IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery to provide accurate location\n   information.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source\n   routing.
    \ It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending\n   the packet with
    a list of instructions, a.k.a. segments.  A segment\n   can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4\n   address, or IPv6 address.  Segment Routing
    can be applied in the MPLS\n   data plane by encoding segments in an MPLS label
    stack.  It also can\n   be applied to the IPv6 data plane by encoding a list of
    segment\n   identifiers in IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH).  In this\n
    \  document is described the use of unified segment identifiers in use\n   cases
    where interworking between SR-MPLS and SRv6 is required.\n\n\t "

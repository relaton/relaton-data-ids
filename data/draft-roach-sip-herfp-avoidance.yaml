  content: "   The processing of SIP reqeusts by certain types of proxies can lead\n
    \  to situations in which multiple non-sucessful responses are\n   generated,
    only one of which is ultimately reported to the originator\n   of the response.
    \ In many cases, these non-successful responses\n   indicate conditions that can
    be addressed by the requestor, and then\n   retried; therefore, the elision of
    them by proxies can lead to a\n   decrease in the rechability of certain network
    entites.\n\n   This document defines a mechanism that can be employed to avoid
    the\n   dropping of such requests with minimal implementation complexity.\n\t "

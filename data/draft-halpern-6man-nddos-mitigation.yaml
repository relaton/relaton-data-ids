abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   It has been observed that with the large space of IPv6 addresses\n
    \  within a subnet, remote attackers can send packets that saturate a\n   rotuers
    ND cache, and potentially saturate a subnet with ND\n   Soliciation messages as
    well.  Some operational techniques and small\n   protocol adjustments have been
    proposed that can help alleviate this\n   problem.  This draft proposes a slightly
    more drastic optional\n   behavior for routers, which can nearly eliminate this
    problem.\n\n\t "

  content: "   When a high priority LSP is being setup, if there is reservation\n
    \  contention on a link along the path to the destination, any low\n   priority
    LSP taking the link could get preempted and eventually\n   rerouted.\n\n   Low
    priority LSPs could suffer preemption repeatedly when they are\n   placed in succession
    on heavily used links that have very less\n   remaining bandwidth. This document
    describes a solution to avoid\n   repeated preemption of low priority LSPs in
    the network.\n\n\n\t "

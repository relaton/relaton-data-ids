  content: "   The mobile users and their traffic demands are expected to be ever-\n
    \  increasing in future years, and this growth will impose a limitation\n   for
    deploying current mobility management schemes that are\n   intrinsically centralized,
    e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6.  This\n   evolution in user traffic demand
    can be tackled by a different\n   approach for IP mobility, called Distributed
    Mobility Management,\n   which is focusing on moving the mobility anchors from
    the core\n   network and pushing them closer to the users, at the edge of the\n
    \  network.  Following this idea, in our proposal, the central anchor is\n   being
    deployed in the access router of the mobile node(MN).  That is,\n   the first
    elements that provide IP connectivity to a set of MNs are\n   also the mobility
    managers for those MNs.  In the following, we will\n   call MAAR (Mobility anchor
    and Access Router).\n\n   This draft strictly abides by the three principles:\n\n
    \  (1) The MN doesn't participate in any mobility-related signaling.MAAR\n   and
    AAA are responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the\n   host.\n\n   (2)
    The MN's movement is transparent to the communication node\n   (CN).The Home Address
    (HoA) and Care-of address (CoA) are not for\n   users but for specific sessions
    in this draft.A MN initiates a\n   session by using the MN's address assigned
    by a MAAR which the MN is\n   registered as the HoA for this session.The MN's
    address assigned by a\n   new MAAR which the MN moves to its access link as the
    CoA for the\n   session.\n\n   (3) The MN can directly forward packages to the
    CN and the packages\n   don't need to pass the home mobility anchor.  It can reduce
    the heavy\n   burdens on home mobility anchor and maintain all the continuity
    of\n   the conversation.\n\n\t "

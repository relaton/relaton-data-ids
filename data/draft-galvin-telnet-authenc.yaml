  content: "One of the deficiences of the Telnet protocol is that in order to log
    into remote systems users have to type their passwords, which are passed in the
    clear through the network.  This document specifies the AUTH_ENCRYPT option, whose
    purpose is two-fold: to provide a framework for the passing of authentication
    information through the TELNET session and to provide a mechanism to enable encryption
    of the data stream as a side effect of successful authentication.\n\t "

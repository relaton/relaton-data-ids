  script: Latn
  content: "   In a Layer 3 (L3) handoff procedure, one of the biggest components
    in\n   terms of delay is introduced by the DHCP address acquisition time\n   required
    for obtaining a valid IP address for the new subnet.\n   Duplicate Address Detection
    (DAD) is the most time consuming part of\n   the whole DHCP procedure.  In this
    document we propose a new DAD\n   scheme which has been proven to be effective
    without introducing any\n   significant delay.  By using such a scheme we can
    avoid duplicate\n   address and at the same time keep the address acquisition
    time in the\n   order of a few milliseconds.  Using the new procedure will also\n
    \  permit to detect an unauthorized use of a particular IP address even\n   if
    no duplicate IP has yet occurred.\n\n\n\t "

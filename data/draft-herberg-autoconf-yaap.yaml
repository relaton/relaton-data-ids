  content: "This document describes automatic configuration of MANET router\ninterfaces,
    as well as prefix delegation to MANET routers.  This\nautoconfiguration protocol
    is characterized by (i) adhering strictly\nto the Internet addressing architecture,
    (ii) being able to configure\nboth MANET interface addresses and handle prefix
    delegation, and\n(iii) being able to configure both stand-alone MANETs, as well
    as\nMANETs connected to an infrastructure providing, e.g., globally\nscoped addresses/prefixes
    for use within the MANET.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo specifies options that enable TCP to detect corruption in\n
    \  the presence of link layers which hand over known-corrupt data to\n   upper
    layers.  The receiver notifies the sender of an erroneous\n   segment that would
    otherwise be lost and assumed to be a sign of\n   congestion. The sender uses
    this ACK to drive its RTO calculation,\n   retransmit the segment and react to
    congestion earlier if ECE=1. In\n   addition, this feedback could be used to realize
    a more appropriate\n   rate change in response to such lost segments.\n\t "

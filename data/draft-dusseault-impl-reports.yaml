  content: "Advancing a protocol to Draft Standard requires documentation of the interoperation
    and implementation of the protocol.  Historic reports have varied widely in form
    and level of content and there is little guidance available to new report preparers.
    \ This document updates the existing processes and provides more detail on what
    is appropriate in an interoperability and implementation report.  This document
    specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

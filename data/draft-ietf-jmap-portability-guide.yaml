  content: "   JMAP (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile friendly and scalable\n
    \  protocol that can be used for data of any type.  This makes it a good\n   fit
    for migrations or data portability use cases that are focusing on\n   data import
    and export.  However, due to its large set of features,\n   it is also quite complex,
    which makes it difficult to explore new\n   application domains in practice.  The
    goal of this document is to\n   provide guidelines on implementing essential parts
    of JMAP for a much\n   lower entry barrier and more efficient implementation of
    the\n   protocol.\n\n\t "

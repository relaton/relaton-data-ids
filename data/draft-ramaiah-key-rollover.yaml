  content: "   This document describes mechanisms to achieve Key rollover for TCP\n
    \  connections that are using the TCP MD5 digest as described in RFC\n   2385.
    \ The mechanisms presented here do not require TCP protocol\n   changes.  The
    mechanisms are not just limited to TCP MD5 digest Key\n   rollover but can be
    used for any shared Key based TCP security\n   option.\n\t "

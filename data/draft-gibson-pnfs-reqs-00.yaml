- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft specifies the requirements that should be satisfied in the\n
    \  definition of a parallel NFS protocol and the considerations\n   recommended
    for its designs.  It responds to the scalable bandwidth\n   problem described
    in the pNFS Problem Statement,\n   draft-gibson-pnfs-problem-statement-01.txt.
    \ In the interest of a\n   timely adoption of scalable bandwidth file service,
    parallel NFS is\n   proposed to be a NFSv4 minor extension for communicating file
    layout\n   available through existing and future storage subsystem protocols\n
    \  such as other NFSv4 file servers (NFS), block-based SCSI subsystems\n   (SBC),
    and object-based SCSI (OSD) subsystems.\n\t "

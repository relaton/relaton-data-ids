  content: "This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance
    assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as either
    \"Active\" or \"Passive\".  Some methods may use a subset of both Active and Passive
    attributes, and we refer to these as \"Hybrid Methods\".  This memo also describes
    multiple dimensions to help evaluate new methods as they emerge.\n\t "

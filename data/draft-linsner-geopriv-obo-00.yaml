  content: "There is proposed solution submitted to the GeoPriv work group that \noutlines
    the need for a location recipient to obtain the location of a \ntarget without
    the target's knowledge.  The scenario is described as \nsupporting a legacy device
    (a device lacking support for location) for \nthe purposes of utilizing location
    when the legacy device summons \nemergency help (by dialing 911/112, etc.).  Below
    is a discussion of \nthe of the general topic of discovering location via 'On
    Behalf Of' or \nOBO.\n\t "

  content: "   There are many systems in which people use \"digital credentials\"
    to\n   control real-world systems, such as digital car keys, digital hotel\n   room
    keys, etc.  In these settings, it is common for one person to\n   want to transfer
    their credentials to another, e.g., to share your\n   hotel key.  It is desirable
    to be able to initiate this transfer with\n   a single message (e.g., SMS) which
    kicks off the transfer on the\n   receiver side.  However, in many cases the credential
    transfer itself\n   cannot be completed over these channels, e.g., because it
    is too\n   large or because it requires multiple round trips.  However, the\n
    \  endpoints cannot speak directly to each other and may not even be\n   online
    at the same time.  This draft defines a mechanism for\n   providing an appropriate
    asynchronous channel using HTTP as a\n   dropbox.\n\n\t "

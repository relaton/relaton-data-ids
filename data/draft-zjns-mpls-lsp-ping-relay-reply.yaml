  content: "   In some inter-AS and inter-area deployment scenarios for LSP Ping and\n
    \  Traceroute, a replying LSR may not have the available route to the\n   initiator,
    and the Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be\n   discarded resulting
    in false negatives or complete failure of\n   operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute.
    \ This document describes\n   extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying
    LSR to have\n   the capability to relay the echo response by a set of routable\n
    \  intermediate nodes to the initiator during the traceroute process in\n   inter-AS
    and inter-area scenarios.\n\n\t "

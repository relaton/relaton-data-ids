  content: "This is one of a pair of specifications that extend the WebDAV \nDistributed
    Authoring Protocol to enable clients to create new access \npaths to existing
    resources.  The two protocol extensions have very \ndifferent characteristics
    that make them useful for different sorts of \napplications.\n \nThe present specification
    defines bindings, and the BIND method for \ncreating them.  Creating a new binding
    to a resource indirectly creates \none or more new URIs mapped to that resource,
    which can then be used to \naccess it.  Servers are required to insure the integrity
    of any bindings \nthat they allow to be created.\n\nThe related specification,
    RFC xxxx, defines redirect reference \nresources.  A redirect reference resource
    is a resource whose default \nresponse is an HTTP/1.1 302 (Found) status code,
    redirecting the client \nto a different resource, the target resource.  A redirect
    reference \nmakes it possible to access the target resource indirectly, through
    any \nURI mapped to the redirect reference resource.  There are no integrity \nguarantees
    associated with redirect reference resources.\n\n\t "

  content: "On today's Internet, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is often used
    (some would say abused) to enable asynchronous, \"server- initiated\" communication
    from a server to a client as well as communication from a client to a server.
    \ This document describes known issues and best practices related to such \"bidirectional
    HTTP\" applications, focusing on the two most common mechanisms: HTTP long polling
    and HTTP streaming.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

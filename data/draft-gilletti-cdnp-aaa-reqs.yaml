  content: "In developing a solution for CDN Internetworking it is necessary to \ndefine
    and accommodate requirements for Authentication, Authorization,\nand Accounting.
    Since the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\n(AAA) working group is
    already focused on defining these requirements, \nthis document attempts to leverage
    that work. It contains the \nrequirements that would have to be supported by a
    AAA service to \nformulate a solution for CDN peering.\n\t "

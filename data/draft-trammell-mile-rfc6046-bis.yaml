  content: "   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a\n
    \  common XML format for document exchange, and Realtime Internetwork\n   Defense
    (RID) defines extensions to IODEF intended for the\n   cooperative handling of
    security incidents within consortia of\n   network operators and enterprises.
    \ This document specifies a\n   transport protocol for RID based upon the passing
    of RID messages\n   over HTTP/TLS.  This document updates the previous [RFC6046]
    to\n   change the intended status to Proposed Standard, and to reference the\n
    \  updated RID specification.\n\n\t "

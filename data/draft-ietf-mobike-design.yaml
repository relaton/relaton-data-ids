  content: "The IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming (MOBIKE) protocol is an extension of
    the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2). These extensions should
    enable an efficient management of IKE and IPsec Security Associations when a host
    possesses multiple IP addresses and/or where IP addresses of an IPsec host change
    over time (for example, due to mobility).\n\n This document discusses the involved
    network entities and the relationship between IKEv2 signaling and information
    provided by other protocols. Design decisions for the MOBIKE protocol, background
    information, and discussions within the working group are recorded. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

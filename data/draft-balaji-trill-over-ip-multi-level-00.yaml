- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or (b) TRILL\n
    \  based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities\n   or
    (c) Campus TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more\n   ISPs that provide
    regular IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. A few\n   solutions have been proposed as
    in [1] in the recent past that have\n   not looked at the PB-like functionality.
    These solutions have not\n   dealt with the details as to how these services could
    be provided\n   such that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected with issues\n
    \  like nick-name collisons for unicast (multicast is still TBD) being\n   taken
    care of. It has been found that with extensions to BGP the\n   problem statement
    which we will define below can be handled. Both\n   control plane and data plane
    operations can be driven into the\n   solution to make it seamlessly look at the
    entire set of TRILL sites\n   as a single entity which then can be viewed as one
    single Layer 2\n   cloud. MAC moves across TRILL sites and within TRILL sites
    can be\n   realized. This document / proposal envisions the use of BGP-MAC-VPN\n
    \  vrfs both at the IP cloud PE devices and at the peripheral PEs within\n   a
    TRILL site providing Provider Backbone like functionality. We deal\n   in depth
    with the control plane and data plane particulars for\n   unicast (multicast is
    still TBD) with nick-name election being taken\n   care of as part of the solution.\n\n\n\t "

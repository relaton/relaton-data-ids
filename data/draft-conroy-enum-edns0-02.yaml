- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Support for EDNS0 (Extension Mechanisms for DNS) is mandated in this\n
    \  document for DNS entities querying for or serving NAPTR records.  In\n   general
    those entities will be supporting ENUM resolution.  This\n   requirement is needed
    because DNS responses to ENUM-related queries\n   generally return large RRSets.
    \ Without EDNS0 support these lookups\n   would result in truncated responses
    and repeated queries over TCP\n   transport.  That has a severe impact on DNS
    server load and on the\n   latency of those queries.\n\n   This document updates
    RFC3761 only in adding this requirement.\n\t "

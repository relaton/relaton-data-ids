  content: "\n   Kernel metadata is a small prescriptive vocabulary designed to\n
    \  support highly uniform but minimal object descriptions for the\n   purpose
    of orderly collection management.  The Kernel vocabulary,\n   based on a subset
    of the Dublin Core (DC) metadata element set, aims\n   to describe objects of
    any form or category, but its reach is limited\n   to a small number of fundamental
    questions such as who, what, when,\n   and where.  The Electronic Resource Citation
    (ERC), also specified in\n   this document, is an object description that addresses
    those four\n   questions using Kernel and other metadata elements.\n\n\t "

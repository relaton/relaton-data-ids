  content: "This document proposes a mechanism for further experimentation, but not
    for widespread deployment at this time in the global Internet.\n\n TCP-Friendly
    Rate Control (TFRC) is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating
    in a best-effort Internet environment (RFC 3448). TFRC was intended for applications
    that use a fixed packet size, and was designed to be reasonably fair when competing
    for bandwidth with TCP connections using the same packet size. This document proposes
    TFRC-SP, a Small-Packet (SP) variant of TFRC, that is designed for applications
    that send small packets. The design goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve the same bandwidth
    in bps (bits per second) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes. TFRC-SP
    enforces a minimum interval of 10 ms between data packets to prevent a single
    flow from sending small packets arbitrarily frequently.\n\n Flows using TFRC-SP
    compete reasonably fairly with large-packet TCP and TFRC flows in environments
    where large-packet flows and small-packet flows experience similar packet drop
    rates. However, in environments where small-packet flows experience lower packet
    drop rates than large-packet flows (e.g., with Drop-Tail queues in units of bytes),
    TFRC-SP can receive considerably more than its share of the bandwidth. This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

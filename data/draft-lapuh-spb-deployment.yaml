  content: "   Based on many live deployments, including the Sochi Winter Olympics\n
    \  2014 network and multiple interoperability events, this document has\n   been
    created to provide advice to network operators about best\n   practices when implementing
    IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB)\n   networks. It is principally addressed
    to system integrators, network\n   operators and solution providers, including
    those that do not yet\n   support SPB. Some advice to protocol implementers is
    also provided.\n   The intention of the advice is to facilitate multi vendor network\n
    \  deployments as well as provide guidance for new installations.\n\n\n\t "

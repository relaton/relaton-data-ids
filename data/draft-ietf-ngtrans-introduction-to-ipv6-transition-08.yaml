  content: "This document is a guide to the introduction of IPv6 in the IPv4 \nbased
    Internet or Intranets.  Several general issues to start IPv6 \nnetworking in a
    predominantly IPv4 world are discussed, such as IPv6\naddresses, IPv6 DNS and
    routing issues.  Short descriptions are given\nof the different translation and
    migration tools and mechanisms that\ntranslate between IPv6 and IPv4 and/or tunnel
    IPv6 over IPv4.  The \nremainder of this document describes how IPv6 can be introduced
    in \nvarious environments, such as ISPs, Internet Exchanges and end user \nenvironments.
    \ Suggestions are given on the use of the different \ntranslation and migration
    tools in each environment.\n\t "

  content: "   Several wireless ad-hoc routing protocols have been and are being\n
    \  developped for MANET.  However, autoconfiguration of MANET networks\n   is
    still an unsettled area, and several methods have been proposed to\n   perform
    such a task.  One of the mecanisms that may be required for\n   address autoconfiguration,
    is the detection of address conflicts.\n   This is specially true for one of scenarios
    for MANET autoconf, the\n   This document specifies a general protocol for the
    detecting address\n   conflicts in a MANET network, and hence addresses a subset
    of the\n   requirements of a full MANET address autoconfiguration solution.  It\n
    \  is specified as an independent protocol from the MANET routing\n   protocol,
    and the address configuration method, and may be used with\n   any of them.  It
    aims at conceptual simplicity: essentially, a tree\n   of the nodes is built,
    from which all the information from all the\n   existing nodes is known.  Conflicts
    are detected by the node at root\n   of the tree, or as inconsistent information
    on the root of the tree.\n\t "

  content: "Usually in FMIPv6, the MN will start the binding process with its \nhome
    agent and the correspondent nodes after it has attached to NAR. \nTill the binding
    is completed, the mobile node continues to receive \npackets via a reverse tunnel
    established between PAR and NAR. The \nduration of this tunnel will depend on
    the time it takes for the \nmobile node to complete its binding, till which time
    the tunnel will \n \n \n continue to consume buffer and processing resources related
    to \nmaintaining the tunnel and forwarding packets through this tunnel in \nboth
    PAR and NAR.  \n\nThis document specifies an extension to FMIPv6 to enhance its
    \nperformance, in terms of resource management, by reducing the \nduration of
    the tunnel existence. This is achieved by enabling the \nNAR to act as a proxy
    for the MN for FMIPv6 handover. Additional \nmessage(s) and message options along
    with modifications to existing \nFMIPv6 messages and message options and definitions
    of new messages \nand message options to achieve the desired functionality is
    also \ndescribed in this document.\n\t "

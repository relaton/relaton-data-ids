- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) format, and many associated formats,
    are expressed using ASN.1.  The current ASN.1 modules conform to the 1988 version
    of ASN.1.  This document updates some auxiliary ASN.1 modules to conform to the
    2008 version of ASN.1; the 1988 ASN.1 modules remain the normative version.  There
    are no bits- on-the-wire changes to any of the formats; this is simply a change
    to the syntax.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

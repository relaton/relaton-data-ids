  content: "All BGP routers in the Default-Free Zone (DFZ) are required to carry all
    routes in the Default-Free Routing Table (DFRT). This document describes a technique,
    Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA), that allows some BGP routers not to install
    all of those routes into the Forwarding Information Base (FIB).\n\n Some routers
    in an Autonomous System (AS) announce an aggregate (the VA prefix) in addition
    to the routes they already announce. This enables other routers not to install
    the routes covered by the VA prefix into the FIB as long as those routes have
    the same next-hop as the VA prefix.\n\n The VA prefixes that are announced within
    an AS are not announced to any other AS. The described functionality is of very
    low operational complexity, as it proposes a confined BGP speaker solution without
    any dependency on network-wide configuration or requirement for any form of intra-domain
    tunneling. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

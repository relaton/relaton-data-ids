- language: en

  content: "There is need to support IP interfaces on the top of GMPLS \n        packet
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and enable IP routing \n        (e.g., OSPF-TE, ISIS-TE)
    and MPLS protocols on these \n        interfaces. Traffic on an IP/MPLS interface
    can be user \n        traffic or control traffic. In addition, it can be MPLS,
    IP \n        or ISIS. Multiplexing IP and MPLS packets over the same LSP \n        is
    supported in the current MPLS architecture. However, \n        multiplexing IP,
    MPLS, and ISIS packets over the same LSP is \n        not currently supported.
    This draft proposes the definition \n        of an explicit ISIS NULL label to
    enable this type of \n        multiplexing to take place.  \n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes modifications to the AES-GCM algorithm \nto allow
    separation of the data authenticity and data \nconfidentiality keys, while preserving
    the performance benefits \nof the algorithm. When AES-GCM is applied to network
    protocols\n such as IPsec and TLS, separation of these keys allows the data \nconfidentiality
    key to be shared with trusted intermediary nodes \non the network, while preserving
    the data authenticity functions \nin an end-to-end manner. The current definition
    of AES-GCM uses \na single key for confidentiality and authenticity hence it is
    \nnot possible to share the key with trusted network nodes, \nwithout compromising
    the data authenticity functions.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data\n
    \  format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n   code
    size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need for version
    negotiation.\n\n   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR
    tags.\n   RFC 8949 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC3339 time as a\n
    \  string) and tag 1 (POSIX time as int or float).  Since then,\n   additional
    requirements have become known.  The present document\n   defines a CBOR tag for
    time that allows a more elaborate\n   representation of time, as well as related
    CBOR tags for duration and\n   time period.  This document is intended as the
    reference document for\n   the IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.\n\n\n
    \  // (This cref will be removed by the RFC editor:) The present\n   // revision
    (–12) addresses the IESG reviews.\n\n\t "

  content: "Where LDAP servers are based on X.500 DSAs for the holding of\n      distributed
    Directory information, the maintenance of the\n      necessary security and networking
    relationships between DSAs is\n      an important factor to consider.\n \n      The
    '93 X.500 Directory standards define HOB (Hierarchical\n      Operational Binding)
    procedures for the creation of a new naming\n      context in another DSA, and
    also for the maintenance of the\n      relationship between two DSAs where one
    holds a superior naming\n      context and the other holds a subordinate naming
    context.  The\n      standards also define the use of the Directory Operational\n
    \     Binding Management Protocol (DOP) to mediate these procedures.\n \n      The
    use of HOBs provides a major simplification for managers of\n      X.500 systems,
    since it provides a way to update policies\n      automatically from one DSA to
    another.  But practical design for\n      HOBs requires decisions in a number
    of respects not fully\n      treated by the standards.  This document simplifies
    the\n      implementor's task by defining viable and practical subsets of\n      the
    standards and by clarifying some of the issues left\n      undefined by the standards.\n
    \n      HOBs always represent an intimate relationship between DSAs\n      which
    must be protected from masquerade. A method of providing\n      this protection
    is given in the '93 Directory standards by\n      requiring mutual authentication
    at the bind between DSAs. HOBS\n      will normally only be established between
    DSAs owned by a single\n      administrative authority, so security needs to be
    considered in\n      this somewhat easier context than complete openness.\n \n
    \     Although simple unprotected authentication (name and password)\n      can
    be a valid option in an already-secure environment, simple\n      protected authentication
    using an encrypted password is\n      potentially a much more secure technique,
    as is strong\n      authentica\n\t "

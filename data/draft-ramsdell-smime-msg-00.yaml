  content: "S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a\nconsistent
    way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on the\npopular Internet MIME
    standard, S/MIME provides the following\ncryptographic security services for electronic
    messaging applications:\nauthentication, message integrity and non-repudiation
    of origin (using\ndigital signatures) and privacy and data security (using encryption).\n
    \nS/MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to add\ncryptographic
    security services to mail that is sent, and to interpret\ncryptographic security
    services in mail that is received. However,\nS/MIME is not restricted to mail;
    it can be used with any transport\nmechanism that transports MIME data, such as
    HTTP. As such, S/MIME\ntakes advantage of the object-based features of MIME and
    allows secure\nmessages to be exchanged in mixed-transport systems.\n \nFurther,
    S/MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents that\nuse cryptographic
    security services that do not require any human\nintervention, such as the signing
    of software-generated documents and\nthe encryption of FAX messages sent over
    the Internet.\n\t "

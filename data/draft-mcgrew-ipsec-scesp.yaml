- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies the use of an additive stream cipher as a\nconfidentiality
    mechanism within the context of the IPSec\nEncapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
    [KA98b].  This transform fits\ninto and extends the framework of ESP CBC-Mode
    Cipher Algorithms\n[PA98].  Further, this draft describes the use of the Counter
    Mode\nof a block cipher as an ESP encryption transform.\n\n\t "

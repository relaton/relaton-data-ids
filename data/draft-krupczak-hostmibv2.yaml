  content: "   This memo modifies the original Host Resources MIB (RFC 1514) by\n
    \  converting it to the SNMPv2 SMI.  Further, this memo adds\n   clarifying text,
    based on implementation and deployment experience,\n   to ambiguous MIB object
    specifications.  It does not add nor remove\n   managed objects from the original
    specification nor change their\n   fundamental semantics.\n \n   The original
    memo defines a MIB for use with managing host systems.\n   This memo does not
    modify the original RFC's definitions or\n   assumptions.  Included from the original
    RFC [1]:\n\n       The term 'host' is construed to mean any computer that\n       communicates
    with other similar computers attached to the\n       internet and that is directly
    used by one or more human\n       beings. Although this MIB does not necessarily
    apply to devices\n       whose primary function is communications services (e.g.,\n
    \      terminal servers, routers, bridges, monitoring equipment), such\n       relevance
    is not explicitly precluded.  This MIB instruments\n       attributes common to
    all internet hosts including, for example,\n       both personal computers and
    systems that run variants of Unix.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The full flooding of LSAs in OSPF may cause large CPU and memory\nconsumption
    at node processors of a network with large number of nodes,\nlinks, adjacencies
    per node and LSDB size.  An LSA storm, defined as  \nthe near-simultaneous update
    of a large number of LSAs, in such  \nnetworks may cause network instability and
    outage.\n\nWe do a simulation study of four alternative algorithms to full \nflooding
    to determine their ability to handle large LSA storms.\nAlgorithm 2 does full
    flooding but in case two neighbors are connected\nby multiple interfaces, flooding
    is done over only one such interface.\nThe other algorithms are based on Algorithm
    2 and employ\nfurther flooding restrictions. In Algorithm 3 each node asks only\na
    subset of its one-hop neighbors, known as multipoint relays, to\nflood further.
    In Algorithm 4 flooding is done only over a\nminimum spanning tree. Algorithm
    5 uses full flooding (as in Algorithm\n2) for LSAs carrying intra-area topology
    information and restricted\nflooding over a minimum spanning tree (as in Algorithm
    4) for other\nLSAs.\n\t "

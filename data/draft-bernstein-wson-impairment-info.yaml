  content: "   This document provides an information model for the optical\n   impairment
    characteristics of optical network elements for use in\n   GMPLS/PCE control plane
    protocols and mechanisms. This information\n   model supports Impairment Aware
    Routing and Wavelength Assignment\n   (IA-RWA) in optical networks in which path
    computation and optical\n   path validation are essential components. This is
    not a general\n   network management information model.\n\n   This model is based
    on ITU-T defined optical network element\n   characteristics as given in ITU-T
    recommendation G.680 and related\n   specifications. This model is intentionally
    compatible with a\n   previous impairment free optical information model used
    in optical\n   path computations and wavelength assignment.\n\n\t "

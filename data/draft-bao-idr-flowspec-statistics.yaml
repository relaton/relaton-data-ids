  content: "   RFC8955 defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability\n
    \  Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used to distribute\n   (intra-domain
    and inter-domain) traffic Flow Specifications for IPv4\n   unicast and IPv4 BGP/MPLS
    VPN services.  This allows the routing\n   system to propagate information regarding
    more specific components of\n   the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination
    prefix.  It also\n   specifies BGP Extended Community encoding formats, which
    can be used\n   to propagate Traffic Filtering Actions along with the Flow\n   Specification
    NLRI.  Those Traffic Filtering Actions encode actions a\n   routing system can
    take if the packet matches the Flow Specification.\n\n   This document extends
    RFC 8955 with New traffic Filtering Actions.\n   statistic for bytes rate per
    second and statistic for packets rate\n   per second are useful in specified Flow
    processing scenario.\n\n\t "

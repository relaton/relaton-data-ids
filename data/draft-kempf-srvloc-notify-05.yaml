  content: "The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides mechanisms whereby service
    agent clients can advertise and user agent clients can query for services.  The
    design is very much demand-driven, so that user agents only obtain service information
    when they specifically ask for it.  There exists another class of user agent applications,
    however, that requires notification when a new service appears or disappears.
    \ In the RFC 2608 design, these applications are forced to poll the network to
    catch changes.  In this document, we describe a protocol for allowing such clients
    to be notified when a change occurs, removing the need for polling.  This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

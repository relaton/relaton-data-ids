- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   DNS over TCP and HTTP/1.x are both stream-oriented, client-speaks-\n
    \  first protocols.  They can both be run over a stream-based security\n   protocol
    like TLS.  A server accepting a stream-based client can\n   distinguish between
    a valid stream of DNS queries and valid stream of\n   HTTP/1.x requests by simple
    observation of the first few octets sent\n   by the client.  This can be done
    without any external demultiplexing\n   mechanism like TCP port number or ALPN.\n\n
    \  Implicit multiplexing of the two protocols over a single listening\n   port
    can be useful for obscuring the presence of DNS queries from a\n   network observer,
    which makes it relevant for DNS privacy.\n\n   Widespread adoption of the described
    approach could constrain\n   evolution of the stream-based variants of both DNS
    ([RFC1035]) and\n   HTTP/1.x ([RFC7230]) by ossifying existing distinguishing
    bit\n   patterns in early octets sent by the client.  However, this draft\n   explicitly
    rules out multiplexing in this form with HTTP/2, so it\n   should place no constraints
    on it or any higher version of HTTP.\n\n\t "

  content: "When an ad hoc network is connected to the Internet, it is important \nfor
    the mobile nodes to detect available gateways providing access to \nthe Internet.
    Therefore, a gateway discovery and selection mechanism \nis required. Current
    ad hoc routing protocols have been extended to \nsupport gateway discovery. However,
    the selection process is based on \nthe default gateway configuration. We here
    describe an extension to \nMANET protocols to enable the gateway selection according
    to users’ \nrequirements, especially in the case where multiple gateways co-\nexist.

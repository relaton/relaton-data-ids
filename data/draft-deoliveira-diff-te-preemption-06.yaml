  content: "When the establishment of a higher priority (Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Path) TE LSP requires the preemption of a set of lower priority TE LSPs,
    a node has to make a local decision to select which TE LSPs will be preempted.
    \ The preempted LSPs are then rerouted by their respective \\%Head-end Label Switch
    Router (LSR).  This document presents a flexible policy that can be used to achieve
    different objectives: preempt the lowest priority LSPs; preempt the minimum number
    of LSPs; preempt the set of TE LSPs that provide the closest amount of bandwidth
    to the required bandwidth for the preempting TE LSPs (to minimize bandwidth wastage);
    preempt the LSPs that will have the maximum chance to get rerouted.  Simulation
    results are given and a comparison among several different policies, with respect
    to preemption cascading, number of preempted LSPs, priority, wasted bandwidth
    and blocking probability is also included.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

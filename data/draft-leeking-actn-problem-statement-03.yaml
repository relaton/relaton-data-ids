  content: "   Previously transport networks were typically static, lacked\n   flexibility,
    and required long planning times when deploying new\n   services. Network Providers
    and Service Providers have embraced\n   technologies that allow separation of
    data plane and control plane,\n   distributed signaling for path setup and protection,
    and centralized\n   path computation for service planning and traffic engineering.\n
    \  Although these technologies provide significant benefits, they do\n   not meet
    the growing need for network programmability, automation,\n   resource sharing,
    and service elasticity necessary for meeting\n   operator's requirement for their
    virtual network operation.\n\n   Virtual network operation refers to the creation
    of a\n   virtualized environment allowing operators to view the\n   abstraction
    of the underlying multi-admin, multi-vendor, multi-\n   technology networks and
    to operate, control and manage these\n   multiple networks as if a single virtualized
    network. Another\n   dimension of virtual network operation is associated with
    use of\n   the common core transport network resource by multi-tenant\n   service
    networks as a way of providing a virtualized\n   infrastructure to flexibly offer
    new services and applications.\n\n   The work effort investigating this problem
    space is known as\n   Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN). This\n
    \  document provides an ACTN problem description, scope of work,\n   and outlines
    the core requirements to facilitate virtual network\n   operation.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The RFC3264 Offer/Answer model specifies rule for the bilateral\n   exchange
    of Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] messages for\n   setting up, updating
    and tearing down of multimedia streams.  Rarely,\n   there might be situations
    wherein either of the communicating\n   parties, might end up being the offerer
    for updating an on-going\n   session.  This scenario is commonly known as \"glare\"
    condition and it\n   needs to be handled nevertheless.  This specification describes\n
    \  procedures for parties involved in an ongoing RTCWeb session to add\n   new
    media in a glareless fashion.\n\n   There are various ways this problem might
    be solved - this draft\n   sketches out one possible solution to the problem.\n\n\t "

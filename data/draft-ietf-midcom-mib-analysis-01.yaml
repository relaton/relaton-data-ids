  content: "This document provides an analysis and identification of the managed \nobjects
    for dynamic configuration of middleboxes. The scope of the \nmiddleboxes to which
    these managed objects apply is limited to NATs \nand Firewalls.  However, the
    managed objects as identified in this \ndocument are intended to provide a baseline
    for the dynamic \nconfiguration of other types of middleboxes. The applicability
    of \nexisting Management Information Base (MIB) modules to the MIDCOM \nrequirements,
    framework and semantics is described. Additional \nmanaged objects are identified
    to satisfy the entirety of the MIDCOM \nrequirements, framework and semantics
    and to provide a complete \nMIDCOM MIB for NATs and Firewalls to fully realize
    the requirements \nof the MIDCOM protocol. The actual definition of any new managed
    \nobjects is provided in a separate document [MDCMIB].\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Protection of location information is an essential requirement of the\n
    \  GEOPRIV architecture.  Since using protocols cannot be relied upon to\n   provide
    adequate protections to the location objects they carry, the\n   location objects
    themselves must be secured.  This document examines\n   several candidates for
    a Secure Location Object format in the context\n   of GEOPRIV and ECRIT security
    requirements, including both locations\n   by value and by reference.\n\n\n\t "

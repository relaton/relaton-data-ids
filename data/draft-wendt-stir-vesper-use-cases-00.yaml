  content: "   This document discusses a set of use cases and requirements for an\n
    \  extension to Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) called VESPER\n   (Verifiable
    STI PERsona).  VESPER enhances STIR by incorporating a\n   trust framework that
    associating a responsible business entity and/or\n   human with the assignment
    and right-to-use a telephone number.\n   Important to the use-cases and requirements
    are mechanisms for the\n   preservation of privacy and explicit choice to reveal
    information\n   beyond the communications service provider you have chosen to
    assign\n   the telephone number with.  Core to this premise is the ability to\n
    \  represent and prove the right to use a telephone number resource via\n   the
    legitimate holder of the Vesper token.  Additional metadata and\n   attributes
    can be vetted and attested via vetting policies and Know-\n   Your-Customer (KYC)
    processes that are not defined as part of this\n   effort but should follow jurisdiction
    specific best practices and\n   policies that may exist.  The framework allows
    for the leveraging of\n   trusted and identified issuers to create a signed credential
    known as\n   a VESPER token that will be defined including associated claims and\n
    \  potential paths for extensibility in the future.  In addition,\n   transparency
    mechanisms are explored to provide public logs or\n   registries of certificates,
    keys, entity information, or telephone\n   number details, if desired by the telephone
    number holder to improve\n   trustability, visibility and accountability within
    the telephone\n   ecosystem.\n\n   This document covers various scenarios in which
    VESPER can be used to\n   enhance trust in communications, focusing on common
    real-world\n   deployments and corresponding requirements.  This work is intended
    to\n   complement and align with the framework described currently as a work\n
    \  in progress in [I-D.wendt-stir-vesper].\n\n\t "

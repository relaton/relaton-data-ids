  content: "When an IPv6 node receives a Router Advertisement, how does it know \nthat
    the node which sent the advertisement is authorized to announce \nthat it routes
    the prefix? When an IPv6 node receives a Neighbor \nAdvertisement message, how
    does it know that the node sending the \nmessage is, in fact, authorized to claim
    the binding? The answer is, \nin the absence of a preconfigured IPsec security
    association among \nthe nodes on the link and the routers, they don't. In this
    draft, a \nlightweight protocol is described for securing the signaling \ninvolved
    in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. The protocol allows a node \nreceiving a Router Advertisement
    or a Neighbor Advertisement to have \nthe confidence that the message was authorized
    by the legitimate \nowner of the address or prefix being advertised without requiring
    a \npreconfigured IPsec security association. A certain degree of \ninfrastructural
    support is required, but not any more than is \ncurrently common for public access
    IP networks. The protocol is \nbased on some results in identity based cryptosystems
    that allow a \npublicly known identifier to function as a public key.\n\t "

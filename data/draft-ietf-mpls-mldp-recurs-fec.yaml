  content: "The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Paths (\"MP LSPs\") contains a field that identifies the address
    of a \"root node\".  Intermediate nodes are expected to be able to look up that
    address in their routing tables.  However, this is not possible if the route to
    the root node is a BGP route and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free
    core.  This document specifies procedures that enable an MP LSP to be constructed
    through a BGP-free core.  In these procedures, the root node address is temporarily
    replaced by an address that is known to the intermediate nodes and is on the path
    to the true root node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

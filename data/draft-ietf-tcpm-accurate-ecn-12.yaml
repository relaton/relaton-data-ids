  content: "   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network\n
    \  nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate\n   incipient
    congestion to the end-points.  Receivers with an ECN-\n   capable transport protocol
    feed back this information to the sender.\n   ECN is specified for TCP in such
    a way that only one feedback signal\n   can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time
    (RTT).  Recent new TCP\n   mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data Center
    TCP (DCTCP)\n   or Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) need more accurate\n
    \  ECN feedback information whenever more than one marking is received\n   in
    one RTT.  This document specifies a scheme to provide more than\n   one feedback
    signal per RTT in the TCP header.  Given TCP header\n   space is scarce, it allocates
    a reserved header bit, that was\n   previously used for the ECN-Nonce which has
    now been declared\n   historic.  It also overloads the two existing ECN flags
    in the TCP\n   header.  The resulting extra space is exploited to feed back the
    IP-\n   ECN field received during the 3-way handshake as well.  Supplementary\n
    \  feedback information can optionally be provided in a new TCP option,\n   which
    is never used on the TCP SYN.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "Security is increasingly becoming a concern in applications built on\nmulti-party
    communication.  Centrally, protection of the application\ncontent from non-authorized
    or malicious parties is the fundamental\ngoal of any security policy specification.
    \ This draft seeks to\nilluminate the design space of secure multicast communication\npolicy.
    \ The security requirements of existing application policies\nare intended to
    be addressable by these policy dimensions.  It is\nfrom an understanding of policy
    design space that the mechanisms for\npolicy specification and enforcement can
    be derived.\n\t "

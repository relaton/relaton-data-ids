  content: "   This document proposes an IP multicast fast reroute method based on
    \n   differentiating primary and backup PIM join.  The multicast stream \n   is
    only sent along one of the multicast primary and backup path, \n   which enables
    the efficient multicast delivery under both normal and \n   abnormal conditions.

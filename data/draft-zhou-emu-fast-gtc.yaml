  content: "The Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP-FAST) method enables secure communication between a peer and a server
    by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated
    tunnel.  Within this tunnel, a basic password exchange, based on the Generic Token
    Card method (EAP-GTC), may be executed to authenticate the peer.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a method for improving the ability of the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to assist in renumbering an internet.  DHCP
    is already capable of supporting host renumbering by assigning a new address when
    a client attempts to renegotiate an existing lease, but this proposal makes host
    renumbering more graceful by providing for a transition period in which the client
    can use both addresses.\n\t "

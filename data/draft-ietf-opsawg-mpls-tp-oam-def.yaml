  content: "At first glance, the acronym \"OAM\" seems to be well-known and well-understood.
    Looking at the acronym a bit more closely reveals a set of recurring problems
    that are revisited time and again.\n\n This document provides a definition of
    the acronym \"OAM\" (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) for use in all
    future IETF documents that refer to OAM. There are other definitions and acronyms
    that will be discussed while exploring the definition of the constituent parts
    of the \"OAM\" term. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.\n\t "

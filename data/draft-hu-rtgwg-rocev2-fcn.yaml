abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   AI services (e.g. distributed model training, separated storage and\n
    \  model training) drive the need to transmit RMDA packets through SRv6\n   tunnels
    in WAN.  RoCEv2 is the most popular open standard for\n   achieving RDMA and network
    offloads over ethernet, with its\n   congestion control based on the combination
    of PFC and ECN.  The\n   document defines the fast congestion notification for
    distributed\n   RoCEv2 network based on SRv6 tunnels, and further extends PFC
    and ECN\n   to achieve precise flow control and end-to-end congestion control.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines a set of services enabled by the Session\nInitiation
    Protocol (SIP), that allow for access to voice services by\npeople who are hearing
    impaired. SIP has gained much attention as a\ntool for voice communications on
    the Internet. Therefore,\nconsiderations for universal access of its services
    are important.\nThis document does not propose any extensions or new capabilities
    to\nSIP, but rather a set of services enabled by it.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has led
    to the creation of shared DNS-based lists (DNSBLs) of IP addresses or domain names
    intended to help guide email filtering.  This memo summarizes guidelines of accepted
    best practice for the management of public DNSBLs by their operators as well as
    for the proper use of such lists by mail server administrators (DNSBL users),
    and it provides useful background for both parties.  It is not intended to advise
    on the utility or efficacy of particular DNSBLs or the DNSBL concept in general,
    nor to assist end users with questions about spam.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

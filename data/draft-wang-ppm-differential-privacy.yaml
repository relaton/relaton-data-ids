  content: "   Differential Privacy (DP) is a property of a secure aggregation\n   mechanism
    that ensures that no single input measurement significantly\n   impacts the distribution
    of the aggregate result.  This is a stronger\n   property than what systems like
    the Distributed Aggregation Protocol\n   (DAP) are designed to achieve.  This
    document describes a variety of\n   DP mechansisms applicable to DAP, and, for
    a variety of common use\n   cases, lifts DAP to a protocol that also achieves
    DP.\n\n\t "

  content: "There are several proposals on increasing the TCP initial congestion\nwindow
    to a new hardcoded value and subsequent updates of this\nhardcoded value.  This
    document explores the mechanism of dynamically\ndetermining the potentially unbounded
    Initial Window.  This would\nallow for the future growth after only one software
    upgrade of the\nexisting TCP stacks.  Also this would allow automatic adjustment
    of\nthe Initial Window size depending on the connectivity properties of\nthe particular
    Internet host, while minimizing the retransmissions\nthat result from overly optimistic
    initial congestion window\nselection.\n\t "

  content: "The ATIS IPTV Interoperability Forum (IIF) is a leading developer of\nrequirements,
    standards, and specifications for Internet Protocol\nTelevision, or IPTV.  IIF
    has specified an architecture for Content\nOn Demand applications which was published
    as the [ATIS-0800042] IPTV\nContent on Demand (CoD) Service specification.  ATIS
    IIF is now\nworking on revision 2 of this document.  Revision 2 of ATIS CoD\nspecification
    includes an additional work item called \"Internet\nSourced Content\" which includes
    \"off net delivery\".  Both Internet\nSourced Content and off net delivery will
    address scenarios that\ninclude delivery of content from a Content Service Provider
    through\nmultiple CDNs operated by different organizations to a user agent.\nThis
    document provides information on [ATIS-0800042], and the\nInternet Sourced Content
    and off net Delivery use cases that are\nrelevant to CDNI.\n\nThe ATIS IIF architecture
    group focuses on developing architectures\nand prefers to reference existing protocols
    where ever possible.  If,\nand as, the IETF CDNI effort progresses, the ATIS IIF
    architecture\ngroup will be evaluating the protocols defined by the CDNI working\ngroup
    for inclusion in the CDN interconnect scenarios defined as part\nof the Internet
    Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases.\n\nA goal of the present document
    is to illustrate the Internet Sourced\nContent and off net Delivery use cases
    defined in revision 2 of the\nATIS CoD architecture that are relevant to the IETF
    CDNI work.  It is\nhoped that these use cases can also be used to guide requirements
    for\nthe development of IETF CDNI protocols.\n\t "

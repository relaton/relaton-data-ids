  content: "This memo describes an experimental method for the funneling IP \ndatagrams
    using tweets and chirps, through avian carriers\nwhich are embedded with a processor/chip
    that is biomedically\nengineered to fit in their tiny brains.  This specification
    is \nprimarily useful in Metropolitan Area Networks where agile predatory\ndomestic
    or feral species are not widespread.  This is an \nexperimental, not recommended
    method.  \n\n\t "

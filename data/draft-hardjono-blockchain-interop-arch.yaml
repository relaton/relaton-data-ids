  content: "   With the increasing interest in the potential use of blockchains and\n
    \  decentralized ledger technology (DLT) networksorks for virtual asset\n   management,
    there is a need for these networks to have\n   interoperability to support applications
    and services built atop\n   these networks.  An interoperability architecture
    for DLT networks is\n   therefore needed in order to permit the secure flow of
    digital assets\n   different DLT networks, satisfying the properties of transfer\n
    \  atomicity, consistency and durability.  The architecture must\n   recognize
    that there are different DLT networks and that the interior\n   constructs in
    these networks maybe incompatible with one another.\n   This document proposes
    an interoperability architecture based on DLT\n   Gateways, which are points of
    interconnection between networks.\n   Among others, the gateways implement one
    or more protocols for the\n   transfer (or exchange) digital assets between DLT
    networks.  A\n   gateway belonging to a DLT network peers with another gateway\n
    \  belonging to a different DLT network to perform the asset transfer\n   between
    the two networks.\n\n\t "

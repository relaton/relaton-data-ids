  content: "In Mobile IPv6 home link operation on point-to-point links requires\nthat
    one prefix can only be assigned to one mobile node by the home\nagent (HA) and
    different mobile nodes can not share this home network\nprefix.  Managing Per-MN
    home network prefixes is likely to increase\nthe processing load at the HA.  Based
    on the idea that DHCPv6 servers\ncan manage prefixes, we propose a new technique
    in which HA offloads\ndelegation and release tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6
    server.\nHA requests a prefix for an incoming mobile station to the DHCPv6\nserver.
    \ Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create a home\naddress.  When the
    mobile node leaves the network, the prefix is\nreturned to the DHCPv6 server.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The 6LoWPAN and CoAP standards defined for resource-constrained\n   devices
    are fast emerging as the de-facto protocols for enabling the\n   Internet-of-Things
    (IoTs).  Security is an important concern in IoTs\n   and the DTLS protocol has
    been chosen as the preferred method for\n   securing CoAP messages.  DTLS is a
    point-to-point protocol relying on\n   the IP routing to deliver messages between
    the client and the server.\n   However in some low-power lossy networks (LLNs)
    with multi-hop, a new\n   \"joining\" device may not be initially IP routable.
    \ This prevents\n   DTLS from being directly useful as an authentication and\n
    \  confidentiality protocol during this stage, requiring other security\n   protocols
    to be implemented on the device.  These devices being\n   resource-constrained
    often cannot accommodate more than one security\n   protocol in their code memory.
    \ To overcome this problem and reuse\n   DTLS, we present a DTLS Relay solution
    for the non-IP routable\n   \"joining\" device to establish a secure DTLS connection
    with a DTLS\n   server.  Further we present a stateful and stateless mode of\n
    \  operation for the DTLS Relay.\n\n\t "

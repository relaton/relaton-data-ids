  content: "IP spoofing attacks based on sequence number spoofing have become a serious
    threat on the Internet (CERT Advisory CA-95:01).  While ubiquitous crypgraphic
    authentication is the right answer, we propose a simple modification to TCP implementations
    that should be a very substantial block to the current wave of attacks.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify
    an Internet standard of any kind.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "The Subnet Selections option is provided by a DHCP client to DHCP a\nserver
    as an indication to which subnet or subnets to select an address from for the
    client's lease. When present, the DHCP server will use this value as an indication
    to which configured subnet pool of addresses to select from, effectively divorcing
    the giaddr of its overloaded subnet selection function for a packet forwarded
    by a DHCP relay agent. The giaddr is retains its function as the address for the
    DHCP server to send replies to. \n\nAn application for this new option would be
    to allow a Network Access \nServer (NAS) acting as DHCP proxy on behalf of a large
    number of dial-in \nusers to obtain an address that is in the desired subnet(s)
    for the dial \nusers without having to configure multiple giaddr values at the
    NAS, or \nrequiring the NAS to utilize an address within each subnet.\n\t "

  content: "The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [2] has historically been\nused
    to announce information for all available IP multicast sessions\nto the prospective
    receivers in the experimental MBone.  Each\nreceiver can then discover which sessions
    are available and which\nones he may want to join.  Although SAP is easy to use,
    SAP is not\nscalable and controlling the SAP message transmission in a wide area\nnetwork
    is not easy.  Therefore this document describes the\nlimitations of SAP when used
    in the global Internet.  Furthermore,\nSAP has recently been used as a convenient
    method for conveying\nconfiguration information to a set of receivers that are
    already\ninterested by a multicast session (e.g., to carry FEC Framework\nConfiguration
    Information [7]).  This documents describes the\nlimitations of SAP for this type
    of usage, since this latter is\nrather different from its original goals.\n\t "

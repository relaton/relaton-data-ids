  content: "   TRILL is originally designed for customer networks. When it is used\n
    \  as a provider network to interconnect multiple separate users, the\n   space
    of current Inner VLAN becomes insufficient. As an easy way, a\n   new VLAN ID
    field is added to the Inner Ethernet frame. The new VLAN\n   ID can be use in
    conjunction with the previous defined Inner VLAN.\n   This mechanism is usually
    known as stacked VLANs(802.1ad, or QinQ).\n   The stacked VLANs mechanism is analyzed
    in this document. The method\n   to introduce a single longer VLAN field to current
    TRILL header is\n   also analyzed in this document.  In addition, a novel MAC
    address\n   rewriting mechanism is also brought forward to break the space\n   limitation
    of the Inner VLAN. The MAC addresses of the native frame\n   are not used for
    forwarding process in transit RBridges. When the\n   packet enters the TRILL network,
    the ingress RBridge (Appointed\n   Forwarder) uses a Virtual MAC (VMAC) address
    to replace the real MAC\n   and embedded the native VLAN ID into this virtual
    MAC address. When a\n   packet egresses from the TRILL network, the egress RBridge
    will use\n   the real MAC address to replace the virtual MAC address and deliver\n
    \  it to the destination on the local link.\n\n\t "

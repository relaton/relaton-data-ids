abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The photonic firewall oriented routing and spectrum allocation\n   strategy
    in elastic optical networks is proposed. For the security\n   detecting requirement,
    each light-path should pass through at least a\n   photonic firewall. To reduce
    the blocking rate and improve the\n   spectrum efficiency, the whole network is
    divided into several parts\n   according to the locations of all deployed photonic
    firewalls. A\n   photonic firewall is responsible for the security detecting for
    each\n   part. This strategy has a low complexity and is suitable for large-\n
    \  scale optical networks.\n\n\t "

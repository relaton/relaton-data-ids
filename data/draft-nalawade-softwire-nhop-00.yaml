  content: "   The current [MP-BGP] extensions carry routing information by\n   associating
    the same network layer protocol with both the NLRI and\n   the next hop. However,
    in certain scenarios, it is desirable or\n   required to advertise next hop information
    associated with a\n   different network layer protocol to the one associated with
    the NLRI.\n\n   Similarly, when data traffic for a network layer protocol's NLRIs\n
    \  needs to be forwarded over an underlying tunnel, it is required to\n   indicate
    the tunnel endpoint to be used for forwarding with the BGP\n   update for a given
    NLRI.\n\n   This document specifies a new BGP attribute, called the SW_NEXT_HOP\n
    \  attribute, which can optionally be used in a BGP Update message to\n   advertise
    next hop information associated with a different network\n   layer protocol than
    that of the NLRIs or convey information about the\n   tunnel endpoint.\n\t "

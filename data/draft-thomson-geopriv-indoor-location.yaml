  content: "A method is described for constructing a Presence Information Data\nFormat
    - Location Object (PIDF-LO) document that contains location\ninformation using
    a locally-defined coordinate reference system\n(CRS).  This form of representation
    allows for use of locally-defined\ncoordinates with potential advantages for improved
    accuracy and\nusability in local context, in particular location applications
    that\noperate indoors.  A framework for defining a local CRS is provided.\nA process
    for transformation of coordinates defined in the local CRS\nand the widely used
    World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) CRS is\ndefined.\n\nStatus of This Memo\n\nThis

- language: en

  content: "   This document proposes a method for detection and mitigation of AS\n
    \  hijacking.  In this mechanism, an AS operator registers a new object\n   in
    the RPKI called 'ROAs Exist for All Prefixes (REAP)'.  REAP is\n   digitally signed
    using the AS holder's certificate.  By registering a\n   REAP object, the AS operator
    is declaring that they have Route Origin\n   Authorization (ROA) coverage for
    all prefixes originated by their AS.\n   A receiving AS will mark a route as Invalid
    if the prefix is not\n   covered by any Validated ROA Payload (VRP) and the route
    origin AS\n   has signed a REAP.  Here Invalid means that the route is determined\n
    \  to be an AS hijack.\n\n\t "

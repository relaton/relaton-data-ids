  content: "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) currently supports grouping\nmedia
    lines.  SDP also has semantics defined for grouping the\nassociated source and
    Forward Error Correction (FEC)-based repair\nflows.  However, the existing specifications
    have strict requirements\nthat severely limit the use of the new features that
    are currently\nunder development in the FECFRAME WG.  These new features will
    allow\napplications to use FEC in a more flexible way but they require\nchanges
    in the current specifications.  This document provides a list\nof the required
    changes and discusses potential approaches to make\nthese changes.\n\t "

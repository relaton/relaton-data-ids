  content: "This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises from\nthe
    desire to treat a set or group of names as \"aliases\" of each\nother, \"bundled,\"
    \"variants,\" or \"the same,\" which is problematic in\nterms of corresponding
    behavior for DNS labels and FQDNs.\n\nWith the emergence of internationalized
    domain names, among other\npotential use cases, two or more names that users will
    regard as\nhaving identical meaning may sometimes require corresponding behavior\nin
    the underlying infrastructure, possibly in the DNS itself.  It's\nnot clear how
    to accommodate this required behavior of such names in\nDNS resolution; in particular,
    it's not clear when they are best\naccommodated in registry practices for generating
    names for lookup in\nthe DNS, existing DNS protocol elements and behavior, existing\napplication-layer
    mechanisms and practices, or some set of protocol\nelements or behavior not yet
    defined.  This document attempts to\ndescribe some of these cases and the behavior
    of some of the possible\nsolutions discussed to date.\n\t "

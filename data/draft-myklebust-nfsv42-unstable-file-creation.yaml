  content: "This document describes an extension to the NFSv4 protocol to allow\nclients
    to create and write files with greater efficiency.\n\nThe first proposal allows
    the server to defer creating the file on\nstable storage when replying to an OPEN
    call.  The aim is to improve\nserver efficiency and scalability by reducing the
    number of required\ndisk accesses when writing a file from scratch.\n\nThe second
    proposal allows the server to share information about the\nimplementation of its
    change attribute with the client.  The aim is\nto improve the client's ability
    to determine the order in which\nparallel updates to the same file were processed.Keywords\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\t "

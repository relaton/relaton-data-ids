- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Some SIP architectures use \"application servers\", B2BUAs that are\ninserted
    between two user agents during a conversation, to provide\nadditional processing.
    \ Since B2BUAs do not follow the rules for SIP\nproxies, they do not by default
    interoperate with SIP call control\noperations.  Augmenting application servers
    with suitable behaviors\nfor handling SIP call control operations mitigates these
    problems,\nand in many cases, allows standard user agents to use SIP call\ncontrol
    features without modification.\n\t "

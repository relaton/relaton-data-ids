abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The original IPv6 Type 0 Routing Header has been deprecated due to\n
    \  the security risk of a packet forwarding loop being formed, by\n   specifying
    a large sequence of alternating IPv6 node addresses to\n   visit.  This memo proposes
    a method to prevent these forwarding loops\n   forming, allowing the IPv6 Type
    0 Routing Header to be more securely\n   and more safely used.  The method may
    also be applicable to other\n   unicast source routing scenarios.\n\n\t "

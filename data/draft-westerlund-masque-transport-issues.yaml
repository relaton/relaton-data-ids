- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The HTTP Connect method uses back-to-back TCP connections to and from\n
    \  a proxy.  Such a solution takes care of many transport aspects as\n   well
    as IP Flow related concerns.  With UDP and IP proxying on the\n   other hand,
    there are several per-packet and per-flow aspects that\n   need consideration
    to preserve the properties of end- to-end IP/UDP\n   flows.  The aim of this document
    is to highlight and provide\n   solutions for these issues related to UDP and
    IP proxying.\n\n\t "

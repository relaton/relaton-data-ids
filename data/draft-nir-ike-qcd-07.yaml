  content: "This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol that\nallows
    for faster detection of SA desynchronization using a saved\ntoken.\n\nWhen an
    IPsec tunnel between two IKEv2 peers is disconnected due to a\nrestart of one
    peer, it can take as much as several minutes for the\nother peer to discover that
    the reboot has occurred, thus delaying\nrecovery.  In this text we propose an
    extension to the protocol, that\nallows for recovery immediately following the
    restart.\n\t "

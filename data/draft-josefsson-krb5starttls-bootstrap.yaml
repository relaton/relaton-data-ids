  content: "This document describes how clients can use the Kerberos V5 over TLS\nprotocol
    together with its long term key to 1) avoid having to\nvalidate the server certificate,
    2) securely learn a KDC's server\ncertificate, and 3) learn the trust anchors
    used by the KDC.\n\nWe also describe how the Kerberos V5 over TLS protocol can
    be used to\n4) avoid the need for a long term shared key between the client and\nthe
    KDC by instead using TLS client authentication.\n\nThese goals are achieved by
    introducing a new Kerberos V5 pre-\nauthentication type that modify how the Kerberos
    V5 reply key is\nderived.\n\t "

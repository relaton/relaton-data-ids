  content: "   This document specifies how BRSKI entities, such as registrars,\n   proxies,
    pledges or others that are acting as responders, can be\n   discovered and selected
    by BRSKI entities acting as initiators,\n   especially in the face of variations
    in the protocols that can\n   introduce non-interoperability when not equally
    supported by both\n   responder and initiator.\n\n   This document does not define
    any new discovery methods.  Instead, it\n   solves the challenges of announcing,
    discovering and selecting an\n   interoperable instance of a BRSKI responder by
    defining a data model\n   and simple string based encoding for BRSKI variations
    and by\n   prescribing how to encode this encoding of variations into multiple\n
    \  pre-existing discovery mechanisms: DNS-SD, GRASP and CoAP discovery\n   (CORE-LF).\n\n
    \  This document also defines the procedures necessary for interoperable\n   announcement,
    discovery and selection in the face of redundant\n   responder, making deployment
    more resilient by allowing easy and\n   automatic redundancy.\n\n   BRSKI Proxies
    are a core element of BRSKI.  This document specifies\n   how Proxies need to
    be implemented to support proxying of BRSKI\n   variations, even supporting possible
    future variations not in\n   existance when the proxy was implemented.\n\n   Finally,
    this document defines the IANA registrities to track the\n   definition of variations
    and their encoding and hence allow easy\n   introduction of new variations, support
    of additional discovery\n   protocols and even discovery of additional BRKI roles
    (such as MASA).\n   All with no or minimum additional specification requirements
    other\n   than new registry entries.\n\n\t "

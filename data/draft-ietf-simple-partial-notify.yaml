  script: Latn
  content: "By default, presence delivered using the presence event package for the
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is represented in the Presence Information Data
    Format (PIDF).  A PIDF document contains a set of elements, each representing
    a different aspect of the presence being reported.  When any subset of the elements
    change, even just a single element, a new document containing the full set of
    elements is delivered.  This memo defines an extension allowing delivery of only
    the presence data that has actually changed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

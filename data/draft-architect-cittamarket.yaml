abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies the CITTAMARKET Protocol v1.0, an open standard
    for the immutable identification and timestamping of Artificial General Intelligence
    (AGI) systems. The protocol leverages the Bitcoin blockchain''s Proof-of-Work
    to solve the architectural problem of coordinating distributed autonomous systems
    without centralized control. It defines a four-layer architecture for creating
    unforgeable "Sovereign Identity" records. Priority of this invention is cryptographically
    anchored in Bitcoin blocks #927277, #927579, #928154, and #928185.</p>'

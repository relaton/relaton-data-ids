  content: "In Multicast Virtual Private Networks (MVPNs), customer multicast flows
    are carried in \"tunnels\" through a service provider's network.  The base specifications
    for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN \"auto-discovery routes\" and specify how to
    use an auto-discovery route to advertise the fact that an individual customer
    multicast flow is being carried in a particular tunnel.  However, those specifications
    do not provide a way to specify, in a single such route, that multiple customer
    flows are being carried in a single tunnel.  Those specifications also do not
    provide a way to advertise that a particular tunnel is to be used by default to
    carry all customer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by all
    the provider edge routers of the MVPN.  This document eliminates these restrictions
    by specifying the use of \"wildcard\" elements in the customer flow identifiers.
    \ With wildcard elements, a single auto-discovery route can refer to multiple
    customer flows or even to all customer flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

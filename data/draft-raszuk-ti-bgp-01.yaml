  content: "BGP4 protocol is a well established single standard of an inter-\ndomain
    routing and non-routing information distribution today.  For\nmany applications
    it is also the protocol of choice to disseminate\nvarious application based information
    intra-domain.  It's popularity\nand it's wide use has been effectively provided
    by it's reliable\ntransport, session protection as well as loop free build in\nmechanism.\n\nIt
    has been observed in both intra-domain as well as inter-domain\napplications that
    reliable information distribution is an extremely\ndesired tool for many services.
    \ Introduction of Multiprotocol\nExtensions to BGP even further attracted various
    sorts of new\ninformation to be carried over BGP4.\n\nThe observation proves that
    amount and nature of information carried\nby BGP increases and diverges from the
    original goal of\ninterconnection for IP Internet Autonomous Systems at a rather
    fast\npace.\n\nThis draft proposes BGP to divide information into two broad\ncategories:
    Internet routing critical and non Internet routing\ncritical that would also include
    information carried by BGP which is\nnot related directly to routing.  For the
    purpose of this document we\nwill refer to the latter case as second BGP instance.\n\nThis
    draft proposes that the current BGP infrastructure will continue\nto be used to
    disseminate Internet routing related information while\nnon routing information
    or private routing data is recommended to be\ncarried by independent transport
    instance BGP.\n\t "

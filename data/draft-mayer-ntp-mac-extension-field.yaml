- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) defines in RFC5905 the\n
    \  optional usage of Message Authentication Code (MAC). The MAC is an\n   optional
    component of the NTP packet at the end of the packet. There\n   can only be one
    MAC segment in the packet but there is no way of\n   knowing if the last data
    segment at the end of an NTP packet is a MAC\n   or an extension field, which
    is also defined in RFC5905. This draft\n   defines a MAC extension field which
    will allow the existing MAC\n   segment to be moved into an extension field and
    have a known length\n   and deprecates the existing MAC.\n\n\t "

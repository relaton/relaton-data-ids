abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol does not support the use\n
    of client public key pairs without X.509 security certificates. This\n document
    circumvents this limitation: an end-entity has access to\n the public domain private
    key of a dummy (or \"explicitly\n meaningless\") Certification Authority (CA),
    and can thus freely\n issue an X.509 security certificate for interoperability
    purposes.\n Given these workaround requirement and solution approach, the\n document
    limits itself to the strict minimal set of standardization\n provisions. This
    supports the orderly cohabitation of auto issued\n certificates and normal TLS
    traffic relying on the full Public Key\n Infrastructure (PKI) model.\n\t "

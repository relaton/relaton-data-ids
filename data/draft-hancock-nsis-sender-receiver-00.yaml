  content: "The NSIS working group is considering protocols for signaling for \nresources
    for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The \nrequirements for such
    signaling are being developed in [2] and a \nframework in [3]. \nIt is clear from
    existing work that there are many interrelated \nissues with NSIS signaling, concerning
    the respective roles of the \ntwo ends of the communication path. These issues
    include route \nfinding, authorisation, state management requirements, localization
    \nof negotiation, and so on. The wide variety of problems involved \nhinders progress
    in deciding what approach NSIS should adopt. This \nInternet Draft attempts to
    provide a summary of these issues and \nsuggests a way of structuring further
    analysis. It is not expected \nthat this document should have a long term existence.\n\t "

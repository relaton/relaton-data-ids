  content: "This document addresses the subject of FEC-based protection of \n   multimedia
    streams. It is proposed to apply re-packetization on the \n   application source
    stream data units in order to get a constant data \n   unit size within each block.
    A reverse packetization operation should \n   also be applied in the receiver
    in order to provide the application \n   consumer with original application data
    units. By avoiding any \n   padding in the process of repair packet production,
    this proposal \n   brings a significant performance enhancement which is evaluated
    by \n   simulation. The proposed re-packetization operations can be used \n   without
    requiring change to the FEC framework. \n\n\t "

  content: "This draft defines a signaling mechanism based on RSVP-TE ([2]) to\nsupport
    an Optical User Network Interface (UNI).  This effort is in\npart driven by work
    in the OIF as well as the recent draft on\nsignaling requirements for the optical
    UNI ([3]), and is consistent\nwith recent work on Generalized MPLS (see [4], [5],
    [6], and [7]). \nThe main function of this draft is to identify the relevant mechanisms\nin
    RSVP-TE (including further extensions) to satisfy functional\nrequirements for
    an Optical UNI.  This draft reflects ongoing work at\nthe Optical Interworking
    Forum (OIF), however, not all of the\nconcepts/requirements have been approved
    by the OIF.\n\t "

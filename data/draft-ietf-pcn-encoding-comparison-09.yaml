abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
    quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. On every
    link in the PCN-domain, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered, and PCN-packets
    are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes
    provide decision points with information about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets that
    allows them to take decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request,
    and to terminate some already admitted flows during serious \\%pre-congestion.
    The PCN working group explored a number of approaches for encoding this pre-congestion
    information into the IP header. This document provides details of those approaches
    along with an explanation of the constraints that apply to any solution. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"

  content: "   Adaptive DNS Discovery is chartered to define mechanisms that allow\n
    \  clients to discover and select encrypted DNS resolvers.  This\n   document
    describes one common use case, namely that of clients that\n   connect to a network
    but where they cannot securely authenticate the\n   identity of that network.
    \ In such cases the client would like to\n   learn which encrypted DNS resolvers
    are designated by that network or\n   by the Do53 resolver offered by that network.
    \ It lists requirements\n   that any proposed discovery mechanisms should seek
    to address.\n\n\t "

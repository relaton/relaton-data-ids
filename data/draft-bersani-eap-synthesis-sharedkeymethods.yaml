  content: "   The purpose of this draft is to gives a broad picture of the existing
    \n   proposed EAP methods, with a focus on shared key EAP methods. Indeed, \n
    \  it is the belief of the author that a standard replacement for EAP-\n   MD5
    (that is deprecated due to security reasons) is needed. By \n   listing the existing
    shared key EAP methods, the goal is to gather \n   consensus that such a multiplication
    of methods is detrimental and \n   that a single methods retaining the best of
    the existing proposals \n   could and should be drafted. \n    \n\t "

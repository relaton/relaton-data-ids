  content: "   Satellite networks present some interesting challenges for packet\n
    \  networking.  The entire topology is continually in motion, with links\n   far
    less reliable than what is common in terrestrial networks.  Some\n   changes to
    link connectivity can be anticipated due to orbital\n   dynamics.\n\n   This document
    proposes a scalable routing architecture for satellite\n   networks based on existing
    routing protocols and mechanisms, enhanced\n   with scheduled link connectivity
    change information.  This document\n   proposes no protocol changes.\n\n   This
    document presents the author's view and is neither the product\n   of the IETF
    nor a consensus view of the community.\n\n\t "

  content: "   NMDA architectural framework eliminates the need to duplicate data\n
    \  structures to provide separate configuration and operational state\n   sections
    and uses different datastores and new protocol operations to\n   distinct configuration
    from operation state.  However when a server\n   needs to support both NMDA client
    and non-NMDA clients, it is not\n   clear whether a NMDA compliant server can
    use existing operation to\n   return the same results with <rpc-reply> as non-NMDA-aware
    server\n   does.\n\n   This document identifies some of the major challenges,
    and provides\n   solutions that are able to mitigate those challenges and smooth
    the\n   migration towards NMDA deployment.\n\n\t "

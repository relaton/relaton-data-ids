  script: Latn
  content: "The ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) protocol is designed
    \nto find the best possible transmission path between two endpoints in \nthe presence
    of intervening NAT (Network Address Translation) boxes. \nIt is a very versatile
    protocol, designed to operate in all possible \nnetwork topologies. This versatility
    occasionally results in a large \nexchange of messages between the two endpoints.
    \n\nThis document proposes a modification which reduces the amount of \nmessaging
    ICE requires, without affecting the effectiveness of ICE.  \nThis modification
    suppresses the transmission of Binding Requests    from server-reflexive candidates.
    \ The result is increased efficiency \ndue to the suppressed connectivity checks,
    leading to fewer overall \nmessages and faster discovery of working paths.   \n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes enhancements to the Segment Routing (SR)\n   Flexible
    Algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework by integrating power\n   consumption metrics into
    routing decisions.  It introduces metrics\n   encompassing both node-level and
    link-level energy consumption\n   attributes and proposes dynamic energy-aware
    path computation.  By\n   incorporating these metrics alongside traditional routing
    parameters,\n   the enhanced Flex-Algo framework can enable networks to optimize\n
    \  routing paths for energy efficiency, and then leverage on advances\n   router
    capabilities to further reduce operational costs as well as\n   supporting sustainability
    objectives.\n\n\t "

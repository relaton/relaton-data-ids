  content: "   There is no standard, interoperable method for associating Internet\n
    \  service identifiers with payment information.  This document\n   specifies
    a means for retrieving information sufficient for a party\n   to render payment
    using various payment networks given the\n   recipient's email address by leveraging
    the DNS to securely publish\n   payment information in a payment association record.
    \ A payment\n   association record associates an Internet service identifier such
    as\n   an email address with payment information such as an account number\n   or
    Bitcoin address.\n\n\t "

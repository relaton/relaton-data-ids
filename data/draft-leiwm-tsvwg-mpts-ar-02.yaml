  content: "   Multipath transport is an important way to improve the efficiency of\n
    \  data delivery. This document defines a multipath transport system\n   framework
    in which application-level relays are deployed to provide\n   the conditions to
    enable multiple paths between source and\n   destination. In the proposed framework,
    endpoints are allowed to use\n   multiple paths, including the default IP path
    and relay paths, to\n   transport data in a single session. A relay path may via
    one or more\n   application-level relays which provide application-level relay\n
    \  services for endpoints. This framework defines three kinds of logical\n   entities
    including user agent, relay server and relay controller.\n   Relay server provides
    relay service for user agents based on a local\n   path-table. Relay controller
    manages relay servers and relay paths.\n   User agent maintains multiple end-to-end
    paths which include a\n   default path and multiple relay paths. The framework
    also defines a\n   relay service control protocol named OpenPath protocol in control\n
    \  plane to manage relay servers and relay paths, and a profile of\n   multipath
    transport protocol suite in data plane to facilitate\n   multipath data transport.
    The multipath transport system framework\n   can support various applications
    including applications requiring\n   timely delivery of real-time data such as
    streaming media, and\n   applications requiring ordered reliable delivery of stream
    of data\n   such as file transfer.\n\n\n\t "

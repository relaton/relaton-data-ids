  content: "BGP (Border gateway Protocol) is a routing protocol, which shares\nthe
    information of its routing table on incremental basis.\nBGP needs to interact
    with the IGP peers within the autonomous\nsystem when all the routers inside the
    autonomous system do not run\nBGP. This document provides a detailed implementation
    of\nsynchronization in BGP.\nThis document specifies some implementation specifics
    of\nsynchronization and also throws some of the pros and cons involved\nin implementing
    synchronization. This also reveals the points to be\ntaken care when transition
    happens from synchronization to No\nsynchronization and vice versa. Some of the
    precautions that are to\nbe taken before implementing synchronization in BGP are
    also\nhighlighted here.\n\t "

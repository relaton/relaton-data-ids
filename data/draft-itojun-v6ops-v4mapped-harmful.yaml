  content: "The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [Hinden, 1998] defines the 'IPv4-mapped\nIPv6
    address.'  These addresses are used in the IPv6 basic API\n[Gilligan, 1999] to
    denote IPv4 addresses using AF_INET6 sockets.  These\naddresses are used in protocol
    proposals such as SIIT [Nordmark, 2000]\nto denote IPv6 communication using AF_INET6
    sockets.  Therefore,\nIPv4-mapped addresses have two different meanings, and they
    are not\ndistinguishable from the user-land applications.\n\nThis draft discusses
    security threats due to this ambiguity of\nIPv4-mapped address.  It also discusses
    threats due to the additional\ncomplexities introduced by IPv4-mapped addresses.
    \ Finally, it proposes\nto resolve these problems by forbidding protocols from
    using IPv4-mapped\naddresses for IPv6 communications.\n\t "

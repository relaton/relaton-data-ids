  content: "There is no requirement for identities asserted by a UA in a SIP\nmessage
    to be anything other than the user's desired alias.\nA Network Asserted Identity
    is an identity initially derived by a SIP\nnetwork intermediary as a result of
    an authentication process.  This\ndraft describes short term requirements for
    the exchange of Network\nAsserted Identities within networks of securely interconnected\ntrusted
    nodes and to User Agents securely connected to such networks.\n\n\n\t "

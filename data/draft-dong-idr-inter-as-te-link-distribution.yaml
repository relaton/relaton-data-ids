  content: "   Protocol extensions to Interial Gataway Protocols (IGPs) have been\n
    \  specified for the flooding of Traffice Engineering (TE) information\n   of
    the Inter-Autonomous System (AS) links into the local AS (RFC 5392\n   and RFC
    5316), in which some information of the inter-AS links needs\n   to be manually
    configured.  This document proposes BGP extensions for\n   dynamic advertisement
    of TE information of Inter-AS links between\n   adjacent ASes.  Such mechanism
    may also be used for the distribution\n   of Inter-AS TE link information to some
    external entities, such as\n   Path Computation Element (PCE).\n\n\n\t "

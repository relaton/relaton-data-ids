  content: "   Recently, there are demands arising for IPv4 address allocation under\n
    \  IPv6 environment, especially in IPv6 transition scenarios.  This\n   document
    describes the mechanism to survive DHCPv4 over IPv6 network.\n   DHCPv4 messages
    are transported in IPv6 packets when traversing the\n   IPv6 network.  DHCPv4
    protocol behavior is extended to support this\n   IPv6 transport.  And for the
    relay case, a new suboption of the Relay\n   Agent Information Option is defined
    to carry the remote IPv6 address\n   of the clients.\n\n\t "

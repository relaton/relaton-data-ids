  content: "   Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves\n
    \  as a tool for other protocols in dealing with Network Address\n   Translator
    (NAT) traversal.  It can be used by an endpoint to\n   determine the IP address
    and port allocated to it by a NAT.  It can\n   also be used to check connectivity
    between two endpoints, and as a\n   keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.
    \ STUN works with many\n   existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior
    from them.\n\n   STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is
    a tool\n   to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes RFC 5389.\n\n\t "

  content: "    Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g.,
    to\n    ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level\n
    \   of congestion along a network path).  While many mechanisms have\n    been
    designed to detect loss, protocols ultimately can only count on\n    the passage
    of time without delivery confirmation to declare a\n    packet \"lost\".  Each
    implementation of a time-based loss detection\n    mechanism represents a balance
    between correctness and timeliness\n    and therefore no implementation suits
    all situations.  This document\n    provides high-level requirements for time-based
    loss detectors\n    appropriate for general use in the Internet.  Within the\n
    \   requirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars\n    that
    best address each situation.\n\n\t "

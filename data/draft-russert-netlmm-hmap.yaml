  content: "   The Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) for Network Localized Mobility\n   Management
    (NETLMM) is a single point of failure for the Localized\n   Mobility Management
    Domain (LMMD) and a focal point for all mobile\n   node (MN) traffic.  These shortcomings
    can be addressed by\n   distributing the MAP function equally among the Access
    Routers (ARs)\n   in the LMMD and deploying hierarchically organized supporting
    nodes\n   in the backhaul network.  This document specifies a Hierarchical MAP\n
    \  (HMAP) and its use in operational delployments that support traffic\n   distribution
    and fault tolerance.  Solutions for both IPv4 and IPv6\n   are given.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Various overlays are used in networks including WAN, enterprise\n   campus
    and others. End to end path are divided into multiple segments\n   some of which
    are overlay encapsulated to achieve better path\n   selection, lower latency and
    so on. Traditional end-to-end transport\n   layer is not very responding to microburst
    and non-congestive packet\n   loss caused by the different characteristics of
    the path segments.\n   With the potential transport enhancement for the existing
    or\n   purposely created overlayed path segment, end to end throughput can\n   be
    improved. This document illustrates the problems in some use cases\n   and tries
    to inspire more about whether and how to solve them by\n   introducing a reliable,
    efficient and non-intrusive transport\n   forwarding over the overlayed path segment(s).\n\n\n\n\t "

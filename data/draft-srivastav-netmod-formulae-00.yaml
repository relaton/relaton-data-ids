abstract:
- content: "<p>Operational data can be divided into multiple categories like i) state
    data, ii) raw performance counter, iii) Derived/calculated Counters by arithmetic
    operation on raw performance counters also referred as KPIs. Existing YANG built-in-types
    only define the way to model the state data and raw performance counters but have
    no provision for modelling derived performance counters representing an equivalent
    of a simple mathematical formula. This document define extensions for the modeling
    language YANG as new language statements, which introduce a method to model KPIs
    aka mathematical expression in YANG data modeling language and describes the syntax
    and semantics of newly added . As KPIs require limited number of mathematical
    operations viz. +, /, -, *,minimum, maximum, summation are needed. Hence, +, /,
    -, *,minimum, maximum, summation are needed. Hence, our proposal is to enhance
    YANG to support formula based nodes for these basic arithmetic operations. YANG
    is enhanced to model KPI formulae with basic arithmetic operations.</p>"

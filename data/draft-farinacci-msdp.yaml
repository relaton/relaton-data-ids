  content: "   This proposal describes a mechanism to connect multiple PIM-SM\n   domains
    together. Each PIM-SM domain uses it's own independent RP(s)\n   and do not have
    to depend on RPs in other domains.\n \n   This proposal is being submitted as
    a method for the initial phase of\n   Inter-Domain Multicast deployment in the
    Internet and may be upward\n   compatible with the IDMR protocols being proposed
    for subsequent\n   phases.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document lays out the problem space of possibly conflicting\n
    \  standards between multiple organizations for URLs and things like\n   them,
    and proposes some actions to resolve the conflicts.  From a\n   user or developer
    point of view, it makes no sense for there to be a\n   proliferation of definitions
    of URL nor for there to be a\n   proliferation of incompatible implementations.
    \ This shouldn't be a\n   competitive feature.  Therefore there is a need for
    the organizations\n   involved to update and reconcile the various Internet Drafts,\n
    \  Recommendations, and Standards in this area.\n\n\t "

  content: "This informational draft presents results of a study on using\ndifferent
    drop precedence assignments to address fairness issues when\nUDP and TCP traffic
    share the same Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB class.\nIn particular, six different
    possible combinations of drop precedence\nassignment were explored with two different
    models of RED parameter\nsettings. We present results showing that the type of
    RED model\nutilized can play a role in the nature of bandwidth sharing between\nTCP
    and UDP flows. The results also show that with the current four\nClass, three
    Drop Precedence AF specification, complete fairness\nbetween TCP and UDP cannot
    be completely achieved using separate drop\nprecedence assignment. This is true
    for both under-provisioned\nnetworks and over-provisioned networks. Certain drop
    precedence\nmapping schemes are beneficial to TCP while others are beneficial
    for\nUDP.\n\n\t "

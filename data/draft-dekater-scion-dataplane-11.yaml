abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Data Plane of SCION (Scalability, Control,
    and Isolation On Next-generation networks), a path-aware, inter-domain network
    architecture. Unlike IP-based forwarding, SCION embeds inter-domain forwarding
    directives in the packet header, enabling endpoints to construct and select end-to-end
    paths from segments discovered by the Control Plane. The role of the Data Plane
    is to combine such segments into end-to-end paths, and to forward data according
    to the specified path. This document describes the SCION packet format, header
    structure, and extension headers. It also describes the cryptographic mechanisms
    used for path authorization, processing at routers including a life of a packet
    example. This document contains new approaches to secure path aware networking.
    It is not an Internet Standard, has not received any formal review of the IETF,
    nor was the work developed through the rough consensus process. The approaches
    offered in this work are offered to the community for its consideration in the
    further evolution of the Internet.</p>"

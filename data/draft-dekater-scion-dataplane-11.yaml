  content: "   This document describes the Data Plane of SCION (Scalability,\n   Control,
    and Isolation On Next-generation networks), a path-aware,\n   inter-domain network
    architecture.\n\n   Unlike IP-based forwarding, SCION embeds inter-domain forwarding\n
    \  directives in the packet header, enabling endpoints to construct and\n   select
    end-to-end paths from segments discovered by the Control\n   Plane.  The role
    of the Data Plane is to combine such segments into\n   end-to-end paths, and to
    forward data according to the specified\n   path.\n\n   This document describes
    the SCION packet format, header structure,\n   and extension headers.  It also
    describes the cryptographic\n   mechanisms used for path authorization, processing
    at routers\n   including a life of a packet example.\n\n   This document contains
    new approaches to secure path aware\n   networking.  It is not an Internet Standard,
    has not received any\n   formal review of the IETF, nor was the work developed
    through the\n   rough consensus process.  The approaches offered in this work
    are\n   offered to the community for its consideration in the further\n   evolution
    of the Internet.\n\n\t "

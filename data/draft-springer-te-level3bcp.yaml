  content: "This paper discusses Traffic Engineering with Multi-Protocol\nLabel Switching
    in the Level3 network. A brief overview of traffic\nengineering is given followed
    by constraints affecting Level3's\ndesign. The approach Level3 will use, which
    is LDP edge and an RSVP-TE\ncore, is presented. Several architectures were considered
    when\ndeciding upon a design. These methods are discussed as well as the\nreasons
    they were ultimately refuted.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a mechanism for authentication of \nthe source
    of a stream of Real-Time Transport Protocol \n(RTP) packets.  The mechanism provides
    sender-specific \nauthentication, non-repudiation, and replay protection \nservices
    for both unicast and multicast RTP streams.  This \nmechanism is based upon the
    stream signing scheme of Wong \nand Lam [WL].  These authentication services extend
    the RTP\nprofile for audio and video conferences with minimal control \n[Schulzrinne96,
    Schulzrinne99].  Authentication covers all\nRTP payload types, and may be applied
    in conjunction with \nthe RTP confidentiality service.  Key management and \nnegotiation
    of the authentication mechanism parameters are\nnot addressed in this document.\n\t "

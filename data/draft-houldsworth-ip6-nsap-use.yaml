  content: "This document defines a proposed replacement for the recommendation in
    draft-carpenter-ip6-nsap-map-00.txt for mapping OSI NSAP addresses into IPv6.
    \             It carries existing NSAP addresses transparently (without any conversion)
    and conveys any additional bytes which cannot be accommodated in the basic 16
    byte IPv6 address space in an optional Hop by Hop extension header.  It can thus
    support all existing NSAP address schemes which have been defined by The ISO and
    The ITU-T, including those which utilise the full 20 byte maximum address length,
    and allows existing NSAP address schemes which have been deployed globally to
    be retained intact.     It can also be extended to cover other addressing schemes,
    such as IPX.\n\t "

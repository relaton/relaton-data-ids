  content: "The motivation for this memo stems from a need not to inundate the \nmailboxes
    of recipients with attachments, when all they need is a \nnotification  with the
    details of the attachment and the list of \nrecipients that the attachment was
    sent to. Also, the recipients of \nthe attachment would in their email copy get
    the details of list of \nnotified recipients. A use case would be where Joe sends
    an email \nwith an attachment to Bill, and Bill in turn adds some comments to
    \nthe body of the message, and has to send it to Bob and Joe with the \nattachment,
    In this case, Joe ends up having two emails with the same \nattachment.\n  \nThis
    memo provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming to the\n[RFC 2822] ('Internet
    Message Format') specification can convey extra\ninformation.  It specifies a
    new set of 'Attachment-Notification' \nheaders, optional and valid for any [RFC
    2822] entity ('message' or \n'body part'). \n\nThis document is intended as an
    extension to [RFC 2822]. As such, the\nreader is assumed to be familiar with [RFC
    2822] and [RFC 1521]. The\ninformation presented herein supplements but does not
    replace that\nfound in those documents.\n\t "

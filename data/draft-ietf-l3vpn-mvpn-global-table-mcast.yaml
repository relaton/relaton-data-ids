  content: "   RFC6513, RFC6514, and other RFCs describe protocols and procedures\n
    \  which a Service Provider (SP) may deploy in order offer Multicast\n   Virtual
    Private Network (Multicast VPN or MVPN) service to its\n   customers.  Some of
    these procedures use BGP to distribute VPN-\n   specific multicast routing information
    across a backbone network.\n   With a small number of relatively minor modifications,
    the very same\n   BGP procedures can also be used to distribute multicast routing\n
    \  information that is not specific to any VPN.  Multicast that is\n   outside
    the context of a VPN is known as \"Global Table Multicast\", or\n   sometimes
    simply as \"Internet multicast\".  In this document, we\n   describe the modifications
    that are needed to use the MVPN BGP\n   procedures for Global Table Multicast.\n\n\n\t "

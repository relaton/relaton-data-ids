  content: "   DKIM (RFC6376 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376)) is an IETF\n   standard
    for the cryptographic protocol to authenticate email at the\n   domain level and
    protect the integrity of messages during transit.\n   Section 8.6 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6376.html#section-8.6)\n
    \  defines a vulnerability called DKIM Replay as a spam message sent\n   through
    a SMTP MTA DKIM signer, that then is sent to many more\n   recipients, leveraging
    the reputation of the signer.  We propose two\n   Replay Resistant cryptographic
    domain based protocols that leverage\n   ARC (RFC8617 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8617.html)).
    \ The\n   first technique discloses all SMTP recipients as signed RFC822\n   headers
    by the sender which allows a receiver to verify this.  The\n   second technique
    defines a SMTP extension that allows both the sender\n   and receiver to participate
    in signing the message signature.  It\n   includes a path building technique that
    accurately defines the SMTP\n   forwarding path of the message.  Both techniques
    permit a receiver to\n   detect DKIM and ARC replay.\n\n\t "

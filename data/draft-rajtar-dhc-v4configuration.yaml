  content: "   As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are\n   taking
    the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual-\n   stack functionality
    for IPv4.  However, access to IPv4 based services\n   is still an ongoing requirement
    and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6\n   softwire tunnels are being developed to
    meet this need.\n\n   In order to provision end-user's hosts with the necessary
    IPv4\n   configuration, a number of different mechanisms have been proposed.\n
    \  This memo discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each, with the aim\n   of
    recommending a single approach as the basis for future work.\n\n\n\t "

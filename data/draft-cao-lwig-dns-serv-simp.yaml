  content: "   This memo discusses a lightweight service simplification method via\n
    \  DNS.  Instead of storing the information on the Web infrastructure,\n   the
    service provider can store them on the DNS servers.  By\n   expressing these information
    in the DNS Resource Records, the\n   requester can get these information directly
    during the DNS name\n   resolution, without the need of accessing any web resource.
    \ This way\n   eliminates the overhead caused by TCP handshake and HTTP get/\n
    \  response, and can be served as a lightweight information provisioning\n   method.\n\n\t "

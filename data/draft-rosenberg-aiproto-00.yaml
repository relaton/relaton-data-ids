abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a protocol that facilitates integration of tools
    into the design and run-time operations of AI Agents. The focus is on enterprise
    AI agents that need to make use of APIs exposed by third party providers. This
    protocol, called the Normalized API for AI Agents Calling Tools (N-ACT) - pronounced
    like "enact" - defines an OpenAI spec that has two principle features - enumeration
    of tools and invocation of tools. The enumeration API enables a human - the AI
    Agent designer employed by the enterprise - to select and include tools from third-party
    vendors into operating procedures (also known as skills or instructions) which
    direct the behavior of AI Agents, including how and when to invoke those tools.
    The enumeration API can also be used (optionally) at run-time for the LLM to obtain
    tool descriptions. The second feature of the API - invocation - allows the AI
    Agent executor to perform the inter-domain invocation of the tool at run time.
    By standardizing these two API functions, the time and cost of integration of
    Internet APIs into AI Agents can be reduced.</p>

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This is a position paper.  It documents the author's personal views\n
    \  on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated\n   in
    ICN protocols like CCNx or NDN which employ flow-balanced\n   Interest/Data exchanges
    and hop-by-hop forwarding state as their\n   fundamental machinery.  It argues
    that such protocols demand a\n   substantially different approach to QoS from
    that taken in TCP/IP,\n   and proposes specific design patterns to achieve both
    classification\n   and differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate
    basis.\n   It also considers the effect of caches in addition to memory, CPU and\n
    \  link bandwidth as a resource that should be subject to explicitly\n   unfair
    resource allocation.  The proposed methods are intended to\n   operate purely
    at the network layer, providing the primitives needed\n   to achieve both transport
    and higher layer QoS objectives.  It\n   explicitly excludes any discussion of
    Quality of Experience (QoE)\n   which can only be assessed and controlled at the
    application layer or\n   above.\n\n   This document is not a product of the IRTF
    Information-Centric\n   Networking Research Group (ICNRG) but has been through
    formal last\n   call and has the support of the participants in the research group\n
    \  for publication as an individual submission.\n\n\t "

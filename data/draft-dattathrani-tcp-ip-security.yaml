  content: "The security problems in the internet are due to inherent problems in\nthe
    TCP/IP stack. The purpose of this draft is to brief on some of \nthe measures
    to prevent security attacks in TCP/IP network, by \nchanging some of the ways
    in which the TCP/IP protocol stack works. \nThe security attacks which are addressed
    in this draft are:\n1) ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing and MAC address
    cloning\n2) TCP Initial sequence number prediction\nThis version offers backward
    compatibility with cards that do not \nsupport the security features mentioned
    in this draft. In view of \nthis, changes have been made to section 2.3 and a
    new section \n(Section 2.4) has been added.\n\n\t "

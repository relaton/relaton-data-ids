  content: "This document describes a mechanism whereby,  in  response  to  a  AAA\nrequest,
    a AAA server may refer a client to another server, which will\nthen directly handle
    requests from that client.  This is  in  contrast\nto  a  proxy  mechanism, where
    one AAA server acts as an intermediary,\ncommunicating with another AAA server
    on behalf of the AAA client.  An\nimplementation  of  this  mechanism  for  Dial
    Access AAA is presented\nusing the RADIUS protocol.\n\t "

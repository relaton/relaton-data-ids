  content: "The pseudowire switching [6] draft describes how a Pseudowire can \nspan
    across multiple PSN domains. This multi-segment PW (MS-PW) \nthreads through one
    or more PEs that are not the endpoints of the PW \nand are called switching PE
    (S-PE). The switching PE at each hop is \nconfigured a-priori with two single
    hops PW information that enables \nit to conduct splicing between the two. The
    configuration of such \ninformation at each S-PE for possibly thousands of MS-PWs
    is \ncumbersome. We describe a mechanism whereby a S-PE can identify and \nprocess
    the PW control signaling with the information present in the \nsignaling message
    in a manner that eliminates the requirement to \nconfigure PW splicing information.
    In this mechanism source PE \ninserts information about the destination PE and
    the PW endpoint that \nis recognized by the receiving PE to identify his role
    as a switching \nPE and engage in propagating the PW signal towards the destination
    \nPE.\n\t "

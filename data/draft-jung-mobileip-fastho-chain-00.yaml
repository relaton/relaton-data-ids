  content: "Mobile IP allows a mobile node to send and receive packets \nregardless
    of the IP address of its current point of attachment in \nthe Internet. Several
    handover protocol using Layer 2 information \nhas proposed for fast handover.
    We propose a modification of the \nfast handover protocol with simple Layer 2
    triggers. For successive \nhandovers of a Mobile Node on real-time service, a
    chain tunneling \nhandover is proposed. For effective operation of the chain,
    the \nchain length threshold is adopted to prevent packet delay due to \nthe successive
    handovers. Tunnel negotiation is employed to adopt \nthe local resource and security
    conditions and management policies.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document creates a registry for describing the types of services\n
    \  available at a specific location.  The registry is expected to be\n   referenced
    by other protocols that need a common set of service terms\n   as protocol constants.
    \ In particular, we define location-based\n   service as either a point at a specific
    geographic location (e.g.,\n   bus stop) or a service covering a specific region
    (e.g., pizza\n   delivery).\n\n\t "

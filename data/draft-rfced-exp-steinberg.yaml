  content: "   Currently, Internet SMTP transport does not allow the sender to know\n
    \  if the recipient receive or open a mail message. This limitation\n   frequently
    causes one question: did my message really arrive? This\n   proposes a simple
    solution, that could be easy implemented in the\n   mail software.\n\t "

  content: "   RFC 2181 is an amalgamation of eight independent components that were\n
    \  lumped together into a single document, ostensibly because none were of\n   enough
    interest to create a standalone reference for each idea.  After\n   nearly two
    decades, and a number of RFCs that update portions of RFC 2181,\n   it seems reasonable
    to move RFC 2181 to historic status and focus on each\n   idea independentally.
    \ This document introduces eight standalone docuements,\n   one for each of the
    ideas collected in RFC 2181 and allows for examination\n   of each idea independently.
    \  In doing so, this document moves RFC 2181\n   to historic status.\n\n\t "

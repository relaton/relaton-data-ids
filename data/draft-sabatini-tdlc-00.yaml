  content: "   This paper describes an extremely efficient and reliable real-time\n
    \  \"Selective Repeat\" protocol that was implemented as the backbone\n   transmission
    protocol for the largest financial information network\n   in the United States
    during the 1980's and 1990's.  The protocol is\n   capable of working efficiently
    in all environments including those\n   with substantial delay and high error
    or congestion rates,\n   transmitting optimally down to the point that there is
    one error per\n   block, never resending a block that has been received correctly
    and\n   always sending the blocks in an order which is optimal for\n   expeditious
    delivery.  This protocol represents a new way of looking\n   at \"Selective Repeat\"
    protocols and the concepts it introduces have\n   wide applicability in other
    protocols.  It works equally well in\n   point to multi-point environments as
    it does point to point ones.  It\n   has been used as both a link level and a
    transport level protocol.\n\n\t "

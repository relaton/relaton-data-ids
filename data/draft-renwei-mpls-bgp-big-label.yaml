  content: "   When BGP is used to distribute a particular route, it can also be\n
    \  used to distribute an MPLS label which is mapped to that route.  In\n   some
    cases, for example, when L3VPN is used to access and connect to\n   virtual networks
    in data centers, there may be 16 millions of VPN\n   instances on a router.  In
    order to map MPLS labels to VPN instances,\n   big labels are required.  This
    document specifies the method to carry\n   and distribute such big labels by piggybacking
    the big label mapping\n   information for an IP route in the BGP Update message
    that is used to\n   distribute the route itself.\n\n\t "

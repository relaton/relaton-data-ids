  content: "   TrustChain is a protocol for a networked datastructure, designed to\n
    \  act as a trust ledger.  This protocol acts as a decentral alternative\n   to
    platforms like eBay, Airbnb, and Uber.  It is specifically\n   designed to record
    transactions among strangers without central\n   control, support high transaction
    volumes, be application neutral,\n   and avoid vendor lock-in.  The protocol defines
    recording\n   transactions in an ordered list using an append-only datastructure,
    a\n   new communication overlay, and a horizontally scalable consensus\n   protocol
    based on checkpoint consensus, called CHECO.  Trustchain has\n   resistance to
    traditional blockchain attacks, such as the 51 percent\n   majority attack.  This
    is achieved by using a graph-based append-only\n   datastructure combined with
    a personal blockchain for each\n   participant with their own genesis block.\n\n\t "

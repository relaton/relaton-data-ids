  content: "This memo proposes an AAA architecture that would incorporate a\ngeneric
    AAA server along with an application interface to a set of\nApplication Specific
    Modules that could perform application specific\nAAA functions.  A separation
    of AAA functions required in a multi-\ndomain environment is then proposed using
    a layered protocol\nabstraction.  The long term goal is to create a generic framework\nwhich
    allows complex authorizations to be realized through a network\nof interconnected
    AAA servers.\n\t "

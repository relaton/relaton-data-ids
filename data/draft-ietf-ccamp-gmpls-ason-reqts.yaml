  content: "The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of protocols
    has been defined to control different switching technologies and different applications.
    These include support for requesting Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) connections,
    including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)
    and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).\n\n This document concentrates on the signaling
    aspects of the GMPLS suite of protocols. It identifies the features to be covered
    by the GMPLS signaling protocol to support the capabilities of an Automatically
    Switched Optical Network (ASON). This document provides a problem statement and
    additional requirements for the GMPLS signaling protocol to support the ASON functionality.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes a scheme that allows a mobile node to register a\nprimary
    care-of address(CoA) as well as one or more non-primary CoAs\nby sending a single
    binding update message to the home agent and/or\ncorrespondent node. This is achieved
    by using two new mobility\noptions defined in this draft. Mobile nodes that perform
    duplicate\naddress detection procedure, such as Advance DAD and Optimistic DAD\ncan
    benefit from this scheme. Proposed scheme does not require to\nexchange CoTI and
    CoT messages, usually required for the registration\nof each of the non-primary
    CoA(s). It also does not require to\nmaintain binding management key for each
    of the non-primary CoA(s).\nThus the proposed scheme reduces the signaling and
    processing\noverhead in Mobile IPv6 networks.\n\t "

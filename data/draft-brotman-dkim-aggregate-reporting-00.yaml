  content: "   This document introduces a mechanism enabling DKIM-signing domain\n
    \  owners to solicit comprehensive aggregate reports from email\n   receivers.
    \ Presented in an XML format, these reports possess\n   adaptable elements conducive
    for integration with current and future\n   drafts and standards like DMARCbis.
    \ They capture the evaluation\n   outcomes of DKIM signatures, such as 'pass'
    or 'fail', alongside\n   other potential data attributes.  Receivers can relay
    these aggregate\n   reports to destinations designated by the DKIM-signing domain
    holder,\n   contingent upon their support capabilities.\n\n\t "

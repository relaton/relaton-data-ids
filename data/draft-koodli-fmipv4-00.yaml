  script: Latn
  content: "   The Mobile IPv6 fast handover document [2] specifies a protocol to\n
    \  improve latency and packet loss resulting from Mobile IPv6 handover\n   operations.
    \ This document adapts the protocol for IPv4 networks\n   to improve performance
    over Mobile IPv4 operations, including\n   processing of Agent Advertisements,
    new Care of Address acquisition\n   and Registration Request and Reply.  However,
    Foreign Agent operation\n   at a router is not necessary.  Also, the protocol
    may be used\n   transparently on hosts which do not support Mobile IP, but with\n
    \  limited movement across subnets.\n\n   Using the concepts outlined in [2],
    this document also addresses\n   movement detection, IP address configuration
    and location update\n   latencies.  For reducing the IP address configuration,
    the draft\n   provides two alternatives.  First, the new CoA is always made to
    be\n   the new access router's IP address.  Second, a hash algorithm is used\n
    \  to produce a new CoA, and any conflicts are resolved so as not to\n   cause
    traffic misdirection.\n\t "

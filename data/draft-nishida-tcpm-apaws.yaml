  content: "   This documents describe a technique called A-PAWS which can provide\n
    \  protection against old duplicates segments like PAWS.  While PAWS\n   requires
    TCP to set timestamp options in all segments in a TCP\n   connection, A-PAWS supports
    the same feature without using\n   timestamps.  A-PAWS is designed to be used
    complementary with PAWS.\n   TCP needs to use PAWS when it is necessary and activates
    A-PAWS only\n   when it is safe to use.  Without impairing the reliability and
    the\n   robustness of TCP, A-PAWS can provide more option space to other TCP\n
    \  extensions.\n\n\t "

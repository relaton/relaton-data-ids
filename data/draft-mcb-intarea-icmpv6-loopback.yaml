  content: "   This document defines ICMPv6 Loopback, which enables a two-way packet\n
    \  exchange that can be used for probing and for diagnostic purposes.\n   ICMPv6
    Loopback is similar to ICMPv6 Echo, except that after a\n   Loopback Request is
    sent, its corresponding Reply includes as much of\n   the IPv6 Loopback Request
    packet as possible, including the IPv6\n   header and IPv6 extension headers and
    options if they are present.\n\n\t "

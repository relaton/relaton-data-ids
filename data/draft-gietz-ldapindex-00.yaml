  content: "This document describes the overall concept of a distributed \nindexing
    system based on the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP)\n[1], as it will be implemented
    in the EC co-funded \nDESIRE II project and afterwards maintained as a service
    by \nthe European academia. Although the system is designed for \nmulti-purpose
    usage, the main focus of this document lies on \nits application as a LDAPv3 [2]
    Directory white pages \nindex, although the system is designed to be applicable
    to \nother indexing problems as well. \n\n\t "

  content: "Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a technique for maintaining QoS\nfor
    inelastic flows in a DIFFServ domain.  The PCN architecture\nrequires that egress
    nodes send regular reports of PCN-defined\nmeasurements to a decision point.  It
    requires further that the\ndecision point occasionally be able to request certain
    measurements\nfrom ingress nodes.  The decision point can be located in different\nplaces
    in the network.  This memo defines a Diameter application to\nsupport communications
    between the ingress and egress nodes and a\nDiameter server acting as a PCN decision
    point.\n\t "

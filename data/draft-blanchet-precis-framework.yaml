  script: Latn
  content: "   Application protocols that make use of Unicode code points in\n   protocol
    strings need to prepare such strings in order to perform\n   comparison operations
    (e.g., for purposes of authentication or\n   authorization).  In general, this
    problem has been labeled the\n   \"preparation and comparison of internationalized
    strings\" or\n   \"PRECIS\".  This document defines a framework that enables application\n
    \  protocols to prepare various classes of strings in a way that depends\n   on
    the properties of Unicode code points.  Because this framework\n   does not depend
    on large tables of Unicode code points as in\n   stringprep (RFC 3454), it is
    more agile with regard to changes in the\n   underlying Unicode database and thus
    provides improved flexibility to\n   application protocols.  A specification that
    uses this framework\n   either can directly use the base string classes defined
    in this\n   document or can subclass the base string classes as needed.  This\n
    \  framework uses an approach similar to that of the revised\n   internationalized
    domain names in applications (IDNA) technology (RFC\n   5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892,
    RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and thus adheres to the\n   high-level design goals described
    in RFC 4690, albeit for application\n   technologies other than the Domain Name
    System (DNS).  This document\n   obsoletes RFC 3454.\n\n\t "

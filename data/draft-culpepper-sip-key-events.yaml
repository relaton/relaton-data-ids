  content: "This document defines a protocol independent message format for \nrequesting
    and reporting state related to keys or buttons.  The \ndocument also defines a
    SIP Event Package to make use of this \nextensible framework through the SIP SUBSCRIBE
    & NOTIFY messages. \nThe draft currently defines key event sub-packages to represent
    the \nstate of telephone dial pads, feature buttons found on many \ncommercial
    telephones, standard keyboards as well as support for \nuser or device specific
    buttons (for instance, a 'Double Latte' \nbutton).  The event package and associated
    key packages can be used \nto enable new SIP services where an application or
    SIP entity \nrequires notification of user interface activity either associated
    \nwith a particular SIP session or simply in relation to the device \nitself.
    \n\n\t "

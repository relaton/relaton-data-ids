abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Protection methods for RSVP-TE P2MP LSP have been described in [TE-\nFRR]([RFC4090])
    and [P2MP-TE-Bypass], but there are no solutions to \nprotect an RSVP-TE P2MP
    head node. This document discusses the \nscenario for RSVP-TE P2MP LSP head node
    failure protection and \ndescribes the protection procedures. RSVP-TE extensions
    for such \nprotection are also described. \n\nTo protect the head node, a backup
    head node is appointed which \nforwards traffic to downstream LSRs of the LSP
    when the protected \nhead node fails. The backup head node is not on the path
    of protected \nLSP. Similar to [TE-FRR] there are two methods that can apply:
    one-\n \n \n to-one backup and facility backup. Only one-to-one backup is \ndescribed
    in detail here, facility backup will be discussed in a \nfuture version of this
    draft. \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC 2119.\n\t "

  content: "   In order to provide a means of proving ownership of telephone numbers\n
    \  on the Internet, some kind of public structure needs to exist that\n   binds
    cryptographic keys to authority over telephone numbers.  This\n   document describes
    a certificate-based credential system for\n   telephone numbers, which could be
    used as a part of a broader\n   architecture for managing telephone numbers as
    identities in\n   protocols like SIP.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object\nclasses
    defined by the ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T committees in the \nIS0/IEC 9594 and  X.500
    documents, in particular those intended for \nuse by directory clients.  This
    is the most widely used schema for \nLDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema
    definitions for white \npages objects use it as a basis.  This document does not
    cover \nattributes used for the administration of X.500 directory servers, \nnor
    does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.\n\t "

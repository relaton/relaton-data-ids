  content: "This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport\nLayer
    Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols that use\nElliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone
    (ECQV) certificates to authenticate an\nElliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV)
    exchange.  These cipher\nsuites provide forward secrecy.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis

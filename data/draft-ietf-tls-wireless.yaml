  content: "This document suggests extensions to TLS designed to make TLS more \namenable
    to use within wireless environments. The extensions may be\nused by TLS clients
    and servers. The extensions are backwards\ncompatible - communication is possible
    between TLS 1.0 clients\nthat support the extensions and TLS 1.0 servers that
    do not\nsupport the extensions, and vice versa.\n\n\t "

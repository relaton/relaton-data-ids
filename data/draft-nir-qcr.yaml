  content: "This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol that\nallows
    for faster crash recovery using a saved token method.\n\nWhen an IPsec tunnel
    between two IKEv2 implementations is\ndisconnected due to a restart of one peer,
    it can take as much as\nseveral minutes to recover.  In this text we propose an
    extension to\nthe protocol, that allows for recovery within a few seconds of the\nreboot.\n\t "

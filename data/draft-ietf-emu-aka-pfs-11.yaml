  content: "   Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations\n
    \  associated with pervasive surveillance.  Some of the reported attacks\n   involved
    compromising the smart card supply chain, such as attacking\n   Universal Subscriber
    Identity Module (USIM) card manufacturers and\n   operators in an effort to compromise
    long-term keys stored on these\n   cards.  Since the publication of those reports,
    manufacturing and\n   provisioning processes have received much scrutiny and have
    improved.\n   However, resourceful attackers are always a cause for concern.\n
    \  Always assuming a breach, such as long-term key compromise, and\n   minimizing
    the impact of breach are essential zero trust principles.\n\n   This document
    updates RFC 9048, the improved Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol Method for
    3GPP Mobile Network Authentication\n   and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA'), with an optional
    extension providing\n   ephemeral key exchange.  Similarly, this document also
    updates the\n   earlier version of the EAP-AKA' specification in RFC 5448.  The\n
    \  extension EAP-AKA' Forward Secrecy (EAP-AKA' FS), when negotiated,\n   provides
    forward secrecy for the session keys generated as a part of\n   the authentication
    run in EAP-AKA'.  This prevents an attacker who\n   has gained access to the long-term
    key from obtaining session keys\n   established in the past, assuming these have
    been properly deleted.\n   In addition, EAP-AKA' FS mitigates passive attacks
    (e.g., large scale\n   pervasive monitoring) against future sessions.  This forces
    attackers\n   to use active attacks instead.\n\n\t "

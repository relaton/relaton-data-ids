  content: "   Current standardization effort on the evolution of the mobile\n   communication
    system reconsiders the mobile data plane protocol.  The\n   IETF DMM Working Group
    has work that proposes and analyzes various\n   protocols as alternative to the
    GPRS Tunneling Protocol for User\n   Plane (GTP-U) for an overlay deployment in
    between the mobile\n   device's assigned data plane anchor and its current radio
    base\n   station, which are denoted as N9 and N3 interfaces.  In the view of\n
    \  some future deployment and the original intent per the very early DMM\n   WG
    charter, a mobile device's data plane anchor may be highly\n   distributed and
    re-selected for optimization throughout a mobile\n   device's communication with
    one or more correspondent services.  Such\n   re-configuration has impact on the
    packet routing in between the\n   mobile device's data plane anchor and the one
    or multiple data\n   networks hosting the services, which is denoted as N6 interface.\n
    \  This draft proposes and discusses a solution to control, setup and\n   maintain
    traffic treatment policy on the cellular communication\n   system's N6 interface
    while taking the UE's PDU session settings per\n   the cellular system's control
    plane, such as QoS and locator\n   information, into account.\n\n\t "

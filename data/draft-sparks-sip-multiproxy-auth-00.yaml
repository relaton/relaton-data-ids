  content: "SIP/2.0 as specified in RFC2543 provides a mechanism for a proxy\ninvolved
    in a SIP transaction to authenticate the originator of the\nrequest. Unfortunately,
    this mechanism is not well defined when more\nthan one proxy in a request’s path
    desires such authentication. This\ndraft proposes a mechanism that would allow
    authentication in that\nscenario to work as expected. Under this proposal, SIP
    clients would\nissue requests with multiple Proxy-Authorization headers, one for\neach
    challenge it has seen in the lifetime of a given call leg.\nAuthenticating SIP
    proxies would search each request for a Proxy-\nAuthorization response to its
    own challenge, passing any others\ndownstream unaltered.\n\t "

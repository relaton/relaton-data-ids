  content: "This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label \nSwitching
    (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched optical \nnetworks (WSON).
    \ Such extensions are necessary in WSONs under a number \nof conditions including:
    (a) when optional processing, such as \nregeneration, must be configured to occur
    at specific nodes along a \npath, (b) where equipment must be configured to accept
    an optical signal \nwith specific attributes, or (c) where equipment must be configured
    to \noutput an optical signal with specific attributes. In addition this memo
    \nprovides mechanisms to support distributed wavelength assignment with \nbidirectional
    LSPs, and choice in distributed wavelength assignment \nalgorithms. These extensions
    build on previous work for the control of \nlambda and G.709 based networks.\n\t "

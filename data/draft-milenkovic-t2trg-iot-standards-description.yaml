  content: "   Implementation of IoT systems imposes a requirement of M2M semantic\n
    \  interoperability.  This problem is addressed by a number of ongoing\n   attempts
    to define and standardize IoT information and data models.\n   At present this
    work is fragmented across several standards with\n   different approaches, scope,
    objectives, terminology, and assumptions\n   that makes them difficult to understand
    and compare.  This document\n   is part of the effort to alleviate that problem
    by means of more\n   streamlined presentations and descriptions.\n\n   We are
    advocating for clear articulation of the intent and implicit\n   or explicit assumptions
    in SDO specifications using the common\n   terminology.  Such clarifications would
    aid IoT practitioners and\n   potential adopters to make meaningful comparisons
    and facilitate\n   selection of IoT specifications that are the best fit for their\n
    \  intended purpose.  To that end, we propose that creators of IoT\n   standards
    address a list of questions that would characterize their\n   work in comparable
    ways, somewhat akin to the intent of nutrition\n   labels for food.\n\n   This
    paper describes the basic design principles and practices of IoT\n   information
    and data model definitions, and proposes an initial list\n   of questions that
    SDOs may address to facilitate understanding and\n   comparisons.  Our intent
    is to evolve and refine this list over time\n   by actively soliciting and incorporating
    feedback and suggestions of\n   IoT community.\n\n\t "

  content: "In the connected MANET, the MANET Border Router (MBR) is used to\nconnect
    the MANET with the external network and MANET nodes are \nrequired to know the
    MBR address to communicate with hosts in the \nexternal network. One way of acquiring
    the MBR address is to use the \nRouter Advertisement (RA) and the Router Solicitation
    (RS) messages.\nIn order to allow RA/RS messages to be delivered in the multi-hop\nMANET,
    the modified RA/RS message has been defined [4]. However, \nthis approach may
    incur the duplicate packet reception problem due \nto rebroadcasting of received
    RA/RS messages to its neighbors.\nIn this draft, we define the scope-extended
    Router Advertisement/\nSolicitation message for announcing/solicitating the MBR
    address in\nthe connected MANET. In the scope-extended RA/RS message, a new \nmessage
    field, the sequence number field, is defined so that \nduplicate RA/RS messages
    can be detected based on the sequence \nnumber and the MBR address included in
    the message.\n\t "

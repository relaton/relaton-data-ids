  content: "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been extended
    with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request information about
    DHCPv6 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to queries for individual bindings.
    \ In some situations individual binding queries may not be efficient, or even
    possible.  This document expands on the Leasequery protocol, adding new query
    types and allowing for bulk transfer of DHCPv6 binding data via TCP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

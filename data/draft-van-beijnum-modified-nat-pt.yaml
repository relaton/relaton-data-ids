  content: "A smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires that either all hosts\nare
    upgraded to dual stack before the first hosts can become IPv6-\nonly, or that
    there be some mechanism for IPv6-only hosts to talk to\nIPv4-only hosts.  Expecting
    the former within a reasonable timeframe\nisn't realistic, based on current adoption
    of dual stack combined\nwith the latest projections for the IPv4 depletion that
    point to a\ndate early in the next decade.  And the IETF has recently deprecated\nthe
    main mechanism that allows the latter: NAT-PT.\nThis document proposes modifications
    to NAT-PT that address the\nreasons why the mechanism was deprecated.  This should
    allow future\ndeployment of the modified NAT-PT as an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition\nmechanism,
    giving operators the option of running their networks\nlargely IPv6-only.\n\t "

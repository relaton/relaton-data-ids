  content: "The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [NHRP] specifies a mechanism
    that allows a station (e.g., a host or a router) on an NBMA subnetwork to find
    the NBMA subnetwork address of a destination station when the destination station
    is connected to the NBMA subnetwork. For the case where the destination station
    is off the NBMA subnetwork the mechanism described in [NHRP] allows to determine
    the NBMA subnetwork address of an egress router from the NBMA subnetwork that
    is ``nearest'' to the destination station.  However, [NHRP] constrains the ability
    of determining the egress router to the destinations that are directly connected
    to the egress router.                                            This document
    describes extensions to the NHRP that allow a station to acquire and maintain
    the information about the egress router without constraining the destination(s)
    to be directly connected to the egress router.\n\t "

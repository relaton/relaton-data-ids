abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to provide source address validation
    for IPv6 networks using a shared key (Skey) signature approach. The basic idea
    is that a device generates a signature using a shared key and its IP address and
    then the signature is sent to a validating device for source address validation.
    The proposed mechanism is intended to complement ingress filtering techniques
    with a finer granularity on the control of the source addresses used.</p>"

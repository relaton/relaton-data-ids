  content: "This document describes the usage of the IP Flow Information \n    Export
    (IPFIX) protocol for the case of exporting and processing \n    per-packet information
    by means of IPFIX.  \n    The main idea is to export two types of records per
    flow: one \n    type that consists of the usual flow information plus a unique
    \n    flow identifier; and a second type of record that consists of \n    the
    actual per-packet information plus a flow identifier that \n    refers to the
    flow the specific packet belongs to -- that means \n    the flow identifier is
    used to associate the packet data to its \n    corresponding flow.\n\t "

  content: "   With the deployment of 5G networks, cloud-based interactive services\n
    \  such as cloud gaming have gained substantial attention.  To ensure\n   users'
    quality of experience (QoE), a cloud interactive service may\n   require not only
    high bandwidth (e.g., high-resolution media\n   transmission) but also low delay
    (e.g., low latency and low lagging).\n   However, the quality perceived by a user
    with mobile and wireless\n   device may vary, as a function of many factors, and
    unhandled changes\n   can substantially compromise the user's QoE.  In this document,
    we\n   investigate network-aware applications (NAA), which realize cloud-\n   based
    interactive services with improved QoE, by efficient\n   utilization of a solution
    named Mobile and Wireless Information\n   Exposure (MoWIE).  In particular, this
    document demonstrates, through\n   realistic evaluations, that mobile network
    information such as MCS\n   (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can effectively expose
    the dynamicity\n   of the underlying network and can be made available to applications\n
    \  through MoWIE; using such an information, the applications can then\n   adapt
    key control knobs such as media codec schemes, encapsulation,\n   and application
    layer processing to minimize QoE distortion.  Based\n   on the evaluations, we
    discuss how the MoWIE features can define\n   extensions of the ALTO protocol,
    to expose more lower-layer and finer\n   grain network dynamics.\n\n\t "

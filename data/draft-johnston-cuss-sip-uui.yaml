  content: "There is a need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User\nInformation
    (UUI) data during session establishment.  This\ninformation, known as call control
    UUI, is a small piece of data\ninserted by an application initiating the session,
    and utilized by an\napplication accepting the session.  This data is opaque to
    SIP and\nits function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  Several\napproaches
    to transporting call control UUI in SIP have been\nproposed.  As networks move
    to SIP it is important that applications\nrequiring this data can continue to
    function in SIP networks as well\nas the ability to interwork with this ISDN service
    for end-to-end\ntransparency.  This document discusses three mechanisms to meet
    the\nrequirements defined in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI\ndocument.
    \ A new SIP header field which bests meets these\nrequirements is proposed.\n\t "

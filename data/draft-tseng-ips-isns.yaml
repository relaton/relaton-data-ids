  content: "The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) provides a generic\nframework
    for configuring and managing various storage entities and\ntheir usage attributes
    in an IP-based storage network.  iSNS\nintegrates Fibre Channel name server and
    DNS mechanisms into a\ncommon naming and resource-discovery framework.  The iSNS
    Protocol\n(iSNSP) defines how entities communicate with the iSNS server to\ndiscover
    and utilize available networked storage resources.  The\niSNS server MAY be supported
    by a consolidated iSNS directory\ndatabase, which serves as a repository to store
    information about\nvarious storage resources, providing easy access to topology\ninformation
    for storage entities.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "     The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of the\n
    \    Access Node Control mechanism to PON-based broadband access. The\n     need
    for an Access Node Control mechanism between a Network\n     Access Server (NAS)
    and an Access Node Complex (a combination of\n     Optical Line Termination (OLT)
    and Optical Network Termination\n     (ONT) elements) is described in a multi-service
    reference\n     architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service-related
    and\n     Subscriber-related operations. The Access Node Control mechanism\n     is
    also extended for interaction between components of the Access\n     Node Complex
    (OLT and ONT). The Access Node Control mechanism\n     will ensure that the transmission
    of information between the NAS\n     and Access Node Complex (ANX) and between
    the OLT and ONT within\n     an ANX does not need to go through distinct element
    managers but\n     rather uses a direct device-to-device communication and stays
    on\n     net. This allows for performing access link related operations\n     within
    those network elements to meet performance objectives.\n\n\t "

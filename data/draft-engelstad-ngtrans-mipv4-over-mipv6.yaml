  content: "This draft outlines how a dual stack mobile node can be reached and\ncommunicate
    by means of both IPv4 and IPv6, even in situations where\nthe mobile node is in
    reach of only either IPv4 or IPv6 networks. A\nDual Stack Mobility Agent accommodates
    mobility and translates\nbetween IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It may operate as a mobility
    agent in\nits own right or as a module that relays traffic between existing\nsingle
    stack Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 home agents.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies an extension to MPLS BDI packet to form a new\ntype
    of OAM packet BNM(Bidirectional Notify Message) , this BNM\npacket will not only
    have the function of informing another peer MEP\nabout existing fault of this
    path like MPLS BDI packet, but also it\nmay use for performance measure and testing
    communication between two\nequipments. in addtion, when Client network has a fault
    or defect. it\nnotify another peer client network about remote peer fault.  And\nthese
    performance measure and fault notification information will be\nencapsulated in
    BNM packet by the way of TLV packet.  So it may\ndecrease the number of OAM type
    and keep compatibility with MPLS\nnetwork. on the other hand, this encapsulating
    these information by\nthe way of TLV packet will be easy to extend OAM function
    to operate\nan MPLS Transport profile(MPLS-TP) label switched path (LSP).\n\t "

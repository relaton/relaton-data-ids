  content: "This document describes an extensible human-readable accounting record\nformat,
    the Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF). Based on MIME,\nADIF is designed
    to compactly represent accounting data from any\nprotocol using attribute/value
    pairs (AVPs) or variable bindings.\n\nADIF may be used within accounting systems
    in several ways. In some\ncases, Accounting Servers will produce ADIF records
    based on data\nobtained from accounting protocols. It is also possible for devices
    to\nstore data in ADIF format and transfer ADIF records to the accounting\nserver,
    using an accounting or file transfer protocol.  The latter\napproach has the advantage
    of offloading the Accounting Server from the\ntask of transcribing interim or
    session records, thus improving\nscalability.  In either scenario, ADIF may be
    used to transfer a single\naccounting records, or a batch of accounting records.\n\t "

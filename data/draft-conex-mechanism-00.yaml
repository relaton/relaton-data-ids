  content: "Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are facing problems where\ncongestion
    prevents full utilization of the path between sender and\nreceiver at today's
    \"broadband\" speeds.  ISPs desire to control the\ncongestion, which often appears
    to be caused by a small number of\nusers consuming a large amount of bandwidth.
    \ Building out more\ncapacity along all of the path to handle this congestion
    can be\nexpensive; and network operators have sought other ways to manage\ncongestion.
    \ The current mechanisms all suffer from difficulty\nmeasuring the congestion
    (as distinguished from the total traffic).\n\nThe ConEx Working Group is designing
    a mechanism to make congestion\nalong any path visible at the Internet Layer.
    \ This document\ndiscusses this mechanism.\n\t "

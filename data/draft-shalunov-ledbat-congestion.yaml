- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "LEDBAT is an alternative experimental congestion control algorithm.\n\nLEDBAT
    enables an advanced networking application to minimize the\nextra delay it induces
    in the bottleneck while saturating the\nbottleneck.  It thus implements an end-to-end
    version of scavenger\nservice.  LEDBAT has been been implemented in BitTorrent
    DNA, as the\nexclusive congestion control mechanism, and in uTorrent, as an\nexperimental
    mechanism, and deployed in the wild with favorable\nresults.\n\t "

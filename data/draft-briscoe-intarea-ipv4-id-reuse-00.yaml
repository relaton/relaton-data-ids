abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that is both\nprincipled
    and a hack.  It builds on recent moves to formalise the\nincreasingly common practice
    where fragmentation in IPv4 more closely\nmatches that of IPv6.  The large majority
    of IPv4 packets are now\n'atomic', meaning indivisible.  In such packets, the
    16 bits of the\nIPv4 Identification (IPv4 ID) field are redundant and could be
    freed\nup for the Internet community to put to other uses, at least within\nthe
    constraints imposed by their original use for reassembly.  This\nspecification
    defines the process for redefining the semantics of\nthese bits.  It uses the
    previously reserved control flag in the IPv4\nheader to indicate that these 16
    bits have new semantics.  Great care\nis taken throughout to ease incremental
    deployment, even in the\npresence of middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise
    packets\nthat have the reserved control flag set.\n\t "

  content: "The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n   functions
    in support of traffic engineering in multi-domain Multi-\n   Protocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\n   networks.  In this context, the ability
    to compute Traffic\n   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in MPLS and
    GMPLS networks\n   across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.\n
    \  This document specifies the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA)\n   procedures
    and potential extensions for the use of Resource\n   Reservation Protocol-Traffic
    Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in PCE\n   based MPLS-TE packet networks and GMPLS
    packet and non-packet\n   networks to support a flexible establishment and maintenance
    of Label\n   Switched Paths that cross domain boundaries or cross layers.\n\n\t "

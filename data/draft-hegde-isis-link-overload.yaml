  content: "   Many ISIS deployments run on overlay networks provisioned by means
    of\n   pseudo-wires or L2-circuits. when the devices in the underlying\n   network
    go for maintenance, it is useful to divert the traffic away\n   from the specific
    node(s), to some alternate paths, before the\n   maintenance is actually scheduled.
    \ Since the nodes in the underlying\n   network are not visible to ISIS, existing
    Avoidance of traffic\n   blackhole mechanism described in [RFC3277] cannot be
    used.  It is\n   useful for routers in IS-IS routing domain to be able to advertise
    a\n   link being in overload state to indicate impending maintenance\n   activity
    in the underlying network devices.\n\n   This document describes the protocol
    extensions to disseminate link\n   overload information in IS-IS protocol.\n\n\n\t "

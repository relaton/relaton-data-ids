  content: "   This document describes a broadcast-oriented, many-to-many Defined-\n
    \  trust Transport (DeftT) framework that makes it simple to express and\n   enforce
    application and deployment specific integrity,\n   authentication, access control
    and behavior constraints directly in\n   the protocol stack.  DeftT enables secure
    and completely self-\n   contained (e.g., no external identity servers or certificate\n
    \  authorities) overlay networks where credentialed members can join and\n   leave
    at any time.  DeftT is part of a Defined-trust Communications\n   approach with
    a specific example implementation available.  Combined\n   with IPv6 multicast
    and modern hardware-based methods for securing\n   keys and code, it provides
    an easy to use foundation for secure and\n   efficient communications in Limited
    Domains (RFC8799), in particular\n   for Operational Technology (OT) networks.\n\n
    \  Conventional IP transports create optionally secured one-to-one\n   sessions.
    \ Where member identities exist, they must either be\n   validated via external
    servers or all member identities must be be\n   preconfigured in each member during
    enrollment.  Synchronization of\n   data across a domain is carried out through
    multiple two-party\n   transport sessions.  In contrast, DeftT is a multi-party
    transport\n   that synchronizes collections of secured information across all\n
    \  enrolled members of a domain.  Security in DeftT is not optional and\n   members
    are preconfigured only with their own identities and the\n   secured rules to
    authenticate other member identities.\n\n   This document describes an architecture
    that is not a standard and\n   does not enjoy IETF consensus.  (The community
    is invited to consider\n   standardizing its concepts and the specification.)\n\n\t "

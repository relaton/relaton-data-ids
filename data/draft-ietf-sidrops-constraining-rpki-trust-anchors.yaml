  content: "   This document describes an approach for Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure
    (RPKI) Relying Parties (RPs) to impose locally\n   configured Constraints on cryptographic
    products subordinate to Trust\n   Anchors (TAs).  The ability to constrain a Trust
    Anchor operator's\n   effective signing authority to a limited set of Internet
    Number\n   Resources (INRs) allows Relying Parties to enjoy the potential\n   benefits
    of assuming trust - within a bounded scope.  The specified\n   approach and configuration
    format allow RPKI operators to communicate\n   efficiently about observations
    related to Trust Anchor operations.\n\n\t "

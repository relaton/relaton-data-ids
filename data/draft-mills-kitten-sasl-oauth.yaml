  content: "   OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to
    a\n   protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by\n   orchestrating
    an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party\n   application to obtain
    access on its own behalf.\n\n   This document defines how an application client
    uses OAuth over the\n   Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) or the
    Generic\n   Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) to access
    a\n   protected resource at a resource serve, and additionally defines\n   authorization
    and token issuing endpoint discovery.  Thereby, it\n   enables schemes defined
    within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based\n   application protocols.\n\n   Clients
    typically store the user's long term credential.  This does,\n   however, lead
    to significant security vulnerabilities, for example,\n   when such a credential
    leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for\n   usage in those clients is that
    the password is replaced by a token.\n   Tokens typically provided limited access
    rights and can be managed\n   and revoked separately from the user's long-term
    credential\n   (password).\n\n\t "

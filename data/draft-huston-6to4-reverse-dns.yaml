  content: "This memo describes the service mechanism for entering a delegation of
    DNS servers that provide reverse lookup of 6to4 IPv6 addresses into the 6to4 reverse
    zone file.  The mechanism is based on a conventional DNS delegation service interface,
    allowing the service client to enter the details of a number of DNS servers for
    the delegated domain.  In the context of a 6to4 reverse delegation, the client
    is primarily authenticated by its source address used in the delegation request,
    and is authorized to use the function if its IPv6 address prefix corresponds to
    an address from within the requested 6to4 delegation address block.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

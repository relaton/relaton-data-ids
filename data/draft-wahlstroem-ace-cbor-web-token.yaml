  content: "   CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be\n
    \  transferred between two parties.  CWT is a profile of the JSON Web\n   Token
    (JWT) that is optimized for constrained devices.  The claims in\n   a CWT are
    encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)\n   and CBOR Object
    Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added\n   application layer security
    protection.  A claim is a piece of\n   information asserted about a subject and
    is represented as a name/\n   value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim
    value.\n\n\t "

  content: "   IPsec encapsulation can be used to provide a secure channel between\n
    \  two entities, to enforce controlled access to a network, or to\n   provide
    any combination of integrity protection, confidentiality,\n   replay protection,
    and traffic flow confidentiality of data being\n   transmitted between two or
    more endpoints over untrusted transmission\n   media or networks.  Whereas various
    assortments of the protections\n   are possible to provide, it is not always safe
    to use some of the\n   combinations.  Next, IPsec SAs are established either manually
    or\n   using a key management protocol such as IKEv2 with entity\n   authentication
    verified locally or with the assistance of a third\n   party.  This document specifies
    when and how to use IPsec and IKEv2\n   and what combinations of protections afforded
    by those protocols are\n   safe and when.\n\n\t "

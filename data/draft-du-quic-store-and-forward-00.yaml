  content: "   This document describes two mechanisms in QUIC.  The first is the\n
    \  delayed transmission, in which the sender would negotiate a proper\n   time
    to send traffic to the receiver.  The second is the store-and-\n   forward, in
    which the sender would send the traffic to another place\n   that supports temporary
    data store and data upload instead of the\n   sender.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol\n
    \  (LDP) for the setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) Label Switched\n   Paths
    (LSPs) in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  The\n   solution relies
    on LDP without requiring a multicast routing protocol\n   in the network.  Protocol
    elements and procedures for this solution\n   are described.  There can be various
    applications for P2MP LSPs such\n   as IP multicast.  Specification of how such
    applications can use a\n   LDP signaled P2MP LSP is outside the scope of this
    document.\n\t "

  content: "   The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is widely used to provide\n   clients
    with delegated access to user data.  However, the core\n   specification, The
    OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, leaves the\n   definition of access scopes
    to individual service providers.  This\n   has led to a fragmented ecosystem for
    common groupware services\n   (Mail, Calendaring, Contacts), where each provider
    uses proprietary,\n   non-interoperable scope identifiers.  Client applications,
    such as\n   desktop mail clients, are forced to hardcode configurations for a\n
    \  small number of large providers, stifling innovation and harming open\n   ecosystems.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a standardized set of scope values, using the\n   IETF-controlled
    URN namespace, to represent granular and aggregate\n   permissions for common
    mail (IMAP/POP/SMTP/JMAP), calendar (CalDAV),\n   and contact (CardDAV) operations.
    \ Adopting these standard scopes\n   would significantly improve interoperability
    between clients and\n   servers, enabling automatic client configuration and a
    more seamless\n   user experience.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for large-scale\n
    \  content delivery.  As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up\n   their
    infrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are\n   deploying their
    own CDNs.  There is a requirement for interconnecting\n   standalone CDNs so that
    their collective CDN footprint can be\n   leveraged for the end-to-end delivery
    of content from Content Service\n   Providers (CSPs) to end users.  The Content
    Distribution Network\n   Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been chartered
    to develop an\n   interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection.\n\n
    \  The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for\n   the
    solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working\n   group.  This draft
    is a work in progress and requirements may be\n   added, modified, or removed
    by the working group.\n\nRequirements Language\n\n   The key words \"High Priority\",
    \"Medium Priority\" and \"Low Priority\"\n   in this document are to be interpreted
    in the following way:\n\n   o  \"High Priority\" indicates requirements that are
    to be supported by\n      the CDNI interfaces.  A requirement is stated as \"High
    Priority\"\n      when it is established by the working group that it can be met\n
    \     without compromising the targeted schedule for WG deliverables, or\n      when
    it is established that specifying a solution without meeting\n      this requirement
    would not make sense and would justify re-\n      adjusting the WG schedule, or
    both.  This is tagged as \"[HIGH]\".\n\n   o  \"Medium Priority\" indicates requirements
    that are to be supported\n      by the CDNI interfaces unless the WG realizes
    at a later stage\n      that attempting to meet this requirement would compromise
    the\n      overall WG schedule (for example it would involve complexities\n      that
    would result in significantly delaying the deliverables).\n      This is tagged
    as \"[MED]\".\n\n   o  \"Low Priority\" indicates requirements that are to be
    supported by\n      the CDNI interfaces provided that dedicating WG resources
    to this\n      work does not prevent addressing \"High Priority\" and \"Medium\n
    \     Priority\" requirements and that attempting to meet this\n      requirement
    would not compromise the overall WG schedule.  This is\n      tagged as \"[LOW]\".\n\n\n\t "

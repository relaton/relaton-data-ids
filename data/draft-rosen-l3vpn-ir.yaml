  script: Latn
  content: "   RFCs 6513, 6514, and other RFCs describe procedures by which a\n   Service
    Provider may offer Multicast VPN service to its customers.\n   These procedures
    create point-to-multipoint (P2MP) or multipoint-to-\n   multipoint trees across
    the Service Provider's backbone.  One type of\n   P2MP tree that may be used is
    known as an \"Ingress Replication (IR)\n   tunnel\".  In an IR tunnel, a parent
    node need not be \"directly\n   connected\" to its child nodes.  When a parent
    node has to send a\n   multicast data packet to its child nodes, it does not use
    layer 2\n   multicast, IP multicast, or MPLS multicast to do so.  Rather, it\n
    \  makes n individual copies, and then unicasts each copy, through an IP\n   or
    MPLS unicast tunnel, to exactly one child node.  While the prior\n   MVPN specifications
    allow the use of IR tunnels, those specifications\n   are not always very clear
    or explicit about how the MVPN protocol\n   elements and procedures are applied
    to IR tunnels.  This document\n   updates RFCs 6513 and 6514 by adding additional
    details that are\n   specific to the use of IR tunnels.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft specifies the behavior of MoQ relays for delivering media\n
    \  before the deadline to decrease end-to-end latency and save transport\n   costs
    in media transmission.  To achieve this, the draft introduces\n   deadline-aware
    actions prioritizing media streams with earlier\n   deadlines, ensuring timely
    transmission while minimizing costs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for\n   facilitating
    dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes\n   multiple virtual networks
    and/or data transmission paths, from a\n   current operation one to a backup one
    during a scheduled maintenance\n   or an emergency such as network disaster.  Specifically,
    the\n   necessity of interfaces between domain management systems to\n   establish
    consistent end-to-end data transmission paths over multiple\n   domain networks
    is addressed.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft defines a NETCONF server configuration data model and a\n
    \  RESTCONF server configuration data model.  These data models enable\n   configuration
    of the NETCONF and RESTCONF services themselves,\n   including which transports
    are supported, what ports the servers\n   listen on, call-home parameters, client
    authentication, and related\n   parameters.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed by
    RFC Editor)\n\n   This draft contains many placeholder values that need to be
    replaced\n   with finalized values at the time of publication.  This note\n   summarizes
    all of the substitutions that are needed.  Please note\n   that no other RFC Editor
    instructions are specified anywhere else in\n   this document.\n\n   This document
    contains references to other drafts in progress, both\n   in the Normative References
    section, as well as in body text\n   throughout.  Please update the following
    references to reflect their\n   final RFC assignments:\n\n   o  draft-ietf-netconf-restconf\n\n
    \  o  draft-ietf-netconf-call-home\n\n   o  draft-ietf-rtgwg-yang-key-chain\n\n
    \  Artwork in this document contains shorthand references to drafts in\n   progress.
    \ Please apply the following replacements:\n\n   o  \"VVVV\" --> the assigned
    RFC value for this draft\n\n   o  \"XXXX\" --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-restconf\n\n
    \  o  \"YYYY\" --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-call-home\n   Artwork
    in this document contains placeholder values for ports\n   pending IANA assignment
    from \"draft-ietf-netconf-call-home\".  Please\n   apply the following replacements:\n\n
    \  o  \"7777\" --> the assigned port value for \"netconf-ch-ssh\"\n\n   o  \"8888\"
    --> the assigned port value for \"netconf-ch-tls\"\n\n   o  \"9999\" --> the assigned
    port value for \"restconf-ch-tls\"\n\n   Artwork in this document contains placeholder
    values for the date of\n   publication of this draft.  Please apply the following
    replacement:\n\n   o  \"2016-03-16\" --> the publication date of this draft\n\n
    \  The following two Appendix sections are to be removed prior to\n   publication:\n\n
    \  o  Appendix A.  Change Log\n\n   o  Appendix B.  Open Issues\n\n   Artwork
    in the document contains a temporary YANG containers that\n   need to be removed.\n\n
    \  o  The \"listening-ssh-server\" container listed at the end of the\n      artwork
    in Section 4.2.3 needs to be removed.  Please remove the\n      ten lines starting
    with \"container listening-ssh-server {\" and\n      ending with \"}\".\n\n   o
    \ The \"listening-tls-server\" container listed at the end of the\n      artwork
    in Section 4.3.3 needs to be removed.  Please remove the\n      ten lines starting
    with \"container listening-tls-server {\" and\n      ending with \"}\".\n\n\t "

  content: "   Recently, in-network aggregation to scale distributed machine\n   learning
    (ML) has been presented.  A network switch implementation\n   uses IPv4 broadcast
    messages from switch to the hosts to send updates\n   to all workers.  IPv6 does
    not support broadcast addresses.  This\n   document proposes, IPv6 implementations
    use the IPv6 link-local all-\n   nodes multicast address to receive messages from
    a switch, until a\n   new link-local multicast address is assigned by IANA for
    switch to\n   hosts multicast communications for switch machine learning\n   algorithms.\n\n\t "

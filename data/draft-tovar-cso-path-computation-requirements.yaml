  content: "   The cross stratum optimization approach aims for providing a jointly\n
    \  optimized provision of both IT and network resources according to the\n   application
    demands. In order to do that, the path computation\n   capabilities in the network,
    which are in charge of finding the\n   optimal connectivity resources, should
    take into account a new set of\n   requirements.\n\n   This memo explores the
    new needs derived from the cross stratum\n   optimization approach.\n\n\t "

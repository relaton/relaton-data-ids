  content: "   The SHREQ specification describes how the JSON Web Signature (JWS)\n
    \  specification combined with the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS),\n   can
    be utilized to support HTTP based applications needing digitally\n   signed requests.
    \ SHREQ is specifically tailored for Web applications\n   using JSON as data interchange
    format.  There is also a SHREQ scheme\n   for HTTP requests that do not have a
    body (\"payload\") like GET.\n   SHREQ was designed to be agnostic with respect
    to REST concepts\n   versus traditional GET/POST schemes.\n\n\t "

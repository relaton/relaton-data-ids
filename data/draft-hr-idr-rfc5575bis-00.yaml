  script: Latn
  content: "   This document updates RFC5575 which defines a Border Gateway Protocol\n
    \  Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format\n   that
    can be used to distribute traffic flow specifications.  This\n   allows the routing
    system to propagate information regarding more\n   specific components of the
    traffic aggregate defined by an IP\n   destination prefix.  This draft specifices
    IPv4 traffic flow\n   specificaitnos.  Other drafst specify , IPv6), MPLS addresses,
    L2VPN\n   addresses, and NV03 encapsulation of IP addresses.  The information\n
    \  is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol algorithms,\n   operational
    experience, and administrative processes such as inter-\n   provider peering agreements.\n\n
    \  There are applications of that encoding format: 1) automation of\n   inter-domain
    coordination of traffic filtering, such as what is\n   required in order to mitigate
    (distributed) denial-of-service\n   attacks; 2) enable traffic filtering in the
    context of a BGP/MPLS VPN\n   service, and 3) aid centralized control of traffic
    in a SDN or NFV\n   context.  Some of deployments of these three applications
    can be\n   handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI traffic flow filters,\n
    \  and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community Flow\n   Specification
    actions.  This defines the first two applications.\n\n   This document provides
    the definition of a BGP NLRI which carries\n   traffic flow specification filters,
    and Extended Community values\n   which encode the actions a routing system can
    take if a packet\n   matches the traffic flow filters.  The specification requires
    that\n   the BGP Flow Specification traffic filters follows a string ordering,\n
    \  and that the BGP Flow Specification Extended Communities actions are\n   processed
    in a defined order.\n\n\t "

  content: "Generic Router Assist (GRA) is a network-based service that enables\nend-to-end
    multicast transport protocols to take advantage of infor-\nmation distributed
    across the network elements in a given multicast\ndistribution tree.  The service
    consists of a canonical set of simple\nfunctions which network elements may apply
    to selected packets in the\ntransport session as they traverse the distribution
    tree.  The choice\nof function and the packet parameters to which it is applied
    can be\ndefined and customized for a given transport session in a highly con-\ntrolled
    fashion that still permits enough flexibility for GRA to be\nused to address a
    wide range of multicast transport problems not\namenable to end-to-end solution.
    \ This document provides the motiva-\ntion and an architecture for GRA.\n\t "

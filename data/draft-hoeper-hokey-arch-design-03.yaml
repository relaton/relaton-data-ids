abstract:
- content: '<p>The Handover Keying (HOKEY) Working Group seeks to minimize handover
    delay due to authentication when a peer moves from one point of attachment to
    another. Work has progressed on two different approaches to reduce handover delay:
    early authentication (so that authentication does not need to be performed during
    handover), and reuse of cryptographic material generated during an initial authentication
    to save time during re-authentication. A starting assumption is that the mobile
    host or "peer" is initially authenticated using the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP), executed between the peer and an EAP server as defined in RFC
    3748. This document documents the HOKEY architecture. Specifically, it describes
    design objectives, the functional environment within which handover keying operates,
    the functions to be performed by the HOKEY architecture itself, and the assignment
    of those functions to architectural components. It goes on to illustrate the operation
    of the architecture within various deployment scenarios that are described more
    fully in other documents produced by the HOKEY Working Group.</p>'

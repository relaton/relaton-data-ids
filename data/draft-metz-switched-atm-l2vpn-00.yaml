  content: "Many providers operate ATM networks that support a suite of network \nservices.
    These networks employ ATM signaling and routing protocols to \nexpedite connection
    setup and recovery. Over time these providers will \nmigrate all or portions of
    their ATM infrastructure and services to an \nIP/MPLS-based Packet Switched Network
    (PSN) thus leading to the \ncreation of ATM L2VPNs. This document describes a
    solution that \nsupports dynamic signaling and routing of point-to-point switched
    ATM \nconnections (i.e. VP or VC) across an IP/MPLS network. It is based on \nthe
    L2VPN (VPWS) architecture which employs an {attachment circuit, PE, \npseudo-wire,
    PE, attachment circuit} tuple to define a distinct point-\nto-point L2 connection
    between two end-points within the VPN [PPVPN \nL2]. The presumption is that the
    L2 connection is a switched ATM VC or \nVP and that one or both ACs and the PW
    are established in real-time \nusing routing and signaling protocol machinery
    native to the ATM and \nIP/MPLS networks. We call this a switched ATM L2VPN. \nThe
    key component of a switched ATM L2VPN is a PWE3 native service \nprocessing (NSP)
    function on the PE that serves as an interworking \ngateway between native ATM
    and IP/MPLS signaling and routing protocols. \nThe NSP learns of ATM prefixes
    reachable through the local attachment \ncircuits. The ATM prefixes are exchanged
    with a co-resident MP-BGP \ninstance for automatic distribution and discovery
    of ATM reachability \nto participating PEs and their directly-attached ATM networks.
    The NSP \nis capable of processing the necessary native ATM signaling messages
    \nfor real-time connection management. The NSP interacts with the co-\nresident
    PWE3 signaling machinery for concurrent PW connection \nmanagement. Extensions
    to the PWE3 signaling protocol are required to \nsupport dynamic single-sided
    provisioning and to transport ATM \nsignaling parameters between the NSPs for
    connection management \npurposes. Extensions to the MP-BGP protocol are needed
    distribute ATM \nprefixes and associated next hop information between PEs. \n\n\t "

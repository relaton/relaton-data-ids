  content: "   TCP's state mechanics uses a series of well-known messages that are\n
    \  exchanged in the clear.  Because these are visible to network\n   elements
    on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport\n   connection, they
    are often used as signals by those network elements.\n   In transports that do
    not exchange these messages in the clear, on-\n   path network elements lack those
    signals.  This document discusses\n   the nature of the signals as they are seen
    by on-path elements and\n   reflects on best practices for transports which encrypt
    their state\n   mechanics.\n\n\t "

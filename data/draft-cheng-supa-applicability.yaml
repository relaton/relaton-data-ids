  content: "   SUPA will define a generic policy model, an imperative ECA (Event\n
    \  Condition Action) policy information model and a declarative (intent-\n   based)
    policy information model which is the extension of the generic\n   model, and
    a set of policy data models which will make use of the\n   common concepts defined
    in the generic model.  This memo will explore\n   some typical use cases and demonstrate
    the applicability of SUPA\n   policy models.\n\n\t "

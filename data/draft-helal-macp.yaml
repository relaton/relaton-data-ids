  content: "This memo describes the message and procedure related to the \nMulticast
    Announce and Control Protocol (MACP). This protocol is \nconsidered as one 'building
    blocks' of a reliable multicast \ntransport framework.  \nThe Multicast Announce
    and Control Protocol (MACP) organizes the \nprocess by which a multicast sender
    node (Msender) manages \ntransmissions to dynamic groups of receivers (Mreceivers)
    in the \n'one-to-many' model. The prime objective of MACP is to work in \nconjunction
    with various data transport protocols in order to meet \nvarious network requirements.
    One other main objective is to provide \na unified announce transport mechanism
    for both bulk data transfer \nand streamed data.\n\t "

  content: "   Hierarchical Carrier Supporting Carrier deployments involve a Carrier\n
    \  Core which hereinafter is called the Tier-1 provider and two or more\n   VPN
    sites that are carriers themselves hereinafter called Tier-2\n   providers that
    offer MPLS VPN services to their own customers. In\n   such cases normally LDP
    is used to distribute labels amongst the\n   routers (P and PE devices) in the
    Tier-2 provider's sites. When RSVP\n   based TE-LSPs are constructed to explicitly
    route traffic for Tier-2\n   ISP's customers from the Tier-2 PEs to the CE of
    the Tier-1 provider\n   and such TE-LSPs exist on multiple sites of the Tier-2
    provider, the\n   Tier-2 ISP may require splicing together through an \"auto-match-and-\n
    \  splice-together\" facility such that traffic flows from the PE of the\n   Tier-2
    ISP through the TE-LSP onto the CE of the Tier-1 ISP and then\n   onto the other
    site and takes a path through a specific TE-LSP from\n   the CE of the other site
    to the destination Tier-2 PE and then onto\n   the final customer.\n\n   This
    solution offers a lot of advantages such as providing adequate\n   assurance that
    the bandwidth for the traffic flowing through these\n   spliced TE-LSPs is met.
    It also provides a explicit routing of the\n   traffic rather than through the
    regular LDP (which follows IGP)\n   scenarios. Such explicitly routed TE-LSPs
    would have been constructed\n   taking into account factors such as using under-utilized
    links for\n   example. Splicing together these TE-LSPs in various sites and doing\n
    \  the splicing on an auto-match based on bandwidth or delay metrics\n   would
    be a good service to offer to the Tier-2 ISPs customers.\n\n   This draft outlines
    a scheme that offers such a feature and service\n   to the Tier-2 ISPs through
    the addition of certain additional label\n   exchanges and some additional labels
    such as the RSVP-stitch label\n   and the RSVP-splicing-LDP label in the label
    stack which can be used\n   to splice together these tunnels. In case of re-optimization
    of the\n   LSP end-to-end there is a wide variety of choices for the near-end
    PE\n   to hook up with a suitable far-end tunnel in the other Tier-2 site.\n\n
    \  Explicit tunnel setup can be obviated by merely choosing from a set\n   of
    already constructed tunnels based on criterion that may involve\n   various parameters.
    Also fast-reroute in case of remote tunnel\n   failure is taken care of.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes some scenarios in which one can imagine that\n
    \  the ability of authoritarian regime to censor news dissemination is\n   reduced.
    \ It tries to draw some conclusions about what's desirable\n   and what's not
    acceptable for users in those scenarios.\n\n   The CensorFree objective is to
    standardize the protocols for\n   microblogging on smartphones with a focus on
    security and censorship\n   resistance.  Microblog entries are short text messages,
    possibly\n   enriched with pictures or streaming video.  The goal is to devise\n
    \  protocols which guard against all known forms of censorship such as:\n   cyberspace
    sabotage, digital eavesdropping, infiltration, fraud,\n   Internet kill switches
    and lawyer-based attacks with the best known\n   protective methods.\n\n\t "

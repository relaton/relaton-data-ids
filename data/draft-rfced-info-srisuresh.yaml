  content: "     Basic Network Address Translation or Basic NAT is a feature by\n
    \    which IP addresses are mapped from one group to another, transparent\n     to
    users. Network Address Port Translation, or NAPT is an extension\n     to Basic
    NAT, in that many network addresses and their TCP/UDP ports\n     are translated
    to a single network address and its TCP/UDP ports.\n\n     Together, these two
    operations, traditionally referred to as NAT,\n     provide a mechanism to connect
    an isolated routing realm with private\n     unregistered addresses to the external
    routing network with globally\n     unique registered addresses.\n\n\t "

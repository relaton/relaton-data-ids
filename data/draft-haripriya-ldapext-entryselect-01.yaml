  content: "This document defines an LDAPv3 control that can select multiple\nentries
    in a subtree of a container entry for modification or\ndeletion.  This control
    extends the scope of the LDAPv3 modify and\ndelete operations as defined in [RFC
    2251]. This control is useful\nfor modifying or deleting multiple entries on the
    basis of a\nsingle selection criterion.  This may be useful for maintenance of\nan
    LDAP directory having a large number of objects.\nExample of Usage - This control
    can be used by client applications\nwho have the need to modify or delete a large
    number of entries in\nan LDAP directory based on a selection criterion. One example
    of\nsuch a usage is when two departments in an organization merge. In\nthis case
    the 'department' name or number given to a number of\nemployees need to change,
    and all the employees in a given\ndepartment are to be assigned the new 'department'.
    Here the\nEntrySelection control can be used to select the entries to be\nmodified
    based on the 'department' value, and the modify operation\ncan change the 'department'
    value for all the selected entries to\nthe given value.\n\t "

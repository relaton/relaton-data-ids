  content: "   The term \"service function chaining\" is used to describe the\n   definition
    and instantiation of an ordered list of instances of such\n   service functions,
    and the subsequent \"steering\" of traffic flows\n   through those service functions.This
    document describes transport\n   mechanisms that use stitched tunnels to achieve
    end-to-end service\n   chaining.  This document specifies two different types
    of transport\n   encodings, one based on SR-MPLS and another based on IP tunnels.\n\n\t "

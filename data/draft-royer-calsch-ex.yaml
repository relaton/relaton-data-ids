  content: "A proposal to specify booked persistent data in calendar stores to track
    'SEQUENCE' and 'DTSTAMP' property values for CUAs with direct access to calendar
    stores.\n\nWith iMIP the iCalendar CUA's do not see the others stored CS data.
    With WebDAV, HTTP, or FTP access, the CUA can see into the public data of other
    calendars. The storage of persistent data mandated by [iTIP] has not been standardized
    yet. This memo proposes a way to standardize on those persistent items.\n\nAlso
    included are ways to make the various ways of using the [iCAL] and\n[iTIP] 'RECURRENCE-ID'
    property work between vendors and to document the procedures to work with 'RECURRENCE-ID's.\n\nComments
    about this proposed standard should be sent to the\n'calsch@ietf.org' mailing
    list.\n\t "

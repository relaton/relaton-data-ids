  content: "This document defines the Common Logic Interface Protocol (CLIP)\n   framework.
    CLIP provides a programming language independent interface\n   between system
    components. An overview of CLIP is provided as well as\n   a description of logical
    systems. In addition, the CLIP syntax is\n   defined. Example pseudo-code for
    common clip utility functions are\n   provided. Finally, some additional notes
    and recommended practices\n   are included in the document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Mobile phone devices are usually configured with multiple wireless\n
    \  access network cards, such as LTE/5G, Wi-Fi.  And the wireless\n   network
    is a network with highly time-varying bandwidth.  For a\n   single wireless device,
    the limited bandwidth cannot meet the peak\n   rate requirements of low-latency
    applications.  MPTCP supports the\n   simultaneous use of multiple networks on
    mobile devices.  Due to the\n   time-varying nature of wireless networks, it is
    challenging for MPTCP\n   to accurately schedule data blocks to different sub-streams
    to meet\n   their low-latency requirements.  This document proposes a new cross-\n
    \  layer feedback method for wireless networks to pass the scheduling\n   information
    and status of the wireless network to the MPTCP Server.\n   MPTCP Server can predict
    the transmission capacity of the wireless\n   network based on this cross-layer
    information, thereby improving the\n   efficiency of data block scheduling on
    multipaths.\n\n\t "

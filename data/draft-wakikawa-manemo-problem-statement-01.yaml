  content: "\n   The NEMO Basic Support protocol has well-known issues when multiple\n
    \  mobile routers are connected to each other in a nested fashion.\n   These issues
    have been already analyzed in the NEMO Working Group.\n   However, solutions are
    not yet considered and discussed in the IETF.\n   MANEMO (MANET for NEMO) is an
    approach to resolve these issues.\n   Although most of issues are relevant to
    what the MANET working group\n   is chartered to deliver, a different approach
    may be required.  This\n   document identifies the problems which MANEMO will
    solve and provides\n   the MANEMO requirements.\n\n\t "

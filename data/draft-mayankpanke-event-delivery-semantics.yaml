abstract:
- content: "<p>Event- and webhook-based integrations are a common application-layer
    mechanism for interoperability across Internet services, yet they lack a shared
    delivery semantics contract. Existing implementations vary widely in retry behavior,
    acknowledgment signaling, failure classification, idempotency identifiers, and
    replay handling, resulting in fragile integrations and ambiguous operational expectations.
    This document defines a minimal, application-layer delivery semantics profile
    for event and webhook delivery over existing transports, most commonly HTTP.</p>"

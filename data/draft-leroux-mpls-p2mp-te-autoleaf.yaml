  content: "In various situations, such as TV broadcasting with several regional \n
    \  sources, it is required to setup a series of Point-To-MultiPoint \n   (P2MP)
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) between a \n   set of head-end
    Label Switching Routers (LSRs) and a group of leaf \n   LSRs referred to as a
    Leaf Group. Setting up such a series of P2MP TE \n   LSPs requires for the set
    of head-end LSRs to be aware of all leaf \n   LSRs, which may lead to the cumbersome
    configuration of a potentially \n\n   large number of leaf LSRs on each head-end
    LSRs. Furthermore leaf \n   LSRs may want to dynamically join or leave a Leaf
    Group without \n   requiring manual configuration on the head-end LSRs. This document
    \n   specifies IGP routing extensions for IS-IS and OSPF so as to provide \n   an
    automatic discovery of the set of leaf LSRs members of a Leaf \n   Group, in order
    to automate the creation and modification of a series \n   of P2MP TE-LSPs.\n\t "

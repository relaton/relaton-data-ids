  content: "   Active measurements are typically used to collect the information of\n
    \  a specific path.  However, when using active measurement mechanisms\n   in
    a multi-path topology, the default forwarding behavior is to go\n   through one
    path.  So, it cannot collect the information of all the\n   paths at one time.\n\n
    \  This document extends IOAM Trace Option with a multi-path flag to\n   simplify
    multi-path IOAM active measurement, which promotes the\n   information collection
    and topology restoration of a multi-path\n   topology.  It can help the operators
    to know the performance of\n   network comprehensively and efficiently.\n\n\t "

    Group.\nThis protocol defines a control connection, which is used to control\nthe
    remote device, and a data connection, which is used to transport\nback the sampled
    data. This protocol includes has a set of optional\nparameters that allows customizing
    the behavior of the sampling\nprocess. This protocol can be used also for packet
    capture and it\nshould be possible to implement it on both network devices (router\nand

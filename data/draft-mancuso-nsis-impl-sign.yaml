  content: "     This memo defines a mechanism for NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol \n
    \    (NSLP). The driving motivation is that some network domains, e.g. \n     based
    on Differentiated Services data plane, might not explicit \n     support a per-router
    and/or per-domain admission control rule. \n     Hence, for such domains, explicit
    signaling is not a viable \n     approach. To partially solve this issue, we suggest
    an admission \n     control paradigm devised to provide ?Implicit Signaling? via
    data \n     plane packet delivery operation. Implicit Signaling relies the \n
    \    decision to admit a new flow upon the successful and timely \n     delivery,
    through the domain, of Probe packets independently \n     generated by the NSIS
    initiator (NI). The key idea is to use failed \n     receptions of Probes to discover,
    at the NI, that a congestion \n     condition occurs in the network segment between
    NSIS initiator and \n     NSIS Responder (NR), and to abort a reservation procedure.
    Since \n     Implicit Signaling is not able to communicate per-flow traffic and
    \n     QoS parameters, in principle it cannot exert a QoS control as tight \n
    \    as in the case of explicit mechanisms. However, it is important to \n     notice
    that Implicit Signaling can indeed operate in a \n     differentiated manner on
    the basis of traffic and QOS parameters, if \n     i) Probes are marked according
    to the flow traffic and QoS \n     requirements, ii) marked Probes experience
    a dropping behaviour \n     according to their mark, and iii) Probe dropping is
    controlled \n     according to measurements taken into the core routers. \n\t "

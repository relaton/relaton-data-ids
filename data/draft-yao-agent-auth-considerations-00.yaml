  content: "   Agent Communication Network(ACN) is becoming a promising and\n   fundamental
    infrastructure for most vertical industries.  To\n   construct and build a scalable
    and trustable ACN, authentication and\n   authorization of AI agents are some
    of the most important issues that\n   need to be solved.  This document extends
    the model of OAuth 2.0 and\n   proposes new workflows for AI agent authentication
    and authorization.\n\n\t "

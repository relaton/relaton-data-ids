  script: Latn
  content: "Customers are frequently required to enter substantial amounts of information
    at an Internet merchant site in order to complete a purchase or other transaction,
    especially the first time they go there.  A standard set of information fields
    is defined as the first version of an Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML)
    so that this task can be more easily automated, for example by wallet software
    that could fill in fields.  Even for the manual data entry case, customers will
    be less confused by varying merchant sites if a substantial number adopt these
    standard fields.  In addition, some fields are defined for merchant to consumer
    communication.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

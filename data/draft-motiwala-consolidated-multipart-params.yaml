abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a deployment pattern for reducing overhead
    in multipart/form-data requests that include both file uploads and numerous text
    parameters. The approach consolidates multiple text fields into one or more application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    parts inside the multipart body. This technique requires no changes to existing
    HTTP, MIME, or form specifications and is fully compatible with RFC 7578. It uses
    only existing, standardized Content-Type values in their already-defined manner,
    making it immediately deployable with current infrastructure. The pattern guarantees
    backward compatibility: servers that don't recognize it still receive all parameters
    as standard form data. RFC 7578 defines multipart/form-data but does not specify
    optimization strategies; this document fills that gap. This document records the
    pattern, processing rules, and deployment considerations, and reports implementation
    experience from production systems processing millions of uploads daily.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes a deployment pattern for reducing overhead
    in\n   multipart/form-data requests that include both file uploads and\n   numerous
    text parameters. The approach consolidates multiple text\n   fields into one or
    more application/x-www-form-urlencoded parts\n   inside the multipart body.\n\n
    \  This technique requires no changes to existing HTTP, MIME, or form\n   specifications
    and is fully compatible with RFC 7578. It uses only\n   existing, standardized
    Content-Type values in their already-defined\n   manner, making it immediately
    deployable with current infrastructure.\n\n   The pattern guarantees backward
    compatibility: servers that don't recognize\n   it still receive all parameters
    as standard form data. RFC 7578\n   defines multipart/form-data but does not specify
    optimization\n   strategies; this document fills that gap.\n\n   This document
    records the pattern, processing rules, and deployment\n   considerations, and
    reports implementation experience from production\n   systems processing millions
    of uploads daily.\n\n\n\t "

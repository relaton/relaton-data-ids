  content: "The Open Pluggable Edge Services architecture (OPES) defines an open \nstandards
    based framework for providing services on intermediaries to \noperate on client
    requests and server responses. One of the key \nelements of this framework is
    the notion of callout services.  \nCurrently proposed remote callout service implementations
    interact \nwith an OPES intermediary through specially designed callout \nprotocols
    like [11].\n\t "

  content: "New value-added IP services such as VoIP requires per-flow \nadmission
    control to be performed in order to ensure the admission \nof new traffic flows
    does not degrade the performance of the \nexisting traffic flows in the network.
    Resource Reservation \nProtocol (RSVP) for Intserv [2205] is proposed to support
    per-flow \nadmission control. However, RSVP requires per-flow state \ninstallation,
    per-flow state refreshment, per-flow traffic \nmanagement and resource reservation
    on each node along a \nforwarding path, which cause significant scalability issues,
    \nespecially on the boundary routers and core routers of service \nprovides’ networks,
    which need to process thousands of traffic \nflows as network aggregation points.
    Intserv over Diffserv \nnetworks proposed in [2998] requires the RSVP/Intserv
    processing \nonly on boundary routers and edge routers. Nevertheless, \nRSVP/Intserv
    has still rarely been supported by boundary router \nvendors because of the scalability
    issue. The use of edge-based \nadmission control with per-class resource management
    and policy \ncontrol offers a scalable approach to manage per-flow admission \ncontrol
    for QoS sensitive applications. \n\n\t "

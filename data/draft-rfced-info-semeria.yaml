  content: "The first part of this paper describes the benefits of multicasting, the
    MBONE, Class D addressing, and the operation of the Internet Group Management
    Protocol (IGMP).  The second section explores a number of different algorithms
    that may potentially be employed by multicast routing protocols:                                                                 -
    Flooding - Spanning Trees - Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) - Truncated Reverse
    Path Broadcasting (TRPB) - Reverse Path Multicasting (RPM) - Core Based Trees
    \                                                               The third part
    contains the main body of the paper.  It describes how the previous algorithms
    are implemented in multicast routing protocols available today.                                                           -

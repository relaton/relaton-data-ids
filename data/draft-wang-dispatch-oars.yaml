  content: "    This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture\n
    \   called OARS which could simplify the data communication process\n    between
    two hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant\n    [RFC4787] [RFC5382]
    NAT devices.  The key mechanism in OARS is the\n    newly defined \"Couple\" message
    which allows the Relay servers to be\n    easily incorporated into existing CGN/CDN
    nodes which are already\n    deployed within the network in a distributed manner.\n\n\t "

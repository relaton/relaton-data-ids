  script: Latn
  content: "   The exploration of latency correlation patterns is of great\n   significance
    for characterizing network states. However, existing\n   measurement approaches
    have to confront multiple challenges in\n   detecting latency correlation factors,
    such as probing speed,\n   routing hops and geographical locations. In this paper,
    we conduct\n   three tasks to handle these issues. The first is to construct\n
    \  relative latency measurement strategies for individual machines\n   without
    any time synchronization and control plane requirements. The\n   probing speed
    has been increased by 14.3% in the same hardware\n   conditions. In 4G/5G heterogeneous
    edges enabled by different mobile\n   operators, worldwide 5003 target servers
    are selected to acquire\n   more than 1TB network datasets. The second is to reveal
    the\n   potential modes between latency and routing hops. Surprisingly,\n   91.2%
    available targets present non-positive characteristics in\n   extreme cases. The
    third is to analyze the fine-grained relationship\n   between latency and geographical
    locations. We found that the\n   significance of mean backward receiving delay
    is higher than other\n   parameters, with a maximum of 33%. Finally, we also made\n
    \  optimizations regarding latency compression and time accuracy in\n   multipath
    networks. The experimental data have been released to an\n   open-source community
    for further investigations.\n\t "

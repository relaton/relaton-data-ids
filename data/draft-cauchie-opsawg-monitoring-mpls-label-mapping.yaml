  script: Latn
  content: "   Because one MPLS label only identifies one single flow on a link\n
    \  between two MPLS routers, information related to one MPLS label is\n   exchanged
    only between (physically and logically) neighbour routers.\n   In other words,
    MPLS label have a link-local significance on which\n   two neighbour routers have
    previously agreed on.  It is therefore not\n   a trivial task for a network operator
    to know where a flow is going\n   as it implies to retreive the MPLS labels mappings
    on each hops in\n   order to get a complete view of end-to-end LSP paths.  This
    taks is\n   even harder when it comes to get the MPLS label mappings over time
    in\n   a purpose of monitoring and/or troubleshooting network services.\n\n   This
    document thus defines a new method to monitor MPLS label\n   mappings that collects
    and stores MPLS labels mapping information so\n   as to offer to one IP/MPLS network
    operator a reliable and clear view\n   of its network LSPs end-to-end establishment
    over time while\n   minimising the impact on network convergence and router CPU.\n\t "

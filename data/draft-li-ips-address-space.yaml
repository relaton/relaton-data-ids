  content: "   The exploration of outer space depends heavily upon communications\n
    \  technology and in many cases, uses IP.  IP address allocation has\n   been
    formally assigned to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), but\n   there is no
    formal allocation of address space for networks in outer\n   space.\n\n   This
    document describes updates existing address allocation\n   procedures to include
    address space for outer space.\n\n\t "

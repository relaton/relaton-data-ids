  content: "This document specifies an IPv6 protocol extension that allows IPv6 \npackets
    to be backward compatible with IPv4. An IPv6 packet \nencapsulated in IPv4 in
    this way (called IPv64) would be processed \nas native IPv6 by IPv6 routers, and
    at the same time, in case there \nis an IPv4-only router in the path, it will
    be processed as IPv4. \nConsequently, it is possible to have native end-to-end
    IPv6 \ncommunication, with IPv6 processing at IPv6 routers, through a path \nthat
    contains some IPv4-only routers. \nProtocol conversion from/to IPv6 to/from IPv64
    is made at edge \nrouters, and therefore the advantages of IPv64 are achieved
    with \nstandard native IPv6 hosts\n\t "

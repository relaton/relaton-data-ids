- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a TCP option for use by middleboxes to\n   facilitate
    transparent detection of other middleboxes along the path\n   of the TCP connection
    during the connection initiation phase.  The\n   option has no effect if an appropriate
    middlebox is not present on\n   the path.  The TCP end hosts are unaware of this
    option and its usage\n   is strictly for use by TCP middleboxes.  Multiple vendors
    of WAN\n   optimization products have used similar (but incompatible and\n   proprietary)
    mechanisms since at least 2004.  Those existing vendor\n   systems use multiple
    TCP option code points, all of which are\n   officially unassigned by IANA.  The
    goal of this memo is to\n   standardize a single TCP option code point for this
    functionality.\n   This memo is the product of discussion among some of the vendors\n
    \  currently using incompatible proprietary TCP options for middlebox\n   discovery.
    \ It is a non-goal of this memo to achieve interoperability\n   of middlebox discovery
    between multiple vendors.  It needs to be\n   noted that an earlier document\n
    \  [I-D.knutsen-tcpm-middlebox-discovery], is re-written as the current\n   document
    after agreement from multiple vendors.\n\n\t "

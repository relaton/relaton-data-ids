  content: "   The aim of Certificate Transparency is to have every public end-\n
    \  entity TLS certificate issued by a known Certificate Authority\n   recorded
    in one or more certificate logs.  In order to detect mis-\n   issuance of certificates,
    all logs are publicly auditable.  In\n   particular, domain owners will be able
    to monitor logs for\n   certificates issued on their own domain.\n\n   In order
    to protect clients from unlogged mis-issued certificates,\n   logs sign all recorded
    certificates, and clients can choose not to\n   trust certificates that are not
    accompanied by an appropriate log\n   signature.  For privacy and performance
    reasons log signatures are\n   embedded in the TLS handshake via the TLS authorization
    extension\n   [RFC5878], or in the certificate itself via an X.509v3 certificate\n
    \  extension [RFC5280].\n\n   In order to ensure a globally consistent view of
    the log, logs also\n   provide a global signature over the entire log.  Any inconsistency
    of\n   logs can be detected through cross-checks on the global signature.\n\n
    \  Logs are only expected to certify that they have seen a certificate\n   and
    thus, we do not specify any revocation mechanism for log\n   signatures in this
    document.  Logs will be append-only, and log\n   signatures will be valid indefinitely.\n\n\t "

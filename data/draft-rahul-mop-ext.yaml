  content: "   RPL allows different mode of operations which allows nodes to have
    a\n   consensus on the basic primitives that must be supported to join the\n   network.
    \ The MOP field in RFC6550 is of 3 bits and is fast\n   depleting.  This document
    extends the MOP field specification and\n   adds a notion of capabilities using
    which the nodes can further\n   advertise their support for, possibly optional,
    capabilities.\n\n\t "

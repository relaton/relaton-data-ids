abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Autonomous Systems (ASes) that peer with one another using the Border\n
    \  Gateway Protocol (BGP) RFC 4271 [RFC4271] do not have an automated\n   way
    to tell if the prefixes announced over a particular peering link\n   are acceped
    by the peer.  One way in which an AS operator can verify\n   acceptance of routes
    by a peer is using a looking glass which may be\n   provided by the peer, however
    this introduces manual toil in the\n   operation and turnup of peering links,
    and does not allow for\n   continued validation to ensure there are no regressions.
    \ Looking\n   glasses are often manually found by browsing the website of the
    peer\n   or via a database of peering participants.\n\n   This document proposes
    a new in-band mechanism for transmitting\n   administrative data between BGP peers,
    and defines one such use case\n   for propagating looking glass addresses.  This
    is done via a new\n   Address Family Identifier (AFI) which carries a message
    that we\n   define here, inside the Multi Protocol (MP_REACH and MP_UNREACH) path\n
    \  attribute\n\n   The looking glass that we expose via the proposed mechanism
    conforms\n   to that defined in RFC 8522 [RFC8522].\n\n\t "

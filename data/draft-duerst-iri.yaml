- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized Resource
    Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). An
    IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO
    10646). A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used
    instead of URIs, where appropriate, to identify resources.\n\n The approach of
    defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the
    definition of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and to
    avoid incompatibilities with existing software. Guidelines are provided for the
    use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components
    that currently deal with URIs.\n\t "

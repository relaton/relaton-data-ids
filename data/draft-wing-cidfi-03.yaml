  content: "   Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling can improve\n
    \  the user experience to adapt to network's constraints and share\n   expected
    application needs, and thus to provide differentiated\n   service to a flow and
    to packets within a flow.  The differentiated\n   service may be provided at the
    network (e.g., packet prioritization),\n   the server (e.g., adaptive transmission),
    or both.\n\n   This document describes how clients can communicate with their
    nearby\n   network elements so their QUIC and DTLS streams can be augmented with\n
    \  information about network conditions and packet importance to meet\n   both
    intentional and reactive management policies.  With optional\n   server support
    individual packets can receive differentiated service.\n   The proposed approach
    covers both directions of a flow.\n\n\t "

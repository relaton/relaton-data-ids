  content: "This Internet Draft defines an architectural model for building\n   Virtual
    Private Networks (VPNs) in an MPLS domain. The proposed model\n   takes advantage
    of both network layer peering and packet switching,\n   and link layer circuits
    and per-stream switching. The model provides\n   a set of simple mechanisms for
    controlling VPN membership, including\n   registration, propagation, discovery,
    and dynamic creation of Label\n   Switch Paths to provide connectivity.\n \n   The
    architectural constructs described in this document, when\n   combined with the
    MPLS architecture [1], provide a flexible and\n   scaleable basis for building
    VPNs.\n\t "

  content: "Pseudowires are sometimes used to carry non-TCP data flows.  In these\ncircumstances
    the service payload will not react to network\ncongestion by reducing its offered
    load.  Pseudowires should\ntherefore reduces their network bandwidth demands in
    the face of\nsignificant packet loss, including if necessary completely ceasing\ntransmission.
    \ Since it is difficult to determine a priori the number\nof equivalent TCP flow
    that a pseudowire represents, a suitably\n\"fair\" rate of back-off cannot be
    pre-determined.  This document\ndescribes pseudowire congestion problem and provides
    guidance on the\ndevelopment suitable solutions.\n\t "

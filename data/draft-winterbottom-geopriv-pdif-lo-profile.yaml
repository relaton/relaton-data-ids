  content: "   The GeoPriv PIDF-LO specification provides a flexible and versatile\n
    \  means to represent location information.  There are, however,\n   circumstances
    that arise when information needs to be constrained in\n   how it is represented
    so that the number of options that need to be\n   implemented in order to make
    use of it are reduced.  There is growing\n   interest in being able to use location
    information contained in a\n   PIDF-LO for message and call routing applications.
    \ For such\n   applications to interoperate successfully location information
    will\n   need to be normative and more constrained than is currently described\n
    \  in the PIDF-LO specification.  This paper makes recommendations on\n   how
    to constrain, represent and interpret locations in a PIDF-LO.  It\n   further
    looks at existing communications standards that make use of\n   geodetic information
    for routing purposes and recommends a subset of\n   GML that MUST be implemented
    by applications to allow message routing\n   to occur.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document motivates the need for a forwarding-label which is\n
    \  another name that can be used in forwarding, in addition to the\n   mandatory
    name in a CCNx Interest message.  Forwarding-label once\n   inserted by a edge
    router can be modified en-route towards the\n   producer.  Forwarding-label can
    be used for several purposes such as\n   to support routing scalability, producer
    mobility, multi-protocol\n   support, or for fast forwarding.  We describe its
    encoding format,\n   and rules followed by a forwarder while processing it.  We
    also\n   illustrate its use by applying it towards producer mobility.  This\n
    \  draft scopes the use of forwarding-label within a closed trusted\n   domain,
    while the use of it by applications is not ruled out.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Reilly Sentinel Protocol (RSP) specifies an interoperable,\n   dual-layer
    method for establishing integrity, provenance, and\n   auditability across the
    artificial intelligence (AI) lifecycle.\n   RSP defines a Sentinel Evidence Package
    (SEP) that binds payload\n   digests, provenance metadata, signatures, blockchain
    timestamp\n   proofs, and resolvable identifiers (DOIs).  This enables\n   tamper-evident,
    independently verifiable receipts for datasets,\n   data transformations, training
    jobs, checkpoints, fine-tuning\n   runs, evaluations, and inference outputs.\n\n
    \  RSP is transport-agnostic and serializable in JSON and CBOR.  It\n   leverages
    existing IETF and industry building blocks, including\n   COSE/CMS signatures,
    CBOR (RFC 8949), CDDL (RFC 8610), JSON\n   (RFC 8259), and NTS-secured time (RFC
    8915).  Anchoring is done\n   via append-only blockchain receipts (e.g., OpenTimestamps-style\n
    \  proofs) and identity/lineage is stabilized with a DOI registry.\n   The result
    is an evidence-grade audit trail for regulated and\n   safety-critical AI deployments.\n\n\n\t "

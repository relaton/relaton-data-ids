abstract:
- content: "<p>The Reilly Sentinel Protocol (RSP) specifies an interoperable, dual-layer
    method for establishing integrity, provenance, and auditability across the artificial
    intelligence (AI) lifecycle. RSP defines a Sentinel Evidence Package (SEP) that
    binds payload digests, provenance metadata, signatures, blockchain timestamp proofs,
    and resolvable identifiers (DOIs). This enables tamper-evident, independently
    verifiable receipts for datasets, data transformations, training jobs, checkpoints,
    fine-tuning runs, evaluations, and inference outputs. RSP is transport-agnostic
    and serializable in JSON and CBOR. It leverages existing IETF and industry building
    blocks, including COSE/CMS signatures, CBOR (RFC 8949), CDDL (RFC 8610), JSON
    (RFC 8259), and NTS-secured time (RFC 8915). Anchoring is done via append-only
    blockchain receipts (e.g., OpenTimestamps-style proofs) and identity/lineage is
    stabilized with a DOI registry. The result is an evidence-grade audit trail for
    regulated and safety-critical AI deployments.</p>"

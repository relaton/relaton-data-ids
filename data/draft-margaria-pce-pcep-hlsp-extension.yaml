  content: "   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) set up in Multiprotocol Label Switching\n
    \  (MPLS) or Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks can be used to form links\n   to
    carry traffic in those networks or in other (client) networks.\n   These LSPs
    can be referred to as Hierarchical LSPs (H-LSP).  H-LSPs\n   allow to improve
    the scalability of MPLS/GMPLS networks by creating\n   hierarchies of TE-LSPs.
    \ Those hierarchies are an important state for\n   optimal TE-Computation, therefore
    a stateful PCE should be able to\n   discover and manage those H-LSPs.  A PCE
    having a global view of the\n   network, including Forwarding Adjacencies LSP
    (FA-LSP) and non FA-\n   LSPs, can create more optimal hierachies and (re-)compute
    the TE-LSPs\n   path to make use of the H-LSPs.  In particular a PCE can better\n
    \  leverage the Private H-LSP introduced by RFC6107 without influencing\n   the
    IGP, allowing a less disruptive use of Hierarchies.\n\n   RFC6107 defined Protocol
    mechanisms to facilitate the establishment\n   of such LSPs and to bundle traffic
    engineering (TE) links to reduce\n   the load on routing protocols.\n\n   This
    document defines PCEP extensions to learn about and control\n   those H-LSPs.\n\n\t "

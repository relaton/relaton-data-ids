  content: "   This document describes solution-agnostic and technology-neutral\n
    \  schema for how various intermediaries can gate content and services\n   based
    on age.  The analysis of the architecture is done based on the\n   effectiveness
    of permitting or restricting access based on age.  The\n   document concludes
    with recommendations as well as critical privacy,\n   security and human rights
    considerations.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Service providers are starting to deploy computing capabilities\n   across
    the network for hosting applications such as distributed AI\n   workloads, AR/VR,
    vehicle networks, and IoT, among others.  In this\n   network-compute environment,
    knowing information about the\n   availability and state of the underlying communication
    and compute\n   resources is necessary to determine both the proper deployment\n
    \  location of the applications and the most suitable servers on which\n   to
    run them.  Further, this information is used by numerous use cases\n   with different
    interpretations.  This document proposes an initial\n   approach towards a common
    exposure scheme for metrics reflecting\n   compute and communication capabilities.\n\n\t "

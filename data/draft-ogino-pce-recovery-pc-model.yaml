  content: "   This document proposes a PC model, where the recovery LSP route in
    a \n   domain is computed using an external PCE. Recovery LSP computation \n   that
    promotes bandwidth sharing between other recovery LSPs requires \n   unreserved
    bandwidth information that corresponds to each failure \n   position or SRLG.
    However, the present IGP-TE can only advertise \n   unreserved bandwidth information
    corresponding to eight priority \n   classes to each LSR involved in an IGP area.
    An external PCE in a \n   domain can compute efficient recovery LSP routes by
    exclusively \n   preserving such unreserved bandwidth information without any
    \n   extension of the present IGP-TE. \n\t "

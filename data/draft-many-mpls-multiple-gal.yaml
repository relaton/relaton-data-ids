  content: "   This document describes the requirements for using multiple Generic\n
    \  Associated Channel Labels (GALs) in an MPLS label stack.  As a\n   result,
    the document updates RFC 5586 by removing the restriction\n   imposed on the usage
    of GAL that limits the number of GAL in the MPLS\n   label stack to one.\n\n\t "

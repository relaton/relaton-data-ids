  content: "This document describes a set of related protocol extensions to \nS/MIME,
    SMTP and DNS that collectively simplify deployment of \nS/MIME. Particular attention
    is given to ensuring that S/MIME \nauthenticated content is only received by end
    user clients capable \nof presenting the content in an acceptable manner. The
    proposal \nextends the ‘end-to-end’ security model of traditional S/MIME to \nsupport
    end-to-edge, edge-to-end and edge-to-edge use cases. \n\t "

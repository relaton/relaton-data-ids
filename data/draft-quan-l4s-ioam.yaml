  content: "   This specification defines a framework how to update L4S Dual-Queue\n
    \  Coupled AQM with In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n   (IOAM).
    \ These are designed for consistently very low queuing\n   latency, very low congestion
    loss, and scaling of perflow throughput\n   by using Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN) using the operational\n   and telemetry information collected by IOAM.  Since
    L4S lacks\n   information about the use of network status and network nodes, which\n
    \  also affect network performance in practice, it is considered to use\n   direct
    export mode for information collection of L4S-IOAM to\n   strengthen the AQM regulation
    of L4S.  It then gives the normative\n   requirements that are necessary.\n\n\t "

  content: "In recent years, there has been a shift in wireless LAN (WLAN) product
    architectures from autonomous access points to centralized control of lightweight
    access points. The general goal has been to move most of the traditional wireless
    functionality such as access control (user authentication and authorization),
    mobility, and radio management out of the access point into a centralized controller.\n\n
    The IETF's CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) WG has
    identified that a standards-based protocol is necessary between a wireless Access
    Controller and Wireless Termination Points (the latter are also commonly referred
    to as Lightweight Access Points). This specification defines the Lightweight Access
    Point Protocol (LWAPP), which addresses the CAPWAP's (Control and Provisioning
    of Wireless Access Points) protocol requirements. Although the LWAPP protocol
    is designed to be flexible enough to be used for a variety of wireless technologies,
    this specific document describes the base protocol and an extension that allows
    it to be used with the IEEE's 802.11 wireless LAN protocol. This document defines
    a Historic Document for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   Although the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions has been\n
    \  implemented, cache poisoning is still a big issue.  \"ID Guessing and\n   Query
    Prediction\" type cache poisoning is detectable on a full\n   resolver.  TCP transport
    has strong resistance to cache poisoning\n   attacks.  This document proposes
    an improvement of full resolvers\n   about the detection and the measure against
    forged response cache\n   poisoning attacks.\n\n\t "

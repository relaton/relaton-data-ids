  content: "A method for mutual network endpoint assessment is introduced in this\ndocument.
    \ In current NEA requirements, only the assessment performed\nby network owner
    is described.  However, for some applications like\nonline business and file sharing,
    the unilateral assessment is not\nenough to ensure the two communication parties
    are both secure\nEspecially in P2P application, the endpoints perform equal\nresponsibility
    and hence the mutual network endpoint assessment seems\nmore necessary. each endpoint
    may configure its security assessment\npolicy based on its own security concerns.

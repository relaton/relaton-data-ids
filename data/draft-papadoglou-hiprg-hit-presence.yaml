  content: "   This document describes a new way of exchanging Host Identities (or
    \n   Host Identity Tags) by means of the Presence Information Data Format \n   [6]
    \ using the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). A new presence \n   information element
    is proposed as an extension to the Presence \n   Information Data Format (PIDF),
    to include and convey the Host \n   Identity that corresponds to the different
    SIP URI's the node may \n   have registered. This automatically creates a list
    of associations \n   between the SIP URI and the Host identity for the different
    UA \n   instances on the same or different node. \n     \n\t "

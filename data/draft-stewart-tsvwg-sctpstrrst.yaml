- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Many applications that desire to use SCTP have requested the ability\nto
    \"reset\" a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is to start\nthe numbering
    sequence of the stream back at 'zero' with a\ncorresponding notification to the
    upper layer that this act as been\nperformed.  The applications that have requested
    this feature\nnormally desire it so that they can \"re-use\" streams for different\npurposes
    but still utilize the stream sequence number for the\napplication to track the
    message flows.  Thus, without this feature,\na new use on an old stream would
    result in message numbers larger\nthan expected without a protocol mechanism to
    \"start the streams back\nat zero\".  This documents presents also a method for
    resetting the\ntransport sequence numbers and all stream sequence numbers.\n\t "

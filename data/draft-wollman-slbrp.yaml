  content: "This document defines an experimental protocol called the Server Load
    \nBalancing Registration Protocol (SLBRP).  This protocol permits \nservers to
    register and coordinate services with a service load \nbalancing (SLB) application.
    \ Coordination between real servers and \nthe SLB application will include service
    definition(s), Virtual IP \n(VIP) address support, server application health monitoring,
    as well \nas, optional support for automatic Domain Name System (DNS) and DNS-\nbased
    Global Server Load Balancer (GSLB) updates.  This document also \ndescribes Anycast
    Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) implementations \nthat can operate with an SLB
    and GSLB based enterprise \ninfrastructure. \n\n\t "

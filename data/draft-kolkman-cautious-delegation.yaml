  content: "   NOTE: The authors recognize that the statistical models that would\n
    \  inform the process are not well understood and that the possibilities\n   to
    game the system might be unmountable.  Unless we reach more\n   insights on how
    to deal with this details this work is abandoned.\n\n   Sometimes, a DNS name
    is known to be in use in the wild even though\n   it was never properly delegated.
    \ This situation appears\n   particularly, but not only, true in certain domains
    near the root of\n   the tree: people have independently used those non-existent
    top-level\n   domains as private namespaces.  If those names are to be delegated
    in\n   the public DNS, prudence dictates that collisions between the private\n
    \  uses and the public use be minimized.  We outline a procedure to\n   evaluate
    the harm of delegation.\n\n\t "

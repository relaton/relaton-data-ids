  content: "   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) defines\n
    \  the mechanisms for the communication between a client and a PCE, or\n   among
    PCEs.  This document describe the usage of Transport Layer\n   Security to enhance
    PCEP security, hence the PCEPS acronym proposed\n   for it.  The additional security
    mechanisms are provided by the\n   transport protocol supporting PCEP, and therefore
    they do not affect\n   its flexibility and extensibility.\n\n\t "

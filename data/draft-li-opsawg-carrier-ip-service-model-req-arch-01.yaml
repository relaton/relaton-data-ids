abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Model is a fundamental building block for a controller's North-Bound
    Interface (NBI). Defining a service model for different multi-layered and heterogeneous
    networks is a complicated work and may require lots of consideration since different
    model users may have different perspective and concerns. This document proposes
    the requirements and architecture for service models to facilitate future work.
    This document does not attempt to provide a detailed description of all the architectural
    components, but rather it describes a set of building blocks, requirements, architecture
    and guidelines from which models may be constructed.</p>"

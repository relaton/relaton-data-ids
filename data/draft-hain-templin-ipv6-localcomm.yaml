  content: "The IPv6 addressing architecture specifies formats for unicast\naddresses,
    but provides no operational guidelines for their use.\nThere is a clear need for
    IPv6 to support organizational-scope\ncommunications whether members of the organization
    are located in the\nsame site or different sites.\nAspects of certain types of
    sites introduce challenges for supporting\norganizational-scope communications.
    Of special interest are nomadic\nsites, e.g., sites that are intermittently-connected
    or disconnected\nfrom the global Internet, sites that frequently change provider\npoints
    of attachment, sites that temporarily or permanently merge\nwith other sites,
    etc. This memo will discuss scenarios and goals for\nIPv6 support organizational-scope
    communications.\n\t "

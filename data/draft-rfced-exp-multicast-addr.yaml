- language: en

  content: "The purpose of this document is to describe an architecture and protocol
    for a multicast address allocation server.  The proposed method employs a distributed
    'nameserver' architecture, and defines a MultiCast NameServer Protocol (MCNSP)
    which specifies the manner in which nameservers interact with one another.  MCNSP
    is designed to support allocation of multicast addresses at any network layer
    on which multicasting itself is supported (IP, Ethernet MAC, etc.).  The protocol
    is designed to use a minimal amount of network bandwidth, while the distributed
    architecture allows a network administrator to configure nameservers to achieve
    high levels of fault tolerance.\n\t "

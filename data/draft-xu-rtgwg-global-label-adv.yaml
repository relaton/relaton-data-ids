  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) [SR-ARCH] is a new MPLS paradigm in which each\n
    \  SR-capable router is required to independently advertise global MPLS\n   labels
    for its attached prefixes using IGP [SR-ISIS-EXT][SR-OSPF-EXT].\n   One major
    challenge associated with such label advertisement\n   mechanism is how to avoid
    a given global MPLS label from being\n   allocated by different routers to different
    prefixes. Although manual\n   allocation can address such label allocation collision
    problem, it is\n   error-prone and therefore may not be suitable for large SR
    network\n   environments. This document proposes an alternative approach for\n
    \  advertising global labels without any risk of label allocation\n   collision.\n\n\t "

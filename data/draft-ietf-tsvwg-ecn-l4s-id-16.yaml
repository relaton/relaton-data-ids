  content: "   This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network\n
    \  service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (L4S).\n   L4S
    uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP\n   layer that
    is similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach,\n   except as specified
    within.  'Classic' ECN marking is required to be\n   equivalent to a drop, both
    when applied in the network and when\n   responded to by a transport.  Unlike
    'Classic' ECN marking, for\n   packets carrying the L4S identifier, the network
    applies marking more\n   immediately and more aggressively than drop, and the
    transport\n   response to each mark is reduced and smoothed relative to that for\n
    \  drop.  The two changes counterbalance each other so that the\n   throughput
    of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a non-L4S flow\n   under the same conditions.
    \ Nonetheless, the much more frequent\n   control signals and the finer responses
    to them result in much more\n   fine-grained adjustments, so that ultra-low and
    consistently low\n   queuing delay (typically sub-millisecond on average) becomes
    possible\n   for L4S traffic without compromising link utilization.  Thus even\n
    \  capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can have high bandwidth and very\n   low
    delay at the same time, even during periods of high traffic load.\n\n   The L4S
    identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from\n   'Classic' (e.g.
    TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic.  It gives an incremental\n   migration path so that
    suitably modified network bottlenecks can\n   distinguish and isolate existing
    traffic that still follows the\n   Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading
    the low queuing delay and\n   low loss of L4S traffic.  This specification defines
    the rules that\n   L4S transports and network elements need to follow to ensure
    they\n   neither harm each other's performance nor that of Classic traffic.\n
    \  Examples of new active queue management (AQM) marking algorithms and\n   examples
    of new transports (whether TCP-like or real-time) are\n   specified separately.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "The Joint Electronics Payment Initiative aims to bring key industry players
    together to assure that multiple payment protocols can operate effectively in
    Web applications. The concrete goal is automatable payment selection over HTTP.
    \                                                      The first step towards
    this was Don Eastlake's development of the Universal Payment Preamble, which is
    also available as an internet-draft (draft-eastlake-universal-payment). The second
    is the development of an HTTP Extension Protocol to embed UPP in HTTP. The latter
    proposal is part of the chartered activities of the IETF HTTP G (draft-ietf-http-pep-03).
    \  This document describes how to use UPP over PEP to support payment selection
    between clients and merchants. It explains basic operations:  requesting available
    payment choices, presenting multiple choices, demanding a selection, making a
    selection, and accepting and rejecting choices.\n\t "

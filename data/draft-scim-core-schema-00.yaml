  content: "   The Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed\n
    \  to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and\n   services
    easier.  The specification suite builds upon experience with\n   existing schemas
    and deployments, placing specific emphasis on\n   simplicity of development and
    integration, while applying existing\n   authentication, authorization, and privacy
    models.  Its intent is to\n   reduce the cost and complexity of user management
    operations by\n   providing a common user schema and extension model, as well
    as\n   binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema\n   using
    standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap, and easy\n   to move identity
    in to, out of, and around the cloud.\n\n   This document provides a platform neutral
    schema and extension model\n   for representing users and groups in JSON and XML
    formats.  This\n   schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud service
    providers.\n   Additional binding documents provide a standard REST API, SAML\n
    \  binding, and use cases.\n\t "

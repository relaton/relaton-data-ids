  content: "   Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use\n
    \  hostnames.  These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of\n   which
    may have different performance and connectivity\n   characteristics.  Since specific
    addresses or address families (IPv4\n   or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal
    on a network, clients\n   that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a
    chance of\n   establishing a connection more quickly.  This document specifies\n
    \  requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and\n   provides
    an example algorithm, referred to as \"Happy Eyeballs\".  This\n   document updates
    the algorithm description in RFC 8305.\n\n\t "

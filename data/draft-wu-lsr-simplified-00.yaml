abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This distributed routing protocol aims to facilitate information\n
    \  exchange and path calculation between routers to ensure efficient\n   data
    transmission in the network. Each router initializes adjacency\n   matrices, neighbor
    tables, routing tables, and flood flags during\n   setup. In operation, routers
    periodically broadcast Hello packets to\n   update neighbor tables and detect
    changes in neighbor relationships,\n   broadcasting update packets accordingly.
    Nodes receiving update\n   packets process them based on flood flags, optimizing
    network\n   performance through scheduled flood flag resets, controlling link\n
    \  occupancy rates, and utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm to compute\n   shortest
    paths when adjacency matrices are complete, storing results\n   in routing tables
    for optimal path selection.\n\n\t "

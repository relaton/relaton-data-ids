  content: "This document discusses several mechanisms for simplifying\nauthentication
    of dual-stack SIP+XMPP clients against the\ncorresponding SIP and XMPP services.
    \ The text is not attempt to\ndefine a complex credential sharing protocol but
    rather to determine\nand eventually encourage use of a simple mechanism that would
    allow\nservice providers to host a SIP+XMPP solution appearing as a single\nservice
    to their users.  In other words, the goal here is to agree on\na set of recommendations
    that would encourage client developers to\nimplement simple UIs that would only
    require users to provide an ID\nand a password when configuring their SIP+XMPP
    account for the first\ntime (as opposed to having to do so separately for SIP
    and XMPP).\n\t "

  content: "   The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture\n   describes
    how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets\n   through an IPv6 or MPLS
    network using the source routing paradigm.\n   Segment Routing (SR) enables any
    head-end node to select any path\n   without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling
    technique (e.g., LDP or\n   RSVP-TE).\n\n   It depends only on \"segments\" that
    are advertised by Link- State\n   IGPs.  A Segment Routed Path can be derived
    from a variety of\n   mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit\n
    \  configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE).\n\n   Since, Segment Routing
    can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6\n   forwarding plane, a PCE should be able
    to compute SR-Path for both\n   MPLS and IPv6 forwarding plane.  This draft describes
    the extensions\n   required for Segment Routing support for IPv6 data plane in
    Path\n   Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP).\n\n\n\t "

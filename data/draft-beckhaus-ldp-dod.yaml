  content: "   Seamless MPLS design enables a single IP/MPLS network to scale over\n
    \  core, metro and access parts of a large packet network infrastructure\n   using
    standardized IP/MPLS protocols.  One of the key goals of\n   Seamless MPLS is
    to meet requirements specific to access, including\n   high number of devices,
    their position in network topology and their\n   compute and memory constraints
    that limit the amount of state access\n   devices can hold.This can be achieved
    with LDP Downstream-on-Demand\n   (LDP DoD) label advertisement.  This document
    describes LDP DoD use\n   cases and lists required LDP DoD procedures in the context
    of\n   Seamless MPLS design.\n\n   In addition, a new optional TLV type in the
    LDP label request message\n   is defined for fast-up convergence.\n\n\n\t "

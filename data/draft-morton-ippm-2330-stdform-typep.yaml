  content: "   This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC\n
    \  2330 with new considerations for measurement methodology and testing.\n   The
    memo updates the definition of standard-formed packets in RFC\n   2330 to include
    IPv6 packets.  It also augments distinguishing\n   aspects of packets, referred
    to as Type-P for test packets in RFC\n   2330.\n\n   Two points (at least) are
    worthwhile discussing further: extent of\n   coverage for 6LO and IPv6 Header
    Compression, and the continued need\n   to define a \"minimal standard-formed
    packet\".\n\n\n\t "

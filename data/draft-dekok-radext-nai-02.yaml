  content: "   In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have a\n   standardized
    method for identifying users.  This document defines the\n   syntax for the Network
    Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity\n   submitted by the client during
    network authentication.  \"Roaming\" may\n   be loosely defined as the ability
    to use any one of multiple Internet\n   Service Providers (ISPs), while maintaining
    a formal, customer-vendor\n   relationship with only one.  Examples of where roaming
    capabilities\n   might be required include ISP \"confederations\" and ISP-provided\n
    \  corporate network access support.  This document is a revised version\n   of
    RFC 4282 [RFC4282], which addresses issues with international\n   character sets,
    as well as a number of other corrections to the\n   previous document.\n\n\t "

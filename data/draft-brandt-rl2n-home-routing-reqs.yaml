  content: "This document presents the home control and automation application\nspecific
    requirements for Routing in Low power and Lossy Networks\n(RL2N).  In a modern
    home, a high number of wireless devices are used\nfor a wide set of purposes.
    \ Examples include lighting control\nmodules, heating control panels, light sensors,
    temperature sensors,\ngas/water leak detector, motion detectors, video surveillance,\nhealthcare
    systems and advanced remote controls.  Because such\ndevices only cover a limited
    radio range, multi-hop routing is often\nrequired.  Such devices are usually highly
    constrained in terms of\nresources such as battery and memory and operate in unstable\nenvironments.
    \ The aim of this document is to specify the routing\nrequirements for networks
    comprising such constrained devices in a\nhome network environment.\n\t "

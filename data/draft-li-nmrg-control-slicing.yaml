  content: "   Optical networks which support a large number of emerging\n   applications,
    such as 5G, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Internet of\n   things, autonomous driving,
    etc., play an increasingly important\n   role in the current world. All the time
    spectrum resources in\n   optical networks have been treated equally. All spectrum
    resources\n   form a resource pool which is allocated to applications bit by bit\n
    \  until it is all used up. Although this pattern reduces the\n   complexity of
    resource maintenance, it has poor flexibility and high\n   operation complexity
    for different types of applications. This draft\n   proposes a framework of centralized
    control and distributed function\n   slicing for fast connection establishment
    and fault recovery in\n   optical networks. The proposed framework divides all
    spectrum\n   resources into four functional areas, i.e., optical channel area,\n
    \  fault recovery area, resource pool area, and the reserved functional\n   area.
    A functional area is responsible for a specific network\n   function. This framework
    improves the flexibility of optical\n   networks and can achieve fast connection
    establishment and fault\n   recovery for the request with a highest service level.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   IEEE-754 NaN formations are not numbers and have no equivalence\n   class.
    \ They are not comparable to anything, including reflexively,\n   and therefore
    each attribute - sign bit, signaling/quiet bit, payload\n   bits, and representation
    width (binary16, binary32, binary64,\n   binary128) - can carry meaning for an
    implementation.  CBOR permits\n   encoding NaNs as floating-point values, but
    generic processing,\n   preferred serialization, and deterministic profiles may
    canonicalize\n   or otherwise alter NaN encodings, losing information.  This document\n
    \  defines a CBOR tag, colloquially \"nan-bstr\", whose content is a byte\n   string
    carrying the exact IEEE-754 NaN bit pattern so that all\n   attributes are preserved
    across encode/decode, enabling use cases\n   like NaN boxing, platform-specific
    error signaling, diagnostics, and\n   forensics.\n\n\t "

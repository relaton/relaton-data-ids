abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   Reliable group communication is required in distributed applications,\n
    \  such as distributed file systems (HDFS, GFS and Ceph), where such\n   group
    communication is defined by the sender and the group members\n   are small (e.g.
    three).  However, existing standards for reliable\n   multicast transport are
    receiver-initiated and suffer from\n   inefficiency in either host-side protocols
    or multicast routing.\n\n   This draft proposes a sender-initiated, efficient,
    congestion-aware\n   and robust reliable multicast solution in Software-Defined
    Networks\n   (SDN), called MCTCP (MultiCast TCP).  The main idea behind MCTCP
    is\n   to manage the multicast groups in a centralized manner, and\n   reactively
    schedule multicast flows to active and low-utilized links,\n   and it is implemented
    by extending TCP as the host-side protocol and\n   managing multicast groups in
    SDN-controller.\n\n\t "

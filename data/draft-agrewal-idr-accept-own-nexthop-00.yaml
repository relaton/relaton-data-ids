  content: "   Various Service chain techniques utilize a Controller to inject\n   Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP) Virtual Private Network (VPN) routes to\n   help steer
    traffic through a given path.  The Controller does so by\n   controlling how these
    VPN routes are imported into various Virtual\n   Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
    tables at routers along the desired\n   path.  A couple of such approaches are
    specified in\n   [I-D.ietf-bess-service-chaining].  These approaches rely on the\n
    \  Controller modifying the Route Target (RT) list and next-hop of a VPN\n   route
    received from a downstream router and redistributing these\n   modified routes
    to upstream routers.  This is done such that -\n\n   o  routes originated by an
    ingress VRF at the downstream router are\n      imported into the egress VRF at
    the immediately preceding upstream\n      router and\n\n   o  next-hop advertised
    to the upstream router is the address of the\n      immediately succeeding downstream
    router.\n\n   This forces the traffic to flow through a sequence of network\n
    \  functions creating a service chain.\n\n   This works fine as long as the VRF
    importing the route received from\n   the Controller is on a different router
    than the VRF that originally\n   exported the route to the Controller.  This is
    because BGP protocol\n   [RFC4271] specifies that a router reject routes received
    with its own\n   next-hop.  This document proposes a new community the reception
    of\n   which relaxes this particular rule in the BGP protocol standard and\n   describes
    at least one way of how next-hops of such routes could be\n   resolved.\n\n\n\t "

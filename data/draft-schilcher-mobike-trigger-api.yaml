  content: "MOBIKE is a protocol which adds mobility and multihome support for\nIKEv2.
    \ MOBIKE peers continuously exchange a list of available IP\naddresses each other.
    \ A MOBIKE peer should have some information\nabout the status of each address
    and interface in order to execute\nthe respective actions.  Examples may comprise
    switching from one\naddress or interface to another.  This information, which
    will be\nreferred as trigger, is distributed over a number of protocol daemons\nat
    an end host.  To make this information available to a MOBIKE\ndaemon, it is necessary
    to store it centrally at the host (called\ntrigger database) and to enable the
    protocols to insert the triggers\nand to allow MOBIKE to obtain timely information.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This is a working document intended to focus discussion on\n   requirements
    for multicast in Low-power and Lossy Networks in the\n   area of M2M communication
    for control purposes.  The Trickle\n   algorithm, which uses re-broadcasting to
    assure that messages arrive\n   at all destinations, is proposed as the ROLL multicast
    protocol.  In\n   this draft additional requirements on Trickle, such as timeliness
    and\n   ordering, are motivated by building control.  Re-broadcasting and\n   timeliness
    can be mutually exclusive properties.  To alleviate that\n   problem, this draft
    considers the possibility of reducing\n   interference by limiting the number
    of transmission paths between any\n   two devices in the mesh.\n\n\t "

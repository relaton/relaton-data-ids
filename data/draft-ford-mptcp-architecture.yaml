  content: "Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but the nature of\nTCP/IP
    restricts communications to a single path per socket.\nResource usage within the
    network would be more efficient were these\nmultiple paths able to be used concurrently.
    \ This should enhance\nuser experience through improved resilience to network
    failure and\nhigher throughput.\n\nThis document outlines architectural guidelines
    for the development\nof a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references to how
    these\narchitectural components come together in the Multipath TCP (MPTCP)\nprotocol.
    \ This document also lists certain high level design\ndecisions that provide foundations
    for the MPTCP design, based upon\nthese architectural requirements.\n\t "

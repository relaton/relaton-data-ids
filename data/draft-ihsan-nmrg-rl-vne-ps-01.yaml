  content: "   In Network virtualization (NV) technology, Virtual Network Embedding\n
    \  (VNE) is an algorithm used to map a virtual network to the substrate\n   network.
    \ VNE is the core orientation of NV which has a great impact\n   on the performance
    of virtual network and resource utilization of the\n   substrate network.  An
    efficient embedding algorithm can maximize the\n   acceptance ratio of virtual
    networks to increase the revenue for\n   Internet service provider.  Several works
    have been appeared on the\n   design of VNE solutions, however, it has becomes
    a challenging issues\n   for researchers.  To solved the VNE problem, we believe
    that\n   reinforcement learning (RL) can play a vital role to make the VNE\n   algorithm
    more intelligent and efficient.  Moreover, RL has been\n   merged with deep learning
    techniques to develop adaptive models with\n   effective strategies for various
    complex problems.  In RL, agents can\n   learn desired behaviors (e.g, optimal
    VNE strategies), and after\n   learning and completing training, it can embed
    the virtual network to\n   the subtract network very quickly and efficiently.
    \ RL can reduce the\n   complexity of the VNE algorithm, however, it is too difficult
    to\n   apply RL techniques directly to VNE problems and need more research\n   study.
    \ In this document, we presenting a problem statement to\n   motivate the researchers
    toward the VNE problem using deep\n   reinforcement learning.\n\n\t "

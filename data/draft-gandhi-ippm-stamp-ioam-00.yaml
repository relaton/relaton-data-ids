  content: "   Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) defined in RFC\n
    \  8762 and its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 can be used for\n   Edge-To-Edge
    (E2E) active measurement.  In Situ Operations,\n   Administration, and Maintenance
    (IOAM) data fields defined in RFC\n   9197 and RFC 9326 can be used for recording
    and collecting Hop-By-Hop\n   (HBH) and E2E operational and telemetry information.
    \ This document\n   extends STAMP to carry IOAM data fields for HBH and E2E two-way\n
    \  active measurement and telemetry.  The STAMP extensions are generic\n   and
    allow to carry and reflect any type of IPv6 option and MPLS\n   Network Action
    Sub-Stacks for two-way active measurement.\n\n\t "

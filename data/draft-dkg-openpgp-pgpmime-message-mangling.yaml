  content: "   An e-mail message with OpenPGP encryption and/or signature has\n   standard
    form.  However, some mail transport agents damage those\n   forms in transit.
    \ A user-friendly mail user agent that encounters\n   such a mangled message may
    wish to try to process it anyway, despite\n   the message's non-standard structure.\n\n
    \  This document aims to be a sort of bestiary of common message\n   mangling
    patterns, along with guidance for implementers for how to\n   cope with messages
    structured in these common ways.\n\n\t "

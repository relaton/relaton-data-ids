  content: "   This document defines basic terminology for describing different\n
    \  types of behavior for NATs and firewalls.  It also defines a set of\n   requirements
    for NATs and firewalls that would allow many\n   applications, such as multimedia
    communications or online gaming, to\n   work consistently.  Developing NATs and
    firewalls that meet this set\n   of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood
    that\n   applications will function properly.\n\t "

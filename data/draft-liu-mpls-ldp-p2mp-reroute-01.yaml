  content: "This document describes some extensions to the Label Distribution \nProtocol
    (LDP) for the reroute of point to multi-point (P2MP) Label \nSwitched Paths (LSPs)
    in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) \nnetworks. The solution relies on LDP
    only and has no requirement of a \nmulticast routing protocol in the network.
    \ Protocol elements and \nprocedures for this solution are described for rerouting
    a P2MP LSP \nin the following cases:1)network failure (link or node); 2)a better
    \npath emerges (e.g. new link available, metric change);3)planned \nmaintenance.
    The rerouting mechanism described in this document can \nminimize the time of
    traffic disruption when network failure happens. \nIt will also minimize the data
    duplication and guarantee the traffic \ncontinuity during the procedure of rerouting
    in the last two cases \nmentioned above. \n\n\t "

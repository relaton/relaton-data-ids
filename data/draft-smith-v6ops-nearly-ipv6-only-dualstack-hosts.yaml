abstract:
- content: "<p>Once all of a dual stack IPv4 and IPv6 host's applications support
    IPv6, IPv4 connectivity becomes unnecessary. However, ceasing to provide a dual
    stack host with an IPv4 address via a DHCPv4 server can cause the host to continue
    to make periodic and unsatisfied DHCPv4 requests, imposing unnecessary broadcast
    traffic on an attached link. In this situation, it would be useful to continue
    to provide a host with an IPv4 address via DHCPv4, yet prevent it from using the
    IPv4 address for any connectivity outside of the host itself. This memo describes
    a DHCPv4 method to achieve this.</p>"

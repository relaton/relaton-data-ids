  content: "The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API),
    as defined in RFC-1508 and subsequent Internet Draft documents, provides security
    services to callers (applications) in a generic fashion, supportable with a range
    of underlying mechanisms and technologies, allowing source-level portability of
    applications to different environments.                                                              Multi-party
    security contexts, where security context information is shared amongst more than
    two session peers, have received little consideration within the scope of the
    GSS-API.  This document describes details of one approach for supporting multi-party
    security services within the GSS-API.\n\t "

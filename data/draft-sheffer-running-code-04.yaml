  content: "   This document describes a simple process that allows authors of\n   Internet-Drafts
    to record the status of known implementations by\n   including an Implementation
    Status section.  This will allow\n   reviewers and working groups to assign due
    consideration to documents\n   that have the benefit of running code, by considering
    the running\n   code as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that
    has\n   made the implemented protocols more mature.\n\n   The process in this
    document is offered as an experiment.  Authors of\n   Internet-Drafts are encouraged
    to consider using the process for\n   their documents, and working groups are
    invited to think about\n   applying the process to all of their protocol specifications.
    \ The\n   authors of this document intend to collate experiences with this\n   experiment
    and to report them to the community.\n\n\t "

  content: "   There are many architectural assumptions regarding DNS behavior that\n
    \  are not specified in the IETF standards documents describing DNS, but\n   which
    are deeply embedded in the behavior as expected by Internet\n   protocols and
    applications.  These assumptions are inherent parts of\n   the network architecture
    of which the DNS is one component.\n\n   It has long been known that it is possible
    to use DNS wildcards in\n   ways that violate these assumptions.  More recently
    there have been\n   deployments of middleboxes -- in most cases recursive nameservers
    or\n   DNS proxies at the ISP level -- that synthesize answers in ways that\n
    \  not only violate these assumptions but also violate the DNS\n   architecture.\n\n
    \  Experience with DNS synthesis in the DNS infrastructure have show\n   that
    the cost of violating these assumptions is significant.  In this\n   document
    we provide an explanation of how DNS wildcards function, and\n   many examples
    of how their injudicious use negatively impacts both\n   individual Internet applications
    and indeed the Internet architecture\n   itself.  We also explain that similar
    problems arise with the\n   synthesis of DNS responses by middleboxes.\n\n   We
    recommend that DNS wildcards should not be used in a zone unless\n   the zone
    operator has a clear understanding of the risks, and that\n   they should not
    be used without the informed consent of those\n   entities which have been delegated
    below the zone.\n\n   In addition we recommend that middleboxes do not perform
    DNS query\n   synthesis unless (1)there are informed consents of those that use
    the\n   forwarding name server, and (2)there exists an opt-out mechanism that\n
    \  allows them to receive the original DNS answers.\n\n\t "

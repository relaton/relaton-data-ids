  content: "This document proposes an alternative IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures
    (6rd) deployment model to that of RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts
    to gain access to IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels.
    \ 6rd requires support by a device (the 6rd customer edge, or 6rd-CE) on the customer
    site, which must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model described
    in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an operator-owned Gateway collocated
    with the operator's IPv4 network edge rather than from customer equipment, and
    hence is termed \"Gateway-initiated 6rd\" (GI 6rd).  The advantages of this approach
    are that it requires no modification to customer equipment and avoids assignment
    of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The latter point means less pressure
    on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth environment.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

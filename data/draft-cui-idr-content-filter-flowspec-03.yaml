  content: "   The BGP Flow Specification enables the distribution of traffic filter\n
    \  policies (traffic filters and actions) via BGP, facilitating DDoS\n   traffic
    filtering.  However, the traffic filter in FSv1 and FSv2\n   predominantly focuses
    on IP header fields, which may not adequately\n   address volumetric DDoS attack
    traffic characterized by fixed\n   patterns within the packet content.  This document
    introduces a new\n   flow specification filter type designed for packet content
    filtering.\n   The match field includes ptype, otype, offset, content-length,\n
    \  content, and mask encoded in the Flowspec NLRI.  This new filter aims\n   to
    leverage network devices such as routers and switches to defend\n   against simple
    volumetric DDoS attacks, reducing the overall defence\n   cost of carrier network.\n\n\t "

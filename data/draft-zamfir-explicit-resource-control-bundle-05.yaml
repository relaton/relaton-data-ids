  content: "   Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been used \n
    \  extensively by the service providers. However, when TE links are \n   bundled,
    identification of label resource in RRO is not enough for \n   the administrative
    purpose. Network service providers would like to \n   know the component link
    within a TE link that is being used by a\n   given LSP. In other words, when link
    bundling is used, resource \n   recording requires mechanisms to specify the component
    link \n   identifier, along with the TE link identifier and Label. As , it is
    \n   not possible to record component link in the RRO, this draft defines \n   the
    extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to specify \n   component link identifiers
    for resource recording purposes.  \n    \n   This draft also defines the ERO counterpart
    of the RRO extension. The \n   ERO extensions are needed to perform explicit label/
    resource control \n   over bundled TE link. Hence, this draft defines the extensions
    to \n   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to specify component link identifiers
    \n   for explicit resource control and recording over GMPLS link bundles.  \n\t "

  content: "IMAP4 is being used to serve rich media content in environments\nthat
    extend beyond traditional text-based e-mail.  One example is a\ncellular telephone
    that can retrieve and send MIME-encoded audio\ndata through IMAP4.  While this
    type of content can be exchanged\nnatively using IMAP4, some applications will
    work better if the\nmessage content can be manipulated using schemes external
    to the\nIMAP4 connection.  In our cellular telephone example, it might be\npreferable
    for the telephone client to retrieve the audio data\nusing RTSP.  This specifications
    defines a mechanism for an IMAP4\nclient to request message content from a server
    through an external\nscheme.\n\t "

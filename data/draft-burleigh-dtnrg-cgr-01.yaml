abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Contact Graph Routing (CGR), a procedure for
    computing efficient Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) bundle forwarding routes between
    source and destination endpoints when connectivity between pairs of neighboring
    bundle protocol agents in the network is scheduled and episodic rather than continuous.</p>"

  content: "With the increasing deployment of IPv6 networks, IPv6 transition has\nbecome
    one of the key problems in developing IPv6 networks.  Among\nvarious transition
    scenarios, one is common where connectivity\nbetween IPv4 networks is desired
    across IPv6-only backbone network.\nIn such case, ISP operating the IPv6 backbone
    will accommodate\nconnectivity and offer transit services for attached IPv4 networks.\nSoftwire
    WG defined softwire mesh mechanism for both of the IPv4-\nover-IPv6 scenario and
    the opposite scenario of IPv6-over-IPv4.\nSoftwire mesh uses automatic softwire
    tunnels employing multi-\nprotocol BGP extensions for distributing IPv4 routes,
    where BGP and\ntunnuls should be configured or setup as a full-mesh architecture.\nThis
    draft, however, proposed an aggregated, centralized mechanism\nsimilar to Virtual
    Aggregation (VA) mechanism, which can\nsignificantly shrink the forwarding information
    base (FIB) size of\nAddress Family Border Routers (AFBRs), reduce the total amount
    of\nrouting activity, and provide the IPv6 ISP with an easy way to\nmanage the
    transit service.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Researchers proposed practical DNS cache poisoning attacks using IP\n
    \  fragmentation.  This document shows feasible and adequate measures at\n   full-service
    resolvers and authoritative servers against these\n   attacks.  To protect resolvers
    from these attacks, avoid\n   fragmentation (limit requestor's UDP payload size
    to 1220/1232), drop\n   fragmented UDP DNS responses and use TCP at resolver side.
    \ To make a\n   domain name robust against these attacks, limit EDNS0 Responder's\n
    \  maximum payload size to 1220, set DONTFRAG option to DNS response\n   packets
    and use good random fragmentation ID at authoritative server\n   side.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses the interaction of transition mechanisms that
    can be involved during the transition phase where both IPv4 and IPv6 will be concurrently
    used. On one hand, several transition mechanisms have been defined to solve particular
    transition issues. On the other hand, one can face multiple transition issues
    and may have to use several transition mechanisms.  \nSince an applicability scope
    is attached to each transition mechanism, specifying where the mechanism applies,
    i.e. host, domain or global, this memo aims at identifying cases where multiple
    transition mechanisms may be involved within the same scope, and what the interaction
    effects among them can be.\n\t "

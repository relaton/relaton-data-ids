  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management\nprotocol
    that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its\nparticipation in any
    mobility-related signaling.  While the PMIPv6\nprotocol itself supports handover
    across interfaces and between\naccess types, there are several issues with effectively
    performing\ninter-technology handovers with network based mobility protocols.\nThis
    document aims to enumerate some known issues with such\nhandovers.\n\t "

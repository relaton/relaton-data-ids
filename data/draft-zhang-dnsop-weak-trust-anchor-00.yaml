abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is an effective method to provide
    security protection for resolvers and end users in the DNS protocols. But the
    DNSSEC is too aggressive for the DNS service in the poor network infrastructure,
    because the domain name will be invisible when large DNSSEC messages were dropped
    by some other network equipments, like the routers which have MTU problem or the
    old firewalls which do not support ENDS0. This document defines a new concept
    weak trust anchor which can be used on a security-aware resolver to get rid of
    the above problem.</p>"

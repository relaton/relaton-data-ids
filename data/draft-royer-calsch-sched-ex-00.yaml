  content: "A proposal to specify booked persistent data in calendar stores to track\n'SEQUENCE'
    and 'DTSTAMP' property values for CUAs with direct access to\ncalendar stores.\n\nWith
    iMIP the iCalendar CUA's do not see the others stored CS data. With\nWebDAV, HTTP,
    or FTP access, the CUA can see into the public data of\nother calendars. The storage
    of persistent data mandated by [iTIP] has not been standardized yet. This memo
    proposes a way to standardize on\nthose persistent items.\n\nAlso included are
    ways to make the various ways of using the [iCAL] and\n[iTIP] 'RECURRENCE-ID'
    property work between vendors and to document the\nprocedures to work with 'RECURRENCE-ID's.\n\t "

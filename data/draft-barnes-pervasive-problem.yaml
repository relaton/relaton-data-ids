  content: "   Documents published in 2013 have revealed several classes of\n   \"pervasive\"
    attack on Internet communications.  In this document, we\n   review the main attacks
    that have been published, and develop a\n   threat model that describes these
    pervasive attacks.  Based on this\n   threat model, we discuss the techniques
    that can be employed in\n   Internet protocol design to increase the protocols
    robustness to\n   pervasive attacks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars\n
    \  has one-way delays 4-24 minutes) and intermittent communications,\n   mainly
    because of orbital dynamics.  This document lists operational\n   methods to enable
    local DNS name resolving on celestial body networks\n   such that there are no
    real-time query and response flow to the\n   authoritative name servers on (Earth)
    Internet.\n\n\t "

  content: "In this document we present Architecture and Framework for Wireless\nVPN
    services. The wireless VPN services discussed here focus on\nmobility users of
    GSM and 3G services. This document does not\ndiscuss Wireless LAN services provided
    by 802.11 standard.\nIn this document wireless VPN services are presented as a
    VPN\nservice with special requirements, underlying physical layer\ncharacteristics
    are considered out of scope.\nThe purpose of the document is to initiate the discussion
    on WVPN\nwith the possibility of expanding the PPVN charter to include WVPN.\n\n\t "

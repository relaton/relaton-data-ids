abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a number of use cases of applications running on
    endpoints located in cellular networks and whose performances highly depend on
    network information. This document first, shows how the performances of these
    applications can be further improved with ALTO provided abstracted network information
    and transportation means thereof. Second, upon reviewing the existing ALTO capabilities,
    it lists the ALTO features that need to be extended or defined to support the
    presented use cases.</p>"

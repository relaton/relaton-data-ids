  content: "   This document outlines work to be done and documents to be produced\n
    \  by the Operational Security Capabilities (OPSEC) Working Group.  The\n   goal
    of the working group is to codify knowledge gained through\n   operational experience
    about feature sets that are needed to securely\n   deploy and operate managed
    network elements providing transit\n   services at the data link and IP layers.
    \ The intent is to provide\n   clear, concise documentation of capabilities necessary
    for operating\n   networks securely, to assist network operators in communicating
    their\n   requirements to vendors, and to provide vendors with input that is\n
    \  useful for building more secure devices.  The working group will\n   produce
    a list of capabilities appropriate for large Internet Service\n   Provider (ISP)
    and Enterprise Networks.  This work is intended to\n   refine [RFC3871].\n\t "

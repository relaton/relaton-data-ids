  content: "   It is commonly assumed that a system controller or network management\n
    \  system has complete knowledge of the data plane, especially in a\n   software-defined
    network (SDN).  That is, the controller knows\n   performance metrics such as
    the flow table size of each switch, the\n   rate of rule updates between a switch
    control plane and its data\n   plane, and the maximum latency to install a rule
    in the flow table of\n   a switch.  However, in reality, this is not the case.
    \ Measurement\n   studies show that the flow table size depends on the structure
    of the\n   rules installed.  The flow table size is much smaller if there are\n
    \  many wild card rules.  The setup latency also depends on the already\n   installed
    rules.  If there are many wild card rules installed, the\n   latency can be much
    higher.  Currently, data centers pre-setup the\n   rules long before the actual
    associated traffic starts to flow\n   through the network.  This puts constraints
    on the use cases.  In\n   this document, we first show that many use cases demand
    a more\n   predictable control plane.  The use cases are applied to networks\n
    \  that require control-plane performance information for dynamic\n   configuration,
    as well as SDN networks.  We then discuss potential\n   mechanisms to enable fine-grained
    control of control-plane\n   performance.\n\n\n\t "

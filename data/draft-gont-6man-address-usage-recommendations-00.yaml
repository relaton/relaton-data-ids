  content: "   IPv6 hosts typically configure and use a number of addresses of\n   different
    scope and stability properties.  Recent work has analyzed\n   the security and
    privacy implications of IPv6 addressing, and\n   improved the security and privacy
    properties of some of the\n   aforementioned address types.  However, advice is
    still missing\n   guidance regarding which address properties are desirable in\n
    \  different scenarios, and how such addresses should be used when they\n   are
    configured.  This document complements the aforementioned work by\n   providing
    advice regarding which address types to configure and how\n   to employ them in
    a number of popular scenarios.\n\n\t "

  content: "This proposal describes how SGML Open catalogs and MIME mechanisms are
    used to exchange SGML documents on the World Wide Web, or via email. Using the
    extension mechanism provided by Technical Resolution 9401:1995 (TR9401) [10]-
    \ TR9401 contains the technical description of SGML Open catalogs -  this proposal
    describes new catalog keywords required for SGML document interchange. In addition,
    Uniform Resource Locators (URL) [8] are used to allow greater flexibility in the
    addressing of storage objects.  This flexibility is intended to allow addressing
    of storage objects encapsulated in MIME messages, or addressable via the World
    Wide Web. A MIME body part containing an SGML Open catalog is tagged with the
    content type 'application/sgml-open-catalog' [5].\n\t "

  content: "   Passwords are a popular form of credential for user authentication.\n
    \  EAP-pwd (RFC 5931) is a popular method of performing secure password\n   authenticaiton.
    \ EAP-pwd requires a secret element in a finite cyclic\n   group, unfortunately
    the technique it uses to derive this secret is\n   open to timing and cache attacks.
    \ This improved version, EAP-pwd',\n   uses a different technique to derive the
    secret element which is\n   resistant to timing and cache attacks.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "It has been recognised that the success of the MPLS depends on the\nability
    to better support the multiservice traffic integration with\nsome levels of service
    guarantees, which are not feasible to implement\nwith the current destination
    prefix only based packet forwarding\nparadigms.\n \nThe efficient support for
    these services throughout the network is\nexpected to be possible using label
    based forwarding paradigm in the\nnetwork.\n \nHowever, the service categories
    and the enabling mechanisms to support\nthose service categories are not well
    addressed in the current\nproposals for the MPLS working group; the effort has
    mostly\nconcentrated on the handling of the best effort traffic and associated\nscalability
    and routing related issues.\n \nThe goal of this document is to define a framework
    for traffic\nmanagement in MPLS networks. We discuss the set of mechanisms that
    have\nbeen proposed for enabling the implementation of the more advanced\nservices
    than pure best-effort packet forwarding, and the impact of\nthose mechanisms with
    respect to MPLS network environments and MPLS\nprotocol implementation.\n\nThe
    document describes the mechanisms and their application with the\nintent to approach
    the level of the traffic management capabilities\nthat are currently available
    in hybrid router/ATM or frame relay\nnetworks using the MPLS. The approach taken
    is that no modifications\nare required in the end station protocol or application
    software in the\nfirst phase of deployment, while this might be allowed later,
    if deemed\nnecessary.\n \nThis document concentrates on the issues from the public
    network\noperators point of view, although most of the discussion applies as\nwell
    in the local network environments.\n \nConcepts and mechanisms described in this
    document are based on the\nprevious work done in the subject on various working
    groups of IETF and\nother standardisation bodies. It has been attempted to use
    applicable\nconcepts and terminology from previous work as\n\t "

  content: "This memo specifies mechanisms for automatically decaying OSPFv2 [1]\nmetrics
    and priorities in the event of partial, but critical, system\nfailures (errors)
    which do not cause interfaces to change state (i.e.\nthey are opaque to transient
    to data).\nThe mechanisms defined in this document, called metric auto-decay,\nallow
    operators to configure OSPFv2 networks to gracefully bypass\ndevices which have
    incurred these opaque system errors.\n\n\t "

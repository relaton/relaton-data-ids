  content: "This document specifies a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile for
    compression of TCP/IP packets. The profile, called ROHC-TCP, provides efficient
    and robust compression of TCP headers, including frequently used TCP options such
    as SACK (Selective Acknowledgments) and Timestamps.\n\n ROHC-TCP works well when
    used over links with significant error rates and long round-trip times. For many
    bandwidth-limited links where header compression is essential, such characteristics
    are common. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

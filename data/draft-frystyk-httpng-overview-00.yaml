  content: "This document gives the authors' opinion of a rough outline of (1) the\n
    \      problems to be addressed by the proposed IETF HTTP-NG Working Group;\n
    \      (2) the requirements on the solution; and (3) the architecture of the\n
    \      solution. It draws heavily on contributions from the whole Protocol\n       Design
    Group of the W3C HTTP-NG Activity. A suite of problems should\n       be addressed,
    summarized as observing that the World Wide Web's\n       tremendous success has
    created some strains on the Internet, its\n       users, and its application developers.
    The requirements on the\n       solution include modularity, extensibility, scalability,
    and\n       efficiency. The proposed solution is to factor HTTP, the Web's central\n
    \      protocol, into three layers and look into performance improvements in\n
    \      the lower two of those resultant layers.\n\t "

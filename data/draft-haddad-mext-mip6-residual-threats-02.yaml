abstract:
- content: <p>This memo aims to highlight specific "residual" threats in Mobile IPv6
    protocol. We call these threats "residual" simply because they were rightfully
    deemed not urgent during the design of Mobile IPv6 protocol. However, these threats
    are somehow benefiting from new mechanisms and/or extensions built on top of Mobile
    IPv6 protocol to improve their effects and likelihood. Hence, our main goal is
    to motivate designers to re-assess their potential taking into consideration these
    new mechanisms.</p>

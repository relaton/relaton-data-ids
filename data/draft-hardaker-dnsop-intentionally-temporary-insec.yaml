  content: "   Performing DNSKEY algorithm transitions with DNSSEC signing is\n   unfortunately
    challenging to get right in practice without decent\n   tooling support.  This
    document weighs the correct, completely secure\n   way of rolling keys against
    an alternate, significantly simplified,\n   method that takes a zone through an
    insecure state first.\n\n\t "

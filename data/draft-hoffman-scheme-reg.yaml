  content: "   This document revises the registration procedures given in RFC 2717\n
    \  based on five years of experience.  It simplifies the requirements\n   for
    getting a scheme listed by IANA by removing the technical review\n   and allowing
    multiple registrants to share a scheme name.\n\t "

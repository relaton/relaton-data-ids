  content: "General electronic mail (email) provides a facility for exchanging\n     messages
    of seemingly arbitrary content.  In common email usage, text\n     is the primary
    media with one or more attachments.\n\n     A class of special-purpose computers
    has evolved to provide voice\n     messaging services.  These machines generally
    interface to a telephone\n     switch and provide call answering and voice messaging
    services.\n     Message exchange between these voice-mail only systems can best
    be\n     achieved using VPIM Version 2.\n\n     Fax messaging is another special
    purpose messaging system which\n     interface to a telephone switch and provide
    the ability to send and\n     receive images over the PSTN.  When sending these
    messages over the\n     Internet rather than the PSTN, the simple mode fax profile
    defined in\n     RFC ABCD should be used.\n\n     Other electronic messaging systems
    include paging, and short message\n     service.  It is expected that other messaging
    systems developed for\n     specific environments will continue to be developed.\n\n
    \    This profile defines a new version of the VPIM specification for the\n     interchange
    of voice messages between a voice messaging system as\n     defined in [VPIM]
    and a unified messaging system.  In this sense, a\n     unified messaging system
    is capable of sending and receiving each of\n     several different message types.
    \ Typical unified messaging systems\n     today consolidate fax messages, voice
    messages, and email messages\n     into a single system and permit the forwarding
    a received message of\n     one type as an attachment to a message of another
    type.\n\n     Further, this profile will define the interactions between a media\n
    \    agnostic (multi-media) messaging system with unified messaging and\n     voice
    messaging systems.  A media agnostic system may combine several\n     media into
    a single message.  Such a message may not have primary a\n     media but rely
    upon several components to\n\t "

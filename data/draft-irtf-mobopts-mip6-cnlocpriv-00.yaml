  content: "   Mobile IPv6 does not allow a mobile node to hide its location from
    a\n   correspondent node without compromising optimized routing.  Hence, a\n   mobile
    node has the choice: it can either get location privacy\n   support or short packet
    delay, but not both at the same time.  This\n   document discusses the problem
    of achieving both simultaneously and\n   specifies a solution.  The solution utilizes
    the Mobile IPv6\n   bootstrapping mechanisms and does neither introduce new network\n
    \  entities nor changes to home agent or correspondent node\n   implementations.\n\t "

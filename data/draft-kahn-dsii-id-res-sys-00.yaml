  content: "Identifier Systems have been in existence for many years and are in\n
    \  widespread use. An opaque identifier conveys essentially nothing\n   about
    the information identified and must be converted into useful\n   intermediate
    information, known as state information, before the\n   information being identified
    can be accessed or used. An identifier\n   that is can be processed by a system
    in the Internet to provide\n   useful and actionable intermediate state information
    is said to be\n   resolvable. Although there is ongoing discussion about the value
    of\n   opaque versus non-opaque identifiers, we assume the existence of a\n   minimal
    syntax structure for the identifier and also that the\n   resolution mechanisms
    only knows about the minimal syntax of the\n   identifier. In this document we
    introduce the notion of\n   interoperability of identifier resolution systems
    as a key component\n   for enabling interoperability of heterogeneous information
    systems\n   more broadly, and discuss the role of unique persistent resolvable\n
    \  identifiers.  Terminology is proposed to facilitate this discussion\n   and
    a set of use cases demonstrating the need for interoperability of\n   resolution
    systems are included.\n\t "

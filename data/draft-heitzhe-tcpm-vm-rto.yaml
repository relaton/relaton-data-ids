  content: "   A Round Trip Time (RTT) estimate that decays performs badly in a\n
    \  bursty environment. A round trip time estimator that does not decay\n   for
    a period of time is proposed.\n\n   It does not require a minimum value to be
    configured. It works\n   equally well when the typical RTT is 100uS as when it
    is 10 seconds.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>{ Work in progress to update the OpenPGP specification from RFC4880.
    Editorial notes are enclosed in curly braces. } { This draft is based on the Git
    head as pf rfc4880bis-10 before the great refactoring. That refactoring, dubbed
    crypto-refresh, basically started from scratch with lots of re-formatting and
    switching to a Gitlab based approach with merge requests mainly prepared in advance
    by one of the chairs. This was done despite that -10 was basically ready for last
    call after a long iterative process adding feature by feature with rough consent
    from the WG. Due to the IETF submission system the draft was renamed but nevertheless
    is in apostolic succession of draft-ietf-openpgp- rfc4880bis-10 } This document
    specifies the message formats used in OpenPGP. OpenPGP provides encryption with
    public-key or symmetric cryptographic algorithms, digital signatures, compression
    and key management. This document is maintained in order to publish all necessary
    information needed to develop interoperable applications based on the OpenPGP
    format. It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an application. It describes
    only the format and methods needed to read, check, generate, and write conforming
    packets crossing any network. It does not deal with storage and implementation
    questions. It does, however, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid
    security flaws.</p>"

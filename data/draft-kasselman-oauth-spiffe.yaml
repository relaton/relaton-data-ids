abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   The OAuth framework is a widely deployed authorization protocol\n   standard
    that enables applications to obtain limited access to user\n   resources.  OAuth
    clients must be registered with the OAuth\n   authorization server, which poses
    significant operational challenges\n   in dynamically scaling environments.  The
    Secure Production Identity\n   Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) is a graduated
    Cloud Native Compute\n   Foundation project designed to dynamically attest and
    verify workload\n   identity.  This draft describes how workloads with SPIFFE
    credentials\n   can be used with OAuth to lessen the operational burden of client\n
    \  registration through a \"register on first use\" principle.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "There is no requirement for identities identities asserted by a UA in
    \na SIP message to be anything other than the user’s desired alias. An \nauthenticated
    identity of a user can be obtained using SIP \nauthentication, however it is unlikely
    that the necessary Public Key \nInfrastructure to facilitate this for UAs will
    be available soon. \nA Network Asserted Identity is an identity obtained by a
    SIP network \nintermediary as a result of an authentication process. This draft
    \ndescribes short term requirements for the exchange of Network \nAsserted Identities
    within networks of securely interconnected \ntrusted nodes and to User Agents
    securely connected to such networks. \nGeneral requirements for transport of Network
    Asserted Identities on \nthe Internet are out of scope of this draft.\n\t "

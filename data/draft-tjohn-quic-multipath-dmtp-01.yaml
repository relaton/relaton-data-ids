  content: "   This document proposes the Deadline-aware Multipath Transport\n   Protocol
    (DMTP) concept as an extension to the Multipath Extension\n   for QUIC (QUIC-MULTIPATH)
    as well as QUIC itself.  This extension\n   aims to support data streams with
    strict latency requirements by\n   enabling the signaling of a stream's deadline
    and ideally by\n   combining multipath scheduling, congestion control adaptations,
    and\n   optional forward error correction (FEC).  Moreover, DMTP leverages\n   the
    path identifiers introduced by the Multipath Extension for QUIC\n   to distinguish
    different end-to-end paths as they may be offered in a\n   Path Aware Network
    (PAN) such as SCION.  This allows an application\n   to select its preferred paths
    while maintaining interoperability with\n   standard endpoints using the Multipath
    Extension for QUIC.  In\n   combination, DMTP enables endpoints to exchange and
    schedule\n   deadline-aware streams across multiple network paths.  Additionally,\n
    \  this proposal also maintains compatibility with QUIC itself, in order\n   to
    deliver its benefits - albeit with limited effectiveness - even in\n   scenarios
    where only a single path can or should be used.\n\n\t "

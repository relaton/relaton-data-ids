  content: "This document describes two fully-specified simple FEC schemes for\nReed-Solomon
    codes that can be used to protect media streams along\nthe lines defined by the
    FECFRAME framework.  Reed-Solomon codes\nbelong to the class of Maximum Distance
    Separable (MDS) codes which\nmeans they offer optimal protection against packet
    erasures.  They\nare also systematic codes, which means that the source symbols
    are\npart of the encoding symbols.  The price to pay is a limit on the\nmaximum
    source block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols,\nand a computational
    complexity higher than that of LDPC codes for\ninstance.\n\nThe first scheme is
    for Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 <= m\n<= 16 and arbitrary packet
    flows.  The second scheme is similar to\nthe first scheme, with the exception
    that it is restricted to a\nsingle sequenced flow.\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses a number of considerations related to the\n
    \  topologies of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions initated\n   using
    the Session Description (SDP) unicast Offer/Answer Model,\n   especially as applied
    to source-multiplexed sessions.\n\n   The primary observation is that certain
    topologies cannot be created\n   by unicast SDP Offer/Answer.  Notably, the it
    is not possible to\n   negotiate the topology that RFC 5117 calls Topo-Transport-Translator\n
    \  (or \"relay\").\n\n   As a consequence of this limitation, certain topological
    assumptions\n   can safely be made for RTP sessions initiated using unicast SDP\n
    \  Offer/Answer; and therefore, certain optimizations to RTP are\n   possible
    in such sessions.  This document also describes the\n   optimizations that these
    assumptions make possible.\n\n\t "

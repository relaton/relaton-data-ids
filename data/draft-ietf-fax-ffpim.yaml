  content: "Classic facsimile document exchange represents both a set of technical
    specifications and a class of service.  Previous work has replicated some of that
    service class as a profile within Internet mail.  The current specification defines
    \"full mode\" carriage of facsimile data over the Internet, building upon that
    previous work and adding the remaining functionality necessary for achieving reliability
    and capability negotiation for Internet mail, on a par with classic T.30 facsimile.
    \ These additional features are designed to provide the highest level of interoperability
    with the standards-compliant email infrastructure and mail user agents, while
    providing a level of service that approximates what is currently enjoyed by fax
    users. [PROPOSED STANDARD]\n\t "

  content: "   BGP Flow Specification (Flowspec) provides a mechanism to distribute\n
    \  traffic flow specifications and the forwarding actions to be\n   performed
    to the specific traffic flows.  A set of Flowspec\n   components are defined to
    specify the matching criteria that can be\n   applied to the packet, and a set
    of BGP extended communities are\n   defined to encode the actions a routing system
    can take on a packet\n   which matches the flow specification.\n\n   An IETF Network
    Slice enables connectivity between a set of Service\n   Demarcation Points (SDPs)
    with specific Service Level Objectives\n   (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations
    (SLEs) over a common underlay\n   network.  To meet the connectivity and performance
    requirements of\n   network slice services, network slice service traffic needs
    to be\n   mapped to a corresponding Network Resource Partition (NRP).  The edge\n
    \  nodes of the NRP needs to identify the traffic flows which belong to\n   a
    network slice and steer the matched traffic into the corresponding\n   NRP, or
    a specific path within the corresponding NRP.\n\n   BGP Flowspec can be used to
    distribute the matching criteria and the\n   forwarding actions to be preformed
    on network slice service traffic.\n   The existing Flowspec components can be
    reused for the matching of\n   network slice services flows at the edge of an
    NRP.  New components\n   and traffic action may need to be defined for steering
    network slice\n   service flows into the corresponding NRP.  This document defines
    the\n   extensions to BGP Flowspec for IETF network slice traffic steering\n   (NS-TS).\n\n\t "

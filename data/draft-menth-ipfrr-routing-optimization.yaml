  content: "This draft gives a summary of findings about routing optimization of\nnot-via
    addresses [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses] and LFAs\n[RFC5286] in IP networks.
    \ The optimization is done only by tuning IP\nlink costs.  Optimization goals
    for both IP FRR techniques is the\nmaximum link utilization in the failure-free
    scenario and for a set\nof failure scenarios such as all single link (and node)
    failures as\nwell as the failure coverage by LFAs.  For LFAs, the failure coverage\nis
    another optimization goal.\n\t "

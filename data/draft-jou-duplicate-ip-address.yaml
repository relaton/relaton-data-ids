  content: "   The Address Resolution Protocol specifies the scheme to resolve the\n
    \  hardware address of a host by using its IP address. The hardware\n   addresses
    are normally unique for each hardware module because they\n   were assigned by
    manufacturers; but there is much less control on the\n   uniqueness of IP addresses
    on a LAN. With the booming network\n   popularity, the possibility of the same
    IP address being used on\n   different hosts is increasing. The duplication may
    come from users'\n   or network administrators' mistakes, or configuration errors
    on host\n   addresses assigning programs such as BOOTP or DHCP servers. This\n
    \  document is to define an extension to the original ARP protocol to\n   prevent
    a newly configured host from making much damage to a host\n   that has been the
    owner of the same IP address. The solution is\n   based on the de-facto gratuitous
    ARP packets with modification on a\n   host's behavior when an address duplication
    is detected.\n\n\t "

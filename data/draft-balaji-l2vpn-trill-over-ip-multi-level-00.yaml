  content: "   There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or (b) TRILL\n
    \  based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities\n   or
    (c) Campus TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more\n   ISPs that provide
    regular IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. A few\n   solutions have been proposed as
    in [1] in the recent past that have\n   not looked at the PB-like functionality.
    These solutions have not\n   dealt with the details as to how these services could
    be provided\n   such that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected with issues\n
    \  like nick-name collisons for unicast and multicast being taken care\n   of.
    It has been found that with extensions to BGP the problem\n   statement which
    we will define below can be handled. Both control\n   plane and data plane operations
    can be driven into the solution to\n   make it seamlessly look at the entire set
    of TRILL sites as a single\n   entity which then can be viewed as one single Layer
    2 cloud. MAC\n   moves across TRILL sites and within TRILL sites can be realized.
    This\n   document / proposal envisions the use of BGP-MAC-VPN vrfs both at the\n
    \  IP cloud PE devices and at the peripheral PEs within a TRILL site\n   providing
    Provider Backbone like functionality. We deal in depth with\n   the control plane
    and data plane particulars for unicast and\n   multicast with nick-name election
    being taken care of as part of the\n   solution.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the extensions needed by certain \nfeatures for
    the purpose of RSVP Graceful Restart. One of \nthese extensions refers to the
    ability of a node to recover \nthe ERO in the case it has performed an ERO expansion
    before \ncontrol plane restart. Also a small modification is proposed \nin the
    basic procedure to support simultaneous multiple node \nrestarts in a network.
    Specifically, a node should use a non-\nzero Recovery Time while in the recovery
    phase. This allows a \nnode to determine at restart time if any of its neighbors
    has \npreviously restarted and it is currently in the recovery phase. \n\t "

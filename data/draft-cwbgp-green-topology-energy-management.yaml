  content: "   This document defines a YANG Network Topology Data Model that can be\n
    \  used for Energy Efficiency Management within a network.  The model\n   provides
    both network-centric view of energy consumption of network\n   devices and device
    view of energy consumption of individual\n   components within network devices.\n\n\t "

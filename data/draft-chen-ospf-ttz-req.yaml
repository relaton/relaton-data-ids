  content: "   This document presents a list of requirements for OSPF topology-\n
    \  transparent zone in a domain.  A topology-transparent zone comprises\n   a
    group of routers and a number of links connecting these routers.\n   Any router
    outside of the zone is not aware of the zone.  The\n   information about the links
    and routers inside the zone is not\n   distributed to any router outside of the
    zone.  Any link state change\n   such as a link down inside the zone is not seen
    by any router outside\n   of the zone.\n\n\t "

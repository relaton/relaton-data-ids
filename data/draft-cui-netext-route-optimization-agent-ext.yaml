  content: "Route Optimization is a very useful feature in Mobile IPv6. Mobile \nnode
    can communicate with correspondent node without the involvement \nof the home
    agent in Route Optimization mode. But there are some \nlimitations to this feature.
    One problem is that the mobile node and \nthe correspondent node must be capable
    for Route Optimization. This \ndocument introduces a Route Optimization Agent
    function used for \nRoute Optimization and this extension mechanism can enable
    Route \nOptimization mode to be used between mobile node and simple IP node. \nIn
    the extension solution, the Route Optimization Agent function may \nbe implemented
    in LMA or MAG and the Agent entity can reflect the  \nRO-related signal messages
    and accomplish the Route Optimization \nprocedure on behalf of the simple IP node.
    \n\n \n\n \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   An organization that owns web content often prefers to delegate\n   hosting
    of this content to a Content Delivery Network (CDN).  To\n   serve HTTP content
    securely, it needs to be protected with TLS.  This\n   document proposes a way
    for the CDN to request constrained\n   certificates so that it can serve web content
    on behalf of the\n   content owner, without having the owner's long term certificate.\n\n\t "

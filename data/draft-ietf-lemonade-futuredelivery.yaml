  content: "   This memo defines an extension to the SMTP submission protocol for
    a\n   client to indicate a future time for the message to be released for\n   delivery.
    \ This extension permits a client to use server-based\n   storage for a message
    that should be held in queue until an\n   appointed time in the future.  This
    is useful for clients which do\n   not have local storage or are otherwise unable
    to release a message\n   for delivery at an appointed time.\n\n\t "

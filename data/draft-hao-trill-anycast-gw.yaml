  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft mainly describes centralized anycast layer 3 gateway\n   solution
    in TRILL campus. Comparing to traditional VRRP based\n   active-standby layer
    3 gateway solution, this solution can achieve\n   better load balancing and scalability.
    Anycast nickname, anycast\n   gateway IP and MAC are introduced. It can ensure
    inter-subnet\n   traffic forwarding in flow-based load balancing mode among all\n
    \  physical layer 3 gateways. To avoid sending duplicated ARP reply\n   message
    to the end system, ARP master gateway election mechanism is\n   introduced. The
    election algorithm is described in this draft.\n\n\t "

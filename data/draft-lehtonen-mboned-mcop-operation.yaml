  content: "This draft defines Multicast Control Protocol (MCOP) operation for\nfirst
    hop routers.  In this context, MCOP may be used as a tool for\nmulticast network
    management.  MCOP provides multicast network remote\nmanagement with centralized
    information database located at Multicast\nControl Server (MCS).  It allows gradual,
    group and network specific\nmulticast network deployment.  The control is done
    by MCOP enabled\nfirst hop routers, Multicast Control Clients (MCC), based on
    the\ninformation received from the MCS.  MCC can filter IGMP/MLD reports\nand
    multicast packets before they reach the IGMP/MLD processing layer\nor multicast
    routing stack of the router.  MCOP is independent of\nmulticast routing protocols.\n\t "

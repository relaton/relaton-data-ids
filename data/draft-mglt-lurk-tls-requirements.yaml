  content: "   In the TLS/DTLS Content provider Edge Server Split use case, a TLS\n
    \  Client uses TLS/DTLS to authenticates the Content Provider while\n   establishing
    a TLS/DTLS session with the Edge Server.  Such\n   authentication scheme is designated
    as Split Authentication in this\n   document.\n\n   In most cases, the Edge Server
    does not even belong to the Content\n   Provider, but instead to a third party
    like, for example, a Content\n   Delivery Network.  As a result, the Content Provider
    and the Edge\n   Server must be able to interact and/or share some information.\n
    \  Interactions and shared information constitutes a split\n   authentication
    model varies with the authentication method involved\n   in the TLS session.\n\n
    \  For each TLS/DTLS authentication method, the document provides the\n   associated
    split authentication model that makes possible a split\n   authentication.  The
    split authentication model is associated to\n   security requirements and an analysis
    to show it does not introduce\n   any weakness compared to the standard TLS authentication
    model.\n\n\t "

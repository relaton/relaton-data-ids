  content: "   This document provides guidance for the advancement of the protocols\n
    \  produced within the IETF Routing Area.  It places implementation and\n   interoperability
    constraints on protocols earlier in the standards\n   process than RFC 2026, based
    on RFC 2026's provision that the IESG\n   may require implementation and/or operational
    experience prior to\n   granting Proposed Standard status to a specification that
    materially\n   affects the core Internet protocols or that specifies behavior
    that\n   may have significant operational impact on the Internet.\n\n   We also
    discuss the applicability of these rules to protocols and\n   their extensions.\n\t "

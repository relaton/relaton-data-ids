  content: "   This document reports lessons learned from an experimental deployment\n
    \  of service chaining with Segment Routing over the IPv6 data plane\n   (SRv6)
    at an event network.  The service chaining part of the network\n   was comprised
    of four SRv6-capable nodes (three products from\n   different vendors), five SRv6
    proxy nodes (two products from\n   different vendors and three open source software),
    and six services.\n   This network was deployed at Interop Tokyo 2019, and it
    successfully\n   provided network connectivity and services to all the exhibitors
    and\n   visitors on the event.\n\n\t "

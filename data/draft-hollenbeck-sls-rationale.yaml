  content: "   Developing technology to support truly internationalized Internet\n
    \  identifiers is proving difficult within the framework of the existing\n   Domain
    Name System (DNS).  At the same time, the DNS continues to do\n   an excellent
    job at serving its original mandate for providing\n   efficient mappings between
    machine-readable labels and network\n   resources.  However, it is clear that
    the existing DNS cannot be\n   transformed into a service that can handle the
    more human-oriented\n   identification services it is now being asked to provide.
    \ This\n   document describes the rationale for a directory layer above the\n
    \  existing DNS that can better solve these problems.\n\t "

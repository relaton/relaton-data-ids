abstract:
- content: "<p>The Cosmos Protocol (Trust-Native Semantic Protocol) defines a badge-
    based identity and communication system intended for deployments that prefer not
    to rely on external consensus or blockchain infrastructure. Cosmos supports trust-native
    communication and decentralized identity management through cryptographically
    signed badges that operate without mandatory external trust systems. The protocol
    also supports passwordless authentication flows using badge- based credentials
    and biometric authenticators, reducing reliance on traditional password mechanisms.
    The Cosmos Protocol introduces several foundational innovations that together
    form an integrated identity-native communication substrate. These include: (1)
    Badge-Based Identity -- cryptographically signed, capability-bearing identifiers
    designed to operate without requiring blockchain or distributed ledger infrastructure,
    while allowing deployments to integrate such systems if desired; (2) Trust Scoring
    -- reputation-anchored trust models (domain-bound for DNS networks, star-bound
    for Cosmos-native networks) that enable cross-star capability granting and trust-based
    authorization without requiring new badges; (3) Lumen Encryption -- uses post-quantum
    candidate cryptographic primitives (see [RFC-XXXX-Lumen]), badge-native encryption
    designed to support forward secrecy; (4) Echo Grammar -- semantic message structures
    that provide intent clarity, UI hints, and agent compatibility; (5) Capsule System
    -- universal, encrypted containers for communication and storage; (6) Slipstream
    Transport (TNTP) -- a trust-native transport protocol with badge-based sessions,
    intent-aware routing, and the ability to operate without blockchain or external
    consensus dependencies; (7) Ramp and SDFF Serialization -- deterministic text
    and binary formats that provide canonical structure for all Cosmos data; (8) Profile
    System -- portable, domain-scoped user profiles with badge-based access control;
    and (9) Productivity Protocols -- standardized scheduling, contacts, and calendaring
    protocols (Comet, Nebula, Nova) that provide a badge-native model that can serve
    as an alternative to multiple legacy standards. Cosmos badges are Ramp (Slope
    Data Format, SDF) documents with optional DID compatibility, allowing integration
    with existing decentralized identity systems while preserving the protocol's self-
    contained architecture within Cosmos deployments. The badge system addresses key
    limitations in current identity approaches, including the lack of enterprise-grade
    lifecycle management, star-bound trust establishment, and the ability to operate
    independently of external infrastructure in constrained or disconnected environments.
    The protocol provides a viable alternative to complex identity stacks while maintaining
    interoperability with existing standards, making it suitable for both greenfield
    deployments and integration with existing systems.</p>"

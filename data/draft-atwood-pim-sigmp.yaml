  content: "   This document specifies a Secure Internet Group Management Protocol\n
    \  (SIGMP), which is an extension to IGMP to enforce receiver access\n   control
    for secured multicast groups.  In SIGMP, only the hosts\n   operated by authorized
    end users are permitted to report their\n   interest in secured groups.  IPsec
    is used to filter the messages\n   that report or query the interest in secured
    groups.  SIGMP provides\n   two working modes that are fully compatible with IGMP
    v2 and IGMP v3\n   respectively.\n\n\t "

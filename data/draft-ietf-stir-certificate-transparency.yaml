abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for the use of the Certificate
    Transparency (CT) protocol for publicly logging the existence of Secure Telephone
    Identity (STI) certificates as they are issued or observed. This allows any interested
    party that is part of the STI eco-system to audit STI certification authority
    (CA) activity and audit both the issuance of suspect certificates and the certificate
    logs themselves. The intent is for the establishment of a level of trust in the
    STI eco-system that depends on the verification of telephone numbers requiring
    and refusing to honor STI certificates that do not appear in a established log.
    This effectively establishes the precedent that STI CAs must add all issued certificates
    to the logs and thus establishes unique association of STI certificates to an
    authorized provider or assignee of a telephone number resource. The primary role
    of CT in the STI ecosystem is for verifiable trust in the avoidance of issuance
    of unauthorized duplicate telephone number level delegate certificates or provider
    level certificates. This provides a robust auditable mechanism for the detection
    of unauthorized creation of certificate credentials for illegitimate spoofing
    of telephone numbers or service provider codes (SPC). The framework borrows the
    log structure and API model from RFC6962 to enable public auditing and verifiability
    of certificate issuance. While the foundational mechanisms for log operation,
    Merkle Tree construction, and Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) are aligned
    with RFC6962, this document contextualizes their application in the STIR eco-system,
    focusing on verifiable control over telephone number or service provider code
    resources.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes a framework for the use of the Certificate\n
    \  Transparency (CT) protocol for publicly logging the existence of\n   Secure
    Telephone Identity (STI) certificates as they are issued or\n   observed.  This
    allows any interested party that is part of the STI\n   eco-system to audit STI
    certification authority (CA) activity and\n   audit both the issuance of suspect
    certificates and the certificate\n   logs themselves.  The intent is for the establishment
    of a level of\n   trust in the STI eco-system that depends on the verification
    of\n   telephone numbers requiring and refusing to honor STI certificates\n   that
    do not appear in a established log.  This effectively\n   establishes the precedent
    that STI CAs must add all issued\n   certificates to the logs and thus establishes
    unique association of\n   STI certificates to an authorized provider or assignee
    of a telephone\n   number resource.  The primary role of CT in the STI ecosystem
    is for\n   verifiable trust in the avoidance of issuance of unauthorized\n   duplicate
    telephone number level delegate certificates or provider\n   level certificates.
    \ This provides a robust auditable mechanism for\n   the detection of unauthorized
    creation of certificate credentials for\n   illegitimate spoofing of telephone
    numbers or service provider codes\n   (SPC).\n\n   The framework borrows the log
    structure and API model from RFC6962 to\n   enable public auditing and verifiability
    of certificate issuance.\n   While the foundational mechanisms for log operation,
    Merkle Tree\n   construction, and Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) are aligned\n
    \  with RFC6962, this document contextualizes their application in the\n   STIR
    eco-system, focusing on verifiable control over telephone number\n   or service
    provider code resources.\n\n\t "

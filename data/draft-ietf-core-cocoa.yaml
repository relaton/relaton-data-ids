  content: "   CoAP, the Constrained Application Protocol, needs to be implemented\n
    \  in such a way that it does not cause persistent congestion on the\n   network
    it uses.  The CoRE CoAP specification defines basic behavior\n   that exhibits
    low risk of congestion with minimal implementation\n   requirements.  It also
    leaves room for combining the base\n   specification with advanced congestion
    control mechanisms with higher\n   performance.\n\n   This specification defines
    more advanced, but still simple CoRE\n   Congestion Control mechanisms, called
    CoCoA.  The core of these\n   mechanisms is a Retransmission TimeOut (RTO) algorithm
    that makes use\n   of Round-Trip Time (RTT) estimates, in contrast with how the
    RTO is\n   determined as per the base CoAP specification (RFC 7252).  The\n   mechanisms
    defined in this document have relatively low complexity,\n   yet they improve
    the default CoAP RTO algorithm.  The design of the\n   mechanisms in this specification
    has made use of input from\n   simulations and experiments in real networks.\n\n\t "

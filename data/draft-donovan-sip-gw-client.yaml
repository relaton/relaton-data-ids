  content: "This document describes a functional model of a gateway between the\nPublic
    Switched Telephony Network (PSTN) and a SIP-based IP network\nproviding telephony
    service.  In this document, the SIP-based IP\nnetwork will be referred to as Telephony
    over IP Service (TIPS).\n \nThe primary function of the gateway is to handle connections
    involving\none or more PSTN phones (i.e.; PSTN black phones) as if those\nPSTN
    phones are SIP clients.  The goal of this approach is to ensure\nthat SIP-based
    TIPS service logic applies to both native Internet-\nbased SIP clients and PSTN
    phones without modification.\n\n\t "

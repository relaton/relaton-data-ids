  content: "   This document offers an approach to initiating TLS for DNS: use of
    a\n   dedicated DNS-over-TLS port, and fallback to a mechanism for\n   upgrading
    a DNS-over-TCP connection over the standard port (TCP/53)\n   to a DNS-over-TLS
    connection.  Encryption provided by TLS eliminates\n   opportunities for eavesdropping
    on DNS queries in the network, such\n   as discussed in RFC 7258.  In addition
    it specifies two usage\n   profiles for DNS-over-TLS.  Finally, it provides advice
    on\n   performance considerations to minimize overheads from using TCP and\n   TLS
    with DNS, pertaining to both approaches.\n\n\t "

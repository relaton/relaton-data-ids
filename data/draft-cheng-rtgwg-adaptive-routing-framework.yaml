  content: "   In many cases, ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) flow-based hashing leads\n
    \  to high congestion and variable flow completion time. This reduces\n   applications
    performance. Load balancing based on local link quality\n   is not always optimal,
    A global view of congestion, with information\n   from remote links, is needed
    for optimal balancing. Adaptive routing\n   is a technology that makes dynamic
    routing decision based on changes\n   in traffic load and network topology.\n\n
    \  This document describes a framework for Adaptive Routing.\n   Specifically,
    it identifies a set of adaptive routing components,\n   explains their interactions,
    and exemplifies the workflow mechanism.\n\n\t "

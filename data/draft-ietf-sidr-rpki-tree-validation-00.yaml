  content: "   This document currently describes the approach to validate the\n   content
    of the RPKI certificate tree, as used by the RIPE NCC RPKI\n   Validator.  This
    approach is independent of a particular object\n   retrieval mechanism.  This
    allows it to be used with repositories\n   available over the rsync protocol,
    the RPKI Repository Delta\n   Protocol, and repositories that use a mix of both.\n\n
    \  This algorithm does not rely on content of repository directories,\n   but
    uses the Authority Key Identifier (AKI) field of a manifest and a\n   certificate
    revocation list (CRL) objects to discover manifest and\n   CRL objects issued
    by a particular Certificate Authority (CA).  It\n   further uses the hashes of
    manifest entries to discover other objects\n   issued by the CA.\n\n   If the
    working group finds that algorithm outlined here is useful for\n   other implementations,
    we may either update future revisions of this\n   document to be less specific
    to the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator\n   implementation, or we may use this document
    as a starting point of a\n   generic validation document and keep this as a detailed
    description\n   of the actual RIPE NCC RPKI Validator implementation.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not have
    a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower maturity
    level or to a non standards track specification (other than specifications from
    other standards bodies).  For example, a standards track document may not have
    a normative reference to an informational RFC.  Exceptions to this rule are sometimes
    needed as the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or IETF-specific
    modes of use of such standards.  This document clarifies and updates the procedure
    used in these circumstances.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current
    Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.\n\t "

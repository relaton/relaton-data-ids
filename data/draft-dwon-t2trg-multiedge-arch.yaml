  content: "   Artificial intelligence based IoT applications demand more massive\n
    \  computing resource through networks for the process of AI tasks.  To\n   support
    these applications, some new technologies based an edge\n   computing and fog
    computing are emerging.  Especially, the\n   computation-intensive and latency-sensitive
    IoT applications such as\n   augmented reality, virtual reality and AI based inference
    application\n   is deployed with an edge computing and fog computing which are\n
    \  connected with cloud computing.  Recently, cluster-based edge system\n   is
    deployed to extend computation capacity of an edge server.  The\n   cluster-based
    edge system has the advantage that can enhace the\n   resource scalability and
    availability in edge computing and fog\n   computing.  In this draft, we present
    cluster-based edge system\n   architecture and multi-cluster edge network topology
    that consists of\n   multi-cluster edge system and core cloud.  Also, we define
    the\n   network functions and network node to configurate and operate multi-\n
    \  cluster edge network collaboratively.\n\n\t "

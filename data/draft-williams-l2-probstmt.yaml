  content: "Much discussion has resulted over the last few years regarding\nL2 triggers
    in wired and wireless scenarios. Recent wireless goals \nhave been to collect
    requirements from various IETF related working \ngroups for L2 triggers in wireless
    environments.  For example, the\nMobile IP and SeaMoby working groups require
    such L2 information\nto optimize handoff. It was the hope that the output of such
    an \neffort would be used to design an API or protocol if desired.  \nA requirements
    draft [REQ] discusses requirements from the following \nFMIPv6, low latency MIPv4,
    and SeaMoby context transfer work.  \nDiscussion over the last several months
    in the PILC working group \nraises concerns about a generic L2 trigger framework
    independent if the \nit is for wired-line or wireless application.  The goal of
    this document \nis to provide a clear problem statement of L2 triggers. Discussion
    has \nalso been documented in this problem statement regarding special needs \nof
    the wireless application.  For example, the method for communicating\nL2 information
    to L3 may be better suited for the wire-lined case (e.g.,\nMIB) but not for the
    wireless scenario. Finally, recommendations on \nwhere to go with the L2 trigger
    area in IETF has been provided. This\ndraft is preliminary.\n\n\t "

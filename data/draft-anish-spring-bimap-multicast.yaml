  content: "   Multicast forwarding in a network provides advantages in improving\n
    \  the network usage and performance.  In some cases it helps improve\n   the
    operations in managing network.  The major challenge in multicast\n   operations
    is in managing the per-flow states in the network as\n   required by all the legacy
    multicast frameworks.\n\n   This document specifies a bitmap forwarding extension
    to SRv6 to\n   support state-free forwarding model in a network.\n\n\n\t "

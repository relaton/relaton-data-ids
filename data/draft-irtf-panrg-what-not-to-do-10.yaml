  content: "   At the first meeting of the Path Aware Networking Research Group, the\n
    \  research group agreed to catalog and analyze past efforts to develop\n   and
    deploy Path Aware techniques, most of which were unsuccessful or\n   at most partially
    successful, in order to extract insights and\n   lessons for path-aware networking
    researchers.\n\n   This document contains that catalog and analysis.\n\n\t "

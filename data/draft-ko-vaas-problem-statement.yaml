  content: "   This document examines the problems and challenges associated with\n
    \  the process of setting up secure connections between authorized\n   network
    nodes.  The network nodes can be located anywhere in a\n   private or public network,
    directly connected or behind one or more\n   levels of NAT.  Setting up a secure
    connection in this environment\n   entails the resolution of various issues such
    as authentication,\n   peer discovery, virtual network address management, routing\n
    \  information exchange and connection parameters determination.\n\n\t "

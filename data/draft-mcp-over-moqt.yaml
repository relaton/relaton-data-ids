  content: "   This document defines how to use Media over QUIC Transport (MOQT) as\n
    \  the underlying transport protocol for the Model Context Protocol\n   (MCP).
    \ MCP is a protocol that enables seamless integration between\n   language model
    applications and external data sources and tools.\n   MOQT provides efficient,
    low-latency, publish-subscribe media\n   delivery over QUIC and WebTransport.
    \ This specification describes\n   the mapping of MCP messages onto MOQT objects
    and defines the\n   procedures for establishing and maintaining MCP sessions over
    MOQT.\n\n\t "

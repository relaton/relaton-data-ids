  content: "   Simple Traversal of UDP Through NATs (STUN) is a lightweight protocol\n
    \  that provides the ability for applications to determine the public IP\n   addresses
    allocated to them by the NAT.  These addresses can be\n   placed into protocol
    payloads where a client needs to provide a\n   publically routable IP address.
    \ STUN works with many existing NATs,\n   and does not require any special behavior
    from them.  As a result, it\n   allows a wide variety of applications to work
    through existing NAT\n   infrastructure.\n\t "

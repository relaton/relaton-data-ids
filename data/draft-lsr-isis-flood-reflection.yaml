  content: "   This document describes an optional ISIS extension that allows the\n
    \  creation of IS-IS flood reflection topologies.  Flood reflection\n   allows
    the creation of topologies where L1 areas provide transit\n   forwarding for L2
    destinations within an L2 topology.  It\n   accomplishes this by creating L2 flood
    reflection adjacencies within\n   each L1 area.  The L2 flood reflection adjacencies
    are used to flood\n   L2 LSPDUs, and they are used in the L2 SPF computation.
    \ However,\n   they are not used for forwarding.  This arrangement gives the L2\n
    \  topology better scaling properties.  In addition, only those routers\n   directly
    participating in flood reflection have to support the\n   feature.  This allows
    for the incremental deployment of scalable L1\n   transit areas in an existing
    network, without the necessity of\n   upgrading other routers in the network.\n\n\n\t "

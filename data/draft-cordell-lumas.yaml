  content: "   A number of methods and tools are available for defining the format\n
    \  of messages used for application protocols.  However, many of these\n   methods
    and tools have been designed for purposes other than message\n   definition, and
    have been adopted on the basis that they are\n   available rather than being ideally
    suited to the task.  This often\n   means that the methods make it difficult to
    get definitions correct,\n   or result in unnecessary complexity and verbosity
    both in the\n   definition and on the wire.\n\n   Lumas - Language for Universal
    Message Abstraction and Specification\n   - has been custom designed for the purpose
    of message definition.  It\n   is thus easy to specify messages in a compact,
    extensible format that\n   is readily machine manipulated to produce a compact
    encoding on the\n   wire.\n\n\t "

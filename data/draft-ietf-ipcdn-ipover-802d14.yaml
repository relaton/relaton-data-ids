  content: "   This memo defines an initial application of classical IP and ARP in\n
    \  an IEEE 802.14 Community Access Television (CATV) Residential Access\n   Network
    environment.  IEEE 802.14 services provide two independent\n   link layer service
    interfaces which are available to support IP\n   residential access networking
    services: traditional Ethernet bridging\n   (via IEEE 802.1D layer services) and
    residential ATM networking\n   services.\n \n   In this memo, the term Logical
    IP Subnetwork (LIS) is defined to\n   apply to Classical IP over ATM LIS's operating
    over IEEE 802.14\n   services as well as traditional IP over Ethernet operating
    over IEEE\n   802.14 services.\n \n   The recommendations in this draft rely on
    existing IETF standards for\n   the family of Classical IP and ARP over ATM (IPOA)
    services and for\n   IP and ARP over Broadcast Ethernet networks.  The tree-based\n
    \  hierarchic nature of the IEEE 802.14 MAC subnetwork permits\n   convenient
    extensions to Classical IPOA model for broadcast and\n   multicast in the downstream
    direction of the CATV plant.\n\n\t "

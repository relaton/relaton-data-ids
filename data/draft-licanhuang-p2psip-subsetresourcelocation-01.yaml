  content: "This file is a proposal for location and discovery of filter resources
    selected by search-conditions. The peers,which  are virtually grouped,\nconstruct
    n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical tree overlay network.\nWith cached addresses
    of peers, the overload of traffic in tree\nstructure can be avoided. The resources
    are classified into hierarchical\ndomains, and registered into the peers which
    are located in the same\ndomain virtual groups as the resources'.  This proposal
    supports\nflexible queries by a SQL-like query statement.\n\t "

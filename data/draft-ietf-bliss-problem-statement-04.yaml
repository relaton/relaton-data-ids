  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been designed as a general\npurpose
    protocol for establishing and managing multimedia sessions.\nIt provides many
    core functions and extensions in support of features\nsuch as transferring of
    calls, parking calls, and so on.  However,\ninteroperability of more advanced
    features between different vendors\nhas been poor.  This document describes the
    reason behind these\ninteroperability problems, and presents a framework for addressing\nthem.\n\t "

  content: "RFC 1639[Pis94] documents experimental long port  (LPRT)  and  long\n
    \  passive  (LPSV)  commands  that many IP Version 6 implementations are\n   using
    as the replacement for  the  PORT  and  PASV  commands  in  FTP\n   [PR85].  The
    \ author believes that this is the incorrect direction to\n   be heading and that
    the replacement for PORT and  PASV  should  carry\n   less information instead
    of more.\n \n     The  passive command (SPASV) is a replacement for the PASV command.\n
    \  It only carries port numbers and does not carry addresses. This makes\n   it
    \ usable with IPv4 and IPv6. A benefit of not carrying addresses is\n   that pure
    network address translators (NAT)  do  not  have  to  do  a\n   search-and-replace
    \  on   the  TCP  stream,  which  is  an  expensive\n   operation.  This also
    eliminates three-way FTP,  which  is  a  rarely\n   used  mode  of  operation
    \ that leaves most existing FTP servers wide\n   open to the FTP Bounce Attack
    [Hob95]. Because the FTP  PORT  command\n   is  unfriendly  to  some kinds of
    firewall configurations [Bel94] and\n   that unfriendliness is there to support
    three-way FTP,  there  is  no\n   replacement  for the PORT command -- all transfers
    should use passive\n   mode instead.\n \n     The author's inet6-apps kit (available
    \ on  ftp.ipv6.inner.net  and\n   ftp.inner.net) includes a client and server
    that supports the current\n   version of these commands. Those FTP servers implement
    this  command.\n\t "

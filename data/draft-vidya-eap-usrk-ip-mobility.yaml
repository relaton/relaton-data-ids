  content: "EAP [1] is increasingly used for network access authentication in\nvarious
    networks.  Also, key generating EAP methods are being adopted\nin various systems
    for the purposes of cryptographic protection\nbetween an EAP peer and an enforcement
    point in the network.  Key\ngenerating EAP methods produce an MSK and an EMSK
    in accordance with\n[1].  The MSK is meant for use by the EAP lower layer at the
    peer and\nthe authenticator and is used differently by various lower layers.\nThe
    EMSK hierarchy is defined in [2].  The EMSK hierarchy is meant to\nbe extensible
    to derive keys for various usages.  This document\ndefines the key hierarchy and
    key derivations for using the EMSK\nhierarchy for keying in IP mobility protocols.\n\t "

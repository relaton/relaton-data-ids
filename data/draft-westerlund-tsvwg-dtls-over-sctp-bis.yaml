  content: "   This document describes a proposed update for the usage of the\n   Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol to protect user\n   messages sent over
    the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).\n\n   DTLS over SCTP provides
    mutual authentication, confidentiality,\n   integrity protection, and replay protection
    for applications that use\n   SCTP as their transport protocol and allows client/server\n
    \  applications to communicate in a way that is designed to give\n   communications
    privacy and to prevent eavesdropping and detect\n   tampering or message forgery.\n\n
    \  Applications using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport\n   features
    provided by SCTP and its extensions.  This document intends\n   to obsolete RFC
    6083 and removes the 16 kB limitation on user message\n   size by defining a secure
    user message fragmentation so that multiple\n   DTLS records can be used to protect
    a single user message.  It\n   further updates the DTLS versions to use, as well
    as the HMAC\n   algorithms for SCTP-AUTH, and simplifies the implementation by
    some\n   stricter requirements on the establishment procedures.\n\n\t "

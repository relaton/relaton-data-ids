  content: "   The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe a set of\n
    \  conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as\n   barriers
    to the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end-\n   to-end messaging.
    \ These include, but are not limited to, key\n   management, key discovery, and
    private key handling (including peer-\n   to-peer synchronization of private keys
    and other user data across\n   devices).  Human Rights-enabling principles like
    Data Minimization,\n   End-to-End and Interoperability are explicit design goals.
    \ For the\n   goal of usable privacy, pEp introduces means to verify communication\n
    \  between peers and proposes a trust-rating system to denote secure\n   types
    of communications and signal the privacy level available on a\n   per-user and
    per-message level.  Significantly, the pEp protocols\n   build on already available
    security formats and message transports\n   (e.g., PGP/MIME with email), and are
    written with the intent to be\n   interoperable with already widely-deployed systems
    in order to ease\n   adoption and implementation.  This document outlines the
    general\n   design choices and principles of pEp.\n\n\t "

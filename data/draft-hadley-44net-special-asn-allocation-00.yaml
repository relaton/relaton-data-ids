  content: "   This document proposes reserving a pool of Autonomous System Numbers\n
    \  (ASNs) for the Amateur Radio Digital Communications Network (44Net,\n   also
    known as AMPRNet). 44Net traces its origins to the early 1980s\n   when the Class
    A network 44.0.0.0/8 was set aside for amateur packet\n   radio, enabling worldwide
    experimental and operational use by\n   licensed radio amateurs.  Recent work,
    including Ursini’s proposal to\n   reserve the IPv6 block 44::/16 for amateur
    radio, demonstrates\n   ongoing efforts to secure dedicated Internet resources
    for the\n   community.  To complement these efforts, this document recommends\n
    \  reserving approximately 25,000 ASNs for distribution to licensed\n   radio
    operators and 44Net operators to support past, present, and\n   future allocations,
    simplify routing and resource management, and\n   make it straightforward to identify
    44Net participants on the global\n   Internet.\n\n\t "

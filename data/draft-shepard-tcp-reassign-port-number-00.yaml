abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Most TCP connections are protected from spoofing attacks from off-\n
    \  path attackers by their obscurity.  This memo suggests that the few\n   TCP
    connections that aren't so protected today may be protected by\n   making them
    obscure by using random values for both port numbers.\n   The obvious difficulty
    with this approach is that the well-known port\n   number is required on the initial
    SYN to connect to the desired\n   service.  A TCP option is proposed which can
    be used during the SYN\n   and SYN-ACK exchange to request (and accomplish) reassignment
    of the\n   well known port number to a random value.\n\t "

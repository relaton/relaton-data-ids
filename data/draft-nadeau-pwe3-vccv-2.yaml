  content: "   This document describes a unified mode for Virtual Circuit\n   Connectivity
    Verification (VCCV), which provides a control channel\n   that is associated with
    a pseudowire (PW). VCCV applies to all\n   supported access circuit and transport
    types currently defined for\n   PWs, as well as those being transported by The
    MPLS Transport\n   Profile. This new mode is intended to augment those described
    in\n   RFC5085, but this document describes new rules requiring this mode\n   to
    be used as the default/mandatory mode of operation for\n   VCCV. The older types
    will remain optional.\n\n\n\n\t "

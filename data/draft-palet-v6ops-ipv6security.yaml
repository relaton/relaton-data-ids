  content: "The security policies currently applied in Internet with IPv4, \n   doesn’t
    longer apply for end-to-end security models which IPv6 will \n   enable. \n\n
    \  Today, each network is often secured by a unique device (i.e. \n   security
    gateway or firewall), that becomes a bottleneck for the end-\n   to-end security
    model with IPv6. \n\n   In addition, users and devices start to be nomadic, moving
    between \n   different networks that could have different security policies. \n\n
    \  A distributed and dynamic approach is consequently required, as\n   already
    described by [1].\n\t "

  content: "   In most countries, there are multiple kinds of police forces.\n   RFC5031
    defines a \"Service URN\" which is used to route emergency\n   calls.  The urn
    has a sub registry for different kinds of emergency\n   services that may be reached
    from different telephone numbers or\n   service numbers (as opposed to a single
    number like 112).  In many\n   countries, the \"police\" service is not a single
    service, but more\n   than one service where the service area and/or types of
    emergencies\n   they respond to are different.  In some countries there are multiple\n
    \  ambulance services.  This document defines sub registries for\n   urn:service:sos.police,
    urn:service:sos.ambulance and, for\n   completeness, urn:service:sos.fire.  It
    also provides an initial set\n   of entries for these sub registries.  These services
    are in addition\n   to the base urn:service:sos.police, etc. services.\n\n\t "

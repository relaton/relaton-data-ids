- language: en

  content: "SIP lacks a mechanism to determine which domain can claim ownership\nof
    a certain telephone number.  Due to this, it is impossible to\nestablish meaningful
    identity or to authenticate endpoints that use\ntelephone number URIs and domain
    names in their From address.  This\ndocument proposes a solution to this problem
    using a return\nroutability test.\n\t "

  content: "   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms\n   [RFC6291]
    are basic building blocks for every communication layer and\n   technology.  The
    current practice is that many technologies and\n   layers have their own OAM protocols.
    \ In the current situation there\n   is a little or no re-use of software and
    hardware in the existing OAM\n   protocols.  Vendors and operators waste a lot
    through the whole OAM\n   life-cycle when a new technology is introduced.  Integration
    of OAM\n   across multiple technologies is extremely difficult.  In many cases\n
    \  it is desirable to have a generic OAM to cover heterogeneous\n   networking
    technologies.  An example to this generic approach is the\n   Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection [BFD] mechanism that offers a way\n   to monitor, troubleshoot and maintain
    the network and services in\n   support multi-layer OAM independent of media,
    data protocols, and\n   routing protocols.  Generic OAM tools can be deployed
    over various\n   encapsulating protocols, and in various medium types.\n\n   An
    example of an environment in which a generic and integrated OAM\n   protocol would
    be valuable is Service Function Chaining.  A Service\n   Function Chaining is
    composed by series of service Functions, that\n   can act in different layers
    but providing an end-to-end chain or path\n   from a source to destination in
    a given order [I.D-ietf-sfc-problem-\n   statement].  In service function chaining
    environment it is necessary\n   to provide end to end OAM across certain or all
    entities and\n   involving many layers.  OAM information should be exchanged between\n
    \  service functions in different layers while using various\n   encapsulating
    protocols.  In some cases OAM should cross different\n   administration and/or
    maintenance domains.\n\n   This document sets out the problem statement and architecture
    for the\n   Generic OAM in the Service Layer Routing.  This document will cover\n
    \  at least the basic OAM functions and information such as Connectivity\n   Verification
    (CV), Path Verification and Continuity Checks (CC),Path\n   Discovery / Fault
    Localization and Performance Monitoring necessary\n   to monitor and maintain
    the network.\n\n\t "

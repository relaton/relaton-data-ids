- language: en

  content: "This draft proposes a framework for path quality verification over an
    \nall-optical network. Because it will be difficult to ensure quality of \na dynamically
    established path over an all-optical network, it may be \nuseful for network providers
    to have means to verify quality of a path \nbefore it is served to the subscribers.
    This draft proposes a framework \nfor such means, including requirements behind
    them and a path continuity \ncheck mechanism to verify optical-level path quality
    upon a path's \nestablishment by the GMPLS signaling. \n\n\t "

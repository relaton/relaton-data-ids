  content: "This document provides a mechanism for Autonomous Systems within an\nAS
    Confederation to survive the disconnection to other AS within the\nAS confederation
    without dropping peers.  When all links to the other\nAS in the Confederation
    break, this mechanism allows the AS to revert\nto local AS to continue communication
    with E-BGP peers.  This\nmechanism has two parts: Capability signaling between
    the two parties\nat connection start to save two AS (internal and AS Confederation
    AS)\nand a mechanism to signal the switch between AS Confederation AS and\ninternal
    AS.\n\n\t "

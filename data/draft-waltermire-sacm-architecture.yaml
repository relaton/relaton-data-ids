  content: "   This document identifies the architectural components, data flows,\n
    \  and the supporting standards needed to define an interoperable\n   automation
    infrastructure required to support timely, accurate and\n   actionable situational
    awareness over an organization's IT systems.\n   This architecture is based on
    previous use case and requirements\n   analysis.  Automation tools implementing
    the continuous monitoring\n   approach described in this document will utilize
    this infrastructure\n   together with existing and emerging event, incident and
    network\n   management standards to provide visibility into the state of assets,\n
    \  user activities and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to\n   use
    these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and\n   operational data
    to understand the organizations security posture,\n   quantify business risk,
    and make informed decisions that support\n   organizational objectives while protecting
    critical information.\n   Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment
    and automate\n   information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to\n
    \  identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation tools will be able\n   to
    integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on\n   human decisions
    to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the\n   overall attack surface.\n\n\t "

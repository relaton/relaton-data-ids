- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "We propose a user scenario framework of location-based services to \nanalyze
    security and privacy issues associated with the services.  The \nframework is
    intended to cover the most of the location-based services \navailable today and
    in near future. There are many kinds of existing and \npossible location-based
    services. Though, what is meant by location-\nbased service varies widely.  The
    framework gives people a common ground \nfrom  where  discussion on the security
    and privacy issues can start.\n\t "

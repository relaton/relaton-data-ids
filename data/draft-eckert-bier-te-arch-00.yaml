  content: "   This document proposes an architecture for BIER-TE: Traffic\n   Engineering
    for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER).\n\n   BIER-TE shares part of its architecture
    with BIER as described in\n   [I-D.wijnands-bier-architecture].  It also proposes
    to share the\n   packet format with BIER.\n\n   BIER-TE forwards and replicates
    packets like BIER based on a\n   BitString in the packet header but it does not
    require an IGP.  It\n   does support traffic engineering by explicit hop-by-hop
    forwarding\n   and loose hop forwarding of packets.  It does support Fast ReRoute\n
    \  (FRR) for link and node protection and incremental deployment.\n   Because
    BIER-TE like BIER operates without explicit in-network tree-\n   building but
    also supports traffic engineering, it is more similar to\n   SR than RSVP-TE.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a source routing paradigm that\n
    \  explicitly indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress\n   node.
    \ SR can be instantiated on the MPLS data plane (MPLS-SR) and\n   the IPv6 data
    plane (SRv6).\n\n   On the MPLS-SR data plane, a segment is encoded as an MPLS
    label, and\n   an ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.  On
    the\n   SRv6 data plane, a segment is encoded as an IPv6 address (SRv6 SID)\n
    \  [RFC8986], and an ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered\n   list
    of SRv6 SIDs in the SR header (SRH) [RFC8754].  The ingress node\n   steers packets
    into a specific path according to the ordered list of\n   segments (SR Policy)
    as defined in [RFC9256].  Service Function\n   Chaining (SFC) defines an ordered
    set of service functions and\n   subsequent \"steering\" of traffic through them.
    \ The architecture of\n   SFC is defined in [RFC7665].\n\n   This document describes
    the common failure scenarios and protection\n   mechanisms of service function
    chains in SR networks.  Then\n   implementation recommendations for protection
    of service function\n   chains are proposed.\n\n\t "

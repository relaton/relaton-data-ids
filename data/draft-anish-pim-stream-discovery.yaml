  content: "   This specification introduces a mechanism in PIM-SM [RFC4601] for the\n
    \  Last-Hop-Router (LHR) router to discover the stream information.\n   Once this
    mechanism is available the complications of the shared tree\n   procedures can
    be avoided.\n\n   The document introduces a hard-state, reliable transport for
    the\n   information about multicast streams active in the network.\n\n   This
    specification uses the existing PIM reliability mechanisms\n   defined by PIM
    Over Reliable Transport [RFC6559].  This is simply a\n   means to transmit reliable
    PIM messages and does not require the\n   support for Join/Prune messages over
    PORT as defined in [RFC6559].\n\n\n\t "

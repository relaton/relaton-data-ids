  content: "This draft is intended to point out a difference of behaviour between\nthe
    RIP protocol as described in the RFC 2453 (also STD 56) and the\nRIP protocol
    as implemented by many vendors.\nIf all the vendors apply the same rule, no problem
    arises. But, on the\ncontrary, serious problems of interoperability can occur.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This option is used by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client
    to optionally identify the type or category of user or applications it represents.
    \ The information contained in this option is an opaque field that represents
    the user class of which the client is a member.  Based on this class, a DHCP server
    selects the appropriate address pool to assign an address to the client and the
    appropriate configuration parameters.  This option should be configurable by a
    user. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

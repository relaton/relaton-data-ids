  content: "   Many of us have held a vision of the Internet as the ultimate\n   distributed
    platform that allows communication, the provision of\n   services, and competition
    from any corner of the world.  But as the\n   Internet has matured, it seems to
    also feed the creation of large,\n   centralised entities in many areas.  This
    phenomenon could be looked\n   at from many different angles, but this memo considers
    the topic from\n   the perspective of how available technology and Internet architecture\n
    \  drives different market directions.\n\n\t "

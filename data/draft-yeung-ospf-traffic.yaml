  content: "   This document describes extensions to the OSPF protocol to support\n
    \  Traffic Engineering [1].  The OSPF protocol is specified in [2], This\n   extension
    make use of opaque LSA defined in [3] and provides similar\n   information to
    what is defined in the ISIS extensions for traffic\n   engineering[4].\n\n   This
    document extends the OSPF protocol by specifying new information\n   that a router
    can place in a type 10 opaque Link State Advertisement\n   (LSA). This information
    describes additional information about the\n   state of the network that is useful
    for traffic engineering.\n\n\t "

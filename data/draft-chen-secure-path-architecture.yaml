  content: "   Some users need to choose nodes that meet security requirements to\n
    \  form secure routing and ensure that traffic can defend against\n   dynamic
    attacks during path forwarding.\n\n   In this architecture, there are four roles
    defined: attester,\n   authorizer, controller and secfunction, the interaction
    of these four\n   roles can achieve the selection of secure routing and security\n
    \  services.  The purpose of this architecture is to secure the routing,\n   including
    node static security assessment, dynamic security defense,\n   and routing path
    and security service consistency validation.\n\n\t "

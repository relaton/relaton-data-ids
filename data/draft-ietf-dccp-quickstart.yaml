  content: "This document specifies the use of the Quick-Start mechanism by the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  DCCP is a transport protocol that allows
    the transmission of congestion-controlled, unreliable datagrams.  DCCP is intended
    for applications such as streaming media, Internet telephony, and online games.
    \ In DCCP, an application has a choice of congestion control mechanisms, each
    specified by a Congestion Control Identifier (CCID).  This document specifies
    general procedures applicable to all DCCP CCIDs and specific procedures for the
    use of Quick-Start with DCCP CCID 2, CCID 3, and CCID 4.  Quick-Start enables
    a DCCP sender to cooperate with Quick-Start routers along the end-to-end path
    to determine an allowed sending rate at the start of a connection and, at times,
    in the middle of a DCCP connection (e.g., after an idle or application- limited
    period).  The present specification is provided for use in controlled environments,
    and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment
    in the global Internet.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

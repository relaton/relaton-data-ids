  content: "   Differentiated Services (diff-serv) and RSVP/Integrated Services\n
    \  (RSVP/int-serv) provide complementary approaches to the problem of\n   providing
    QoS for Internet end systems.  These approachs must be able\n   to coexist and
    effectively interoperate.  This document outlines one\n   important model for
    such interoperation, in which diff-serv is used\n   by transit networks in the
    core of the Internet while hosts and edge\n   networks use RSVP/int-serv.  It
    also contains a brief discussion of\n   some alternative models for interoperation.\n\n\t "

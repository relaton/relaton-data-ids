  content: "   The QQP protocol specifies a method for transmitting multiple\n   webservice
    requests and responses between two Hosts.  QQP plays\n   the role of transport
    protocol for the QRPC webservice protocol,\n   similar to how XML-RPC and SOAP
    often use HTTP over TCP as\n   transport protocol.\n\n   QQP is called the \"Quick
    Queues Protocol\" because it is faster\n   than transmitting XML data via HTTP
    over TCP for several reasons.\n   QQP is also designed to handle Internet Protocol
    multihoming,\n   hiding IP address changes from application layer software without\n
    \  need for introducing an additional protocol layer for that purpose.\n\n\t "

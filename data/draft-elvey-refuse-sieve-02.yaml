  content: "   This memo defines the SIEVE mail filtering language [SIEVE]\n   \"refuse\"
    extension.\n   A Joe-job is a spam run forged to appear as though it came from
    an\n   innocent party, who is then generally flooded by the bounces, MDNs\n   and
    messages with complaints.  With the Sieve \"reject\" action, MDNs\n   contribute
    to the flood of Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs;\n   SMTP level refusals usually
    don't.  With \"refuse\", Sieve gains the\n   ability to simply not accept an email
    during the SMTP transaction\n   (instead of accepting it and then sending an MDN
    [MDN] back to the\n   alleged sender using \"reject\").\n\t "

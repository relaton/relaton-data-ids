  content: "   This document provides an overview of routing technologies that\n   address
    the needs of traffic engineering and load balancing, with a\n   focus on fast
    notification for example in adaptive routing.  As the\n   scale and complexity
    of networks grow, these technologies are\n   becoming increasingly important when
    fault tolerance and rapid\n   convergence are critical.  The document explores
    existing solutions\n   from both the IETF and the broader industry, highlighting
    their\n   applicability to various use cases, including AI workloads and\n   general
    services that demand low-latency fault recovery and dynamic\n   load distribution
    across data center networks and inter data center.\n   It also offers suggestions
    for potential IETF initiatives to further\n   develop and standardize these techniques.\n\n\t "

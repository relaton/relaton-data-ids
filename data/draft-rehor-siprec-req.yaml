  content: "Session recording is a critical requirement in many business\ncommunications
    environments such as call centers and financial\ntrading floors.  In some of these
    environments, all calls must be\nrecorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.
    \ In others, calls may\nbe recorded for quality control or business analytics.\n\nRecording
    is typically done by sending a copy of the session media to\nthe recording devices.
    \ This document specifies requirements for\nextensions to SIP that will manage
    delivery of RTP media from an end-\npoint that originates media (or that has access
    to it) to a recording\ndevice.  This is being referred to as SIP-based Media Recording.\n\t "

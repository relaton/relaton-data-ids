  script: Latn
  content: "   Pairing-based cryptography, a subfield of elliptic curve\n   cryptography,
    has received attention due to its flexible and\n   practical functionality.  Pairing
    is a special map defined using\n   elliptic curves and it can be applied to construct
    several\n   cryptographic protocols such as identity-based encryption, attribute-\n
    \  based encryption, and so on.  At CRYPTO 2016, Kim and Barbulescu\n   proposed
    an efficient number field sieve algorithm named exTNFS for\n   the discrete logarithm
    problem in a finite field.  Several types of\n   pairing-friendly curves such
    as Barreto-Naehrig curves are affected\n   by the attack.  In particular, a Barreto-Naehrig
    curve with a 254-bit\n   characteristic was adopted by a lot of cryptographic
    libraries as a\n   parameter of 128-bit security, however, it ensures no more
    than the\n   100-bit security level due to the effect of the attack.  In this\n
    \  memo, we list the security levels of certain pairing-friendly curves,\n   and
    motivate our choices of curves.  First, we summarize the adoption\n   status of
    pairing-friendly curves in standards, libraries and\n   applications, and classify
    them in the 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit\n   security levels.  Then, from the
    viewpoints of \"security\" and \"widely\n   used\", we select the recommended
    pairing-friendly curves considering\n   exTNFS.\n\n\t "

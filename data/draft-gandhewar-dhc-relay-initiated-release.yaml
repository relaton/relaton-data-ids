  content: "   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is initiated by a DHCP\n
    \  client.  A DHCP server can force DHCP client to send DHCPRENEW by\n   sending
    a DHCPFORCERENEW message.  There may be multiple DHCP network\n   devices connected
    in between a DHCP client and a server, each one\n   reserving resources for the
    DHCP client.  There are no DHCP messages\n   that a relay can initiate in order
    to control the client binding.\n\n   A DHCP client may not always send a DHCPRELEASE
    message when it no\n   longer needs the IP address and network resources for the
    associated\n   services it is using.  This document specifies a way to request\n
    \  release message to be initiated by an intermediate DHCP network\n   device,
    e.g.  DHCP relay, on behalf of DHCP client.  This helps to\n   relinquish network
    resources sooner than the lease expiration time.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   As described in [I-D.xiong-rtgwg-precise-tn-requirements], the\n   deterministic
    networks not only need to offer the Service Level\n   Agreements (SLA) guarantees
    such as low latency and jitter, low\n   packet loss and high reliability, but
    also need to support the\n   precise services such as flexible resource allocation
    and service\n   isolation so as to the Precise Transport Networking.  However,
    under\n   the existing IP network architecture with statistical multiplexing\n
    \  characteristics, the existing deterministic technologies are facing\n   long-distance
    transmission, queue scheduling, dynamic flows and per-\n   flow state maintenance
    and other controversial issues especially in\n   Wide Area Network (WAN) applications.\n\n
    \  This document analyses the problems in existing deterministic\n   technologies
    to provide precise services in various industries such\n   as 5G networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document analyzes scenarios for ENUM and ENUM-like Systems, both
    \nfor ENUM used by End Users and also for ENUM-like Systems used by \noperators
    for network-specific or infrastructure purposes. It also \ngives some examples
    of ENUM Usage and proposes a new URI scheme to be \nused with ENUM. This may allow
    a way forward for the definition of \nENUM Services and also for the definition
    of the required URIs and \ntheir parameters. \nThis document therefore deals with
    information stored in the ENUM and \nthe look-up process and the usage of the
    information retived in this \nlook up process. \nIt does not deal with the administrative
    process related to the \npopulation of the relevant zones. \n\n\t "

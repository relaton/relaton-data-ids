  content: "In traditional GSTN-based fax, a coverpage is often sent before the\nactual
    document.  Some of the uses for a coverpage are:\no routing the document to the
    correct recipient\no identifying the sender\no providing comments to the recipient
    about the document\no page count\no transmission date\nCurrent fax-over-SMTP aware
    applications do not have a standard way\nto indicate that a coverpage has been
    included with a message, or that\nthere is a good possibilty that a coverpage
    is part of the message.\nThis memo provides a mechanism to indicate that a coverpage
    has been\nincluded or has probably incluced in a message.\n\t "

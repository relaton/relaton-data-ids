abstract:
- content: "<p>The YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language is currently being considered
    for a wide variety of applications throughout the networking industry at large.
    Many standards defining organizations, open source projects, and vendors are using
    YANG to develop and publish models of configuration, state data and operations
    for a wide variety of applications. At the same time, there is currently no well-known
    terminology to categorize various types of YANG models. A consistent terminology
    would help with the categorization of models, assist in the analysis the YANG
    data modeling efforts in the IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to
    the YANG-related discussions between the different groups. This document describes
    a set of concepts and associated terms to support consistent classification of
    YANG models.</p>"

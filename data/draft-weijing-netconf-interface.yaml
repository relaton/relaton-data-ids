  content: "This document specifies an XML network management interface between \na
    network managing system and a network managed system.  The XML \nnetwork management
    interface is intended for use in diverse network \nenvironments where transport,
    data and operating model requirements \nvary greatly.  It is unlikely that a single
    transport, data and \noperating model specification will meet the needs of all
    anticipated \nservice operators.  Therefore, the XML network management interface
    \nis partitioned into layered components. \n    \n\n\t "

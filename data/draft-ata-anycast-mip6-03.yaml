  script: Latn
  content: "   Today, the use of anycasting is quite limited.  In this document we\n
    \  explain a new network architecture for global anycasting to solve (1)\n   in
    practical use and able to realize with existing technology easily,\n   (2) about
    support for stateful communications keeping a session\n   information at the end
    nodes such as TCP. The architecture is based\n   on MIPv6 because there are many
    similarities between MIPv6 and global\n   anycast.\n\t "

  content: "   RFC2812 introduced the ability to set certain usermodes before\n   connection
    has occurred via a simple extension to the USER command.\n   However, this implementation
    is believed to be excessively limiting.\n   The RFC2812 implementation only allows
    a limited number of modes (+i\n   and +w) to be set.  Modern IRC servers provide
    many more modes and a\n   method is necessary to set these modes at the pre-connection
    stage.\n\n   Therefore, this specification introduces a method to allow users
    to\n   set arbitrary usermodes at the pre-connection stage while maintaining\n
    \  backward compatibility with RFC2812.\n\t "

  content: "Ethernet pseudowires are widely deployed to support packet transport of
    Ethernet services. These services in-turn provide transport for a variety of client
    networks, e.g., IP and MPLS. This document uses procedures defined in the existing
    IETF specifications of Ethernet pseudowires carried over MPLS networks.\n\n Many
    of the requirements for the services provided by the mechanisms explained in this
    document are also recognized by the MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) design effort
    formed jointly by the IETF and ITU-T. The solution described here does not address
    all of the MPLS-TP requirements, but it provides a viable form of packet transport
    service using tools that are already available.\n\n This document also serves
    as an indication that existing MPLS techniques form an appropriate basis for the
    design of a fully- featured packet transport solution addressing all of the requirements
    of MPLS-TP. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

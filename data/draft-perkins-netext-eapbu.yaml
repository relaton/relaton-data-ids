  content: "   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is commonly used for\n
    \  access authentication in many wireless networks.  EAP methods often\n   involve
    AAA servers to effect the required authentications;\n   notifications about success
    or failure are then relayed back to a\n   functional module in the access network
    known as the Network Access\n   Server.  The Binding Authentication Data option
    has been defined for\n   enabling alternative methods for authentication in the
    context of\n   Mobile IPv6, and there is a subtype allocated for AAA-based\n   authentication
    methods such as EAP.  However, some EAP methods\n   require additional handling
    that requires specification not yet\n   available in the existing documentation
    for the Binding\n   Authentication Data option.  This document provides the required\n
    \  specification for at least some very widely deployed EAP methods.  In\n   many
    situations requiring the use of EAP, this enables much faster\n   operation for
    Mobile IPv6 tunnel redirection to a wireless device's\n   new care-of address
    by avoiding having to do multiple\n   authentications.\n\n\t "

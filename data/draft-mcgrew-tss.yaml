  content: "Threshold Secret Sharing (TSS) provides a way to generate N shares\nfrom
    a value, so that any M of those shares can be used to\nreconstruct the original
    value, but any M-1 shares provide no\ninformation about that value.  This method
    can provide shared access\ncontrol on key material and other secrets that must
    be strongly\nprotected.\n\nThis note defines a threshold secret sharing method
    based on\npolynomial interpolation in GF(256) and a format for the storage and\ntransmission
    of shares.  It also provides usage guidance, describes\nhow to test an implementation,
    and supplies test cases.\n\t "

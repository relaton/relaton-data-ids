  script: Latn
  content: "      In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in \n      separate
    headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and \n      the upper-layer
    header in a packet.  There are a small number of \n      such extension headers,
    each identified by a distinct Next \n      Header value. However, it presents
    no backward compatible way \n      for incrementally introducing new IPv6 extension
    headers inside \n      the network.  \n\n      Additionally since there is no
    standard format for extension \n      headers, it becomes impossible for intermediaries
    that want to \n      deep inspect the packet to parse an incoming packet which
    \n      carries an extension header that it does not recognize. \n\n      This
    document attempts to standardize the IPv6 extension header \n      format to fix
    these issues. \n\n\t "

  content: "This document mainly analyzes the key revocation issue with host \nidentities
    (HIs) in the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). Generally, key \nrevocation is an important
    functionality of key management systems; \nit is concerned with the issues of
    removing antique cryptographic \nkeys from operational usages when they are not
    secure or not secure \nenough any more. This functionality is particularly important
    for \nthe security systems expected to execute for long periods. This \ndocument
    also attempts to investigate several key issues that a \ndesigner of HI revocation
    mechanisms need to carefully consider.\n\t "

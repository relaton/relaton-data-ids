  content: "   The mobile communication becomes the mainstream because more and more
    \   \n   mobile devices, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, \n
    \  notebooks, etc., are used to access the Internet. In order to be \n   reachable,
    the mobile devices need frequently change their \n   communication IP addresses
    in mobile IPv6 network according to its \n   current attached domain. However,
    the conventional firewalls are \n   primarily based on IPv4 network where the
    security criteria are \n   specified only to the fixed IP addresses or subnets.
    The goal of the \n   document is to solve the conflict and propose some approaches
    to make \n   the firewall friendly in mobile IPv6 network.\n\n\t "

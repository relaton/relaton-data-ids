  content: "MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can carry\nany
    data payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to provision
    new\nservice with any expense. As loss and delay sensitive applications such as
    Voice and Video are\nrunning on MPLS network, they may suffer delays in packet
    transmission and delivery. So Voice and Video traffic\non MPLS network needs low
    loss and delay LSP's to transfer Voice and Video packets.\nThis draft is proposing
    a solution to selection of Low loss and latency LSP's for\nVoice and Video applications
    using MPLS Loss and Delay measurement parameters.\n\n\nThe benefit of this technology
    results in delivery voice and video packets with\nbest possible lsp i.e. LSP's
    with less loss and delay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise Equipment
    (CPE) can leverage modern security techniques to have strong security, while retaining
    as much of the end-to-end reachability of IPv6 as possible. It is a re-submission
    in the framework of the HOMENET working group. The reputation part of this document
    should leverage the work done in the REPUTE working group of the Application are.</p>"

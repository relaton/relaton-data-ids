  content: "IDsec is a mechanism that provides an identity for users on the\nInternet.
    Identity in IDsec means that a user is known by a certain\nprofile that contains
    precisely those attributes that the user wants\nto reveal to the requester of
    his profile. Access to profile\nattributes is managed by the user himself. Certificates
    and\npublic/private key mechanisms ensure that information is exchanged in\na
    secure way only between parties that trust each other.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a YANG data model for traffic steering\n   policies
    in Distributed Data Center (DDC) scenarios. The policy\n   model is a specific
    data model for traffic steering using VPN\n   technology. It helps the service
    management in Simplified Use of\n   Policy Abstractions (SUPA) to model the policy
    (a set of\n   constraints and rules) that defines how a VPN service is monitored\n
    \  and managed during its lifecycle. Two traffic steering\n   applications have
    been provided such as traffic optimization with\n   pass or bypass specific nodes
    or sites.\n\n\n\n\t "

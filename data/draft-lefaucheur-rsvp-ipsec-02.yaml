  content: "   [RSVP-IPSEC] defines RSVP extensions for IPsec which permit support\n
    \  of reservations for individual IPsec flows, but it does not support\n   aggregate
    reservations between the IPsec devices with Diffserv\n   [DIFFSERV] classification
    and scheduling.  Conversely, [RSVP-AGG]\n   defines how to aggregate individual
    RSVP reservations over Aggregate\n   IP reservations when the aggregation region
    supports Diffserv, but it\n   does not address the case where the Aggregator and
    Deaggregator use\n   IPsec.  Also, [RSVP-AGG] does not address the case where
    multiple\n   Aggregate reservations are needed for the same DSCP from the same\n
    \  Aggregator to the same Deaggregator.  However, there are scenarios\n   requiring
    aggregate reservations for IPsec tunnels or requiring\n   multiple aggregate reservations
    for the same DSCP from a given\n   Aggregator to a given Deaggregator.  This document
    specifies the\n   incremental RSVP extensions beyond those defined in [RSVP-IPSEC]
    and\n   [RSVP-AGG] to support such reservations.\n\t "

  content: "   The Simple Extensible Data Format (SXDF) defined in this document\n
    \  aims to combine the nice properties of XML (of providing a universal,\n   text-based
    data format which allows adding additional data fields\n   without breaking existing
    application programs) with a simple syntax\n   which can be parsed efficiently
    by computer programs.  This data\n   format is intended for over-the-wire use
    in webservice protocols,\n   where there is generally no interest in being able
    to directly modify\n   the representation of the data with a standard text editor.\n\t "

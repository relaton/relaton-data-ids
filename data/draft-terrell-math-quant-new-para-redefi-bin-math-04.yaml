  content: "This paper provides the Mathematics for the New Paradigm Defining\nthe
    Binary System. Furthermore, while the Mathematical foundation\nand Logical justification,
    which established the New Structure for\nthe BINARY SYSTEM, were derived from
    The Mathematics of\nQuantification. The Mathematics itself, which is used in the
    New\nBinary System however, while providing the viable justification and\nthe
    logical reasons that supports the change for the New Binary Model,\nis not quite
    so new. In fact, it can be said that the Mathematics of\nQuantification sustains
    a Cascading Effect, Producing a Profound Change\nin the Mathematics for the Entire
    Mathematical Field. But, the Mathematics for the New Binary System has a Historical
    Foundation, which dates to the  beginnings of Mathematics itself.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) today is defined by\n   RFC
    8610, RFC 9165, RFC 9682, and RFC\\ 9741).  RFC 9165 and the\n   latter (as well
    as some more application specific specifications such\n   as RFC 9090) have used
    the extension point provided in RFC 8610, the\n   control operator.\n\n   As CDDL
    is used in larger projects, feature requirements become known\n   that cannot
    be easily mapped into this single extension point.\n   Hence, there is a need
    for evolution of the base CDDL specification\n   itself.\n\n   The present document
    provides a roadmap towards a \"CDDL 2.0\"; it is\n   intended to serve as a basis
    for implementations that evolve with the\n   concept of CDDL 2.0.  It is based
    on draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-freezer,\n   but is more selective in what potential
    features it takes up and more\n   detailed in their discussion.  This document
    is intended to evolve\n   over time; it might spawn specific documents and then
    retire, or it\n   might eventually be published as a roadmap document.\n\n\t "

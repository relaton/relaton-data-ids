  content: "The Internet is an amazing achievement - any of the thousand million\nhosts
    can freely use any of the resources anywhere on the public\nnetwork.  At least
    that was the original theory.  Recently issues\nwith how these resources are shared
    among these hosts have come to\nthe fore.  Applications are innocently exploring
    the limits of\nprotocol design to get larger shares of available bandwidth.\nIncreasingly
    we are seeing ISPs imposing restrictions on heavier\nusage in order to try to
    preserve the level of service they can offer\nto lighter customers.  We believe
    that these are symptoms of an\nunderlying problem: fair resource sharing is an
    issue that can only\nbe resolved at run-time, but for years attempts have been
    made to\nsolve it at design time.  In this document we show that fairness is\nnot
    the preserve of transport protocols, rather the design of such\nprotocols should
    be such that fairness can be controlled between\nusers and ISPs at run-time.\n\t "

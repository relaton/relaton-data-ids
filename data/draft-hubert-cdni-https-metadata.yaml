  content: "   The CDNI Metadata specification describes generic CDNI metadata\n   objects
    and properties as well as mechanisms to extend the generic/\n   base objects and
    properties to support additional standardised and/or\n   proprietary capabilities.
    \ This document is intended to \"test\" the\n   extensibility of the CDNI Metadata
    protocol by defining CDNI Metadata\n   for delivery of content over HTTPS that
    extends the existing generic\n   CDNI Metadata.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a new architecture on the client-side for \nauthentication
    by EAP. This architecture complements the usual setup \nconsidered in EAP by making
    it become symmetric: the client-side is \ndivided in two parts, the Authentication
    Token and the client, which \nare analogous respectively to the Authentication
    Server and the \nAuthenticator on the server-side. Moreover, this document describes
    a \nframework for the use of Authentication Tokens with the EAP protocol. \n \n\t "

  content: "   Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) improves destination privacy by\n   encrypting
    the Server Name Indication in TLS, but the customer's\n   source identity-- typically
    the IP address and network metadata--\n   remains observable to intermediaries
    such as CDNs, hosting providers,\n   and recursive resolvers.  This document introduces
    the _Customer-\n   Facing Relay (CFR)_, a lightweight, transport-agnostic relay
    operated\n   by access providers to decouple customer identity from encrypted\n
    \  destinations.\n   By forwarding opaque encrypted payloads (TCP or UDP) without\n
    \  terminating TLS or QUIC, a CFR complements ECH encryption to\n   strengthen
    source privacy and reduce metadata correlation.\n\n\t "

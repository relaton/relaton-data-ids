  content: "   Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the process of directing packets\n
    \  through a network so that they can be acted on by an ordered set of\n   abstract
    service functions before being delivered to the intended\n   destination.  An
    architecture for SFC is defined in RFC7665.\n\n   The Network Service Header (NSH)
    can be inserted into packets to\n   steer them along a specific path to realize
    a Service Function Chain.\n\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a widely
    deployed forwarding\n   technology that uses labels placed in a packet in a label
    stack to\n   identify the forwarding actions to be taken at each hop through a\n
    \  network.  Actions may include swapping or popping the labels as well,\n   as
    using the labels to determine the next hop for forwarding the\n   packet.  Labels
    may also be used to establish the context under which\n   the packet is forwarded.\n\n
    \  This document describes how Service Function Chaining can be achieved\n   in
    an MPLS network by means of a logical representation of the NSH in\n   an MPLS
    label stack.  It does not deprecate or replace the NSH, but\n   acknowledges that
    there may be a need for an interim deployment of\n   SFC functionality in brownfield
    networks.\n\n\t "

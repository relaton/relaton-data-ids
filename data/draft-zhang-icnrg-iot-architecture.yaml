  content: "   Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to\n
    \  Internet.  Nowadays, the IoT landscape is very fragmented from both\n   technological
    and service perspectives.  As a consequence, it is\n   difficult to cross correlate
    data coming from heterogeneous contexts\n   and build added value services on
    top of them.  For this reason, the\n   current trend is to develop a unified de-fragmented
    IoT platform so\n   that objects can be made accessible to applications across\n
    \  organizations and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a few proposals\n   have
    been made to build a unified IoT platform as an overlay on top\n   of today's
    Internet.  Such overlay solutions, however, inherit the\n   same limitations of
    the IP protocol, in terms of mobility, security,\n   scalability and communication
    reliability.  To address this problem,\n   we propose a unified IoT platform based
    on the Information Centric\n   Networking (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT
    [2].  ICN-IoT\n   leverages the salient features of ICN, and thus provides seamless\n
    \  device-to-device (D2D) communication, mobility support, scalability,\n   and
    efficient content and service delivery.  Furthermore, in order to\n   guarantee
    the real diffusion of ICN-IoT architecture it is\n   fundamental to deal with
    security and privacy requirements, since the\n   system may handle sensitive information
    (e.g., user habits, devices\n   location).  Note that ICN-IoT needs to manage
    the security\n   requirements at the early stage of the design, representing all
    the\n   involved entities and their relationships, in order to better\n   understand
    their interactions and, consequently, apply the proper\n   countermeasures to
    the possible security attacks (e.g., data\n   violation, privacy violation, access
    attacks).\n\n   This draft begins by motivating the need for an unified ICN-IoT\n
    \  platform to connect heterogenous IoT systems.  We then propose an\n   ICN-IoT
    system architecture and middleware components which includes\n   device/network-service
    discovery, naming service, IoT service\n   discovery, data discovery, user registration,
    and content delivery.\n   For all of these components, a secure solution is defined
    too.  We\n   also provide discussions on inter-connecting heterogeneous ICN-IoT\n
    \  domains.\n\n\t "

  content: "   There is no standardized method to describe assets used in a cloud\n
    \  such that they can be moved from one cloud to the next independent\n   of the
    underlying architecture. This document defines Cloud Assets\n   as a lightweight
    description of cloud resources and proposes a\n   standardization of Cloud Assets
    into three major categories:\n   Resource Assets, Component Assets, and Composite
    Assets.\n\n\t "

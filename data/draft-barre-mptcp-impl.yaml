  content: "Multipath TCP is a major extension to TCP that allows improving the\nresource
    usage in the current Internet by transmitting data over\nseveral TCP subflows,
    while still showing one single regular TCP\nsocket to the application.  This document
    describes our experience in\nwriting a MultiPath TCP implementation in the Linux
    kernel and\ndiscusses implementation guidelines that could be useful for other\ndevelopers
    who are planning to add MultiPath TCP to their networking\nstack.\n\t "

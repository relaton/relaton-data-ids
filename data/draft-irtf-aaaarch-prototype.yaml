  content: "In this document a prototype of an AAA (Authentication,\n      Authorization,
    Accounting) server is presented.  The prototype is\n      build in accordance
    with the RFCs 2903, 2904 and 2905.\n      As the AAA concept is a multi-tier concept
    we have chosen for JAVA\n      Enterprise Beans (J2EE) to build the prototype.
    \ New techniques\n      and protocols supported by the J2EE platform are discussed.
    \ Web\n      service standards like SOAP are explored.  A general architecture\n
    \     of an AAA server is outlined in Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)\n      component
    architecture.\n\t "

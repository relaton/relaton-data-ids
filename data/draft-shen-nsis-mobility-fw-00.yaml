  content: "This memo discusses several framework issues related to Next Step In\nSignaling
    (NSIS) and mobility interaction. The first issue is related\nto handoff impact
    on NSIS operation. We present several general\nrequirements for NSIS and mobility,
    followed by evaluation of how\nspecific approaches using Mobile IP or other mechanisms
    might fit\ninto the picture. Other issues covered include NSIS and mobility\nsignaling
    layering and soft-state management.\n\t "

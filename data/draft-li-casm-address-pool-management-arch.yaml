  content: "   This document describes an mechanism for a standard, programmatic\n
    \  interface for address pool management.  With the remaining IPv4\n   address
    becoming more and more scattered, it is complicated to\n   manually configure
    the address pools on lots of Broadband Network\n   Gateways(BNGs) for operators.
    \ By introducing SDN/NFV in BNG, the\n   address pools can be allocated in a centralized
    way.  It will not\n   only simplify the address management for operators, but
    also improve\n   the utilization efficiency of the address pool.\n\n\t "

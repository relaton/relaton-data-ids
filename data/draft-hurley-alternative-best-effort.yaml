  content: "Alternative Best-Effort (ABE) is a novel service for IP networks. It\noffers
    applications the choice between receiving a lower end-to-end\ndelay and receiving
    more overall throughput. Every best effort packet\nis tagged as either green or
    blue. Green packets receive a low, \nbounded queueing delay. To ensure blue packets
    do not suffer as a\nresult, green flows receive less throughput during bouts of\ncongestion.\n\t "

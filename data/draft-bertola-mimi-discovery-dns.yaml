  content: "   This document introduces a possible solution for the discovery\n   problem
    in MIMI (More Instant Messaging Interoperability).  The\n   problem is defined
    in a narrow sense, only including the conversion\n   of a non-service-specific
    user identifier (email address, telephone\n   number or a new MIMI-specific format)
    into one or more service-\n   specific user identifiers, then retrieving the necessary
    information\n   to establish a connection with their provider.  The solution is
    based\n   on the Domain Name System, so that it could be easily and quickly\n
    \  deployed on existing, well-known and broadly available\n   infrastructure.\n\n\t "

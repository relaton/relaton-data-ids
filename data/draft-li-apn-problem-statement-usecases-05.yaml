abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators are facing the challenge of providing better network
    services for users. As the ever-developing 5G and industrial verticals evolve,
    more and more services that have diverse network requirements such as ultra-low
    latency and high reliability are emerging, and therefore differentiated service
    treatment is desired by users. On the other hand, as network technologies such
    as Hierarchical QoS (H-QoS), SR Policy, and Network Slicing keep evolving, the
    network has the capability to provide more fine- granularity differentiated services.
    However, network operators are typically unware of the applications that are traversing
    their network infrastructure, which means that not very effective differentiated
    service treatment can be provided to the traffic flows. As network technologies
    evolve including deployments of IPv6, SRv6, Segment Routing over MPLS dataplane,
    the programmability provided by IPv6 and Segment Routing can be augmented by conveying
    application related information into the network satifying the fine- granularity
    requirements. This document analyzes the existing problems caused by lack of service
    awareness, and outlines various use cases that could benefit from an Application-aware
    Networking (APN) framework.</p>"

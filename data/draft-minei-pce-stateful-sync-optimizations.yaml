  content: "   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) has access to not only the\n
    \  information disseminated by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol\n   (IGP),
    but also the set of active paths and their reserved resources\n   for its computation.
    \ The additional Label Switched Path (LSP) state\n   information allows the PCE
    to compute constrained paths while\n   considering individual LSPs and their interactions.
    \ This requires a\n   reliable state synchronization mechanism between the PCE
    and the\n   network, PCE and path computation clients (PCCs), and between\n   cooperating
    PCEs.  The basic mechanism for state synchronization is\n   part of the stateful
    PCE specification.  This draft presents\n   motivations for optimizations to the
    base state synchronization\n   procedure and specifies the required Path Computation
    Element\n   Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The discussions of internationalized email addresses in the IETF have\n
    \  led to a number of stated requirements.  This document identifies\n   some
    of those requirements in the context of general issues of\n   internationalization
    of Internet name spaces, demonstrates that the\n   combination of all of the requirements
    that appear reasonable on\n   first glance adds up to a null solution space, and
    then suggests a\n   different model for proceeding.\n\t "

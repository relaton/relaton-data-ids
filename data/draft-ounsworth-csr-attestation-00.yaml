  content: "   Utilizing information from a device or hardware security module about\n
    \  its posture can help to improve security of the overall system.\n   Information
    about the manufacturer of the hardware, the version of\n   the firmware running
    on this hardware and potentially about the\n   layers of software above the firmware,
    the presence of hardware\n   security functionality to protect keys and many more
    properties can\n   be made available to remote parties in a cryptographically
    secured\n   way.  This functionality is accomplished with attestation technology.\n\n
    \  This document describes extensions to encode evidence produced by an\n   attester
    for inclusion in PKCS10 certificate signing requests.  More\n   specifically,
    two new ASN.1 Attribute definitions, and an ASN.1 CLASS\n   definition to convey
    attestation information to a Registration\n   Authority or to a Certification
    Authority are described.\n\n\t "

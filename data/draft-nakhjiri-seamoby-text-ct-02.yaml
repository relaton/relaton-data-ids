  content: "This document presents a context transfer proposal that allows \ncompletion
    of context transfer outside timing critical message \nsequence for handover.  The
    context transfer process is initiated \nat a moment of MN’s choice (in regard
    to layer 2 and 3 handover \nand MN’s traffic) and is completed without a disruption
    in the \nflow of MN’s real time traffic. This proposal is in line with the \ncurrent
    fast handover framework within Mobile IP WG [3].  Although \nthis document provides
    a specific recommendation, the framework \nproposed here, along with multiple
    alternatives that are \nmentioned, provides a great amount of flexibility in detailed
    \ndesign of context transfer. A minimum reliability mechanism for \nensuring quality
    of transferred context is added to provide \ncontext updates that cannot be achieved
    by any transport protocol.\n\t "

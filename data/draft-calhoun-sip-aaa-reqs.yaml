  content: "The AAA Working Group has been defining requirements for Network\nAccess
    in Inter-Domain (roaming) networks, including requirements\nfrom the Mobile IP
    and NASREQ Working Groups. Some of these\nrequirements were input from work done
    in the 3rd Generation wireless\nSDOs. These same SDO's have a need to tie their
    IP Intelligent\nServers (e.g. Softswitches, Call Agents, SIP Servers, etc.) to
    their\nAAA infrastructure.\n\t "

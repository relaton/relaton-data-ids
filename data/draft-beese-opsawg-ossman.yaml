  content: "   In commercial embedded systems utilizing open source, there are legal\n
    \  requirements to make open source software utilized in a product\n   known.
    \ Headless devices have no UI to display an open source\n   manifest.  Additionally,
    printed manuals become out of date as\n   software updates occur throughout the
    product lifetime.  This\n   standard intends to create a common method of retrieving
    open source\n   manifests directly from an embedded device utilizing Ethernet
    or Wi-\n   Fi.\n\n\n\t "

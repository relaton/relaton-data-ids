  content: "Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of\nservice
    for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The\noverall PCN architecture
    is described in ID.PCNArch.  This memo is\none of a series describing possible
    boundary node behaviours for a\nPCN domain.  The behaviour described here is that
    for three-state\nmeasurement-based load control, known informally as CL.  The\nrequirement
    for three encoding states means that CL is for\nexperimental use only pending
    further standards action.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Protective DNS is a defense mechanism deployed on recursive resolvers
    to prevent users from accessing malicious domains. For domain names in the blocklist,
    it rewrites DNS resolution responses to point to secure destinations (e.g., safe
    servers) to prevent users from accessing malicious entities. Owing to its effective
    defenses against common cyber attack behaviors—such as command-and-control (C2)
    communications of malware—Protective DNS deployment has surged via various initiatives.
    Not only have renowned DNS service providers adopted this defense, but some countries
    have also launched national-scale deployments. Meanwhile, studies analyzing Protective
    DNS have identified implementation diversity. Thus, this document aims to provide
    specific operational and security considerations for Protective DNS. It is intended
    primarily for entities seeking to deploy Protective DNS for defensive purposes,
    offering deployment and security considerations.</p>"

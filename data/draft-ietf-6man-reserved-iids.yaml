  content: "Interface identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify interfaces
    on a link.  They are required to be unique within a subnet.  Several RFCs have
    specified interface identifiers or identifier ranges that have a special meaning
    attached to them.  An IPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier in these
    ranges will encounter unexpected consequences.  Since there is no centralized
    repository for such reserved identifiers, this document aims to create one. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

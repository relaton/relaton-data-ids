- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) framework, a \nhybrid
    routing framework suitable for a wide variety of mobile ad-hoc\nnetworks, especially
    those with large network spans and diverse\nmobility patterns.  Each node proactively
    maintains routes within a\nlocal region (referred to as the routing zone).  Knowledge
    of the\nrouting zone topology is leveraged by the ZRP to improve the\nefficiency
    of a globally reactive route query/reply mechanism. The \nproactive maintenance
    of routing zones also helps improve the quality\nof discovered routes, by making
    them more robust to changes in network\ntopology. The ZRP can be configured for
    a particular network by proper\nselection of a single parameter, the routing zone
    radius.\n\t "

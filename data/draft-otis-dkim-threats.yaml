  content: "   This document is intended to provide an alternative perspective to\n
    \  the document prepared by Jim Fenton for DomainKeys Identified Mail\n   (DKIM),
    although it borrows from his substantial effort.  This review\n   removes emphasis
    on email-address domains, as DKIM allows signatures\n   to be independent of the
    email-address.  This document also considers\n   the impact of adding an opaque-identifier
    and implementing abusive\n   message replay abatement.  This document considers
    threats against\n   Internet mail and threats created when employing a signature-based\n
    \  method for establishing an accountable domain for a message, in\n   particular
    DKIM.  This document also ranks threat levels, modes of\n   access, Bad Actors
    and their capabilities, and possible motivations\n   for various attack scenarios.\n\t "

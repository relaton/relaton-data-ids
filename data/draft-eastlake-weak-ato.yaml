  content: "   The packet switched nature of the Internet Protocol (IP) provides no\n
    \  inherent method to assure that a packet has been issued with a source\n   address
    authorized for the sender and no inherent method to trace the\n   actual source
    of a packet.  These characteristics make it difficult\n   to take effective action
    concerning injurious packets which may have\n   originated, by accident or maliciously,
    virtually anywhere in the\n   Internet.\n \n   A lightweight IP level option is
    proposed that provides (1) some\n   assurance that packet's source addresses are
    authorized for their\n   sender, and (2) limited statistical tracing information
    such that, if\n   many bad packets are logged, the path to their source will be\n
    \  revealed.\n \n   These features, even if not implemented throughout the Internet,\n
    \  would provide significantly improved protection against packet level\n   abuse.\n\n\t "

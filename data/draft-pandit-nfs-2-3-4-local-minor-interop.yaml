- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "NFS (Network File System) version 4 is a major rewrite of NFS. NFS\n    version
    4 has lot of new features added into the protocol and the \n    behavior is changed
    a lot from the predecessors.\n\n    This Draft considers the interoperability
    problems of all versions \n    of NFS and local filesystem. Yet, access to any
    one file system \n    through the NFS v2 or NFS v3 or NFS v4 protocol requires
    that a \n    single server be accessed.  \n\n    This draft tries to suggest the
    behavior that could be expected \n    when NFS version 4 is used in multi-protocol
    environment with NFS \n    version 2 and version 3.\n\t "

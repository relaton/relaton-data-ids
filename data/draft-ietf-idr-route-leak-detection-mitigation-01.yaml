- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have\n
    \  provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated\n   several
    types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine\n   which of those route-leak
    types are detected and mitigated by the\n   existing origin validation (OV) [RFC
    6811] and BGPSEC path validation\n   [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  Where the
    current OV and BGPSEC\n   protocols don't offer a solution, this document suggests
    an\n   enhancement that would extend the route-leak detection and mitigation\n
    \  capability of BGPSEC.  The solution can be implemented in BGP without\n   necessarily
    tying it to BGPSEC.  Incorporating the solution in BGPSEC\n   is one way of implementing
    it in a secure way.  We do not claim to\n   have provided a solution for all possible
    types of route leaks, but\n   the solution covers several, especially considering
    some significant\n   route-leak attacks or occurrences that have been observed
    in recent\n   years.  The document also includes a stopgap method for detection
    and\n   mitigation of route leaks for the phase when BGPSEC (path validation)\n
    \  is not yet deployed but only origin validation is deployed.\n\n\t "

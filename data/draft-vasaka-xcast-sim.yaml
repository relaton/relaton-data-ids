  content: "Sender Initiated Multicast (SIM) is a point-to-multipoint multicast\nmechanism.
    SIM will not replace the existing multicast protocol, but\nwill be a subset of
    entire multicast protocol suite. Its design goals\nare to gain more simplicity
    than the traditional IP multicast and to\ngain less header-processing overhead
    than the Xcast protocol.  It\neliminates the cost of allocating global multicast
    address, by\nrouting packets according to receiver unicast addresses attached
    to\npacket headers.  Access control can be introduced before, members of\na receiving
    group are explicitly specified by the sender. A group is\nidentified by the combination
    of sender's unicast address and a\nmulticast group address. The key feature of
    SIM is in its Preset\nmode, which can lessen the costs of route lookups and provides
    cost-\nefficient packet forwarding by using a SIM Forwarding Information\nBase
    (FIB) maintained on routers. Moreover, a SIM tunnel will be\nautomatically created
    between two routers that act as multicast\nbranching points.  Therefore, SIM can
    gain scalability by maintaining\nFIB entries only on the branching routers.\nIn
    this document, we describe SIM including its delivery models, SIM\nFIB operations,
    the formats, and security considerations.\n\n\t "

  content: "In this document, a proactive correspondent registration mechanism \nis
    proposed for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) route optimization \nbetween the correspondent
    node (CN) and the mobile access gateway \n(MAG) on behalf of the mobile node (MN).
    Two scenarios are \nconsidered according to the type of CN. For the proposed mechanism,
    \nthe proxy home test and the concurrent care-of test are defined \nnewly with
    parameters specified by information on candidate MAGs. \nThe proposed correspondent
    registration mechanism is performed \nbefore actual handover for candidate MAGs
    where the MN can attach\nnewly. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can reduce correspondent
    \nregistration latency, which can reduce handover latency and thus \nenhance throughput
    degradation caused by the bidirectional tunneling\nvia the local mobility anchor
    (LMA).\n\t "

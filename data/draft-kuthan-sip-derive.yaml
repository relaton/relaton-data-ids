  content: "This document provides a simple mechanism to prevent an attacker from\n
    \  presenting a forged \"From\" header field.  It offers an end-to-end\n   identity
    assumption which does not require any previous association\n   or trust relationship
    between administrative domains or the UAs.  The\n   UAS verifies the \"From\"
    header by subscribing to the Dialog Event\n   package [RFC 4235] at the AOR in
    the \"From\" header field.  If the\n   entity calling is registered under this
    AOR, it will confirm that it\n   is calling by sending some valid dialog state.
    \ In this case, the\n   identity of the caller is considered to be verified.\n\n\t "

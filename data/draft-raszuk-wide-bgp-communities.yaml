  content: "   Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP [RFC4271]\n   relations,
    in communicating various routing policies between peers.\n   It is also a very
    common best practice among operators to propagate\n   various additional information
    about routes intra-domain.  The most\n   common tool used today to attach various
    information about routes is\n   through the use of BGP communities [RFC1997].\n\n
    \  Such information is important to allow BGP speakers to perform some\n   mutually
    agreed actions without the need to maintain a separate\n   offline database for
    each tuple of prefix and associated set of\n   action entries.\n\n   This document
    defines a new encoding which will enhance and simplify\n   what can be accomplished
    today with the use of BGP communities.  The\n   most important addition this specification
    makes over currently\n   defined BGP communities is the ability to specify, carry
    as well as\n   use for execution an operator's defined set of parameters.  It
    also\n   provides an extensible platform for any new community encoding needs\n
    \  in the future.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "MIME is a general-purpose mechanism for labeling and\naggregating objects
    into complex hierarchies. Some MIME\nobjects are discrete objects.  If placed
    within another MIME\nhierarchy, they need to appear as a leaf node in the\ncontaining
    hierarchy, rather than seeming to be continuations\nof that hierarchy.  This specification
    defines Content-type\nApplication/MIME to provide an encapsulation mechanism for\narbitrary
    MIME structures.  This facilitates their treatment\nas a single unit, rather than
    causing them to be treated as\npart of any containing MIME hierarchy.\n\n\t "

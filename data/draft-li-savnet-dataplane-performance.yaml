  content: "   Source address validation (SAV) is one important way to mitigate\n
    \  source address spoofing attacks. However, there may be concern about\n   whether
    the source address check action of the data plane would\n   cause a great performance
    loss and even affect SAV deployment. This\n   document provides an analysis of
    data plane implementation of SAV\n   mechanisms, including the existing mechanisms
    and a new mechanism\n   using independent SAV table. The data plane performances
    of\n   different mechanisms are tested respectively.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces the \"Packet Too Big\"-\"Packet Too Small\"\n
    \  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) based attack against IPsec\n   gateways.
    \ We explain how an attacker having eavesdropping and packet\n   injection capabilities,
    from the unsecure network where he only sees\n   encrypted packets, can force
    a gateway to reduce the Path Maximum\n   Transmission Unit (PMTU) of an IPsec
    tunnel to the minimum, which can\n   trigger severe issues for the hosts behind
    this gateway: with a Linux\n   host, depending on the PMTU discovery algorithm
    in use (i.e., PMTUd\n   versus PLPMTUd) and protocol (TCP versus UDP), the attack
    either\n   creates a Denial of Service or major performance penalties.  This\n
    \  attack highlights two fundamental problems, namely: (1) the\n   impossibility
    to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate ICMP\n   packets coming from the untrusted
    network, and (2) the contradictions\n   in the way Path MTU is managed by some
    end hosts when this Path MTU\n   is below the minimum packet size any link should
    support because of\n   the IPsec encapsulation.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Due to uncontrolled interferences, including the self-induced\n   multipath
    fading, deterministic networking can only be approached on\n   wireless links.
    \ The radio conditions may change -way- faster than a\n   centralized routing
    can adapt and reprogram, in particular when the\n   controller is distant and
    connectivity is slow and limited.  RAW\n   separates the routing time scale at
    which a complex path is\n   recomputed from the forwarding time scale at which
    the forwarding\n   decision is taken for an individual packet.  RAW operates at
    the\n   forwarded time scale.  The RAW problem is to decide, within the\n   redundant
    solutions that are proposed by the routing, which will be\n   used for each individual
    packet to provide a DetNet service while\n   minimizing the waste of resources.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a type of private networks that\n   interconnect
    thin CPEs at multiple client sites by IP tunnels, or\n   more specifically, lay
    over multiple client sites' Thin CPEs via IP\n   tunnels. Those private overlay
    networks not only interconnect those\n   sites by secure IP tunnels but can also
    enforce the client specified\n   policies to govern how applications or hosts
    within those sites\n   communicate and how to access public internet.\n\n   Hosts
    or applications in those sites can be interconnected by Layer\n   2 networks or/and
    by Layer 3 networks. The network that the IP\n   tunnels are traversing can be
    IPv4 or IPv6 networks. This document\n   describes the special properties of the
    client defined networks over\n   Thin CPEs.\n\n   A separate draft will describes
    the special features that those IP\n   tunnels need to have in order to interconnect
    multiple sites as if\n   those sites are directly connected by wires and how communication\n
    \  policies are enforced.\n\n\t "

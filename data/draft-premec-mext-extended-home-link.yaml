  content: "Mobile IPv6 for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers enables mobility for the\nmobile
    node's IPv6 home address or prefix as well as an IPv4 home\naddress, irrespective
    of the IP version supported on the link that\nthe mobile node is attached to.
    \ The home agent maintains binding\ncache entries for the IPv6 and IPv4 home addresses
    assigned to the\nmobile node when the mobile node is connected via a foreign link.\nThe
    binding cache entries are deprecated when the mobile node\nattaches to its home
    link.  This document addresses an issue related\nto the de-registration procedure
    and the continued connectivity for\nthe IPv4 home address when the mobile node
    attaches to its IPv6-only\nhome link.\n\t "

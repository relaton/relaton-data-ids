  content: "   Different kinds of relationships can be established among\n   interconnected
    Traffic Engineered Networks.  In particular, this\n   document focuses on the
    case where there is a client-server relation\n   between the network domains.
    \ The domain interconnection is a policy\n   and administrative boundary.  This
    informational document collects\n   current terminology and provides a taxonomy
    for the posible control\n   plane based operation models.\n\n   Each control model
    defines, on the one hand, the level of information\n   that the domain acting
    as client receives by control plane means from\n   the domain acting as server
    and, on the other hand, the control model\n   will determine what can be requested
    from the client domain to the\n   server domain.\n\n\t "

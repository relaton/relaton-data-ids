  content: "Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but communications are
    usually restricted to a single path per connection. Resource usage within the
    network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be
    used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport
    in TCP.\n\n New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport
    protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues
    in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing
    algorithms such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath
    flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one
    of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available
    will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a
    property called \"resource pooling\" where a bundle of links effectively behaves
    like one shared link with bigger capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency
    of the network and also its robustness to failure.\n\n This document presents
    a congestion control algorithm that couples the congestion control algorithms
    running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically
    controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical
    algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested
    links. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

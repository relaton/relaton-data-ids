  content: "The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file\ntransfer
    protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a\nremote host.\nThis
    document describes a new TFTP option. This new option will allow\nthe multiple
    clients to receive the same file concurrently through\nthe use of Multicast packets.
    The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is\ndescribed in [2].\nOften when similar
    computers are booting remotely they will each\ndownload the same image file. By
    adding multicast into the TFTP\noption  set,  two  or  more  computers  can  download
    \ a  file\nconcurrently, thus increasing network efficiency.\nThis document assumes
    that the reader is familiar with the\nterminology and notation of both [1] and
    [2].\n\t "

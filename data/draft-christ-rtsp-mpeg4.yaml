  content: "      In order to support advanced interactivity as envisaged for\n      MPEG-4
    applications, this document proposes a simple  RTSP-\n      based [1] streams
    control framework - including necessary\n      extensions to RTP methods syntax
    and semantics.  Reflecting\n      syntax and semantics of the MPEG-4 BIFS scene
    description\n      [2], VRML nodes  [4] and the MPEG-4 media delivery framework\n
    \     (DMIF)[3], in the spirit of HTMLSMIL [5], Random Access\n      Point information,
    Range and Time parameters are introduced\n      into the relevant URL(s) and related
    signaling methods\n      accordingly.  Two additional optional methods, R-MUTE,
    for\n      Remote-MUTE, and RESUME are also proposed.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Emerging applications (e.g., extended reality, cloud gaming, and\n
    \  teleoperation) impose stringent bandwidth, latency, reliability\n   requirements
    on network transport, so as to deliver immersive and\n   interactive user experience.
    \ That drives recent discussion on\n   application-network collaboration, especially
    in wireless access\n   networks.  To motivate participation from content and network\n
    \  providers, this memo elaborates the necessity of such collaboration\n   while
    focusing on wireless access scenarios.\n\n\t "

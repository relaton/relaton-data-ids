  content: "   There are many approaches to addressing virtualized datacenter\n   scaling
    problems. Examples of these approaches include, L2 vs. L3\n   forwarding, host-based
    vs. network-based solutions, fat-access and\n   lean-core vs. fat-core and lean-access,
    flat addressing vs.\n   encapsulation, protocol learning vs. directories for location\n
    \  discovery, APIs vs. protocols for orchestration, etc. Different\n   solutions
    being proposed today take one or more of these approaches\n   in combination,
    although sometimes the question of approach itself\n   may not be settled. Given
    the multiple facets of the datacenter\n   problem, and many approaches to solve
    each problem, it becomes hard\n   to discuss a solution when some approaches may
    be acceptable while\n   others are not. This document discusses the pros and cons
    of various\n   approaches. The goal is not to describe a specific solution, but
    to\n   evaluate the various approaches. This document concludes with a set\n   of
    recommendations on which approaches are most optimal for a\n   holistic solution
    to the entire problem set.\n\n\t "

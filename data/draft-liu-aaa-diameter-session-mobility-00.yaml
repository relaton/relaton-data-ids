  content: "A mobile node will change its access router frequently during a \nDiameter
    session and the relevant AAA parameters may also be \ntransferred between the
    access routers. However, the home AAA server \ndoes not know the movement of the
    mobile node before the mobile node \nre-authenticates, and a request from the
    home AAA server will always \nbe forwarded to the former realm. Therefore, an
    efficient way is \nneeded to forward the request to the new access router. \n

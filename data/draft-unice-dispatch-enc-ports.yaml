  content: "   The internet and free flow of information has enabled the individual\n
    \  in society several advantages that have not been available in the\n   past.
    \ The free flow of information has enabled social and political\n   changes, open
    education for students, and now the free-flow of money\n   without the need for
    intermediate institutions.  This free flow of\n   information etc. is continually
    under attack from institutions that\n   are compromised by the Internet.  So these
    institutions have and\n   continue to implement controls in an attempt to stop
    the empowerment\n   of the individual.  These controls on information is what
    this RFC\n   attempts to weaken.\n\n\t "

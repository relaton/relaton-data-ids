    (draft-ietf-mhtml-rev-05.txt) specifies how to send packaged\naggregate HTML objects
    in MIME format. This memo is an accompanying\ninformational document, intended
    to be an aid to developers. This\ndocument is not an Internet standard.\n \nIssues

    of URIs, making messages suitable both for mailers which\ncan and which cannot
    handle Multipart/related and handling recipients\nwhich do not have full Internet
    connectivity.\n \nThe latest version of this document is available in HTML format
    at:\nhttp://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/mhtml-info.html\n \nDifferences from the
    previous versions 9 and 10 of this draft\n \n(1) A paragraph about one disadvantage
    with MAILTO action elements has\nbeen added to section 10.\n \n(2) A new section
    13: Default font size has been added\n \n(3) A new temporary section 'Issue list'
    immediately below has been added\n\t "

  content: "   This draft describes a mechanism for information exchange between an\n
    \  application and the network.  The information provided from the\n   application
    to the network MAY be used by a network element in the\n   path to modify its
    behavior to improve application quality of\n   experience (QoE).  Likewise, the
    information provided by the network\n   to the application MAY be used by the
    application to modify its\n   behavior to optimize for QoE.\n\n   The information
    provided from the application to the network can also\n   be useful for middleboxes
    that are responsible for security at edges\n   of network (e.g. firewalls) or
    other middleboxes in determining how\n   to treat the packets delivered from this
    application.\n\n\n\t "

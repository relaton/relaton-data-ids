  content: "HTTP Cookies, as originally defined by Netscape in [NETSC] and as\nlater
    updated by [RFC2109] , [RFC2965], and\n[I-D.ietf-httpstate-cookie] did not address
    the issue of how to\nrestrict for which domains a server is allowed to set a cookie.
    \ This\nis particularly a problem for servers hosted in top-level domains\nhaving
    subdomains that are controlled by registries and not by domain\nowners, e.g.,
    \"co.uk\" and \"city.state.us\" domains.  In such\nsituations, unless the client
    uses some kind of domain black-list, it\nis possible for a malicious server to
    set cookies, so they are sent\nto all servers in a domain the attacker does not
    control.  These\ncookies may adveresly affect the function of servers receiving
    them.\nThe primary reason this is a problem is that the server receiving the\ncookie
    has no way of telling which server originally set it;\ntherefore it is not able
    to distinguish reliably an invalid cookie\nfrom a valid one.\n\nThis document
    proposes a new attribute, \"$Origin\", that is associated\nwith each cookie and
    sent in all client cookie headers in the\nrequests sent to the server.  Servers
    recognizing the attribute may\nthen check to see if the cookie was set by a server,
    which is allowed\nto set cookies for the server and, if necessary, ignore the
    cookie.\n\nThis document updates RFC 2109 and RFC 2965.\n\t "

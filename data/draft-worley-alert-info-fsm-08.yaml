  script: Latn
  content: "   The \"alert\" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can be used
    in\n   the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   requests
    and responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the\n   characteristics
    of the call that the user agent has originated or\n   terminated.  The user agent
    must resolve the URNs into a signal, that\n   is, it must select the best available
    signal to present to its user\n   to indicate the characteristics of the call.
    \ This document describes\n   a method by which a user agent's designer can, based
    on the user\n   agent's signals and their meanings, construct a finite state machine\n
    \  (FSM) to process the URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the\n   restrictions
    given in the definition of the \"alert\" URN namespace.\n   In many situations,
    the resulting FSM is simpler to implement and\n   faster than the selection algorithm
    described in [RFC7462].\n\n\t "

  content: "The Framework for Operational Security Capabilities [11] outlines the\nproposed
    effort of the IETF OPSEC working group.  This includes\nproducing a series of
    drafts to codify knowledge gained through\noperational experience about feature
    sets that are needed to securely\ndeploy and operate managed network elements
    providing transit\nservices at the data link and IP layers.  Current plans include\nseparate
    capabilities documents for Packet Filtering; Event Logging;\nIn-Band and Out-of-Band
    Management; Configuration and Management\nInterfaces; AAA; and Documentation and
    Assurance.  This document\ndescribes some additional miscellaneous capabilities
    which do not fit\ninto any of these specific catagories, and whose descriptions
    are\nbrief enough that it does not seem appropriate to create a separate\ndocument
    for each.\n\nOperational Security Current Practices [12] lists current operator\npractices
    related to securing networks.  This document lists\nmiscellaneous capabilities
    needed to support those practices.\n\nCapabilities are defined without reference
    to specific technologies.\nThis is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies
    that\nimplement the capability.  Each capability cites the practices it\nsupports.
    \ Current implementations that support the capability may be\ncited.  Special
    considerations are discussed as appropriate listing\noperational and resource
    constraints, limitations of current\nimplementations, tradeoffs, etc.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Given the open nature of the Internet today, application protocols\n
    \  require strong security.  IPsec's wire protocols appear to meet the\n   requirements
    of many protocols.  The lack of a common model for\n   application-layer interfaces
    has complicated use of IPsec by upper-\n   layer protocols.  This document provides
    an overview of facilities\n   which a host IPsec implementation should provide
    to applications to\n   allow them to both observe and influence how IPsec protects
    their\n   communications.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   A common setting in emerging applications (e.g., data-intensive\n   science
    applications, flexible inter-domain routing, multi-domain\n   service function
    chaining) is that the traffic from a source to a\n   destination traverses multiple
    networks domains.  Such multi-domain\n   applications can benefit from network
    information exposure using\n   ALTO.  This document summarizes the benefits of
    using such multi-\n   domain information and discusses the ALTO design issues
    for gathering\n   it.  Besides, it also presents key design requirements to be\n
    \  addressed in order to realize the proposal of providing multi-domain\n   information
    by ALTO services.  Finally, another important objective\n   of this document is
    to begin discussions into the ALTO WG concerning\n   potential new items to be
    considered for the re-charter.\n\n\t "

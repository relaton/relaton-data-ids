  content: "   This document discusses the motivation and requirements for\n   supporting
    interactive network queries and data collection through a\n   mechanism called
    Dynamic Network Probes (DNP).  Network applications\n   and OAM have various data
    requirements from the data plane.  The\n   unpredictable and interactive nature
    of the query for network data\n   analytics asks for dynamic and on-demand data
    collection\n   capabilities.  As user programmable data plane is becoming a reality,\n
    \  it can be enhanced to support interactive query through DNPs.  DNP\n   supports
    node, path, and flow-based data preprocessing and\n   collection.  For example,
    in-situ OAM (iOAM) with user-defined flow-\n   based data collection can be programmed
    and configured through DNP.\n   DNPs serve as a building block of an integrated
    network data\n   telemetry and analytics platform which involves the network data\n
    \  plane as an active component for user-defined data collection and\n   preparation.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables services to be delivered by\n
    \  selective traffic steering through an ordered set of service\n   functions.
    \ Once classified into an SFC, the traffic for a given flow\n   is steered through
    all the service functions of the SFC for the life\n   of the traffic flow even
    though this is often not necessary.\n   Steering traffic to service functions
    only while required and not\n   otherwise, leads to shorter SFC forwarding paths
    with improved\n   latencies, reduced resource consumption and better user experience.\n\n
    \  This document describes the rationale, techniques and necessary\n   protocol
    extensions to achieve such optimization, with focus on one\n   such technique
    termed \"simple offloads\".\n\n\n\t "

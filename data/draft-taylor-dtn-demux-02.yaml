  script: Latn
  content: "   Since the publication of [RFC5050] a number of transport and\n   convergence
    layer protocols have been developed to carry bundles\n   between nodes in a delay-tolerant
    network.  Before the publication of\n   Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) in [RFC9171],
    there was only one\n   standardized version of the Bundle Protocol, version 6,
    and as many\n   of these transport and convergence-layer protocols pre-date the\n
    \  publication of version 7, they do not include any protocol mechanism\n   to
    differentiate between versions of the Bundle Protocol.\n\n   This document describes
    a mechanism by which an implementation can\n   efficiently determine validity
    and the version of the Bundle Protocol\n   that was used to encode a bundle by
    examining the initial octets of\n   the encoded data, allowing this document to
    be used as a normative\n   reference for updates to existing protocols.\n\n   Additionally,
    this document updates [RFC9171] by defining a CBOR\n   [RFC8949] tag that may
    be used as an explicit indicator that a\n   particular indefinite-length CBOR
    array is a Bundle Protocol version\n   7 bundle.\n\n\t "

  content: "Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale better\nwith
    the number of multicast sessions than traditional multicast does\n(DCM [BLAZ],
    SGM [BOIV], Somecast [HELD], MDO6 [IMAI], CLM [OOMS],\nERM [SHAN], REUNITE [STOI]).
    \ These proposals are also known as\nExplict Multicast (xcast; explicit list of
    destinations) or Small\nGroup Multicast (sgm; the main application being few-to-few\ncommunication).
    \ To stimulate and streamline the discussion this\ndraft is an attempt to make
    a taxonomy of these mechanisms.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Classic Internet transport protocols use a single source IP Address\n
    \  and a single destination IP Address, as part of the identification\n   for
    an individual transport data flow. This is problematic for\n   multihomed hosts
    and for mobile hosts, collectively needing\n   'multiaddressing' support. The
    basic goal, then, is to find a method\n   for multiaddressing that makes the smallest
    possible change to the\n   architecture and to current systems, while maintaining
    flexibility\n   for different emerging solutions.  This draft proposes a framework\n
    \  for methods for creating Common Endpoint Locator Pools that can be\n   used
    by and among the proposed solutions.\n\t "

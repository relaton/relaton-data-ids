  content: "A holistic directory system is described which translates a standard\nE.164
    telephone number into the Internet address information\nrequired to support IP-enabled
    communications applications such as\nreal-time voice, voice-messaging, fax or
    unified-messaging. The\nproposed system utilizes two logical control tiers to
    implement the\ntranslation.\nThe first logical control tier is patterned after
    a Top Level Domain\n(TLD) of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS).  This first-tier\nprovides
    a mechanism for locating the appropriate directory within\nthe second logical
    tier of the Internet-Telephony directory system\nwhere authoritative Internet
    address information is stored for a\ngiven E.164 number.  This first-tier is expected
    to conform to the\nregulatory and operational standards defined by the Internet\nCorporation
    for the Assignment of Names and Numbers (ICANN) for the\noperation of top-level
    domains.\nThe second logical control tier provides a mechanism for accessing\nand
    managing authoritative Internet address information associated\nwith an E.164
    number.  This tier consists of widely distributed DNS\nservers controlled by service
    providers, and corporate network\noperators.  Distributed ownership of the second
    tier directories\nallows organizations to control the Internet address information\nassociated
    with the E.164 numbers under their day-to-day control.\n\t "

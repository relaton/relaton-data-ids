abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies Agentic JSON Web Token (Agentic JWT), as an
    extension to OAuth 2.0 that addresses authorization challenges unique to autonomous
    agentic AI systems. This protocol solves the problem of Zero-Trust drift due to
    non-deterministic Agentic AI clients causing separation between user''s (resource
    owner''s) intent and client application''s actions. Traditional OAuth 2.0 assumes
    that client applications faithfully represent user intent when requesting authorization.
    This assumption breaks down when autonomous AI agents dynamically generate workflows,
    create sub-agents, and make authorization decisions without continuous human oversight.
    We term this the "intent-execution separation problem." Agentic JWT introduces
    three mechanisms to address this problem: (1) cryptographic agent identity through
    agent checksums (based on agent''s system prompts, tools and configurations),
    (2) workflow-aware token binding that links user intent to agent execution, and
    (3) a new OAuth 2.0 grant type (agent_checksum) for secure token issuance, (4)
    a flavor of PoP (Proof-of-Possession) at the level of an agentic identity to prevent
    token replays by other agents in the same multi- agent process. This specification
    enables Zero-Trust security principles in multi- agent systems while maintaining
    backward compatibility with existing OAuth 2.0 infrastructure. The security analysis
    and experimental validation are described in the companion research paper.</p>'

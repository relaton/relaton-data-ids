  content: "   This document describes a mechanism to do an inventory of devices on\n
    \  a network.\n\n   While there are significant abuse and privacy concerns with
    kind of\n   scanning, the practice of scanning networks and fingerprinting\n   devices
    has been occuring since the mid 1990s.  But, the adhoc\n   methods are not reliable
    and do not provide any kind of strong device\n   identity.\n\n   This document
    takes the approach that if it will happen, it might as\n   well be reliable and
    secure.\n\n\t "

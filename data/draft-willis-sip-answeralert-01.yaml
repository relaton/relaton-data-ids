  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines three SIP extension header fields and\n   associated
    option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey\n   the requester's
    preference for user-interface handling of that\n   request.  The first header,
    \"Answer-Mode\", expresses a preference as\n   to whether the target node's user
    interface waits for user input\n   before accepting the request or instead accepts
    the request without\n   waiting on user input.  The second header, \"Priv-Answer-Mode\"
    is\n   similar to the second, except that it requests administrative-level\n   access
    and has consequent additional authentication and authorization\n   requirements.
    \ The third header, \"Alert-Mode\", expresses a preference\n   as to whether the
    target node's user interface alerts the user about\n   the request.  These behaviors
    have applicability to applications such\n   as Push-to-Talk and to diagnostics
    like loop-back.  This document\n   also defines use of the SIP extension header
    field \"Answer-Mode\" in a\n   response to an INVITE request to inform the requester
    as to which\n   answer mode was actually applied to this request.  There are\n
    \  significant security considerations, especially when an answering\n   mode
    option is used in conjunction with an alerting mode option.\n\t "

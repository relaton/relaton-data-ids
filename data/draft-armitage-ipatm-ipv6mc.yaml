  content: "The Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt ('Support for Multicast
    over UNI 3.1 based ATM Networks') describes a mechanism for handling IP multicast
    over ATM. Whilst the architecture is intended to support multiple protocols such
    as IP, IPX, AppleTalk, etc, the current examples apply only to IPv4 environments.
    \ This document describes the specific encodings that should be used when running
    IPv6 over ATM. It is expected that some of this text will influence the revision
    of draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt or become a separate companion document in its
    own right.\n\t "

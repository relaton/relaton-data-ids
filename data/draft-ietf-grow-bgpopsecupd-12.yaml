  content: "   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a critical component in the\n
    \  Internet to exchange routing information between network domains.\n   Due to
    this central nature, it is important to understand the\n   security and reliability
    requirements that can and should be ensured\n   to prevent accidental or intentional
    routing disturbances.\n\n   Previously, security considerations for BGP have been
    described in\n   RFC7454 / BCP194.  Since the publications of RFC7454, several\n
    \  developments and changes in operational practice took place that\n   warrant
    an update of these best current practices.  This document\n   obsoletes RFC7454,
    focusing on the overall goals, and providing a\n   less implementation centric
    set of best practices.\n\n   This document describes security requirements and
    goals when\n   operating BGP for exchanging routing information with other networks,\n
    \  and explicitly does not focus on specific technical implementations\n   and
    requirements.\n\n\t "

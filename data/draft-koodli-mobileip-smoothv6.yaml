  content: "During handover from one access router to another, a wireless mobile\nnode
    may need to have a certain amount of state information passed from\nthe Previous-Router
    to the new one.  This document specifies extensions\nto Mobile IPv6 which allow
    additional control structures enabling the\ntransfer of the necessary state during
    handovers.  This state transfer\nallows the applications running on the mobile
    node to operate with\nreduced latency, minimal disruption, and reduced packet
    loss during\nhandovers.\n\n\n\t "

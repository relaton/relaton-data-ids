  content: "This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configuration\nmanagement
    protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to perform\nsets of active tests (i.e.,
    verification) against servers' running\nconfiguration over a period of time to
    afford the client and server a\nmore robust and resilient configuration management
    capability.  This\nis of value to commercial enterprise and public networks as
    well as\nwireless emergency and military networks.  We propose an initial new\nNETCONF
    capability, i.e., verify.  The verify capability is defined\nin the context of
    the verify.yang module listed in the appendix of\nthis document.  Associated with
    the verify operation are various\ntest.yang modules to be defined elsewhere.  However,
    this document\ndefines a set of interoperability requirements on the development
    of\nthe test.yang modules in order to be controlled through the verify\ncapability.\n\t "

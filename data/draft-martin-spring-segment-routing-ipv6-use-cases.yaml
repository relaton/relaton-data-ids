  content: "   Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture leverages\n
    \  the source routing paradigm.  A node steers a packet through a\n   controlled
    set of instructions, called segments, by prepending the\n   packet with SPRING
    header.  A segment can represent any instruction,\n   topological or service-based.
    \ A segment can have a local semantic to\n   the SPRING node or global within
    the SPRING domain.  SPRING allows to\n   enforce a flow through any topological
    path and service chain while\n   maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress
    node to the SPRING\n   domain.\n\n   The objective of this document is to illustrate
    some use cases that\n   need to be taken into account by the Source Packet Routing
    in\n   Networking (SPRING) architecture.\n\n\t "

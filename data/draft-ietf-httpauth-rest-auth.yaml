- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a \"RESTful\" pattern of authentication for\n
    \  HTTP/1.0, 1.1, and 2.0.  The goal is to make it easy to add\n   authentication
    mechanisms to HTTP applications and to make it easy to\n   implement them even
    without much help from the HTTP stack (though it\n   is best to integrate authentication
    into the stack, of course).\n   Another goal is to make it easy to reuse existing
    authentication\n   mechanisms by allowing the user (that is, the server's operators)
    to\n   choose what concrete authentication mechanism(s) to use.\n\n   Among other
    benefits of RESTauth: it is orthogonal to \"HTTP routers\"\n   and proxies, it
    results in session Uniform Resource Identifiers\n   (URIs) that can be DELETEd
    to logout, naturally supports multi-legged\n   authentication schemes, naturally
    supports clustering, and can be\n   universally implemented on the server side
    with such\n   server<->application interfaces as the Common Gateway Interface
    (CGI)\n   and FastCGI, among others.\n\n\t "

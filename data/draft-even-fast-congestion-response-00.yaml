  content: "   The high link speed (100Gb/s) in Data Centers (DC) are making network\n
    \  transfers complete faster and in fewer RTTs.  The short data bursts\n   requires
    low latency while longer data transfer require high\n   throughput.  This document
    describes the current state of flow\n   control and congestion handling in the
    DC using RoCEv2 and suggests\n   new directions for faster congestion control.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a trust anchor bootstrap protocol for the witnessd
    Proof of Process framework. The protocol defines how new devices enter the witnessd
    ecosystem, how device keys are provisioned and verified, and how Verifiers discover
    and validate device trust anchors. Three enrollment modes are defined: self-sovereign
    mode for individual users, organizational mode for enterprise deployments, and
    public registry mode for federated trust ecosystems.</p>"

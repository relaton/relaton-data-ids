  content: "   This document specifies a trust anchor bootstrap protocol for the\n
    \  witnessd Proof of Process framework.  The protocol defines how new\n   devices
    enter the witnessd ecosystem, how device keys are provisioned\n   and verified,
    and how Verifiers discover and validate device trust\n   anchors.\n\n   Three
    enrollment modes are defined: self-sovereign mode for\n   individual users, organizational
    mode for enterprise deployments, and\n   public registry mode for federated trust
    ecosystems.\n\n\t "

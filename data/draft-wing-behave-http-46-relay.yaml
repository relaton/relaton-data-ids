- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "As IPv6-only hosts become commonplace, it is desirable to still have\nIPv4
    clients access those IPv6-only hosts.  Due to the size of the\nIPv4 and IPv6 address
    spaces, this has proven difficult using pure IP\naddress translation.  Rather
    than trying to support all IP protocols,\nor even all TCP or UDP applications,
    this document proposes a\nmechanism for an IPv4 HTTP client to connect to an IPv6-only
    HTTP\nserver.\n\t "

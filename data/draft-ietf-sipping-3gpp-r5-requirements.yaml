  content: "The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has selected Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP Multimedia
    Core Network Subsystem (IMS).  IMS is part of Release 5 of the 3GPP specifications.
    \ Although SIP is a protocol that fulfills most of the requirements for establishing
    a session in an IP network, SIP has never been evaluated against the specific
    3GPP requirements for operation in a cellular network.  In this document, we express
    the requirements identified by 3GPP to support SIP for Release 5 of the 3GPP IMS
    in cellular networks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

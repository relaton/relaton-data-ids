abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The link quality mechanism of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood
    Discovery Protocol (NHDP) enables \"ignoring\" some 1-hop neighbors if the measured
    link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable threshold while still
    retaining the corresponding link information as acquired from the HELLO message
    exchange. This allows immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link
    quality later improves sufficiently.\n\n NHDP also collects information about
    symmetric 2-hop neighbors. However, it specifies that if a link from a symmetric
    1-hop neighbor ceases being symmetric, including while \"ignored\" (as described
    above), then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed. This may lead
    to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being permanently removed (until further
    HELLO messages are received) if the link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor
    drops below the acceptable threshold, even if only for a moment.\n\n This specification
    updates RFC 6130 \"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol
    (NHDP)\" and RFC 7181 \"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2)\"
    to permit, as an option, retaining, but ignoring, symmetric 2-hop information
    when the link quality from the corresponding 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable
    threshold. This allows immediate reinstatement of the symmetric 2-hop neighbor
    if the link quality later improves sufficiently, thus making the symmetric 2-hop
    neighborhood more \"robust\".\n\t "

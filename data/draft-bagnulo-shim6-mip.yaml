  content: "   In this note, we explore the interaction between the SHIM protocol\n
    \  and MIPv6 protocol, identifying potential benefits and difficulties.\n   The
    analysis will consider the two modes of operation of MIPv6: the\n   Bidirectional
    Tunnel (BT) mode where the communication is routed\n   through the Home Agent
    and the Route Optimization (RO) mode, where\n   the communication flows directly
    between the Correspondent node and\n   the mobile node.\n\t "

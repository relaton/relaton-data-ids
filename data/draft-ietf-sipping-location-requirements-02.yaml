  content: "   This document presents the framework and requirements for usage of
    \n   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to convey user location \n   information
    from one Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entity to \n   another SIP entity.
    \ We consider cases where location information is\n   conveyed from end to end,
    as well as cases where message routing by \n   intermediaries is influenced by
    the location of the session \n   initiator.  We offer a set of solutions to the
    requirements, based \n   on the scenario(s) being addressed.\n\t "

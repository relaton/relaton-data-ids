  content: "   This document provides gap analysis and requirements for the problems\n
    \  and use cases that champion the joint optimization of both network\n   and
    computing resources as outlined in[I-D.liu-can-ps-usecases].  It\n   also identifies
    the key engineering investigation areas which require\n   adequate architectures
    and protocols to achieve balanced computing\n   and networking resource utilization
    among facilities providing the\n   services.\n\n\t "

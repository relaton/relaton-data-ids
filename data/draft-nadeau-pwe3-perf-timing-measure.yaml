  content: "   To-date, no intrinsic mechanisms exist for pseudowires\n   that allow
    operators to measure the performance of\n   a pseudowire. Only the existing Virtual
    Circuit Connectivity\n   Verification protocol allows for the verification of\n
    \  connectivity of a pseudowire.\n\n   This document defines the problems that
    must be solved in\n   this space, and provides discussion points around the issues
    of\n   pseudowire performance measurement, including timing synchronization\n
    \  and packet loss detection. \n\t "

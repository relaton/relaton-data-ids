  content: "   As part of the LEMONADE work to define extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1
    \n   protocol [RFC3501] and SMTP that provide optimizations in a variety \n   of
    settings,  the this document  describes an alternative, optional \n   binding
    for IMAPv4 and SMTP showing how HTTP can be used to transfer  \n   commands and
    responses. This binding is intended to facilitate the \n   use of IMAP and SMTP
    in deployments involving a variety of \n   intermediaries. A binding to SOAP is
    also provided. \n\t "

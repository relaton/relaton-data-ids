  content: " The group communication is designed for the communication of Internet\n
    \  of Things. A threat is identified in [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] that\n   current
    DTLS based approach is unicast oriented and there is no\n   supporting on group
    authentication feature. Unicast oriented\n   authentication will causing serious
    burden when a large number of\n   terminal nodes will be involved inevitably.
    In another aspect, some\n   terminals will own the same characteristics, such
    as owning same\n   features, in the same place, working in the same time, etc.
    With this\n   mechanism, all terminals can be authenticated together with little\n
    \  signaling and calculation at the same time. It will reduce the\n   network
    burden and save time. This draft describes the security of\n   group authentication
    and an group authentication implementation\n   method for the Internet of things.\n\t "

  content: "This document is intended as part of an IETF discussion about \"middleboxes\"
    - defined as any intermediary box performing functions apart from normal, standard
    functions of an IP router on the data path between a source host and destination
    host.  This document establishes a catalogue or taxonomy of middleboxes, cites
    previous and current IETF work concerning middleboxes, and attempts to identify
    some preliminary conclusions.  It does not, however, claim to be definitive.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

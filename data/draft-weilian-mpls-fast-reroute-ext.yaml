  content: "   This document defines extensions to the Fast Reroute (FRR) mechanism\n
    \  of Facility Backup defined in RFC4090. Through the extensions, the\n   node
    that has set up FRR relation is capable of notifying the tail \n   node of backup
    tunnel to act as Merge Point (MP) of the protected and\n   backup tunnels. In
    addition, after the FRR switchover, PLR and MP \n   nodes can refresh the protocol
    state of protected tunnel by the \n   Refresh message of backup tunnel, so that
    the protocol messages of \n   protected tunnel don't need to be refreshed through
    the backup \n   tunnel.\n\n\t "

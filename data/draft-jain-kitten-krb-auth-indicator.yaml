  content: "   This document proposes an extension in the Kerberos protocol.  It\n
    \  defines a new Authorization Data Type AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR.  The\n   purpose
    of introducing this data type is to include an indicator of\n   the client's authentication
    strength in the service tickets so that\n   the application services can use it
    as an input into policy\n   decisions.\n\n\t "

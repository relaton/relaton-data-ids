  content: "This document describes a set of enhancements to the Network News Transport
    Protocol [NNTP-977] that allows full-text searching of news articles across multiple
    newsgroups.                                      This new search mechanism also
    allows search criteria to be saved into search profiles.   Articles arriving on
    the server are checked against the profiles, and the articles that match are collected
    together for the client.                                                                 The
    availability of the extensions described here will be advertised by the server
    using the extension negotiation-mechanism described in the new NNTP protocol specification
    currently being developed [NNTP-NEW].\n\t "

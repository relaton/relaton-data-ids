  content: "This protocol is designed to allow general indexing from most of the attribute-value
    based directory services. It is an extension of the current WHOIS++ indexing protocol.
    Also, this protocol is designed to be implemented in such a way as to allow many
    different types of protocols (X.500, WHOIS++, SOLO, LDAP, etc) to use a basic
    server which speaks all these protocols.\n\t "

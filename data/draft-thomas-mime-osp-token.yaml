  content: "The Open Settlement Protocol (OSP)[1], an open standard from the\nEuropean
    Telecommunications Standards Institute, specifies a means\nby which IP telephony
    equipment in one administrative domain may\nrequest access to IP telephony equipment
    (including, but not limited\nto: Gateways, Gatekeepers, Border Elements, etc.)
    in another\nadministrative domain. OSP grants such access by returning\nauthorization
    tokens, which must then be passed to the destination\nIP telephony gateway during
    call signaling. In order to support\naccess control via OSP, IP telephony signaling
    protocols must be\ncapable of carrying these authorization tokens in an interoperable\nway.
    This memo defines just such a method for protocols, such as the\nSession Initiation
    Protocol[2], that can support carriage of MIME\ntypes during call signaling. This
    memo conforms to the requirements\nfor MIME type registration defined in RFC 2048[3].\n\t "

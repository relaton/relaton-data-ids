  content: "   IPv6 prefix sharing in policy for convergence applications makes it\n
    \  impossible to track individual quality of service requirements for\n   each
    host by the policy server.  In order to enable it, we define a\n   protocol which
    is based on the residential gateway sending some\n   parameters such as IPv6 addresses
    of each host (3GPP UE or fixed\n   host) to the edge router.  The edge router
    in its turn establishes\n   IP-CAN sub-session for each host to receive the quality
    of service\n   parameters.  The edge router enforces this quality of service which\n
    \  is specific to the host on its traffic both uplink and downlink.\n   When the
    host disconnects or leaves the network, IP-CAN sub-session\n   is terminated.\n\n\t "

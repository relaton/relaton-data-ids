  content: "   Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical platform\n
    \  Or vServer greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling\n   more
    work from less hardware.  Multiple vServer and associated\n   virtual machines
    work together as one cluster make good use of\n   resources of each vServer that
    are scattered into different data\n   centers or vServers.  VMs have their lifecycles
    from VM creation, VM\n   Power on to VM Power off and VM deletion.  The VMs may
    also move\n   across the participating virtualization hosts (e.g., the\n   virtualization
    server, hypervisor).  This document discusses how VMs,\n   vServers and overlay
    network are managed by leveraging control plane\n   function and management plane
    function and desired signaling\n   functionalities for Network Virtualization
    Overlay.\n\n\t "

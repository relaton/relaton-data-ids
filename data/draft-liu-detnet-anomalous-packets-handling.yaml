  content: "   In deterministic networking (DetNet), there may be resource conflicts\n
    \  at the flow aggregation nodes, resulting in network anomalies.  The\n   existing
    mechanisms for handling anomalous packets in the data plane\n   are crude, such
    as discarding or processing them as BE flows, so the\n   network performance may
    be worse than applying traditional QoS.\n   Therefore, in order to handle the
    anomalous traffic, the data plane\n   should implement an enhanced handling mechanism.\n\n
    \  This document proposes an anomalous packet handling solution for\n   anomalous
    traffic in DetNet.  This solution includes two policies:\n   the packet squeezing
    policy and the packet degrading policy, which\n   can be applied flexibly to a
    variety of queuing mechanisms, thereby\n   ensuring that network traffic for deterministic
    services is\n   preferentially scheduled in anomalous situations.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides a solution for migrating L2VPN virtual private\n
    \  wire service(VPWS) to Ethernet VPN Virtual Private wire service\n   (EVPN-VPWS)
    over SRv6.  The service provider may want to migrate\n   L2VPN VPWS to EVPN-VPWS,
    and deploy EVPN-VPWS over SRv6 network.\n   When co-existing of EVPN-VPWS over
    SRv6 network and a legacy L2VPN\n   VPWS over MPLS/IP network, the next hop of
    the EVPN Ethernet-AD per\n   EVI route is different from the nexthop of VPWS AD
    routes or the\n   source of LDP-LM message of the legacy L2VPN VPWS.  As a result,\n
    \  whether the pseudowire of the EVPN VPWS and legacy L2VPN VPWS is same\n   cannot
    be identified by the next hop of the EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI\n   route and VPWS
    AD routes or LDM messages.  This document provides a\n   solution to identify
    whether the pseudowire of EVPN VPWS is same with\n   the pseudowire of L2VPN VPWS,
    which allows migrating VPWS to EVPN-\n   VPWS under the same vpn instance but
    over different network.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The evergrowing interconnectedness of Internet and society increases\n
    \  the impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals.  Because of\n   this,
    the design and development of the architecture of the Internet\n   also has a
    growing impact on society.  This has led to an broad\n   recognition that human
    rights [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in\n   the development and management
    of the Internet [HRC2012] [UNGA2013]\n   [NETmundial].  It has also been argued
    that the Internet should be\n   strengthened as a human rights enabling environment
    [Brown].\n\n   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the\n
    \  relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of\n   the
    discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,\n   a proposal
    for the mapping of the relation between human rights and\n   technical concepts,
    and a proposal for guidelines for human rights\n   considerations, similar to
    the work done on the guidelines for\n   privacy considerations [RFC6973].\n\n
    \  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published
    for informational purposes.\n\n   This document is a product of the Internet Research
    Task Force\n   (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research\n
    \  and development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus\n   document
    of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of\n   the Internet
    Research Task Force (IRTF).\n\n   Discussion of this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org //\n

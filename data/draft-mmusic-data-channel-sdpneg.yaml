  content: "   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n   communications
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.  For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular defined
    the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP, where each data channel
    might be used to\n   transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.  Data channel
    setup\n   can be done using either the internal in-band band (also referred to\n
    \  as 'internal' for the rest of the document) WebRTC Data Channel\n   Establishment
    Protocol or some external out-of-band simply referred\n   to as 'external negotiation'
    in the rest of the document . This\n   document specifies how the SDP offer/answer
    exchange can be used to\n   achieve such an external negotiation.  Even though
    data channels are\n   designed for RTCWeb use initially they may be used by other
    protocols\n   like, but not limited to, the CLUE protocol.  This document is\n
    \  intended to be used wherever data channels are used.\n\n\t "

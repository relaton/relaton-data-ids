abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the MyClerk Protocol, a tiered-security communication
    protocol designed for distributed family orchestration systems. The protocol provides
    six security tiers ranging from 1-byte minimal overhead for tunneled messages
    to 144-byte full security for critical operations. It supports multiple transport
    mechanisms including NATS, Matrix, WebSocket, and direct TCP, while maintaining
    end-to-end encryption using ChaCha20-Poly1305 and X25519 key exchange. The protocol
    is transport-agnostic, federation-capable, and optimized for environments ranging
    from resource-constrained IoT devices to full-featured desktop clients.</p>"

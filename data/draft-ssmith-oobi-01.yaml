  content: "   An Out-Of-Band Introduction (OOBI) provides a discovery mechanism\n
    \  that associates a given URI or URL with a given AID (Autonomic\n   IDentifier)
    or SAID (Self-Addressing IDentifier)\n   [KERI_ID][KERI][SAID_ID][OOBI_ID].  The
    URI provided by an OOBI acts\n   as a service endpoint for the discovery of verifiable
    information\n   about the AID or SAID.  As such an OOBI itself is not trusted
    but\n   must be verified.  To clarify, any information obtained from the\n   service
    endpoint provided in the OOBI must be verified by some other\n   mechanism.  An
    OOBI, however, enables any internet and web search\n   infrastructure to act as
    an out-of-band infrastructure to discover\n   information that is verified using
    an in-band mechanism or protocol.\n   The primary in-band verification protocol
    is KERI [KERI_ID][KERI].\n   The OOBI protocol provides a web-based bootstrap
    and/or discovery\n   mechanism for the KERI and the ACDC (Authentic Chained Data\n
    \  Container) protocols [KERI_ID][ACDC_ID][OOBI_ID].  Thus the security\n   (or
    more correctly the lack of security) of an OOBI is out-of-band\n   with respect
    to a KERI AID or an ACDC that uses KERI.  To clarify,\n   everything in KERI or
    that depends on KERI is end-verifiable,\n   therefore it has no security dependency
    nor does it rely on security\n   guarantees that may or may not be provided by
    web or internet\n   infrastructure.  OOBIs provide a bootstrap that enables what
    we call\n   Percolated Information Discovery (PID) which is based on Invasion\n
    \  Percolation Theory [IPT][DOMIP][PT][FPP].  This bootstrap may then be\n   parlayed
    into a secure mechanism for accepting and updating data.\n   The principal data
    acceptance and update policy is denoted BADA\n   (Best-Available-Data-Acceptance).\n\n\t "

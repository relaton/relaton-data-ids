  content: "   Distributed artificial intelligence (AI) computing is increasingly\n
    \  deployed across geographically dispersed AI data centers (AIDCs) to\n   meet
    the scale and performance demands of modern AI workloads.  In\n   such environments,
    the efficiency of distributed training, inference,\n   and remote service access
    depends critically on tight coordination\n   between optical transport networks
    and compute orchestration systems.\n   However, today's infrastructure operates
    with isolated control\n   planes: optical networks lack awareness of dynamic compute\n
    \  requirements, while compute schedulers have no visibility into real-\n   time
    network conditions such as latency, bandwidth, or congestion.\n   This decoupling
    leads to suboptimal resource utilization, degraded\n   job performance, and inefficient
    scaling.\n\n   This document presents the problem statement, outlines three\n
    \  representative use cases—distributed AI training, distributed AI\n   inference,
    and remote AI service access—and specifies the\n   requirements for Unified Optical
    Networks and AI Computing\n   Orchestration (UONACO).  The goal is to enable bidirectional\n
    \  awareness, joint resource abstraction, and synchronized control\n   across
    the compute-optical boundary, thereby supporting intent-\n   driven, end-to-end
    provisioning of AI services over wide-area optical\n   infrastructures.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo defines a data structure that can be appended to selected ICMP
    messages. The ICMP extension defined herein can be used to identify any combination
    of the following: the IP interface upon which a datagram arrived, the sub-IP component
    of an IP interface upon which a datagram arrived, the IP interface through which
    the datagram would have been forwarded had it been forwardable, and the IP next
    hop to which the datagram would have been forwarded.\n\n Devices can use this
    ICMP extension to identify interfaces and their components by any combination
    of the following: ifIndex, IPv4 address, IPv6 address, name, and MTU. ICMP-aware
    devices can use these extensions to identify both numbered and unnumbered interfaces.

  content: "   This document extends the AAA authorization framework described in\n
    \  RFC 2904 in that some or all of the authorization task is delegated\n   from
    the AAA server to a local network entity.  The extension\n   considers new AAA
    services such as PANA network access service and\n   dynamic host configuration
    service that have different\n   characteristics from legacy AAA services such
    as PPP service and IEEE\n   802.1X network access service.\n\t "

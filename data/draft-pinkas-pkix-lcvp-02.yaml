  content: "\n   LCVP allows a client to delegate certificate path validation to \n
    \  a trusted server.  The path validation (e.g. making sure that none \n   of
    the certificates in the path are revoked) is performed according \n   to a set
    of rules called a validation policy.  It allows \n   simplification of client
    implementations and only uses of a set of \n   predefined validation policies.
    \ This document defines a protocol \n   that can be used to:\n      (1) validate
    one certificate according to one validation policy,\n      (2) query the validation
    policies supported by an LCVP server. \n\n\t "

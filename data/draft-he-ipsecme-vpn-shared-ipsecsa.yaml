  content: "   In a multi-VPN environment, currently, different IPsec tunnels (i.e.,\n
    \  different IKE SAs and Child SAs) have to be created to differentiate\n   and
    protect the traffic of each VPN between the device and its peer.\n   When the
    number of neighbors of a device and the number of VPNs\n   increases, the number
    of IPsec tunnels also increases considerably.\n   This results in the need for
    a large number of SAs, which exceeds the\n   device's capacity.\n\n   This document
    proposes a method for different VPNs to share the use\n   of a single IPsec tunnel,
    which can greatly reduce the number of SAs\n   required in a multi-VPN scenario.\n\n\t "

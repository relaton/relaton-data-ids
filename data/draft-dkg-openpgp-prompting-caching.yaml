  content: "   Some OpenPGP secret keys and messages are locked with a passphrase.\n
    \  An OpenPGP-using application might want to prompt the user for the\n   passphrase,
    or might want to permit the user to only enter the\n   passphrase once while keeping
    the material unlocked for future use.\n   This document describes a simple interface
    that can be used for\n   prompting the user and for caching the results of such
    a prompt.  It\n   is designed to interoperate well with the Stateless OpenPGP\n
    \  Interface, and to facilitate its use both in test suite operations\n   and
    in common patterns of interactive operation.\n\n\t "

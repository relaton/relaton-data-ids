abstract:
- content: <p>Matrix is an existing openly specified decentralized secure communications
    protocol able to provide a framework for instant messaging interoperability. Matrix
    rooms (aka conversations) currently use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for persisting
    events/ messages. Servers broadcast their changes to the DAG to every other server
    in order to create new events. This model provides excellent decentralization
    characteristics and conversation history replication, but proves complex when
    aiming to use Matrix strictly for interoperability between today's existing messaging
    service providers, which often do not persist chat history serverside, and do
    not seek to replicate it between servers. This document explores an API surface
    for Matrix which optimizes for ease of interoperability at the expense of decentralized
    conversation history at a per-room level. We call this API surface "Linearized
    Matrix".</p>

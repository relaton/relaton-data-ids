  content: "The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX \ntype
    devices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based \nAddress of Records,
    using the GIN mechanism defined in [draft-gin].  \nTwo other drafts, [draft-olive]
    and [draft-glass], propose the same \nfor non-E.164-based AoRs.  This document
    defines a means by which \nthe IP-PBX can verify the resolution entries in the
    SSP for open-\nended or full AoRs of any GIN-based mechanism, using a new Event-\nPackage
    named \"vermouth\".\n\t "

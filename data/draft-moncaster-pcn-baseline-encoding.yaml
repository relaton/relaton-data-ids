  content: "Pre-congestion notification (PCN) provides information to support\nadmission
    control and flow termination in order to protect the\nQuality of Service of inelastic
    flows.  It does this by marking\npackets when traffic load on a link is approaching
    or has exceeded a\nthreshold below the physical link rate.  This document specifies
    how\nsuch marks are to be encoded into the IP header.  The baseline\nencoding
    described here provides for only two PCN encoding states.\nOther documents describe
    extended encoding schemes that allow for\nthree encoding states.\n\nStatus\n\nThis
    memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually\nprogress to
    standards track.\n\t "

  content: "Routers in an operational network are configured with multiple \nprotocols
    and security policies while simultaneously forwarding \ntraffic and being managed.
    \ To accurately benchmark a router for \ndeployment it is necessary to test the
    router in a lab environment\nunder accelerated conditions, which is known as Stress
    Testing.  \nThis document provides the Methodology Guidelines for performing \nAccelerated
    Stress Benchmarking of networking devices.  \nThe methodology is to be used with
    the companion terminology \ndocument [4].  These guidelines can be used as the
    basis for \nadditional methodology documents that benchmark stress conditions
    \nfor specific network technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking\n\t "

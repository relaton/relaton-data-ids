abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document imposes a new requirement on Label Edge Routers (LER)\nspecifying
    that when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IP\npacket, the determination
    is made independent of any IP options that\nmay be carried in the IP packet header.
    \ Lack of a formal standard\nmay result in a different forwarding behavior for
    different IP\npackets associated with the same prefix-based Forwarding Equivalence\nClass
    (FEC).  While an IP packet with either a specific option type\nor no header option
    may follow the MPLS label switched path (LSP)\nassociated with a prefix-based
    FEC, an IP packet with a different\noption type but associated with the same prefix-based
    FEC may bypass\nMPLS encapsulation and instead be IP routed downstream.  IP option\npackets
    that fail to be MPLS encapsulated simply due to their header\noptions present
    a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.\n\t "

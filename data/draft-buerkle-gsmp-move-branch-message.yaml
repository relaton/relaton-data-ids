  content: "Some multicast applications, such as Video distribution, need an\nefficient
    support for moving between multicast groups.\nThis draft shows that the support
    of such application results in a\nextended move branch concept of GSMP to be able
    to move the Output\nbranch of a connection not only to another port but also between\nconnections
    with the same QoS.\n\t "

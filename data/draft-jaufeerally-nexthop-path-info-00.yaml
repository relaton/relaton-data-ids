  content: "   The aim of this document is to define an interface through which an\n
    \  Autonomous System (AS) can disseminate information about forwarding\n   of
    packets to the next hop outside the AS, to devices within its\n   network.  This
    information can be used to make path aware routing\n   decisions, either by being
    aware of the default route packets will\n   take when traversing the AS, or by
    using other mechanisms to control\n   the path packets which is out of the scope
    of this document.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "It is possible for link-state routing protocols to converge in link\npropagation
    time scales, that is, in tens of milliseconds. However,\ncurrent deployments of
    ISIS[ISIS-ISO][ISIS-IP], a link-state routing\nprotocol, are not anywhere near
    this point. In this paper, we present\nsome analyses of ISIS convergence by showing
    its behavior upon\nlink/router failures and repairs, and its scaling properties
    to\nlarge networks, both in terms of number of nodes and links. We\nthen explore
    changes needed in the ISIS specification and implementations to reach IGP convergence
    in milliseconds. Our results are based on experimentation done with ISIS, but
    some of the findings may apply to OSPF as well.\n\t "

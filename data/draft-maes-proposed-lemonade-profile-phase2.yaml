  content: "   This document proposes an initial draft for LEMONADE profile phase
    2.\n   It is based on a combination of the content of LEMONADE profile [4]\n   and
    the OMA MEM realization internet draft [21] initially considered\n   for internet
    draft publication as information or standard track by\n   LEMONADE.\n\n   This
    also provides an initial proposal on how to divide the\n   specification work
    between OMA MEM and LEMONADE for a LEMONADE\n   realization of the OMA MEM enabler.\n\t "

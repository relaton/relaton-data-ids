  content: "Digital Signatures are fast emerging as a viable information security\nsolution,
    satiating the objectives of data integrity, entity \nauthentication, privacy,
    non-repudiation and certification. \nThe technique, as it stands today, faces
    the problem of the \nmaintenance of the secrecy of the private key. This document
    provides \na conceptual framework for the establishment of a biometric-based key
    \ngeneration scheme. In this scheme, the private key is generated each \ntime
    a document or record requires to be signed. Such generation is \nbased upon a
    combination of biometric traits.\n\n\n\t "

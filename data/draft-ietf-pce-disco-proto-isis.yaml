  content: "There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable for a Path
    Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover
    a set of Path Computation Elements (PCEs), along with information that can be
    used by the PCC for PCE selection.  When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR)
    participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating
    passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists of
    using IGP flooding.  For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the
    Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol for the advertisement
    of PCE Discovery information within an IS-IS area or within the entire IS-IS routing
    domain. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

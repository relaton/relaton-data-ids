abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation
    about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol. It explains the motivation for
    including a ConEx marking at the IP layer: to expose information about congestion
    to network nodes. Although such information may have a number of uses, this document
    focuses on how the information communicated by the ConEx marking can serve as
    the basis for significantly more efficient and effective traffic management than
    what exists on the Internet today. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"

  content: "   The IETF ALTO protocol provides guidance to content delivery\n   applications
    such as P2P or Content Delivery Networks (CDN), which\n   have to select one or
    several hosts or endpoints from a set of\n   candidates that are able to provide
    a desired data resource.  This\n   guidance shall be based on parameters that
    affect performance and\n   efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts,
    for instance\n   the topological distance or the routing cost between them.  To
    this\n   end, ALTO Servers deployed by Network Operators (NO), provide\n   requesting
    ALTO Clients with information, currently such as the NO-\n   centric view on the
    network topology, the candidate application\n   endpoints with attributes such
    as their connectivity type.\n\n   The present draft proposes to extend the cost
    information provided by\n   the ALTO protocol by providing, for a same cost metric,
    several\n   possible cost values.  Which value to provide depends on qualitative\n
    \  criteria as opposed to quantitative criteria such as time.  The\n   purpose
    is to allow a finer grained decision on which application\n   endpoint or sub
    network to access given that their routing cost\n   values may depend on criteria
    suh as the access technology of the end\n   system consuming the resources or
    the policy applied for the client\n   requesting ALTO information.\n\n\n\t "

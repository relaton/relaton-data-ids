  content: "   The breadth of IoT applications implies that future wireless\n   environments
    will be characterized by the presence of many diverse,\n   administratively independent
    IoT networks operating in the same\n   physical location.  In many cases, these
    networks will use unlicensed\n   spectrum, due to its low cost and ease of deployment.
    \ However, this\n   spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded.  IoT networks will\n
    \  therefore be subject to wireless interference, both from similar\n   networks
    and from networks that use the channel in very different\n   ways.\n\n   To date,
    there have been few studies or testbeds that fully reflect\n   this aspect of
    the future IoT operating environment.  This document\n   describes some of the
    main issues in network co-existence in IoT\n   environments, focusing on protocol-level
    interactions.  It identifies\n   two issues for the IRTF t2trg community.  The
    first is to define best\n   practices for performance evaluation and protocol
    design in the\n   context of inter-network interference.  The second is the potential\n
    \  use of higher layer protocols to actively participate in interference\n   mitigation.\n\n\t "

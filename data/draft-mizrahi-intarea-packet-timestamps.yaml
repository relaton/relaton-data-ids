  content: "   This document specifies guidelines for defining binary packet\n   timestamp
    formats in networking protocols at various layers.  It also\n   presents three
    recommended timestamp formats.  The target audience of\n   this memo includes
    network protocol designers.  It is expected that a\n   new network protocol that
    requires a packet timestamp will, in most\n   cases, use one of the recommended
    timestamp formats.  If none of the\n   recommended formats fits the protocol requirements,
    the new protocol\n   specification should specify the format of the packet timestamp\n
    \  according to the guidelines in this document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Mobile networks using LTE, 4G are complex. Managing mobility and\n
    \  content delivery using IP is complex and not optimized. IP unicast\n   routing
    from server to clients is used for delivery of multimedia\n   content to User
    Equipment (UE), where each user gets separate stream.\n   From bandwidth and routing
    perspective this approach is inefficient.\n   Multicast and broadcast technologies
    have emerged recently for mobile\n   networks, but their deployments are very
    limited or at an\n   experimental stage due to complex architecture and radio
    spectrum\n   issues. ICN is a rapidly evolving technology for efficient multimedia\n
    \  content delivery, however majority of the work is focused either on\n   fixed
    networks or unlicensed WiFi-based wireless networks. The main\n   focus of this
    draft is on native deployment of ICN in cellular mobile\n   networks by embedding
    into 3GPP protocol stack at IP level or\n   replacing IP for non-IP datagrams.
    ICN has an inherent capability for\n   anchorless mobility, security and it is
    optimized for content\n   delivery using local caching at the edge. We believe
    that native or\n   dual stack (with IP) deployment will bring all inherent benefits
    of\n   ICN and help in optimizing mobile networks.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The proposed pretty Easy privacy (pEp) protocols for email are based\n
    \  upon already existing email and encryption formats (such as PGP/MIME)\n   and
    designed to allow for easily implementable and interoperable\n   opportunistic
    encryption.  The protocols range from key distribution,\n   secret key synchronization
    between own devices, to mechanisms of\n   metadata and content protection.  The
    metadata and content protection\n   is achieved by moving the whole message (not
    only the body part) into\n   the PGP/MIME encrypted part.  The proposed pEp Email
    Formats not only\n   achieve simple forms of metadata protection (like subject\n
    \  encryption), but also allow for sending email messages through a\n   mixnet.
    \ Such enhanced forms of metadata protection are explicitly\n   discussed within
    the scope of this document.\n\n   The purpose of pEp for email is to simplify
    and automate operations\n   in order to make usage of email encryption viable
    for a wider range\n   of Internet users, with the goal of achieving widespread\n
    \  implementation of data confidentiality and privacy practices in the\n   real
    world.\n\n   The proposed operations and formats are targeted towards\n   Opportunistic
    Security scenarios and are already implemented in\n   several applications of
    pretty Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t "

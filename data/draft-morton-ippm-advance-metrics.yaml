  content: "This memo supports the process of progressing performance metric RFCs\nalong
    the standards track.  Observing that the metric definitions\nthemselves should
    be the primary focus rather than the\nimplementations of metrics, this memo describes
    results of example\nlab test procedures to evaluate specific metric RFC requirement\nclauses
    to determine if the requirement has been implemented as\nintended.  A single implementation
    has been tested against the key\nspecifications of RFC 2679 on One-way Delay.\n\t "

  content: "   At one time, the RFC Editor published snapshots of the \"Internet\n
    \  Official Protocol Standards\".  These documents were known as xx00\n   documents,
    the last of which was published in May 2008.  These\n   snapshots have been replaced
    by an online database.  The RFC Editor\n   provides an up-to-date list on the
    RFC Editor website and will no\n   longer be publishing these snapshots as RFCs.\n\n\t "

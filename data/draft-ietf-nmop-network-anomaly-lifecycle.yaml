  content: "   Network Anomaly Detection is the act of detecting problems in the\n
    \  network.  Accurately detecting problems is very challenging for\n   network
    operators in production networks.  Good results require a lot\n   of expertise
    and knowledge around both the implied network\n   technologies and the connectivity
    services provided to customers,\n   apart from a proper monitoring infrastructure.
    \ In order to\n   facilitate network anomaly detection, novel techniques are being\n
    \  introduced, including programmatical, rule-based and AI-based, with\n   the
    promise of improving scalability and the hope to keep a high\n   detection accuracy.
    \ To guarantee acceptable results, the process\n   needs to be properly designed,
    adopting well-defined stages to\n   accurately collect evidence of anomalies,
    validate their relevancy\n   and improve the detection systems over time, iteratively.\n\n
    \  This document describes a well-defined approach on managing the\n   lifecycle
    process of a network anomaly detection system, spanning\n   across the recording
    of its output and its iterative refinement, in\n   order to facilitate network
    engineers to interact with the network\n   anomaly detection system, enable the
    \"human-in-the-loop\" paradigm and\n   refine the detection abilities over time.
    \ The major contributions of\n   this document are: the definition of three key
    stages of the\n   lifecycle process, the definition of a state machine for each
    anomaly\n   annotation on the system and the definition of YANG data models\n
    \  describing a comprehensive format for the anomaly labels, allowing a\n   well-structured
    exchange of those between all the interested actors.\n\n\t "

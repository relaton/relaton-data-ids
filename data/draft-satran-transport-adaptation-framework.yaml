  content: "This draft is an attempt to outline a 'technique' (I hesitate to call
    \nit a protocol) to adapt a transport protocol to application needs, \noutside
    the protocol payload, without interfering with the transport \nprotocol operation,
    nor directly affecting its implementation. \nIt is based on an 'interposer' header
    between the IP header and the \ntransport header (TCP or UDP) and, when needed,
    a trailer that that \nis appended to the transport PDU.\n\t "

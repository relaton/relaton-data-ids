  content: "\n   Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced\n
    \  as a field type within proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols.\n   The
    basic goal of an SDNV is to hold a non-negative integer value of\n   arbitrary
    magnitude, without consuming much more space than\n   necessary.  The primary
    motivation is to conserve the bits sent\n   across low-capacity or energy-intensive
    links typical of NASA deep-\n   space missions, with a secondary goal of allowing
    the protocol to\n   automatically adjust to unforseen usage scenarios.  This can
    be\n   desirable in that it allows protocol designers to avoid making\n   difficult
    and potentially erroneous engineering decisions that may\n   have to be hacked
    around in the future.  This document describes\n   formats and algorithms for
    SDNV encoding and decoding, and discusses\n   implementation and usage of SDNVs.\n\n\n\t "

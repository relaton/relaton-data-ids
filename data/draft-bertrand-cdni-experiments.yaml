  content: "   This document reports studies and related experiments on CDN\n   interconnection
    performed by France Telecom-Orange Labs.  The\n   document summarizes implications
    of CDN interconnection to CDN\n   service providers and lessons learned through
    CDNI experiments.\n\n   The main purpose of the experiments was to test the interconnection\n
    \  of CDN solutions from two vendors (namely, Cisco and Verivue) and to\n   identify
    the gaps and needs for standardization work for CDN\n   interconnection.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes a solution for Basic Network Support.  It\nproposes
    Mobile IPv6 extensions as advocated by the NEMO working\ngroup.  Our solution
    differs from Prefix Scope Binding Update (PSBU)\nwhich was originally proposed
    before the NEMO working group was set\nup.  Our draft however uses mechanisms
    similar to those of PSBU, such\nas 'Prefix binding' and 'Searching mechanism of
    prefix binding'.\nThe main difference relies on the management of the permanent
    address\nof the MR, which is assigned to the ingress interface, and not to the\negress
    interface.\n\t "

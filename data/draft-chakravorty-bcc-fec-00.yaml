  content: "   IETF Internet Draft \"IPv6 Label Switching Architecture (6LSA)\" [6LSA]\n
    \  [2] proposes using the IPv6 Flow Label field to switch packets\n   through
    an IPv6 subnetwork.  The use of these IPv6 Label Switched\n   Paths (6LSPs) can
    provide means for traffic engineering and\n   potentially increase the speed of
    packets traversing a routed network\n   with no increase in bandwidth.  The 6LSA
    draft defines two processes:\n   1) grouping packets with identical forwarding
    behavior into a\n   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC), 2) forwarding all packets\n
    \  belonging to an FEC along the same path.  The assignment of packets\n   to
    an FEC is called binding.  The purpose of this document is to\n   expand on these
    two processes, discussing specific methods of\n   performing the required functions.\n\t "

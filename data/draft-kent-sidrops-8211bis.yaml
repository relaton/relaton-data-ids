  content: "   This document analyzes actions by or against a Certification\n   Authority
    (CA) or an independent repository manager in the RPKI that\n   can adversely affect
    the Internet Number Resources (INRs) associated\n   with that CA or its subordinate
    CAs.  The analysis is done from the\n   perspective of an affected INR holder.
    \ The analysis is based on\n   examination of the data items in the RPKI repository,
    as controlled\n   by a CA (or an independent repository manager) and fetched by
    Relying\n   Parties (RPs).  The analysis does not purport to be comprehensive;
    it\n   does represent an orderly way to analyze a number of ways that errors\n
    \  by or attacks against a CA or repository manager can affect the RPKI\n   and
    routing decisions based on RPKI data.\n\n\t "

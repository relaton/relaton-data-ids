  content: "   This document specifies a stateful pull model for LISP where ITRs can\n
    \  subscribe with the mapping system to be notified whenever a\n   particular
    EID mapping changes.  The model uses a publish/subscribe\n   mechanism that supports
    overlapping EID registrations without having\n   to notify the ITR about every
    single prefix covered by a particular\n   subscription.  The pull model is stateful
    in the sense that it\n   requires that the mapping system maintain subscription
    state.\n\n\t "

  content: "   NFS version 4 (NFSv4) introduces the use of file delegations to\n   improve
    the ability of clients to cache file data and to provide\n   locks in certain
    sharing environments without performing a round-trip\n   communication to the
    server.  Directory caching in NFSv4, however, is\n   similar to previous versions
    and generates unnecessary revalidation\n   traffic to maintain consistency weaker
    than delegations can provide.\n   This document addresses the issues involved
    in providing a directory\n   delegation mechanism and specifies a new operation,
    REQUEST_DELEGA-\n   TION, to enable directory delegations.\n\t "

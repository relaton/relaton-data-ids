  content: "   In IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), randomizing the\n
    \  interface identifier (IID) is a common practice to promote privacy.\n   If
    there are a very large number of nodes, as has been discussed in\n   several use
    cases, the effect will to proportionately increase the\n   number of IIDs.  A
    duplicate address detection (DAD) cycle is needed\n   for each configured IID,
    introducing more and more overhead into the\n   network.  Each failed DAD requires
    the initiating node to regenerate\n   a new IID and undergo the DAD cycle again.
    \ This document proposes an\n   optimized approach when higher privacy is required
    in a given network\n   by allowing a 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router) to provide a
    unique IID,\n   avoiding any potential duplication.  Such practice also prevents\n
    \  failure of time-critical applications, by enabling 6LBR to provide a\n   unique
    IID, in case of address collision.\n\n   Further improvements are proposed to
    enable multiple concurrent DAD\n   cycles, and to return the randomized IID from
    6LBR to 6LN in a space-\n   efficient manner.\n\n\t "

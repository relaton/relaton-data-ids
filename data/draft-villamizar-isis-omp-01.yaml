  script: Latn
  content: "IS--IS may form multiple equal cost paths between points.  This is\n  true
    of any link state protocol.  In the absence of any explicit sup-\n  port to take
    advantage of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily.\n  Techniques have been utilized
    to divide traffic somewhat evenly among\n  the available paths.  These techniques
    have been referred to as Equal\n  Cost Multipath (ECMP). An unequal division of
    traffic among the avail-\n  able paths is generally preferable.  Routers generally
    have no knowl-\n  edge of traffic loading on distant links and therefore have
    no basis\n  to optimize the allocation of traffic.\n \n  Optimized Mulitpath is
    a extension to IS--IS, utilizing additional\n  Type/Length/Value (TLV) tuples
    to distribute loading information.  An\n  algorithm to adjust forwarding, gradually
    enough to insure stability\n  yet provide reasonably fast adjustment when needed,
    is provided in the\n  related document OSPF--OMP [5].  The IS--IS encapsulation
    and minor\n  differences in the dynamics of ISIS--OMP relative to OSPF--OMP are\n
    \ described here.\n\t "

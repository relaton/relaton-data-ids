abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The extensible authentication protocol (EAP), specified in RFC3748\n
    \  [1] is a generic framework for network access authentication, in\n   which
    a peer engages in a full EAP conversation each time.  A full\n   EAP conversation
    involves several roundtrips between the peer and the\n   authentication server
    in the home domain, and that is not acceptable\n   for fast roaming.  In this
    document, we explain the requirements for\n   low-latency EAP re-authentication
    and associated key management.\n\n\n\t "

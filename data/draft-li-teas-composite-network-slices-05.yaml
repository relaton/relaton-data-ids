  content: "   A network slice offers connectivity services to a network slice\n   customer
    with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service\n   Level Expectations
    (SLEs) over a common underlay network.  RFC 9543\n   describes a framework for
    network slices built in networks that use\n   IETF technologies.  As part of that
    framework, the Network Resource\n   Partition (NRP) is introduced as a collection
    of network resources\n   that are allocated from the underlay network to carry
    a specific set\n   of network slice service traffic and meet specific SLOs and
    SLEs.  In\n   some network scenarios, network slices using IETF technologies may\n
    \  span multiple network domains, and they may be composed\n   hierarchically,
    which means a network slice itself may be further\n   sliced.  In the context
    of 5G, a 5G end-to-end network slice consists\n   of three different types of
    network technology segments: Radio Access\n   Network (RAN), Transport Network
    (TN) and Core Network (CN).  The\n   transport segments of the 5G end-to-end network
    slice can be provided\n   using network slices described in RFC 9543.\n\n   This
    document first describes the possible use cases of composite\n   network slices
    built in networks that use IETF network technologies,\n   then it provides considerations
    about the realization of composite\n   network slices.  For the multi-domain network
    slices, an Inter-Domain\n   Network Resource Partition Identifier (Inter-domain
    NRP ID) may be\n   introduced.  For hierarchical network slices, the structure
    of the\n   NRP ID is discussed.  And for the interaction between IETF network\n
    \  slices with 5G network slices, the identifiers of the 5G network\n   slices
    may be introduced into IETF networks.  These network slice-\n   related identifiers
    may be used in the data plane, control plane and\n   management plane of the network
    for the instantiation and management\n   of composite network slices.  This document
    also describes the\n   management considerations of composite network slices.\n\n\t "

  content: "Many Internet users currently cannot participate in wide-area IP\nmulticast
    sessions, because their first-hop routers (or beyond) do not\nsupport IP multicast
    routing.  We describe an application level\n(UDP-based) tunneling mechanism that
    allows non-multicast-connected\nusers - with no modification to their operating
    systems - to\nautomatically receive a large class of multicast sessions, pending
    the\ndeployment of multicast in their upstream routers.\n\t "

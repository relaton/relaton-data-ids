  content: "   Large webserver farms consist of thousands of frontend proxies that\n
    \  serve as endpoints for the TCP and TLS connection and relay traffic\n   to
    the (sometimes distant) backend servers.  Load-balancing across\n   those server
    is done by layer-4 loadbalancers that ensure that a TCP\n   flow will always reach
    the same server.\n\n   Multipath TCP's use of multiple TCP subflows for the transmission
    of\n   the data stream requires those loadbalancers to be aware of MPTCP to\n
    \  ensure that all subflows belonging to the same MPTCP connection reach\n   the
    same frontend proxy.  In this document we analyze the challenges\n   related to
    this and suggest a simple modification to the generation\n   of the MPTCP-token
    to overcome those challenges.\n\n\t "

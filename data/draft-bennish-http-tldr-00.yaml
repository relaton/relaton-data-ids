  content: "   This document describes an HTTP extension that allows user agents to\n
    \  verify downloaded data.  It provides a standardised way for an HTTPS\n   URL
    (assumed trustworthy) to redirect to a non-HTTPS URL and give the\n   user agent
    extra information about the resulting output (e.g. a\n   downloaded file.)  Once
    that is retrieved, it can check whether or\n   not the data has been modified
    since the trustworthy site checked it\n   (e.g. altered during transit or as a
    result of the destination site\n   having been compromised.)\n\n\t "

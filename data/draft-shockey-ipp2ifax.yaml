  content: "This memorandum discusses the use of the Internet Print Protocol\n[IPP]
    as a facsimile service. IPP has most of the functional\nattributes necessary to
    be a successful real time facsimile\nservice on the Internet with little or no
    modification to the\ncore IPP V 1.0 protocols [IPP-MOD] [IPP-PRO].\n \nIPP compliance
    with the legal and general custom and practice\nsurrounding General Switched Telephone
    Network [FAX] will require\nsome modification to the behavior of IPP clients and
    the common\nusage of time/date stamping on local IPP device transactions and logs.\n\n\t "

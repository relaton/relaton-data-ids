  content: "   Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) aims at evolving the way\n   network
    operators design, deploy and provision their networks by\n   leveraging on standard
    IT virtualisation technologies to move and\n   consolidate a wide range of network
    functions and services onto\n   industry standard high volume servers, switches
    and storage.  The\n   primary target for operators, stimulated by the recent updates
    on NFV\n   and SDN, is the network edge.  In fact, operators are considering\n
    \  their future datacentres and Points of Presence (PoPs) as\n   increasingly
    dynamic infrastructures where Virtualised Network\n   Functions (VNFs) and on-demand
    chained services with high elasticity\n   will be deployed.\n\n   This document
    presents an orchestration framework for automated\n   deployment of highly available
    VNF chains.  Resiliency of VNFs and\n   chained services is a key requirement
    for operators to improve, ease,\n   automate and speed up services lifecycle management.
    \ The proposed\n   VNFs orchestration framework is also positioned with respect
    to\n   current NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC) architectures and\n   solutions.\n\n\t "

  content: "The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP), specified in RFC 4656,
    provides a common protocol for measuring one-way metrics between network devices.
    \ OWAMP can be used bi-directionally to measure one-way metrics in both directions
    between two network elements.  However, it does not accommodate round-trip or
    two-way measurements.  This memo specifies a Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
    (TWAMP), based on the OWAMP, that adds two-way or round-trip measurement capabilities.
    \ The TWAMP measurement architecture is usually comprised of two hosts with specific
    roles, and this allows for some protocol simplifications, making it an attractive
    alternative in some circumstances. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "In recent years there has been dramatic progress on the enabling technologies
    for workstation-based multimedia teleconferencing applications.  We expect that
    such applications will soon become an important component of many future social
    and business interactions.  Teleconferencing applications have aspects of their
    state, such as membership, types of media beings used, and encryption, that are
    under joint control.  Much of this state is 'ephemeral', in that it is of importance
    only for the duration of a session, and does not have importance outside of the
    session itself.  In this paper we focus on the specification and realization of
    policies for managing this shared ephemeral teleconferencing state.  We first
    define a broad family of policies which has three dimensions:  initiation, voting
    and consistency.  We then consider three different communication models, and for
    each model present a mechanism which implements this family of policies.  This
    specification is a product of the Multiparty Multimedia Session Control working
    group within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should
    be addressed to the working group's\n\t "

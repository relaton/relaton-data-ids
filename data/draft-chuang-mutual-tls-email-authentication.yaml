abstract:
- content: "<p>Valid client and server TLS certificates authenticate the traffic coming
    from the SMTP sending and receiving servers. Domain owners can delegate email
    sending and receiving to servers using Mail eXchange (MX) DNS resource records.
    This enables transitive authentication of mail traffic from sending and receiving
    domains of envelope sender much like Sender Policy Framework and the envelope
    recipient. This document also proposes an Automatic Certificate Management Environment
    responder using these DNS records to automate TLS certificate issuance.</p>"

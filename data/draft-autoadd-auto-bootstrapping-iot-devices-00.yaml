  content: "   IoT devices are fast getting embedded into our lives, and when put\n
    \  together they have the potential to generate a precise and detailed\n   history
    of our lives and store them forever.  Their networking and\n   communicational
    power can be unleashed for malicious and sabotage\n   purposes, by a motivated
    attacker sitting in the far corner of the\n   world.  Attacks on Industrial IoT
    systems can cause greater\n   disasters.  It is therefore essential to inculcate
    the security\n   aspect, right from design to development to operations.  The
    first\n   operation of an IoT device is to bootstrap itself, and due importance\n
    \  should be placed to ensure that this operation is carried out\n   securely
    and with due diligence.  However, it's easier said than\n   done, and this paper
    outlines several approaches for secure automated\n   bootstrapping and also proposes
    a new method, which is compared\n   against the existing mechanisms for several
    qualitative factors.\n\n\t "

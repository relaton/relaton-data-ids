  content: "NAT-PT (RFC2766) is an address translation mechanism designed to \nfacilitate
    communications between IPv6-only and IPv4-only nodes.  \nThis mechanism was designed
    to be used when tunneling transition \nmechanisms cannot be used.   \nThis document
    is intended to be a compilation of known security \nissues related to NAT-PT and
    includes a few new ones.  These issues \nare discussed in some detail, and suggestions
    on how to deal with \nthem are included in this document. \n\t "

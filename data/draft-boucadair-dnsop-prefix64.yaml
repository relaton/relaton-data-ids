  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)\n   option
    to convey the IPv6 prefix used to build IPv4-converted IPv6\n   addresses.  When
    conveyed in a DNS query, the option communicates the\n   IPv6 prefix used in the
    network from which the query was originated.\n   Such a network is assumed to
    enable a Network Address and Protocol\n   Translation from IPv6 clients to IPv4
    servers (NAT64) function.\n   DNS64-capable servers will use that prefix to build
    synthesized AAAA\n   records, rather than relying on a preconfigured prefix.  When\n
    \  conveyed in a DNS reply, the option conveys the IPv6 prefix that is\n   used
    by a DNS64-capable server to synthesized AAAA records.  Such\n   information helps
    to automatically detect mismatches between the\n   local NAT64 configuration and
    the one enforced at the DNS64 server.\n   Also, security-aware and validating
    hosts may use the new EDNS0\n   option to signal the presence of a NAT64 function.
    \ That signal is\n   used by the DNS server to fill the additional section of
    the AAAA\n   reply in order to supply A RRs of the target.  Dual queries and\n
    \  delays are thus avoided.\n\n   This document updates RFC 6147.\n\n\t "

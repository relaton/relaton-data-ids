  content: "   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography will\n
    \  come uncertainty about the strength of cryptographic primitives.  For\n   example;
    when will RSA and ECC fall?  Are Lattice schemes as strong\n   as we believe?
    \ The cryptographic community is calling for hybrid\n   schemes that combine classic
    and post-quantum crypto in ways that\n   remain strong so long as at least one
    of the algorithms used remains\n   strong.\n\n   This document defines the problem
    statement for digital signatures in\n   PKIX-like protocols, and gives an overview
    of the general families of\n   solutions.\n\n\t "

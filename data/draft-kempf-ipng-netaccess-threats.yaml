  content: "The Mobile IP Working Group has been conducting a threat analysis \nfor
    the purpose of securing specific Mobile IPv6 mechanisms. In the \nprocess of conducting
    the analysis, threats were identified that are \nnot specific to Mobile IP but
    that are amplified by the nature of \nmobility. These threats are likely to be
    more or less of an issue \nwithin any Public Multi-Access network, regardless
    of whether \nmobility is involved. This document discusses threats associated
    \nwith Public Multi-Access links in IPv6. The document covers non-\nMobile IP
    specific threats uncovered by the Mobile IPv6 study, \nthreats raised in the IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery and Stateless Address \nAutoconfiguration RFCs that have yet
    to be adequately addressed, and \nnew threats that have not previously been identified.\n\t "

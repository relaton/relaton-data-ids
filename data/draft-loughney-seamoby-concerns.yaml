  content: "As a mobile node moves in a network, existing mobility mechanisms\nmay
    not be sufficient to achieve performance as expected by the\nuser. Seamless mobility
    can be said to be achieved when a mobile\nnode suffers little to no disruption
    of service.  This document\npresents an overview of requirements and functions
    needed for\nSeamless Mobility and their impact.\n\n\n\t "

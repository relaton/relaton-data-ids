  content: "   This document presents a set of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) \n
    \  call control requirements that support communication with direct \n   transcoding
    capability. Several solutions are addressed for \n   transcoding service. \n    \n
    \  Direct transcoding requires two kinds of requirements: the service \n   requirement
    and call control requirement. Service requirement is no \n   constraint of codec
    adaptation and interoperability of models. Call \n   control requirement is exchange
    of codec information and minimizing \n   of call set up delay. \n \n   The model
    might be applied to general-purpose services satisfying the \n   requirements
    of multimedia applications without an additional INVITE. \n\t "

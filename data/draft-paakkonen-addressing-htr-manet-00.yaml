  content: "This document presents IPv6 addressing related to end-to-end \nconnectivity
    in a Mobile Ad hoc Network with heterogeneous nodes. \nInternet connectivity for
    the mobile ad hoc network has to be provided\nby an Access Router. The nodes in
    such a network could only have IPv6 \nfunctionality, or contain support for Mobile
    IPv6 (MIPv6) or facilitate\nad hoc routing by using a MANET-based routing protocol.
    End-to-end \nconnectivity means that the nodes must be able to communicate with
    each \nother locally and over the Internet. The draft focuses on the Ad hoc \nOn-demand
    Distance Vector (AODV) as a MANET-based routing protocol.    \n\t "

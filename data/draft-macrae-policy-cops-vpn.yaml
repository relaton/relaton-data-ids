  content: "   This document proposes a solution for establishing connectivity for\n
    \  a network routed VPN. It makes use of a Policy Server to get\n   information
    on the establishment of tunnels between the Edge Devices\n   of a Service Provider's
    network. Use of a Policy Server allows a\n   network operator to enable the tunnel
    topology which is most suited\n   to the VPN; provides a mechanism to learn about
    the current state of\n   the VPN connectivity; and enables the addition and removal
    of\n   tunnels to reflect current network demands. The proposed extensions\n   are
    independent of the specific tunneling technology deployed in the\n   core of the
    network, i.e. MPLS, ATM, FR or IP.\n \n   The document also defines the extensions
    required to the COPS\n   (Common Open Policy Service) protocol being developed
    in the IETF\n   for communication between the Edge Devices and the Policy Server
    to\n   exchange VPN connectivity information.\n\n\t "

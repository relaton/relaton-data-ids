  content: "There is a need for standardized mechanisms to manipulate, install,\nedit,
    and delete the configuration of a network device.  In addition,\nthere is a need
    to retrieve device state information and receive\nasynchronous device state messages
    in a manner consistent with the\nconfiguration mechanisms.  There is great interest
    in using an XML\nbased data encoding because a significant set of tools for\nmanipulating
    ASCII text and XML encoded data already exists.\n\t "

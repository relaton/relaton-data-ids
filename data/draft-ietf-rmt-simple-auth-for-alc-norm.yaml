  content: "This document introduces four schemes that provide per-packet authentication,
    integrity, and anti-replay services in the context of the Asynchronous Layered
    Coding (ALC) and NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocols.  The first
    scheme is based on RSA Digital Signatures.  The second scheme relies on the Elliptic
    Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  The third scheme relies on a Group-
    keyed Message Authentication Code (MAC).  Finally, the fourth scheme merges the
    Digital Signature and group schemes.  These schemes have different target use
    cases, and they do not all provide the same service. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

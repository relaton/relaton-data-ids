abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   QUIC ([RFC9000]) defines a few different mechanism flow control\n   mechanisms:
    Stream flow control, connection-level flow control and\n   flow control for the
    number of (unidirectional / bidirectional)\n   streams\n\n   This allows a single
    application running on of a QUIC connection to\n   apply backpressure.\n\n   However,
    when multiple independent applications share a single\n   underlying QUIC connection,
    these mechanisms are not sufficient to\n   prevent one resource-hungry application
    from consuming all the\n   resources (streams and / or connection-level flow control
    credit)\n   available on the connection, effectively starving the other\n   application.\n\n\t "

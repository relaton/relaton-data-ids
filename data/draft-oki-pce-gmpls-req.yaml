  content: "Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of traffic engineering\nin
    Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and IP/MPLS net-\nworks. In
    IP/MPLS networks, PCE provides MPLS LSP routes with con-\nstraints. In GMPLS networks,
    PCE provides GMPLS LSP routes and optimal\nvirtual network topology reconfiguration
    control, and jugdes on whether\na new lower-region LSP should be established when
    a higher-region LSP is\nrequested. PCE also handles interworking between GMPLS
    and IP/MPLS net-\nworks, both of which will coexist at some point during the migration\nprocess.\n\t "

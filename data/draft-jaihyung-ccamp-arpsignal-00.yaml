  content: "     In this memo, we first discuss some weaknesses of proposals\n     employing
    RSVP in local network, such as RFC2814, 2815, 2816, and\n     propose extension
    of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and [LSE]\n     technique for solution to
    provide QoS in Ethernet based Customer\n     Premise Network (ECPN). Framework
    architecture of LSE (Label\n     Switched Ethernet) as a method of GMPLS implementation
    for Ethernet\n     is described in [LSE]. ARP is proposed for integrated signaling
    and\n     routing protocol in ECPN. This document describes overview of ARP\n
    \    extension, procedure for label negotiation and method for QoS\n     routing.
    \ Major features of this ARP extension are; support for\n     label switching,
    incorporation of routing function, compatibility\n     with legacy Ethernet and
    enhanced security.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the requirements of an audio communication \nsystem
    (ACS) for acoustic content, especially speech and music. The \nACS consists of
    all components above the IP layer and below a digital \nPCM audio interface. These
    include codec, jitter buffer, and \ntransport. \n\nThe goal of the ACS is to provide
    a bidirectional acoustic \ncommunication between any two Internet hosts at a good
    quality, \nconstrained only by the available resources at the hosts and the \ncharacteristics
    of the transmission path between both hosts. \n\nThe intention of the document
    is to provide the requirements for a \ncodec that is solely intended for the Internet,
    to provide the \nrequirements for the codec's payload specification, and to define
    the \nrequirements on the transport protocol.\n\t "

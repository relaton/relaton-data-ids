  content: "   The Signed Prefix List (SPL) is an RPKI object that attests to the\n
    \  complete list of prefixes which an Autonomous System (AS) may\n   originate
    in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  This document\n   specifies an SPL-based
    Route Origin Verification (SPL-ROV)\n   methodology and combines it with the ROA-based
    ROV (ROA-ROV) to\n   facilitate an integrated mitigation strategy for prefix hijacks
    and\n   AS forgery.  The document also explains the various BGP security\n   threats
    that SPL can help address and provides operational\n   considerations associated
    with SPL-ROV deployment.\n\n\t "

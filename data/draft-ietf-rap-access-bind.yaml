  content: "There is an ever-growing distinction between edge and core \nfunctionality.
    While the core continues to focus on stability and \npure forwarding functionality,
    the edges increasingly need to deal \nwith dynamic capabilities like QoS management,
    VPN encapsulations, \nencryption, dynamic steering and service monitoring. The
    dynamic \ndeployment of these functions is dependent on specific contextual \nknowledge
    such as the physical location of the data stream and the \nidentity of the client
    or system generating the data.\n\t "

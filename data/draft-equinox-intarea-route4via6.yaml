  content: "   // This draft lives at https://github.com/eqvinox/dhc-route4via6\n\n
    \  As a result of the shortage of IPv4 addresses, installations are\n   increasingly
    recovering IPv4 addresses from uses where they are not\n   strictly necessary.
    \ One such situation is in establishing next hops\n   for IPv4 routes, replacing
    this use with IPv6 addresses.  This\n   document describes how to provision DHCP-configured
    hosts with their\n   routes in such a situation.\n\n\t "

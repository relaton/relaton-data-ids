  content: "   This document discusses the necessity and solutions of PPSP NAT\n   traversal.
    \ Two NAT traversal solutions based are described in this\n   document: PPSP-ICE
    and RELOAD-ICE solution.  PPSP-ICE and RELOAD-ICE\n   solutions both use ICE.
    \ PPSP-ICE solution uses PPSP messages to\n   convey ICE parameters, while RELOAD-ICE
    solution proposes to form a\n   RELOAD overlay with PPSP peers and use RELOAD
    messages to exchange\n   ICE parameters.  Extensions to PPSP are also proposed
    to support\n   these solutions.\n\n\t "

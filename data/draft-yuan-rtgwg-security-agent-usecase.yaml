abstract:
- content: "<p>Core network devices like routers fulfill dual roles of data forwarding
    and security protection. However, escalating threats (e.g., zero-day vulnerabilities,
    DDoS attacks) expose limitations of traditional security—relying on static ACLs,
    signature-based detection, and manual configuration—causing delayed responses,
    high false positives, and protection gaps. This paper proposes AI Network Security
    Agents: intelligent software components leveraging machine learning, behavioral
    analysis, and real-time data fusion, with three core capabilities (adaptive learning,
    automation, distributed collaboration) to shift security from passive to intelligent.
    Four key scenarios are outlined: dynamic defense against unknown threats via baselines
    and tracing; ACL optimization via intent parsing; configuration security via baseline
    checks and simulation; and collaborative defense via intelligence aggregation
    and linked responses. AI Agents turn routers into active security orchestrators,
    enhancing threat protection and operational efficiency.</p>"

  content: "   Core network devices like routers fulfill dual roles of data\n   forwarding
    and security protection.  However, escalating threats\n   (e.g., zero-day vulnerabilities,
    DDoS attacks) expose limitations of\n   traditional security—relying on static
    ACLs, signature-based\n   detection, and manual configuration—causing delayed
    responses, high\n   false positives, and protection gaps.  This paper proposes
    AI Network\n   Security Agents: intelligent software components leveraging machine\n
    \  learning, behavioral analysis, and real-time data fusion, with three\n   core
    capabilities (adaptive learning, automation, distributed\n   collaboration) to
    shift security from passive to intelligent.  Four\n   key scenarios are outlined:
    dynamic defense against unknown threats\n   via baselines and tracing; ACL optimization
    via intent parsing;\n   configuration security via baseline checks and simulation;
    and\n   collaborative defense via intelligence aggregation and linked\n   responses.
    \ AI Agents turn routers into active security\n   orchestrators, enhancing threat
    protection and operational\n   efficiency.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   TRILL protocol provides layer 2 multicast data forwarding using IS-IS\n
    \  link state routing. Distribution trees are computed based on the link\n   state
    information through Shortest Path First calculation. When a\n   link on the distribution
    tree fails, a campus-wide recovergence of\n   this distribution tree will take
    place, which can be time consuming\n   and may cause considerable disruption to
    the ongoing multicast\n   service.\n\n   This document proposes to build the backup
    distribution tree to\n   protect links on the primary distribution tree. Since
    the backup\n   distribution tree is built up ahead of the link failure, when a
    link\n   on the primary distribution tree fails, the pre-installed backup\n   forwarding
    table will be utilized to deliver multicast packets\n   without waiting for the
    campus-wide recovergence, which minimizes the\n   service disruption.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A simple method of implementing Application Aware Networking using\n
    \  the Domain Name System (DNS) is discussed.  This enables DNS system\n   responses
    that are dependent on communication service quality\n   requirements without changes
    in the format of DNS protocol messages\n   or application program interfaces (APIs).
    \ Such responses can provide\n   lightweight support to application aware networking.\n\n\t "

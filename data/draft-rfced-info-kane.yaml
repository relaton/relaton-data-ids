  content: "The Virtual LAN Link State Protocol (VLSP) is part of the InterSwitch
    Message Protocol (ISMP).  ISMP was designed to facilitate interswitch communication
    within distributed determine and maintain a fully connected mesh topology graph
    of the switch fabric.  Each switch maintains an identical database describing
    the topology.  Call-originating switches use the topology database to determine
    the path over which to route a call connection.                                                                VLSP
    provides support for equal-cost multipath routing, and recalculates routes quickly
    in the face of topological changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic.\n\t "

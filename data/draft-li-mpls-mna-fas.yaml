  content: "   An IETF Network Slice service provides connectivity coupled with a\n
    \  set of network resource commitments and is expressed in terms of one\n   or
    more connectivity constructs.  A Slice-Flow Aggregate refers to\n   the set of
    traffic streams from one or more connectivity constructs\n   belonging to one
    or more IETF Network Slices that are mapped to a set\n   of network resources
    and provided the same forwarding treatment.  The\n   packets associated with a
    Slice-Flow Aggregate may carry a marking in\n   the packet's network layer header
    to identify this association and\n   this marking is referred to as Flow-Aggregate
    Selector (FAS).  The\n   FAS is used to map the packet to the associated set of
    network\n   resources and provide the corresponding forwarding treatment to the\n
    \  packet.\n\n   MPLS Network Actions (MNA) technologies are used to indicate
    actions\n   for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and/or MPLS packets and to transfer\n
    \  data needed for these actions.  This document discusses options for\n   using
    MPLS Network Actions (MNAs) to carry the FAS in MPLS packets.\n\n\n\t "

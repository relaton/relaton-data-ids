abstract:
- content: "<p>The WG MultiMob aims at defining a basic mobile multicast solution
    leveraging on network localized mobility management, i.e. Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.
    The solution would be basically based on multicast group management, i.e. IGMP/MLD,
    proxying at the access gateway. If such a basic solution is essential from an
    operational point of view, challenges with efficient resource utilization and
    user perceived service quality still persist. These issues may prevent large scale
    deployments of mobile multicast applications. This document attempts to identify
    topics for near future extension of work such as modifying multimob base solution,
    PMIPv6 and MLD/ IGMP for optimal multicast support, and adaptation of Handover
    optimization. Far future items such as extending to and modifying of MIPv4/v6
    and DSMIP, sender (source) mobility, consideration of multiple flows and multihoming
    will be dealt with in a future version.</p>"

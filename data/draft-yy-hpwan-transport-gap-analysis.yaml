  content: "   This document analyzes the throughput performance of existing\n   transport
    protocols under different implementation modes, including\n   kernel space based
    mode, user space based mode, and offloading-based\n   implementations, and concludes
    that existing technologies are either\n   limited by host CPU overhead or by the
    complexity of offloading, and\n   cannot guarantee high throughput approaching
    the bandwidth rate of\n   the network adapter.  Accordingly, this document proposes
    new\n   requirements for the design of HP-WAN transport protocol.\n\n\n\t "

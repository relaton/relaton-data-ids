  content: "This document is an alternative approach to defining the requirements\nfor
    a presence information protocol.  It may be usefully compared and\ncontrasted
    with ''Presence Information Protocol Requirements'' by Lisa\nDusseault, draft-dusseault-pipr-00.txt.
    \ Although worthy in many\nrespects, that document includes numerous desiderata,
    design\nconsiderations, and implementation concerns.  This document attempts\nto
    define only requirements, and a minimal set of requirements at\nthat. In addition,
    this document treats ''presence'' and ''instant\nmessaging'' as distinct entities
    for the purpose of defining\nrequirements. We leave open the possibility of a
    single protocol\nfulfilling both sets of requirements, without requiring it.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Each I2NSF agent and I2NSF client needs to provide application level\n
    \  support for management traffic during periods of DDoS and network\n   security
    attacks to deal with congestion (burst and/or continuous),\n   high error rates
    and packet loss due to the attacks, and the\n   inability to utilize a transport
    protocol (E.g.  TCP) due to a\n   specific protocol attack.  This application
    level support needs to be\n   able to select the key management system and provide
    \"chunking\" of\n   data (in order to fit in reduced effective MTUs), compression
    of data\n   (in order to fit into reduced bandwidth), small security envelope
    )in\n   order to maximize room for mangement payload), and fragmentation and\n
    \  reassembly at the application layer for those protocols which do not\n   support
    fragmentation/reassembly (E.g.  UDP or SMS).  The application\n   layer needs
    to be able to turn off this features if the system\n   detects these features
    are no longer needed.\n\n   This draft specifies a security session layer services(SSLs)
    which\n   provide these features in terms of an API, and the component features\n
    \  (interface to key management systems, data compression, chunking of\n   data,
    secure session envelope (SSE) to send data, and fragmentation\n   and reassembly,
    and ability to detect existence of attack).\n\n\t "

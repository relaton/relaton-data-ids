- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Existing HTTP authentication mechanisms are probeable in the sense\n
    \  that it is possible for an unauthenticated client to probe whether an\n   origin
    serves resources that require authentication.  It is possible\n   for an origin
    to hide the fact that it requires authentication by not\n   generating Unauthorized
    status codes, however that only works with\n   non-cryptographic authentication
    schemes: cryptographic schemes (such\n   as signatures or message authentication
    codes) require a fresh nonce\n   to be signed, and there is no existing way for
    the origin to share\n   such a nonce without exposing the fact that it serves
    resources that\n   require authentication.  This document proposes a new non-probeable\n
    \  cryptographic authentication scheme.\n\n\t "

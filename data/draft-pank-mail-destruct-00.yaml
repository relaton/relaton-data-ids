  content: "   As e-mail use is becoming more prevalent and the applications of  its\n
    \  use  more  diverse  it is increasingly becoming a burden to users and\n   system
    administration staff to maintain message stores and 'weed-out'\n   obsolete  messages.
    \  The  problem  also manifests itself as a direct\n   cost to organisations trying
    to maintain storage space  for  user  e-\n   mail  messages where a considerable
    proportion of messages are simply\n   forgotten and lay dormant.\n \n   RFC 822
    defines a message representation protocol specifying  details\n   about  US-ASCII
    \ message  headers.   As an extension to this protocol\n   this memo proposes
    the introduction of an additional header to enable\n   e-mail messages to 'self-destruct'
    after a specified period depending\n   on a number of  conditions  that  may  have
    \ been  specified  by  the\n   originator  or  can  subsequently be (re-)specified
    by the recipient.\n   This memo also proposes possible client  and  server  implementations\n
    \  with  a  view  of  soliciting  feedback  and  further refining of the\n   extensions.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes a framework for simple caller authorization.\nIt is
    a generalization of the RMX draft[1], which was designed to\nprotect against e-mail
    fraud and spam.  This new draft describes a\ngeneral mechanism suitable for other
    protocols used in the Internet\nor other networks. It is designed to be simple
    and to not make use\nof any kind of secret, and to establish  a cheap, robust,
    and\nlightweight authorization scheme.  It is intended to be used for\nlow security
    requirements.\n\n\t "

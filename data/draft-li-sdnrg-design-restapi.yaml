  content: "        As stated in ONF SDN Architecture WG Charter [Arc2013], in the
    SDN\n        architecture, the control and data planes are decoupled, network\n
    \       intelligence and state are logically centralized, and the underlying\n
    \       network infrastructure is abstracted from the applications. As a\n        result,
    network operators gain programmability, automation, and\n        network control,
    enabling them to build highly scalable, flexible\n        networks that readily
    adapt to changing business needs. In this\n        architecture, the Northbound
    API provides interfaces to the external\n        components where applicable.\n\n
    \       As REST architectural style has gained more popularity in\n        implementing
    loosely-coupled systems, RESTful services are becoming\n        the style of choice
    for SDN Northbound API and gaining increasingly\n        importance in SDN architecture,
    for example, the Floodlight\n        [Floodlight] has a Northbound API based on
    REST.\n\n        However, despite the recent advances made on RESTful web services,\n
    \       there is a lack of guidelines for designing RESTful networking\n        protocols
    and communication web services, especially based on the\n        Resource-Oriented
    Architecture (ROA) that further refines the REST\n        principles. Many networking
    protocols that claim to be REST APIs are\n        not hypertext driven as prescribed
    by REST. This situation can lead\n        to REST networking APIs that are not
    as scalable, extensible,\n        maintainable, and interoperable as promised
    by REST.\n\n        This document describes the key rules and design patterns
    for the\n        SDN Northbound API in a truly RESTful manner, based on our\n
    \       experiences with REST API designs in general and SDN Northbound API\n
    \       design in particular. The rules and the design patterns illustrate\n        the
    solutions to the common API problems in REST API designs, using\n        the network
    virtualization API of OpenStack as an example.\n\n\t "

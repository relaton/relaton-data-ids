  content: "   Today most TLD registries publish DNSSEC signed zones.  The sequence\n
    \  of steps from generating the unsigned zone, via DNSSEC signing and\n   various
    types of verification is referred to as the \"zone pipeline\".\n\n   The robustness
    and correctness of the zone pipeline is of crucial\n   importance and the zone
    pipeline is one of the most critical parts of\n   the operations of a TLD registry.\n\n
    \  After a serious incident in 2022, the .SE Registry decided to re-\n   evaluate
    the requirements on the zone pipeline.  This has led to\n   several new design
    choices and a decision to create a more robust\n   implementation from scratch.\n\n
    \  The goal of this document is to describe the requirements that the\n   .SE
    Registry choose in preparation for the implementation of the new\n   zone pipeline.
    \ The document also describes some of the design\n   consequences that follow
    from the requirements.  Hence this document\n   is intended to work as a guide
    for understanding the actual\n   implementation, which is planned to be released
    as open source.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in
    Github at:\n   https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline\n   (https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline).
    \ The\n   most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should\n
    \  all be available there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull\n   requests.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes the Constrained GeneRic Autonomic Signaling\n
    \  Protocol (cGRASP), a constrained and lightweight variant of the\n   GeneRic
    Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP, or the standard GRASP).\n   cGRASP reduces
    message overhead and replaces TCP with CoAP as the\n   transport protocol.  By
    leveraging CoAP's reliability features and\n   deployment maturity, cGRASP can
    provide reliable signaling services\n   without relying on TCP, making it suitable
    for IoT, where lightweight\n   and resource-constrained devices dominate.  Furthermore,
    this\n   document also discusses the potential approaches to adapting the\n   cGRASP
    to work on the network without IP connectivity.\n\n\t "

  content: "DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows an organization to claim responsibility
    for transmitting a message, in a way that can be validated by a recipient.  The
    organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary,
    or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple signatures, from the same
    or different organizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level
    digital signature authentication framework for email, using public key cryptography
    and using the domain name service as its key server technology.  This permits
    verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message
    content.  DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers
    to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email
    receivers to make additional assessments about messages.  DKIM's authentication
    of email identity can assist in the global control of \"spam\" and \"phishing\".
    \ This document provides implementation, deployment, operational, and migration
    considerations for DKIM.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "NFS version 4 is a distributed file system protocol which owes\nheritage
    to NFS versions 2 [RFC1094] and 3 [RFC1813].  Unlike earlier\nversions, NFS version
    4 supports traditional file access while\nintegrating support for file locking
    and the mount protocol.  In\naddition, support for strong security (and its negotiation),
    compound\noperations, and internationalization have been added.  Of course,\nattention
    has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an\nInternet environment\n\t "

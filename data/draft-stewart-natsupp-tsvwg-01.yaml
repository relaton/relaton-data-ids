abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable\ncommunications
    channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to\nTCP [RFC0793].  With the
    widespread deployment of Network Address\nTranslators (NAT), specialized code
    has been added to NAT for TCP\nthat allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT
    and yet use only a\nsingle globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind
    a\nNAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This\nadditional code
    is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port\nTranslation or NAPT.  To
    date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet\nbeen added to most NATs so that only
    pure NAT is available.  The end\nresult of this is that only one SCTP capable
    host can be behind a\nNAT.\n\nThis document describes an SCTP specific chunks
    and procedures to\nhelp NAT's provide similar features of NAPT in the single point
    and\nmulti-point traversal scenario.\n\t "

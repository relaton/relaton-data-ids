  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a mechanism to advertise IPv6 prefixes in BGP\n
    \  which are associated with Color Extended Communities to establish\n   end-to-end
    intent-aware paths for SRv6 services.  Such IPv6 prefixes\n   are called \"Colored
    Prefixes\", and this mechanism is called Colored\n   Prefix Routing (CPR).  In
    SRv6 networks, the Colored prefixes are the\n   SRv6 locators associated with
    different intent.  SRv6 services (e.g.\n   SRv6 VPN services) with specific intent
    could be assigned with SRv6\n   SIDs under the corresponding SRv6 locators, which
    are advertised as\n   Colored prefixes.  This allows the SRv6 service traffic
    to be steered\n   into end-to-end intent-aware paths simply based on the longest
    prefix\n   matching of SRv6 Service SIDs to the Colored prefixes.  In data\n   plane,
    dedicated transport label or SID for the inter-domain path is\n   not needed,
    thus the encapsulation efficiency could be optimized.\n   The existing IPv6 Address
    Family could be used for the advertisement\n   of IPv6 Colored prefixes, thus
    this mechanism is easy to interoperate\n   and can be deployed incrementally in
    multi-domain networks.\n\n\t "

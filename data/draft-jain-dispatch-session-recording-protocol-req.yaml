  content: "Session recording is a critical requirement in many business\ncommunications
    environments such as call centers and financial\ntrading floors.  In some of these
    environments, all calls must be\nrecorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.
    \ In others, calls may\nbe recorded for quality control or business analytics.
    \ Recording is\ntypically done by sending a copy of the media to the recording\ndevices.
    \ This document specifies requirements for a protocol that\nwill manage delivery
    of media from an end-point that originates media\nor that has access to it to
    a recording device.  This protocol is\nbeing referred to as Session Recording
    Protocol and will most likely\nbe based on SIP.\n\t "

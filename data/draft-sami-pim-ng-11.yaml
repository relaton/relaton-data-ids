  content: "   This document specifies protocol independent multicast- Next\n   generation
    or simply called PIM-NG. PIM-NG uses the underlying\n   unicast routing information,
    but unlike PIM-SM it doesn't necessarily\n   need to build unidirectional shared
    trees rooted at a Rendezvous\n   Point (RP) per group, due to the fact that the
    processes through\n   which a source registers with the Rendezvous Point and a
    host finds\n   the source of the multicast destination groups it needs are done
    in a\n   whole new way and hence, the source of multicast group (G) is\n   discovered
    faster. So at some points PIM-NG works faster than its\n   predecessor. Also the
    new Domain concept, unique to PIM-NG, along the\n   RPF check method used in PIM-NG
    specifications provides many features\n   along a robust and flexible control
    and administration over multicast\n   networks.\n\n\t "

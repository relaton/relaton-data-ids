  content: "This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification to RFC\n2598.
    The primary motivation for this draft is that the definition\nof EF PHB given
    in RFC 2598 does not match the intuition of the EF\nPHB, and has been determined
    to be unimplementable in a manner\ncompliant with the definition. In particular,
    no work-conserving\nscheduler, including all of the schedulers listed in the\nImplementation
    Examples section of RFC 2598, can comply with the\ndefinition given in that RFC.\nThis
    draft gives a rigorous definition of EF PHB which in our\nopinion preserves the
    spirit of the EF PHB as intended by RFC 2598\nwhile allowing a number of reasonable
    compliant implementations. The\ndocument also provides implementation guidance
    and lists several\npossible implementation examples which conform to the definition\ngiven
    in this draft.\n\t "

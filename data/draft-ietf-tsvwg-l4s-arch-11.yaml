  content: "   This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet\n
    \  applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable\n   throughput
    (L4S).  The insight on which L4S is based is that the root\n   cause of queuing
    delay is in the congestion controllers of senders,\n   not in the queue itself.
    \ The L4S architecture is intended to enable\n   _all_ Internet applications to
    transition away from congestion\n   control algorithms that cause queuing delay,
    to a new class of\n   congestion controls that induce very little queuing, aided
    by\n   explicit congestion signaling from the network.  This new class of\n   congestion
    control can provide low latency for capacity-seeking\n   flows, so applications
    can achieve both high bandwidth and low\n   latency.\n\n   The architecture primarily
    concerns incremental deployment.  It\n   defines mechanisms that allow the new
    class of L4S congestion\n   controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls
    in a shared\n   network.  These mechanisms aim to ensure that the latency and\n
    \  throughput performance using an L4S-compliant congestion controller\n   is
    usually much better (and never worse) than the performance would\n   have been
    using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing\n   flows continuing
    to use 'Classic' controllers are typically not\n   impacted by the presence of
    L4S.  These characteristics are important\n   to encourage adoption of L4S congestion
    control algorithms and L4S\n   compliant network elements.\n\n   The L4S architecture
    consists of three components: network support to\n   isolate L4S traffic from
    classic traffic; protocol features that\n   allow network elements to identify
    L4S traffic; and host support for\n   L4S congestion controls.\n\n\t "

  content: "Fast Payload Replication (FPR) is a technique for fanning out the\npayloads
    of individual packets to large numbers of recipients.  It\nwas developed as the
    central part of Ivip's real-time mapping\ndistribution system.  However, as of
    late February 2010, Ivip has a\nnew mapping system: Distributed Real Time Mapping
    (DRTM) which\noperates on different principles.  Therefore, the material in this
    ID\nis no longer an essential part of Ivip.  Some of it may be useful for\nother
    purposes and for two potential purposes in Ivip, both of which\nare entirely optional.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a mechanism for embedding a new path\n   attribute,
    known as the FC path attribute, into BGP UPDATE messages.\n   The FC (Forwarding
    Commitment) is a cryptographically signed object\n   to certify an AS's routing
    intent on its directly connected hops.  By\n   incorporating the FC path attribute
    into BGP UPDATE messages.  This\n   mechanism provides enhanced route authenticity
    and lays the\n   groundwork for improved data-plane forwarding verification.  This\n
    \  mechanism is backward compatible, which means a router that supports\n   the
    attribute can interoperate with a router that doesn't, allowing\n   partial deployment
    across the Internet.\n\n\t "

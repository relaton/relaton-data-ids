  content: "   This document describes a layering and peering model for network\n
    \  switches and end stations. It also discusses, using this model, the\n   compatibility
    of RBridges (Routing Bridges) with Layer 3 routers and\n   various types of bridges
    including Shortest Path Bridges. RBridges\n   are devices that implement the IETF
    TRILL (TRansparent\n   Interconnection of Lots of Links) standard.\n\n\n\t "

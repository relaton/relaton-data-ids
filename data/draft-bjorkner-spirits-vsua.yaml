  content: "This document discusses events occurring in a telephony network that \ncould
    be useful for call related services created in an Internet \nenvironment. It also
    shows one possible implementation of a SPIRITS \nprotocol based on Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) [2]. The SPIRITS \nworking group has not yet done any protocol
    decisions, so this draft \nis written for informative purpose showing that the
    introduction of \nvirtual SIP user agents (SIP UAs) in a SPIRITS client makes
    it \npossible to realize the services described in the pre-spirits \nimplementations
    document [3].\n\t "

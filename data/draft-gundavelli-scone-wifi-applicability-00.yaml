  content: "   This document describes the applicability of the Standard\n   Communication
    with Network Elements (SCONE) protocol to IEEE 802.11\n   based access networks.
    \ SCONE defines a mechanism by which an on-path\n   network element can provide
    advisory downlink throughput guidance to\n   QUIC endpoints.  The SCONE protocol
    is access agnostic and does not\n   assume any specific access technology.\n\n
    \  In IEEE 802.11 deployments, such constraints may be derived at access\n   points
    or controllers that combine policy awareness, with visibility\n   into access
    network conditions.  This document explains how existing\n   SCONE roles and throughput
    advice semantics apply in these\n   deployments without assuming any specific
    IEEE 802.11 MAC or PHY\n   behavior.\n\n   This document does not define new protocol
    extensions and does not\n   modify SCONE behavior.  Its purpose is to clarify
    deployment\n   considerations for IEEE 802.11 environments.\n\n\t "

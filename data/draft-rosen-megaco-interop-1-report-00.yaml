  content: "An interoperability test of the Megaco (RFC2885/6) protocol was held \non
    August 28-31 in Durham, NH.  An excellent turnout of many \ndifferent independently
    developed implementations were present, and \na great many of the tests were quite
    successful, including media \nflow in many cases, and several cases of testing
    a Media Gateway \ncontroller from one organization with two Media Gateways from
    \ndifferent organizations.   \nThe primary purpose of the event was to assess
    the ability of \nindependent development teams to create interoperable devices
    from \nthe recent Proposed Standard RFCs 2885 [1] and 2886 [2].  While \nseveral
    discrepancies were found that resulted from differing \ninterpretations of the
    documents, the level of compatibility \nexhibited at this first test was excellent.
    \ A secondary purpose of \nthe event was to begin the process of moving the RFCs
    to draft \nstandard status, which requires documentation of at least two \nimplementations
    of each protocol element/feature.  While this first \nevent only used a subset
    of the protocol, quite a few of the \nelements and features were demonstrated
    by all implementations. \n  \n   This I-D describes the event and summarized the
    results.   \n\n\t "

  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) introduces new challenges for pinning candidate\n
    \  paths on their intended paths (the path the PCE computed based on\n   provided
    intent and may have made bandwidth reservations on).  The\n   actual path through
    a network can change or no longer meet the\n   required constraints if a SID list
    of an SR Policy candidate path is\n   not fully expressed as a list of adjacency
    SIDs or when a change in\n   the topology does happen.  The introduction of the
    new candidate path\n   eligibility concept permits a path to be signaled and established
    as\n   operationally up, but controls whether the path is eligible to carry\n
    \  traffic, thus influencing its active state.\n   The eligibility concept allows
    a system (operator, pce, headend,\n   etc.) to set eligibility as false when path
    deviations may have\n   occurred, or path constraints are no longer met for one
    or more SID\n   lists of a candidate path and clear it when candidate path deviations\n
    \  are removed or constraints are met again.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "In the Kerberos protocol [RFC1510], cryptographic keys are used in a number
    of places.  In order to minimize the effect of compromising a key, it is desirable
    to use a different key for each of these places. Key derivation [Horowitz96] can
    be used to construct different keys for each operation from the keys transported
    on the network.  For this to be possible, a small change to the specification
    is necessary.\n\t "

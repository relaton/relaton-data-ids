  content: "   Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of\n   processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.  Due to these
    constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily applicable.  Nevertheless,
    an authentication and\n   authorization solution is needed to ensure the security
    of these\n   devices.\n\n   During the lifecycle of a constrained device, responsibility
    for\n   managing authorization policies for the constrained device may change\n
    \  several times.  To ensure the security of the constrained devices,\n   the
    authorization to authorize must be transferred to the new\n   principal in a secure
    way.\n\n   Resource-constrained nodes benefit from delegating defined\n   authentication-
    and authorization-related tasks to less-constrained\n   devices called Authorization
    Managers, thus limiting the hardware\n   requirements of the security solution
    for the constrained devices.\n\n   This document defines how security relationships
    between constrained\n   nodes and their Authorization Managers can be established
    and managed\n   in a RESTful way, thus providing for a flexible authorization\n
    \  solution for the whole lifecycle of a constrained node.\n\n\t "

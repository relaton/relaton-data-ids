  content: "   This document defines an optional extension block, called a\n   Retransmission
    Block, that may be used with the Bundle Protocol [2]\n   within the context of
    a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [4].  The\n   Retransmission Block (RB)
    is designed to be inserted by a custodian\n   when re-forwarding a bundle, so
    as to mark the bundle as a legitimate\n   custody-based retransmission rather
    than an unauthorized bundle\n   duplicate.  By providing a way for nodes that
    receive the re-\n   forwarded bundle to distinguish it from an unauthorized duplicate,\n
    \  the RB enables those nodes whose local security policies do not\n   permit
    them to forward replayed bundles to detect and delete\n   unauthorized bundle
    replays but forward authorized custody-based\n   bundle retransmissions.  This
    document defines the format and\n   processing of this new Retransmission Block.\n\t "

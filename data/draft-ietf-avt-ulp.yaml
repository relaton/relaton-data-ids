  content: "This document specifies a payload format for generic Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is based on the exclusive-or (parity)
    operation.  The payload format described in this document allows end systems to
    apply protection using various protection lengths and levels, in addition to using
    various protection group sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics.
    \ It enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of
    the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.  This
    scheme is completely compatible with non-FEC-capable hosts, so the receivers in
    a multicast group that do not implement FEC can still work by simply ignoring
    the protection data.  This specification obsoletes RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  The
    FEC specified in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 2733 and RFC
    3009. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

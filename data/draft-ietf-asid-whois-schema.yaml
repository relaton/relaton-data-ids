  content: "WHOIS++ is a simple Internet search and retrieval protocol, specified
    in [1], which allows clients and servers to exchange structured data objects known
    as templates.  In the interests of interoperability it is desirable to have a
    common base schema for these templates.  This document suggests a schema drawn
    from implementation and deployment experience to date with WHOIS++.\n\n\t "

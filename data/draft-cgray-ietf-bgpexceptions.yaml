  content: "   There is not currently any standardized method of dealing with\n   distributed
    or other large scale threats other than individual\n   firewall and/or null routing
    instructions.  This Internet Draft\n   describes an optional BGP Capability (as
    defined by RFC 5492) that\n   allowed Autonomous Systems to self-censor utilizing
    the existing\n   Inter-Domain Routing system.  This capability does not add any\n
    \  automatic actions and must be explicitly activated by an\n   administrator.\n\n\t "

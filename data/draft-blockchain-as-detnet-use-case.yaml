  content: "   This draft brings blockchain into the detnet use case list.\n   Generally
    speaking, blockchain is both a technical term and a\n   blockchain-based industry,
    which is spreading into a wide range of\n   industries other than the thriving
    bitcoin.  Blockchain would have to\n   require the supporting network offer deterministic
    networking service\n   rather than the ongoing best-effort, because of its inherent
    p2p and\n   frequent multicast working mechanism.\n\n   Blockchain working process,
    its current network mechanism and\n   challenges ahead, as well as requirements
    to detnet will be\n   illustrated in the draft.\n\n\t "

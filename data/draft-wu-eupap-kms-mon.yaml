  content: "   In view of the characteristics of multi-domain optical networks under\n
    \  hierarchical PCE architecture and its key management needs, a novel\n   key
    management scheme (KMS-KI) based on key hypergraph and in this\n   paper identity-based
    cryptography was proposed. The key relationship\n   of multi-domain optical networks
    was firstly modeled into key\n   hypergraph with two layers, namely the vertices
    was represented by\n   points and the key relation at all levels was described
    with\n   hyperedge. And the master keys, the public keys and private keys, the\n
    \  session keys, the layer group keys and the inter-domain keys were\n   generated
    respectively and were dynamic managed by using hierarchical\n   identity-based
    cryptography and improved private key generation\n   strategies. When the group
    members join or leave, the remaining group\n   members autonomously used the key
    value of the pPCE or cPCE to\n   calculate and update the group key. So the risk
    that the new group\n   key was uncovered by adversary was greatly reduced. KMS-KI
    scheme\n   possessed the security performance of forward and backward,\n   confidentiality
    of private keys and the ability of resisting\n   collusive attack. Meanwhile,
    it not only supported the using of\n   hierarchical identity-based cryptography,
    but also had performed\n   comprehensively well in terms of numbers of the key
    storage, numbers\n   of cPCE communication, encryption and decryption times.\n\n\t "

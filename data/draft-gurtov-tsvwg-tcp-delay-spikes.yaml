  content: "We suggest a more conservative management of TCP's retransmit timer\n\nand
    a more careful response of the TCP sender on duplicate ACKs. The\n\nformer reduces
    the risk of triggering spurious timeouts, while the\n\nlatter eliminates potentially
    unnecessary retransmits. Although, we\n\nbelieve that these suggestions are permitted
    (although not\n\nexplicitly) by RFC2581 and RFC2988, they do not seem to be widely\n\nknown
    nor deployed in existing TCP implementations. We therefore want\n\nto make implementers
    aware of these choices.\n\t "

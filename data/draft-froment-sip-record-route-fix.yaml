abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "A typical function of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy is to\n
    \  set a Record-Route header on initial requests in order to make\n   subsequent
    requests pass through it.  This header contains a SIP\n   Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) indicating where and how the\n   subsequent requests should be sent to reach
    the proxy.  Like any SIP\n   URI, it can contain sip or sips schemes, IPV4 or
    IPV6 addresses, and\n   URI parameters that could influence the routing like different\n
    \  transport parameters (UDP, TCP, SCTP...), or a compression indication\n   like
    \"comp=sigcomp\".  When a proxy has to change some of those\n   parameters between
    its incoming and outgoing interfaces (multi-homed\n   proxies, transport switching,
    sip to sips or IPV4 to IPV6\n   scenarios...), the question arises on what should
    be put in Record-\n   Route: it is just not possible to make one header having
    the\n   characteristics of both sides at the same time.  This document aims\n
    \  to clarify these scenarios and fix bugs already identified on this\n   topic;
    it formally suggests the use of the double Record-Route\n   technique as a replacement
    to the current RFC3261 text, which only\n   describes Record-Route rewriting solution.\n\t "

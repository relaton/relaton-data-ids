  content: "   This document questions the applicability of a multicast semantic for\n
    \  the distributed consensus problem.  For this, it details the\n   consensus
    problem and the solutions taken in current systems.  It\n   outlines how point-to-multipoint
    communication arises as part of the\n   consensus solution.  Then, it details
    a peer-centric realization of a\n   permissionless approach, identifying key issues.
    \ These issues\n   include communication costs, performance delays, and lack of\n
    \  finality.  Hence, it discusses a multicast strawman and its expected\n   improvements.\n\n\t "

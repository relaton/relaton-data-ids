  content: "   The use of directory services based on the Lightweight Directory\n
    \  Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP] is becoming increasingly popular for\n   distributed
    and web-based services. Since most LDAP-based\n   applications have developed
    their schemas independently, new\n   application designers find themselves faced
    with the dilemma of how\n   to interoperate with an already conflicting set of
    existing LDAP\n   specifications. Today's Web-aware customers expect interoperability,\n
    \  so it is crucial to converge existing schema in a way that supports\n   interoperability
    across arbitrary applications and vendors. In this\n   spirit, we describe an
    LDAP schema for internet mail routing and\n   delivery that is designed to be
    modular and to support a common core\n   for sharing user state across an arbitrary
    set of applications.\n\n\t "

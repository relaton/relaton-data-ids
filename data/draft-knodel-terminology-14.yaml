- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There has been extensive discussion in and around the IETF community\n
    \  about the use of technical terminology, which could be interprereted\n   as
    exclusionary.  The document below is published as an artefact of\n   the discussion
    because it sparked many debates and inspired several\n   actions in the IETF community.
    \ This, however, does not say anything\n   about whether the opinions it holds
    are correct or incorrect.  Since\n   the debate about technology, language, and
    its implications will\n   probably never be finished, we offer this document for
    reference in\n   future discussions about the topic.\n\n   It is important to
    note that this is not standard, it does not\n   represent IETF consensus, and
    should not be misconstrued as anything\n   other than the authors’ views.\n\n\t "

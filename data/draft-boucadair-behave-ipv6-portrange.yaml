  content: "This memo presents a solution to solve IPv4 address shortage and ease\nIPv4-IPv6
    interconnection.  The document presents a set of\nincremental steps for the deployment
    of IPv6 as a means to solve IPv4\naddress exhaustion.  Stateless IPv4/IPv6 address
    mapping functions\nare introduced and IPv4-IPv6 interconnection scenarios presented.\nThis
    memo advocates for a more proactive approach for the deployment\nof IPv6 into
    operational networks.\n\nThis memo specifies the IPv6 variant of the A+P. Both
    encapsulation\nand translation scheme are covered.  Moreover, two modes are\nelaborated:
    the binding mode (compatible mode with DS-lite) and the\nstateless mode.\n\t "

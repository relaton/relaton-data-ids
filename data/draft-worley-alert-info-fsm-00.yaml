  script: Latn
  content: "   The \"alert\" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can be used
    in\n   the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   requests
    and responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the\n   characteristics
    of the call that the user agent has originated or\n   terminated.  Based on the
    URNs in the Alert-Info header field, the\n   user agent must select an the best
    available signal to present to its\n   user to indicate the characteristics of
    the call.  This document\n   describes a method of constructing a finite state
    machine (FSM) to do\n   this selection.  In many situations, the resulting FSM
    is simpler and\n   faster than previously described selection algorithms.  The
    designer\n   must construct the FSM so that its behavior will satisfy the\n   requirements
    given in the definition of the \"alert\" URN namespace.\n\n\t "

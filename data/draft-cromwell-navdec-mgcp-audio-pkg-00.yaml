  content: "   The MGCP protocol describes a protocol for controlling a VOIP (Voice\n
    \  Over IP) gateway from an external call agent.  The protocol defines a\n   number
    of event packages, each of which defines a group of events\n   supporting a particular
    type of gateway functionality.  For example,\n   there is a package for MF trunks,
    one for DTMF, and one for RTP.  A\n   gateway may support one or more packages
    depending on the functional-\n   ity it provides. A Residential Gateway might
    support the Generic\n   Media, DTMF, Line, and RTP packages while an MF Trunk
    Gateway could\n   support the Generic Media, MF, DTMF, MF Trunk, and RTP packages.\n
    \n   This document proposes a set of IVR-related events that constitute an\n   MGCP
    Announcement Package for use by an Announcement Server Gateway.\n   This event
    package provides support for the standard IVR operations\n   of Play Announcement,
    Play Collect, and Play Record.  It supports\n   direct references to simple audio
    as well as indirect references to\n   simple and complex audio. It also provides
    multi-language audio vari-\n   ables, control of audio interruptibility, digit
    buffer control, spe-\n   cial key sequences, and support for reprompting during
    data collec-\n   tion.\n\n\t "

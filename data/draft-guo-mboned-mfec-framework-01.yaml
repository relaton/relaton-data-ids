  content: "  At present, the multimedia services such as IPTV are gaining \n  importance.
    Multicast technologies play an inevitable role in these \n  multimedia services.
    \ \n   \n  The main factors affecting the multicast technologies are the \n  convergence
    speed and the capacity of the multicast routing table. \n   \n  One of the easiest
    and the most commonly practiced methods in \n  nowadays multicast deployment is
    to push the data to the end router \n  by static configurations (igmp static group).
    This will reduce the \n  delay in channel switching. The data flow of multiple
    channels from \n  one or several servers are transmitted along the distribution
    tree. \n  The distribution tree for multiple channels may be composed of only
    \n  one same distribution tree. A router, however, maintains separate \n  protocol-status
    and provides separate protocol-packets content for \n  each channel. This prolongs
    the route convergence, increases the \n  status-space and reduces the exchange
    rate of protocol-packets.  \n   \n  This document proposes a solution to speed
    up the route convergence, \n  reduce the states in the multicast forwarding table
    and increase the \n  exchange rate of packets. This can be achieved by using the
    same \n  state for the data flows that passes the same path in the \n  distribution
    tree. This same state is called Multicast Forwarding \n  Equivalent Class (MFEC).
    In other words, MFEC is a group of multicast \n  packets that are forwarded over
    the same path with the same traffic \n  handling treatment. This solution extends
    various multicast protocols \n  such as PIM- SSM, PIM-SM, Bidir-PIM, PIM-DM and
    DVMRP, and perfects \n  application of multicast. \n\n\t "

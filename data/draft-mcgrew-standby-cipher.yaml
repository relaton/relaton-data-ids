  content: "   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is extensively used and is\n
    \  widely believed to provide security that is more than adequate.\n   Several
    other cipher designs have been proposed for use in standards,\n   and new designs
    continue to be developed, while consideration of cost\n   and complexity impels
    that the number of mandatory-to-implement\n   ciphers be minimized.  This note
    outlines an approach to the\n   selection of cryptographic algorithms that best
    serves the needs of\n   the users of cryptography: AES should continue in its
    role as the\n   mandatory-to-implement cipher, while other cipher designs should
    be\n   reviewed with the goal of selecting a single standby cipher.  If\n   future
    advances in the science of cryptanalysis uncover security\n   issues with the
    AES, the standby cipher will be ready for adoption as\n   its replacement.\n\n\t "

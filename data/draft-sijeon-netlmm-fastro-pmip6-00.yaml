  script: Latn
  content: "To solve the inefficient route problem of PMIPv6, a variety of\nmechanisms
    were proposed. The mechanism was also proposed to support\nPMIPv6 RO handover
    according mobile node's movements. Efficient\nPMIPv6 RO handover SHOULD be considered
    to reduce handover latency\nand to support communication with route optimization
    disabled mobile\nnode's remote node. In this draft, we proposed a mechanism that
    can\nsolve handover latency in PMIPv6 RO handover. And we introduce a few\nof
    messages to apply proposed mechanism.\n\t "

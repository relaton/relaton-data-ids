  content: "   There is a need to simplify network operations for multicast\n   services.
    \ Current solutions require a tree-building control plane to\n   build and maintain
    end-to-end tree state per flow, impacting router\n   state capacity and network
    convergence times.  Multi-point tree\n   building protocols are often considered
    complex to deploy and debug\n   and may include mechanics from legacy use-cases
    and/or assumptions\n   which no longer apply to the current use-cases.  When multicast\n
    \  services are transiting a provider network through an overlay, the\n   core
    network has a choice to either aggregate customer state into a\n   minimum set
    of core states resulting in flooding traffic to unwanted\n   network end-points,
    or to map per-customer, per-flow tree state\n   directly into the provider core
    state amplifying the network-wide\n   state problem.\n\n\t "

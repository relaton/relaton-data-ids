  content: "This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform\nthe
    network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in\nthe same flow.
    \ Today, the network may signal congestion to the\nreceiver by ECN markings or
    by dropping packets, and the receiver may\npass this information back to the sender
    in transport-layer feedback.\nThe mechanism to be developed by the ConEx WG will
    enable the sender\nto also relay this congestion information back into the network
    in-\nband at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion is\nvisible
    to all IP devices along the path, from where it could, for\nexample, be provided
    as input to traffic management.\n\t "

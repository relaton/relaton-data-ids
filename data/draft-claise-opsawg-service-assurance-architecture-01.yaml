  content: "   This document describes the architecture for Service Assurance for\n
    \  Intent-based Networking (SAIN).  This architecture aims at assuring\n   that
    service instances are correctly running.  As services rely on\n   multiple sub-services
    by the underlying network devices, getting the\n   assurance of a healthy service
    is only possible with a holistic view\n   of network devices.  This architecture
    not only helps to correlate\n   the service degradation with the network root
    cause but also the\n   impacted services when a network component fails or degrades.\n\n\t "

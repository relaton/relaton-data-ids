abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON (RFC7159) is a text-based data format which is popular for Web
    based data exchanges. CBOR (RFC7049) is a binary data format which has been optimized
    for data exchanges for the Internet of Things. For many IoT scenarios, CBOR formats
    will be preferred since it can decrease transmission payload sizes compared to
    other data formats. This specification defines an approach for translating JSON
    objects, which are relevant for the CoRE WG and its related specifications, into
    CBOR format. Where applicable, mapping from other formats into JSON or CBOR is
    also described.</p>"

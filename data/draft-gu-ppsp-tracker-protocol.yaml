  content: "   This document specifies the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol--Tracker\n
    \  Protocol (PPSP-TP), an application-layer control (signaling) protocol\n   for
    the exchange of meta information between trackers and peers, such\n   as initial
    offer/request of participation in multimedia content\n   streaming, content information,
    peer lists and reports of activity\n   and status.  The specification outlines
    the architecture of the\n   protocol and its functionality, and describes message
    flows, message\n   processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax and\n
    \  semantics.  The PPSP Tracker Protocol enables cooperating peers to\n   form
    content streaming overlay networks to support near real-time\n   Structured Media
    content (audio, video, associated text/metadata)\n   delivery, such as adaptive
    multi-rate, layered (scalable) and multi-\n   view (3D), in live, time-shifted
    and on-demand modes.\n\n\t "

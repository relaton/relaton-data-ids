  content: "   This draft summarizes the results in some experiments looking at the\n
    \  impact of proposed changes to ICE based on the latest consumer NATs.\n   It
    looks and the amount of non congestion controlled bandwidth a\n   browser can
    use and the impacts of that on ICE timing.\n\n   This draft is not meant to become
    an RFC.  It is purely information\n   to help guide development of other specifications.\n\n\t "

    naming layer, is not able to serve today's Internet users\nnaming needs anymore.
    Attempts to change the DNS to adapt to those\nneeds, such as the IDN (Internationalized
    Domain Name) IETF effort,\nare not only proving themselves unsatisfactory in many
    ways, they are\nalso limited by the nature of DNS itself.\n\t "

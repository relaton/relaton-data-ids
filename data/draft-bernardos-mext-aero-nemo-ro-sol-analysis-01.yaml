  content: "The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam\nand
    attach to different access networks without disrupting the\nongoing sessions that
    nodes of the mobile network may have.  By\nextending the Mobile IPv6 support to
    Mobile Routers, nodes of the\nmobile network are not required to support any kind
    of mobility,\nsince packets go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-\ndirectional
    tunnel.  Data packets belonging to communications of\nnodes of the mobile network
    have to traverse the Home Agent, and\ntherefore resulting paths are likely to
    be suboptimal.  Additionally,\nthe solution adds packet overhead, due to the use
    of encapsulation\nbetween the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.\nThere are currently
    a set of well defined NEMO Route Optimization\nrequirements for Operational Use
    in Aeronautics and Space\nExploration, which potential solutions should meet.
    \ This document\nanalyses how the problem of NEMO RO for Aeronautics Mobile Networks\nmight
    be tackled, in a way as generic as possible, trying to identify\nthose open questions
    and deployment considerations that need to be\naddressed.\n\nThe main goal of
    this document is to foster the discussion about\naeronautics NEMO RO solution
    space within the MEXT WG.\n\t "

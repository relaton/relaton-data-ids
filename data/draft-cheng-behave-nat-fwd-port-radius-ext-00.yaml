  content: "This memo proposes two new RADIUS attributes with each to carry\nan Internal
    Port number and a Configured External Port number,\nboth are associated with a
    specific NAT device and a specific user,\nand are configured on a RADIUS server
    such that when the user\nrequests an Internet connection, the port mapping information
    can\nbe conveyed to NAS that co-locates with the NAT device via RADIUS\nprotocol,
    and is used during the NAT operation for IP flows to and\nfrom that user. The
    two attributes also include an IPv4 address or\nIPv6 address, respectively, as
    the pinhole internal IP address at\nthe NAT device.\n\t "

  content: "   The management of hosts and risks is important for enterprises that\n
    \  have large scale IP space.  For IPv4, it won't take too long even to\n   scan
    the entire Internet address space.  For IPv6, further\n   consideration is needed.
    \ A narrow range of IPv6 address is preferred\n   for scanning.  And in order
    to shorten the time for IPv6 scanning, a\n   very specific IPv6 address list is
    highly needed.\n\n   This document proposes a solution to solve the problem.  At
    first,\n   append the information of the collection point address to the Router\n
    \  Advertisement packet sent by the router, and announce this address\n   information
    to all nodes in the subnet.  Then, each host node report\n   its own IPv6 address
    information to the designated collection point\n   by using Echo Reply message.
    \ After that, the corresponding\n   collection point device should save these
    information.  In this way,\n   online IPv6 address information in the current
    network can be quickly\n   collected on the collection point device.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   RFC 7854, BGP Monitoring Protocol, uses different message types for\n
    \  different purposes.  Most of these are Type, Length, Value (TLV)\n   structured.
    \ One message type, the Peer Up message, lacks a set of\n   TLVs defined for its
    use, instead sharing a namespace with the\n   Initiation message.  Subsequent
    experience has shown that this\n   namespace sharing was a mistake, as it hampers
    the extension of the\n   protocol.\n\n   This document updates RFC 7854 by creating
    an independent namespace\n   for the Peer Up message.  It also updates RFC 8671
    and RFC 9069 by\n   moving the defined codepoints in the newly introduced registry.\n
    \  Compliant implementations of RFC 7854, RFC 8671 and RFC 9069 also\n   comply
    with this specification.\n\n\t "

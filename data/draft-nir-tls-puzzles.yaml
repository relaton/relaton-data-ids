  content: "   This document proposes a mechanism for mitigating denial of service\n
    \  (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on TLS\n   servers.
    \ Attackers are limited in their ability to cause resource\n   waste on the server
    by requiring proof of work by the client before\n   these CPU resources are expended.\n\n\t "

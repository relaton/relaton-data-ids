abstract:
- content: "<p>Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) is a reliability mechanism that is
    distinct and separate from the retransmission logic in reliable transfer protocols
    such as TCP. FEC coding can help deal with losses at the end of transfers or with
    networks having non-congestion losses. However, FEC coding mechanisms should not
    hide congestion signals. This memo offers a discussion of how FEC coding and congestion
    control can coexist. Another objective is to encourage the research community
    to also consider congestion control aspects when proposing and comparing FEC coding
    solutions in communication systems. This document is the product of the Coding
    for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG). The scope of the
    document is end-to-end communications: FEC coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope
    of the document.</p>"

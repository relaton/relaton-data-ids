  content: "This document describes a new transport protocol for DNS.\nIP fragmentation
    is avoided, blind spoofing, amplification attacks\nand other denial of service
    attacks are prevented. Latency for a \ntypical DNS query is a single round trip,
    after a setup handshake.\nNo per-client server state is required between transactions.\nPackets
    may optionally be encrypted and authenticated.\nThe protocol may have other applications.\n\t "

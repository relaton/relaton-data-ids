  content: "   [RFC8280] has identified and documented important principles, such
    as\n   Data Minimization, End-to-End, and Interoperability in order to\n   enable
    access to fundamental Human Rights.  While (partial)\n   implementations of these
    concepts are already available, many current\n   applications lack Privacy support
    that the average user can easily\n   navigate.  This document covers analysis
    of threats to privacy and\n   security and derives requirements from this threat
    analysis.\n\n\t "

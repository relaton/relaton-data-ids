  content: "Today, satellites are becoming major vectors of the information\ndiffusion
    on the Internet. Their use can prove to be fully useful for\nthe cache pre-filling
    because they allow big volumes of data to be\ntransferred at high speed (up to
    45 Mb/s) and to be distributed\nsimultaneously on several reception dishes. When
    having this pre-\nfilling information on the cache, users can benefit from better
    access\ntime to the stored pages.\nIn this context, the satellite allows the quality
    of service for the\nend user to be improved by optimizing satellite links and
    by\ntransferring large volumes of data directly only when the traffic on\nthe
    network is low.\n\t "

  content: "   This document updates the Proportional Rate Reduction (PRR) algorithm\n
    \  described as experimental in RFC 6937 to standards track.  PRR\n   potentially
    replaces the Fast Recovery and Rate-Halving algorithms.\n   All of these algorithms
    regulate the amount of data sent by TCP or\n   other transport protocol during
    loss recovery.  PRR more accurately\n   regulates the actual flight size through
    recovery such that at the\n   end of recovery it will be as close as possible
    to the ssthresh, as\n   determined by the congestion control algorithm.\n\n\t "

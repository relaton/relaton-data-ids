  content: "iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family \nof application
    protocols onto TCP/IP.  The Datamover \nArchitecture for iSCSI (DA) defines an
    abstract model in \nwhich the movement of data between iSCSI end nodes is \nlogically
    separated from the rest of the iSCSI protocol in \norder to allow iSCSI to adapt
    to innovations available in new \nIP transports.  The new Datamover protocol provides
    a \nreliable transport for all iSCSI PDUs, but actually moves the \ndata required
    for certain iSCSI PDUs without involving the \nremote iSCSI layer itself.  This
    document begins with an \nintroduction of a few new abstractions, defines a layered
    \narchitecture for iSCSI and Datamover protocols, and then \nmodels the interactions
    within an iSCSI end node between the \niSCSI layer and the Datamover layer that
    happen in order to \ntransparently perform remote data movement within an IP \nfabric.
    \ It is intended that this definition would help map \niSCSI to generic RDMA-capable
    IP fabrics in the future \ncomprising TCP, SCTP, and possibly other underlying
    network \ntransport layers.\n\t "

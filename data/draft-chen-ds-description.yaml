  content: "The rapid development of Internet has driven more and more\nenterprises
    or individuals encapsulate operations on key data\nentities we call data service
    (DS). Due to the different fields\nbetween enterprise or individual, resulting
    in the description of\ndata services appear semantic heterogeneity. In this paper,
    we\npropose a more principled approach to the problems of heterogeneous\ndata
    service on the Web. We start with a data service description\ndocument pre-processing.
    Finally, we propose a unified description\nlanguage model for data service, the
    Unified Description Language\nfor Data Service (UDL4DS).\n\n\t "

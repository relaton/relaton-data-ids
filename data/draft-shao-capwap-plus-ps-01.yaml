  content: "   In recent widescale deployments of large public Wi-Fi networks, and\n
    \  in their integration with cellular networks EAP based authentication\n   has
    been considered as a good candidate to making Wi-Fi user\n   experience seamless
    similar to what it has been for cellular users.\n   A few new functions which
    could enhance CAPWAP protocol have been\n   identified in such deployments that
    can help improve the large scale\n   carrier grade Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\t "

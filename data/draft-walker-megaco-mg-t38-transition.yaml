  content: "This document describes MEGACO/H.248 [6,2] call-setup set up \nprocedures
    that enable T.38 [4] capable media gateways to transition \nbetween a Voice over
    IP (VoIP) call and a Facsimile over IP (FoIP) \n(using ITU-T Rec. T.38) call either:
    \na)   with the real-time intervention of a Media Gateway \nController (MGC) using
    one of the existing mechanisms in \nRec. T.38 Annex B/H.323, Rec. T.38 Annex D/SIP-SDP
    and Rec. \nT.38 Annex E/H.248, and Rec. H.323 Annex D. \nb)   without the real-time
    intervention of a Media Gateway \nController (MGC). The only involvement of the
    MGC will be \nduring initial connection capabilities negotiation between \nthe
    media gateways.  At this stage, both the MGs and the \nMGCs are unaware of the
    type of connection, (i.e. Voice, \nFax, Modem, etc.).   \nThis contribution also
    describes how these call set-up procedures can \nbe used in conjunction with the
    existing procedures of ITU-T Rec. \nH.323 Annex D to set-up two parallel channels,
    one for voice and the \nother for T.38, without any modifications of the procedures.

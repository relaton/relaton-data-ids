  content: "   For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called lag,\n   latency,
    or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but\n   common, symptom
    in today's networks.  Even after a decade of work on\n   standardizing technical
    solutions, it remains a common problem for\n   the end users.\n\n   Everyone \"knows\"
    that it is \"normal\" for a video conference to have\n   problems when somebody
    else at home is watching a 4K movie or\n   uploading photos from their phone.
    \ However, there is no technical\n   reason for this to be the case.  In fact,
    various queue management\n   solutions have solved the problem.\n\n   Our network
    connections continue to suffer from an unacceptable\n   amount of delay, not for
    a lack of technical solutions, but rather a\n   lack of awareness of the problem
    and deployment of its solutions.  We\n   believe that creating a tool that measures
    the problem and matches\n   people's everyday experience will create the necessary
    awareness, and\n   result in a demand for solutions.\n\n   This document specifies
    the \"Responsiveness Test\" for measuring\n   responsiveness.  It uses common
    protocols and mechanisms to measure\n   user experience specifically when the
    network is under working\n   conditions.  The measurement is expressed as \"Round-trips
    Per Minute\"\n   (RPM) and should be included with goodput (up and down) and idle\n
    \  latency as critical indicators of network quality.\n\n\t "

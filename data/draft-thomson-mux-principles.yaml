- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The existence of protocols that rely on multiplexing of different\n
    \  protocols could be used to justify the imposition of constraints on\n   the
    operation of other protocols.  The existence of a multiplexed\n   protocol does
    not inherently justify constraints on protocols that\n   participate or might
    participate in the protocol.\n\n\t "

  content: "The advent of IPv6 in addition to IPv4 makes hosts and servers dual-\nstack.
    SIP communications can be used in both environments but there \nis little understanding
    what will happen if some nodes are dual-stack \nwhile others, presently the majority,
    is IPv4 only enabled. This \ndocument describes some scenarios and associated
    issues when dual-\nstack users and servers try to communicate with IPv4 only hosts
    using \nSIP. It is not evident that interoperability is achieved, and if that
    \nis not the case, this would severely limit the usability of both SIP \nand IPv6.

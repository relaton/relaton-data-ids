  content: "    The document describes a SingleSignON solution to WWW seen as one
    Giant\n    computer. As WWW use increases, on average an user has many service
    login\n    accounts they have to manage. It would be better for most users at
    the\n    expense of some security risk to have one password for all the services
    and\n    a WWW shell and a control panel. Also the WWW as an intelligent being
    could\n    show information to an user interpreting their needs from all their
    accounts.\n    A smartcard could have a phone SIM slot and phone devices and computers
    can\n    have smartcard slots and email user should be able to allow login only
    by insertion\n    of smartcards.A smart card can be programmed with user details
    and a session\n    manager software can be used to allow the user to login / create
    and use many services.\n\n\t "

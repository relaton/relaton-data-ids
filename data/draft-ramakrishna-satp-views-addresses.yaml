  script: Latn
  content: "   With increasing use of DLT (distributed ledger technology) systems,\n
    \  including blockchain systems and networks, for virtual assets, there\n   is
    a need for asset-related data and metadata to traverse system\n   boundaries and
    link their respective business workflows.  Core\n   requirements for such interoperation
    between systems are the\n   abilities of these systems to project views of their
    assets to\n   external parties, either individual agents or other systems, and
    the\n   abilities of those external parties to locate and address the views\n
    \  they are interested in.  A view denotes the complete or partial state\n   of
    a virtual asset, or the output of a function computed over the\n   states of one
    or more assets, or locks or pledges made over assets\n   for internal or external
    parties.  Systems projecting these views\n   must be able to guard them using
    custom access control policies, and\n   external parties consuming them must be
    able to verify them\n   independently for authenticity, finality, and freshness.
    \ The end-to-\n   end protocol that allows an external party to request a view
    by an\n   address and a DLT system to return a view in response must be DLT-\n
    \  neutral and mask the interior particularities and complexities of the\n   DLT
    systems.  The view generation and verification modules at the\n   endpoints must
    obey the native consensus logic of their respective\n   systems.\n\n\t "

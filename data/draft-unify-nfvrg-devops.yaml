  content: "   Carrier-grade network management was optimized for environments built\n
    \  with monolithic physical nodes and involves significant deployment,\n   integration
    and maintenance efforts from network service providers.\n   The introduction of
    virtualization technologies, from the physical\n   layer all the way up to the
    application layer, however, invalidates\n   several well-established assumptions
    in this domain. This draft opens\n   the discussion in NFVRG about challenges
    related to transforming the\n   telecom network infrastructure into an agile,
    model-driven\n   environment for communication services. We take inspiration from
    data\n   center DevOps on the simplification and automation of management\n   processes
    for a telecom service provider software-defined\n   infrastructure (SDI). A number
    of challenges associated with\n   operationalizing DevOps principles at scale
    in software-defined\n   telecom networks are identified in relation to three areas
    related to\n   key programmable management processes.\n\n\t "

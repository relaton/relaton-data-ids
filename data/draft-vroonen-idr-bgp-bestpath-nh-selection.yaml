  content: "   BGP [RFC4271] has originally been designed to carry IPv4 routing\n
    \  information over the Internet.  IP routing being “hop-by-hop” in\n   nature,
    [RFC4271] defines the NEXT_HOP attribute which purpose is to\n   carry the address
    of the next router to send the IP packet to.  In\n   BGP, the next-hop may not
    be a directly connected router, hence, when\n   evaluating paths, BGP needs to
    figure out if the next-hop is\n   resolvable and, when needed, needs to figure
    out what is the internal\n   cost to reach this next-hop.\n\n   The incremental
    use of tunneling technologies to carry traffic\n   between routers (e.g.: GRE,
    MPLS, SR-MPLS, SRv6…) may violate the\n   assumption that the address carried
    in the NEXT_HOP attribute is\n   representative of the actual forwarding next-hop.
    \ These technologies\n   decouple the BGP control-plane's view of the next-hop
    from the data-\n   plane's actual forwarding endpoint.  This document describes
    the\n   problems that arise from this decoupling.  These problems include\n   sub-optimal
    path selection, incorrect resolvability tracking of the\n   forwarding path leading
    to traffic drop or misrouting, and others.\n   This document proposes some modification
    of BGP path selection\n   procedures to accommodate these use cases.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP [RFC4271] has originally been designed to carry IPv4 routing information
    over the Internet. IP routing being “hop-by-hop” in nature, [RFC4271] defines
    the NEXT_HOP attribute which purpose is to carry the address of the next router
    to send the IP packet to. In BGP, the next-hop may not be a directly connected
    router, hence, when evaluating paths, BGP needs to figure out if the next-hop
    is resolvable and, when needed, needs to figure out what is the internal cost
    to reach this next-hop. The incremental use of tunneling technologies to carry
    traffic between routers (e.g.: GRE, MPLS, SR-MPLS, SRv6…) may violate the assumption
    that the address carried in the NEXT_HOP attribute is representative of the actual
    forwarding next-hop. These technologies decouple the BGP control-plane's view
    of the next-hop from the data- plane's actual forwarding endpoint. This document
    describes the problems that arise from this decoupling. These problems include
    sub-optimal path selection, incorrect resolvability tracking of the forwarding
    path leading to traffic drop or misrouting, and others. This document proposes
    some modification of BGP path selection procedures to accommodate these use cases.</p>"

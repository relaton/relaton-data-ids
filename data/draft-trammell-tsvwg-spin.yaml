abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines an explicit per-flow transport-layer signal for\n
    \  hybrid measurement of end-to-end RTT.  This signal consists of three\n   bits:
    a spin bit, which oscillates once per end-to-end RTT, and a\n   two-bit Valid
    Edge Counter (VEC), which compensates for loss and\n   reordering of the spin
    bit to increase fidelity of the signal in less\n   than ideal network conditions.
    \ It describes the algorithm for\n   generating the signal, approaches for observing
    it to passively\n   measure end-to-end latency, and proposes methods for adding
    it to a\n   variety of IETF transport protocols.\n\n\t "

  content: "An IPv6 addressing architecture which maximize the provider independence
    is described.     With flatly routed IPv4 addresses, one can subscribe to multiple
    providers and change providers at will without a lot of efforts. But, IPv6 packets
    will be hierarchically routed and their addresses will have hierarchical structure,
    whose higher part is determined by the network provider.      By separating a
    128 bit IPv6 address into 64 bit ILOC (Internet LOCator), first 4 bytes of which
    is flat routable provider part and the rest 4 bytes of which is hierarchical intra-provider
    part, and 64 bit IID (Internet ID), which is not routable but globally unique,
    it is possible to preserve some of the provider independence of IPv4.      The
    architecture can also identify geographical location of providers.\n\t "

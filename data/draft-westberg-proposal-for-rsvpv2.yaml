  content: "The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards\ntrack
    within the IETF for a number of years.  During that time, the\nlevel of vendor
    support and deployment has been relatively slow,\ndespite the desire of many to
    deploy technology to deliver services\nwith different levels of quality of service
    (QoS) to their customers.\nThe reasons for this are arguably well-understood and
    documented and\nare not the focus of this memo.  This memo seeks to initiate a
    dialog\nabout the design of a new version of RSVPv1, which we call RSVPv2.\nThe
    RSVPv2 framework could use the combination of two concepts.  The\nconcept of ALSP
    (Application Layer Signaling Protocol) and the\nconcept of Common Signaling Transport
    Protocol (CSTP).\nThis memo outlines the motivation for doing this work and provides\ndesign
    guidelines and specifications for the development of the\nRSVPv2 ALSP. RSVPv2
    ALSP is an ALSP type that can be a part of the\nRSVPv2 framework.\n\n\t "

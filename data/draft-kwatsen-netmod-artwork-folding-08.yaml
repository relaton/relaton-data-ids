abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy for
    handling long lines in artwork in drafts using a backslash ('\\') character where
    line-folding has occurred. The strategy works on any text based artwork, but is
    primarily intended for sample text and formatted examples and code, rather than
    for graphical artwork. The approach produces consistent results regardless of
    the content and uses a per-artwork header. The strategy is both self-documenting
    and enables automated reconstitution of the original artwork.</p>"

  content: "This document defines requirements for signaling across different network
    environments, such as across administrative and/or technology domains.  Signaling
    is mainly considered for Quality of Service (Qos) such as the Resource Reservation
    Protocol (RSVP).  However, in recent years, several other applications of signaling
    have been defined.  For example, signaling for label distribution in Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) or signaling to middleboxes.  To achieve wide applicability
    of the requirements, the starting point is a diverse set of scenarios/use cases
    concerning various types of networks and application interactions.  This document
    presents the assumptions before listing the requirements.  The requirements are
    grouped according to areas such as architecture and design goals, signaling flows,
    layering, performance, flexibility, security, and mobility.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

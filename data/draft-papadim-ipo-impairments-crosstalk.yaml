  content: "Optical in-band crosstalk between interfering optical channels has\nbeen
    identified (see [ITC-DIL]) as one of the major limitations to\nthe diameter and
    the performance of photonic (or all-optical)\nnetworks. In this context in-band
    crosstalk remains a cause of\noptical signal degradation in switching elements
    included in a\nPhotonic Cross-Connect (PXC).\n\t "

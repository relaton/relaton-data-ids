  content: "Many Service Providers (SPs) offer the Virtual Private Network (VPN)\nservices
    to their customers, using a technique in which Customer Edge\n(CE) routers are
    routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers.  The\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP)
    is used to distribute the customer's\nroutes across the provider's IP backbone
    network, and Multiprotocol\nLabel Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer
    packets across the\nprovider's backbone.  This is known as a \"BGP/MPLS IP VPN\".\nOriginally
    only IPv4 was supported and it was later extended to\nsupport IPv6 VPNs as well.
    \ Extensions were later added for the\nsupport of the Open Shortest Path First
    protocol version 2 (OSPFv2)\nas a PE-CE routing protocol for the IPv4 VPNs.  This
    document extends\nthose specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a
    PE-CE\nrouting protocol.  The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical to\nthat
    of OSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document.\n\t "

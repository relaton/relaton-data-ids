  content: "This document describes a connectionless tunneling architecture that\nis
    applicable to layer 3 PE-based virtual private networks and\nspecifies protocols
    for implementing it.  This tunneling architecture\nis designed to facilitate scalability
    and reliability.  A prominent\nfeature of it is to provide VPN tunnels over a
    connectionless\nnetwork.  Since a connectionless network can provide full mesh\nconnectivity
    without a connection establishment procedure, the\narchitecture enables scalable
    operation of a VPN more efficiently\nthan connection-oriented tunneling technologies.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents two YANG modules, one module to configure a\n
    \  NETCONF client and the other module to configure a NETCONF server.\n   Both
    modules support both the SSH and TLS transport protocols, and\n   support both
    standard NETCONF and NETCONF Call Home connections.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed
    by RFC Editor)\n\n   This draft contains placeholder values that need to be replaced
    with\n   finalized values at the time of publication.  This note summarizes\n
    \  all of the substitutions that are needed.  No other RFC Editor\n   instructions
    are specified elsewhere in this document.\n\n   Artwork in this document contains
    shorthand references to drafts in\n   progress.  Please apply the following replacements
    (note: not all may\n   be present):\n\n   *  AAAA --> the assigned RFC value for
    draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-\n      types\n\n   *  BBBB --> the assigned RFC value
    for draft-ietf-netconf-trust-\n      anchors\n\n   *  CCCC --> the assigned RFC
    value for draft-ietf-netconf-keystore\n\n   *  DDDD --> the assigned RFC value
    for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-\n      server\n\n   *  EEEE --> the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client-\n      server\n\n   *  FFFF --> the
    assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-\n      server\n\n   *  GGGG
    --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-http-\n      client-server\n\n
    \  *  HHHH --> the assigned RFC value for this draft\n   Artwork in this document
    contains placeholder values for the date of\n   publication of this draft.  Please
    apply the following replacement:\n\n   *  2024-03-16 --> the publication date
    of this draft\n\n   The \"Relation to other RFCs\" section Section 1.1 contains
    the text\n   \"one or more YANG modules\" and, later, \"modules\".  This text
    is\n   sourced from a file in a context where it is unknown how many modules\n
    \  a draft defines.  The text is not wrong as is, but it may be improved\n   by
    stating more directly how many modules are defined.\n\n   The \"Relation to other
    RFCs\" section Section 1.1 contains a self-\n   reference to this draft, along
    with a corresponding reference in the\n   Appendix.  Please replace the self-reference
    in this section with\n   \"This RFC\" (or similar) and remove the self-reference
    in the\n   \"Normative/Informative References\" section, whichever it is in.\n\n
    \  Tree-diagrams in this draft may use the '\\' line-folding mode defined\n   in
    RFC 8792.  However, nicer-to-the-eye is when the '\\\\' line-folding\n   mode
    is used.  The AD suggested suggested putting a request here for\n   the RFC Editor
    to help convert \"ugly\" '\\' folded examples to use the\n   '\\\\' folding mode.
    \ \"Help convert\" may be interpreted as, identify\n   what looks ugly and ask
    the authors to make the adjustment.\n\n   The following Appendix section is to
    be removed prior to publication:\n\n   *  Appendix A.  Change Log\n\n\t "

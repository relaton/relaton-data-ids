  content: "A Mobile IPv6 node needs a home address, a home agent address and a\nsecurity
    association with its home agent.  One of the current\nchallenge is to dynamically
    provide these information to the Mobile\nNode.  This problem is known as the Mobile
    IPv6 Bootstrapping\nproblem.  A solution for this is to rely on the AAA infrastructure
    to\nprovide the Home Agent Information to the Network Access server\n(NAS).  Then
    the Mobile Node uses DHCPv6 to get this information.\nThis document provides a
    way for the Mobile Node to get the Home\nAgent information by using the PANA protocol
    instead of DHCPv6.\n\nBefore the authentication phase, the PANA Authentication
    Agent (PAA)\nindicates to the PANA Client (PaC) that it can provide him with the\nHome
    Agent Information.  According to the PANA client's response,\nafter the authentication
    and authorization phase with the AAA\ninfrastructure, the PAA will send this information
    to the PaC.\n\n\t "

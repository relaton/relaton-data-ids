  content: "   The latency spin bit is an optional feature included in the QUIC\n
    \  transport protocol [I-D-QUIC].  It enables passive, on-path\n   observations
    for estimation of latency.  This document presents the\n   results of an inquiry
    into the potential of using randomized response\n   mechanisms (RRM) to reduce
    privacy loss in latency measurements.  It\n   concludes that RRM could be used
    to introduce choice for clients in\n   preserving privacy in latency measurements.
    \ But the trade-offs,\n   especially since the latency spin bit is already optional,
    do not\n   favour RRM.\n\n\t "

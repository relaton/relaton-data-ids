abstract:
- content: "<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are entering network operations through
    natural-language intent interfaces. Existing south-bound protocols (NETCONF, RESTCONF,
    gNMI, MCP, A2A) were not designed for conversational, semantically-rich, multi-agent
    orchestration. This document provides a systematic gap analysis and identifies
    extension points for each protocol to meet intent-based networking requirements.</p>"

  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\nfor
    use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.\nIn particular
    it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on\nthe IEEE 802.1D-1990 standard
    between Local Area Network (LAN)\nsegments.  Provisions are made for support of
    transparent bridging.\nProvisions are also made so that these objects apply to
    bridges\nconnected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a hybrid key and signature solution, which\n
    \  allows to integrate two public keys and/or two signatures into a\n   single
    certificate.  The scheme enables a single certificate to be\n   converted between
    different forms, allowing an alternative public key\n   and/or an alternative
    signature to be transmitted either by direct\n   inclusion or by referencing external
    data.  This flexibility ensures\n   that the scheme is backward-compatible with
    legacy devices, while\n   also providing enhanced security support for upgraded
    devices.  Four\n   CSR attributes and two new X.509v3 certificate extensions are\n
    \  defined, and the procedures for signing and verifying certificates\n   containing
    the defined attributes and extensions are described.\n\n\t "

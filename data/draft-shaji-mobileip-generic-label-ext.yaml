  content: "This document is regarding extended label distribution method using \nMobile
    IP registration and binding protocols. The document specifies \na novel method
    in which the label mapping information for a \nparticular mobile registration
    is piggybacked or placed in the same \nMobile IP registration request and response
    message. To apply this \nsame method to the route optimization protocol in Mobile
    IP, the \nlabel mapping information is piggybacked or placed in the binding \nupdate
    request message. The label mapping information is carried \nusing Mobile IP registration
    extensions. The document also addresses \nthe applicability of this label distribution
    method in GRE, MPLS and \nIPv6 networks.\n\t "

  content: "The IETF standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6 enables\nmobile
    devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways\nwithout changing
    the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides limited multi-\nhoming support to multi-mode
    mobile devices.  The IETF is working on\noptimizations for PMIPv6.  While multi-homing
    item has been proposed\nto be part of the approved work, discussions showed there
    are still\nmany controversial issues to be addressed (i.e. the no-host\nmodification
    theorem).  This document explores solutions for the\nmulti-homing use case aiming
    at helping PMIPv6 development where\npossible.\n\t "

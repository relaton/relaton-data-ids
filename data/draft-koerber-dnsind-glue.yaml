  content: "The GLUE-type Resource records offer an alternative to the use of\ntraditional
    address records (A, AAAA, A6) as glue in parent zones.\nThe intention is that
    GLUE-type records are only ever returned in the\nadditional section of referrals,
    rather than as reply to address\nqueries to a parent nameserver which is not actually
    responsible for\nthe delegated zone.\n\n\n\t "

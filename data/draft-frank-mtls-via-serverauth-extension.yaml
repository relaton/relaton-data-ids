  script: Latn
  content: "   This document aims to standardize the validation of mutual TLS\n   authentication
    between servers (server-to-server).  It outlines\n   recommended validation flows
    as well as provides practical design\n   recommendations.  Basically the EKU id-kp-clientAuth
    and id-kp-\n   serverAuth get more precisely defined to represent their common\n
    \  understanding by issuing CAs and browsers.  id-kp-clientAuth aka.\n   \"TLS
    WWW client authentication\" SHOULD mean authentication of a\n   natural or legal
    entity.  id-kp-serverAuth aka.  \"TLS WWW server\n   authetnication\" SHOULD mean
    authentication of a device.  When two id-\n   kp-clientAuth certificates are used
    this means E2E authentication\n   between two users.  Where as two id-kp-serverAuth
    certificates being\n   used means server-to-server authentication.  And one user
    and one\n   server certificate within one TLS connection means client-to-server\n
    \  (or technically also server-to-client).  The term \"TLS-Client\" SHOULD\n   no
    longer be used and mean the party sending the initial package\n   while establishing
    a TLS connection.  This helps to avoid design\n   issues moving forward as currently
    some people thought TLS-Client\n   auth was only ever used in \"client-to-server\"
    and never within\n   \"server-to-server\" context.  Which sparked the demand for
    this\n   document to begin with to keep server-to-server auth with public\n   trusted
    certificates working.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performance\n   over
    large bandwidth*delay product paths and to provide reliable\n   operation over
    very high-speed paths.  It defines new TCP options for\n   scaled windows and
    timestamps, which are designed to provide\n   compatible interworking with TCP's
    that do not implement the\n   extensions.  The timestamps are used for two distinct
    mechanisms:\n   RTTM (Round Trip Time Measurement) and PAWS (Protect Against Wrapped\n
    \  Sequences).  Selective acknowledgments are not included in this memo.\n\n   This
    memo updates and obsoletes RFC-1323 [Jacobson92d].\n\t "

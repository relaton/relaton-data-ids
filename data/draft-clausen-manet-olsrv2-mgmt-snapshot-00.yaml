  content: "   This document describes how Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are\n   typically
    managed, in terms of pre-deployment management, as well as\n   rationale and means
    of monitoring and management of MANET routers\n   running the Optimized Link State
    Routing protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)\n   and its constituent MANET Neighborhood
    Discovery Protocol (NHDP).\n   Apart from pre-deployment management for setting
    up IP addresses and\n   security related credentials, OLSRv2 only needs routers
    to agree one\n   single configuration parameter (called \"C\").  Other parameters
    for\n   tweaking network performance may be determined during operation of\n   the
    network, and need not be the same in all routers.  This, using\n   MIB modules
    and related management protocols such as SNMP (or\n   possibly other, less \"chatty\",
    protocols).  In addition, for\n   debugging purposes, monitoring data and performance
    related counters,\n   as well as notifications (\"traps\") can be sent to the
    Network\n   Management System (NMS) via standardized management protocols.\n\n\t "

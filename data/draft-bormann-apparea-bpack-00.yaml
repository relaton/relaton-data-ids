abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the\n   representation
    of structured information, supporting Boolean values,\n   numbers, strings, arrays,
    and tables.  Recently, a number of\n   applications have started to look for binary
    representation formats\n   that solve a similar problem.  In particular, constrained
    node\n   networks can benefit from such a binary representation format.\n\n   A
    very successful binary representation that is otherwise comparable\n   to JSON
    is MessagePack.  Recently, a slight modification of\n   MessagePack has been defined
    that allows for distinguishing UTF-8\n   strings from binary data.  This draft,
    as an independent effort,\n   documents the resulting BinaryPack format.\n\n   The
    current version -00 of this document is an early draft that is\n   intended to
    spark further discussion.\n\n\t "

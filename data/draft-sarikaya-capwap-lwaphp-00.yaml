  content: "   This document describes the Light Weight Access Point Handover\n   Protocol
    (LWAPHP) which is a protocol allowing the access router to\n   anchor and  manage
    802.11 handovers of the stations between a\n   collection of wireless Access Points.
    The protocol like IEEE's IAPP\n   aims to ensure that a station is connected to
    a single access point\n   and provides an efficient context transfer mechanism
    during handover\n   using neighbor graphs.\n\t "

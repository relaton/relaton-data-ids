  content: "   This note presents Lightweight Fair Queueing (LFQ), a fair queueing\n
    \  algorithm with a small code footprint, low memory requirements, no\n   multiply
    operations, only two physical queues, and only one set of\n   AQM state.  LFQ
    provides throughput fairness, sparse flow\n   prioritization and ordering guarantees,
    making it suitable for a\n   mixture of traffic flow types.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "This document proposes security extensions that are applicable to\nP2PSIP
    overlays that follow the base protocol described in the WG\nleading drafts. The
    proposed extensions exploit symmetric/asymmetric\ncryptography and a key refresh
    mechanism to protect the signaling\nexchanged between the participating peers
    in order to enhance the\nrobustness of the system against several types of attacks
    that are\ncommon to peer-to-peer networks. The refresh mechanism is either\nsupervised
    by higher-level trusted peers or exclusively controlled by\nthe members of the
    overlay.\n\t "

  content: "   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n   provides
    optimal multicast forwarding through a \"multicast domain\",\n   without requiring
    intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state\n   or to engage in an explicit
    tree-building protocol.  There may be\n   some routers which could not support
    BIER technology (We name them as\n   non-BIER node in this document) in the BIER
    domain when deployed.\n   This document specifies a solution for the BIER packet
    transiting the\n   non-BIER nodes.\n\n\t "

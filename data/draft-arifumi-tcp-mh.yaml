- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In the existing TCP, only one local and one remote address is used\nthrough
    a TCP session, even when a client or a server is located\nunder multi-homed site
    and has multiple IP addresses.  When a network\noutage occurs and the access-line
    associated with the local and\nremote addresses is down, the TCP session itself
    gets lost even if\nanother access-line is alive.  TCP MH option makes it possible
    to\nhandle multiple local and remote address pairs in one TCP session and\nto
    survive network outages by finding out an alternative network\npath.  Our path
    transition mechanism is simple, fast, lightweight and\nas secure as existing TCP.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>In many deployments, remote attestation is performed within separate
    administrative and trust domains. Each domain typically operates its own management
    plane and a Remote Attestation Service (RAS) to obtain verifier inputs (e.g.,
    endorsement material and reference values) and produce attestation results. At
    scale, cross-domain scenarios face two recurring challenges: (1) enabling policy-controlled
    transparency so that verifiers or relying parties in one domain can discover and
    retrieve selected attestation artifacts from other domains; and (2) supporting
    many-to-many distribution and reuse of verifier inputs and verifier outputs without
    requiring point-to-point integrations. This document describes Distributed Remote
    Attestation (DRA) patterns that use a shared publication channel for selected
    artifacts with provenance and access control in mind. A Distributed Ledger (DL)
    is discussed as one concrete instantiation of such a publication channel, including
    an option to host verification logic on the DL. The described patterns are intended
    to complement existing RATS procedures and conceptual messages, and can be realized
    by other tamper-evident publication channels with comparable properties.</p>"

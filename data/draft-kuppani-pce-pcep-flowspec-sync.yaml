  content: "   Dissemination of the traffic flow specifications was first introduced\n
    \  in the BGP protocol via RFC 5575.  In order to distribute the flow\n   specifications
    from PCE controller to network device without BGP\n   protocol it is desirable
    to extend PCEP with flow specification\n   information.\n\n   [I-D.li-pce-pcep-flowspec]
    specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to\n   support dissemination of flow specifications.
    \ The extensions include\n   the instantiation, updation and deletion of flow
    specifications.\n\n   Flow specifications downloaded to forwarding entries requires
    a\n   reliable synchronization mechanism between the path computation\n   clients
    (PCCs) and the PCE.  This draft specify the flow\n   specification synchronization
    mechanism for managing of flow\n   specification (FLOwSPEC-DB) at node (PCC) aligning
    with FLOWSPEC-DB\n   at PCE on initial session UP or session flap and specifies
    the\n   required Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)\n   extensions.\n\n\t "

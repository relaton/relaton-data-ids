  content: "   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides\n
    \  mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to instantiate and\n   manage
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) on a Path Computation Client\n   (PCC).  A Stateful
    PCE RFC8231 can instantiate LSPs on a PCC.  In\n   some cases, the PCC shall perform
    additional validations and/or\n   actions.  If some validations or actions fail,
    the LSP will not be\n   created and established or updated.  This document specifies
    PCEP\n   extensions to handle this situation gracefully in case the problem\n
    \  can be resolved by some network changes (freeing up resources,\n   restoring
    or changing the network, and so on).  This draft defines\n   common usage of the
    new flag and known use cases for using this flag.\n   Each draft relevant to LSP
    creation can add a corresponding bit to\n   the use case list.\n\n\t "

  content: "   DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives\n   attackers
    the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by\n   eavesdropping on network
    connections.  This document specifies use of\n   DNS Stateful Operations to enable
    a subscribe/publish mechanism for\n   zone transfers reducing the over head introduced
    by NOTITY/SOA\n   interactions prior to zone transfer request.  This additionally\n
    \  prevents zone contents collection via passive monitoring of zone\n   transfers
    by restricting XFR using DSO to require TLS.\n\n\t "

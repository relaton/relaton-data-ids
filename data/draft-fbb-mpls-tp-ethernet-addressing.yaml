  content: "   The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)\n
    \  is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable to the construction\n   and
    operation of packet-switched transport networks.  This document\n   presents considerations
    for link-layer addressing of Ethernet frames\n   carrying MPLS-TP packets.\n\n
    \  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF)
    / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network.\n\n\t "

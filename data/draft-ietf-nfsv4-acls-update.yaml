  content: "   This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the\n
    \  description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc8881bis\n   respecification
    effort for NFSv4.1.  It describes the structure and\n   function of NFSv4 Access
    Control Lists within NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1.\n   These minor versions and forthcoming
    ones define ACLs using an ACL\n   structure derived from Windows ACLs.\n\n   Support
    for other ACL approaches such as draft-POSIX ACLs remains an\n   option that could
    be taken advantage of in later minor versions such\n   as NFSv4.2.\n\n   This
    document describes the structure of these Windows-derived NFSv4\n   ACLs and their
    role in the NFSv4 security architecture.  While the\n   focus of this document
    is on the role of these ACLs in providing a\n   more flexible approach to file
    access authorization than is made\n   available by the POSIX-derived authorization-related
    attributes, the\n   potential provision of other security-related functionality
    based on\n   ACLs is covered as well.\n\n   Because of the failure of previous
    specifications to provide a\n   satisfactory description of the authorization
    semantics of NFSv4\n   ACLs, this document takes a different approach to many
    matters while\n   maintaining compatibility with implementations based on previous\n
    \  specifications.\n\n   When the resulting document is eventually published as
    an RFC, it\n   will supersede the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics\n
    \  appearing in existing minor version specification documents for\n   NFSv4.0
    and NFSv4.1, thereby updating RFC7530 and RFC8881.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the
    description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc881bis respecification
    effort for NFSv4.1. It describes the structure and function of NFSv4 Access Control
    Lists within NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1. These minor versions define ACLs using an ACL
    model based on Windows ACLs. Support for other ACL models such as draft POSIX
    ACLs remains an option that could be taken advantage of in later minor versions
    such as NFSv4.2. This document describes the structure of these Windows-derived
    NFSv4 ACLs and their role in the NFSv4 security architecture. While the focus
    of this document is on the role of these ACLs in providing a more flexible approach
    to file access authorization than is made available by the POSIX-derived authorization-related
    attributes, the potential provision of other security-related functionality is
    covered as well. Because of the failure of previous specifications to provide
    a satisfactory description of the authorization semantics of NFSv4 ACLs, this
    document takes a different approach to many matters while maintaining compatibility
    with implementations od previous specifications, which dealt with the need for
    support for UNIX- oriented clients and server by leaving many important matters
    unspecified. [Consensus Needed (Items #117a, #119a)]: In this document, the relationship
    among the multiple ACL models for which potential support was mentioned has changed.
    A core set of functionality, shared in large part with that derived from a subset
    of the functionality provided by the now-withdrawn draft-POSIX ACLs is presented
    as the conceptual base of the feature set. Additional sets of features used to
    provide the functionality needed by clients expecting Windows semantics as part
    of the NFSv4 ACL model are considered as OPTIONAL extensions to that core. In
    addition it is made clear that support for the draft POSIX ACL model is not yet
    present in NFSv4.1, but that a subset of that functionality is available. When
    the resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it will supersede the
    descriptions of ACL structure and semantics appearing in existing minor version
    specification documents for NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby updating RFC7530 and
    RFC8881.</p>"

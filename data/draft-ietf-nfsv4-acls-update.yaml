abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the
    description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc8881bis respecification
    effort for NFSv4.1. It describes the structure and function of NFSv4 Access Control
    Lists within NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1. These minor versions and forthcoming ones define
    ACLs using an ACL structure derived from Windows ACLs. Support for other ACL approaches
    such as draft-POSIX ACLs remains an option that could be taken advantage of in
    later minor versions such as NFSv4.2. This document describes the structure of
    these Windows-derived NFSv4 ACLs and their role in the NFSv4 security architecture.
    While the focus of this document is on the role of these ACLs in providing a more
    flexible approach to file access authorization than is made available by the POSIX-derived
    authorization-related attributes, the potential provision of other security-related
    functionality based on ACLs is covered as well. Because of the failure of previous
    specifications to provide a satisfactory description of the authorization semantics
    of NFSv4 ACLs, this document takes a different approach to many matters while
    maintaining compatibility with implementations based on previous specifications.
    When the resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it will supersede
    the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics appearing in existing minor version
    specification documents for NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby updating RFC7530 and
    RFC8881.</p>"

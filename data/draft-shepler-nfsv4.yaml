  content: "\n   NFS version 4 is a distributed file system protocol which owes\n
    \  heritage to NFS versions 2 [RFC1094] and 3 [RFC1813].  Unlike earlier\n   versions,
    NFS version 4 supports traditional file access while\n   integrating support for
    file locking and the mount protocol.  In\n   addition, support for strong security
    (and its negotiation), compound\n   operations, and internationlization have been
    added.  Of course,\n   attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate
    well in an\n   Internet environment.\n\n\t "

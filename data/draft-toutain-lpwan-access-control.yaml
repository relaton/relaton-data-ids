  content: "   The framework for SCHC defines an abstract view of the rules,\n   formalized
    with through a YANG Data Model.  In its original\n   description rules are static
    and share by 2 entities.  The use of\n   YANG authorizes rules to be uploaded
    or modified in a SCHC instance\n   and leads to some possible attacks, if the
    changes are not\n   controlled.  This document summarizes some possible attacks
    and\n   define augmentation to the existing Data Mode, to restrict the\n   changes
    in the rule.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "       In order to update the DNS (Domain Name System)[1] resource records\n
    \      (RRs) for the node when its name or address changes, the DDNS\n       (Dynamic
    DNS) protocol[2] has been standardized as an extension of\n       basic DNS protocol.
    Then the security DDNS scheme[3] was proposed to\n       enhance the security
    of DDNS. Based on these two protocols, the DNS\n       update can be used in many
    scenarios, for example in the DHCP\n       (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)[4]
    deployed environment.\n\n       Based on these specifications, this document defines
    the extension\n       in MIPv6 (Mobile IPv6)[5] to achieve DNS update for the
    named MN\n       (Mobile Node). Specifically speaking, the FQND Option defined
    in the\n       RFC4704[6] is included in the MIPv6 BU (Binding Update) signaling\n
    \      message. Then the PTR RR or AAAA and PTR RRs may be updated by the\n       HA
    (Home Agent) when the HoA (Home Address) or name of MN changes.\n\n\t "

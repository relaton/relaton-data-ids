  content: "This document addresses service requirements for provider \nprovisioned
    optical virtual private network \nThe intent of this document is to include the
    OVPN work as part \nof PPVPN charter. A VPN service model based on optical \nconnectivity
    has a lot of functional elements in common with \nother models already chartered
    in PPVPN.  \nInclusion of this topic in the charter will facilitate \nconvergence
    and maximize reusability of common techniques to \nprovide VPN service functions
    independently of the VPN \nconnectivity level. That is also a global objective
    of the \nPPVPN standardization effort.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines the precise ECN during used in WAN. With the growing
    demand for AI computing power, the computational capacity of a single Artificial
    Intelligence Data Center (AIDC) can no longer meet the requirements of large-scale
    model training. This has led to the emergence of cross-AIDC distributed model
    training, driving the need for transmitting RoCEv2 packets over WAN networks.
    AI training is highly sensitive to network packet loss, where even minimal packet
    loss can significantly degrade training efficiency. Additionally, elephant flows
    and extreme concurrent traffic impose higher demands on network performance. ECN
    achieves active feedback of network congestion by setting ECN flag bits in the
    header of IP packets, which is an effective traffic control method. RFC6040 introduces
    the application of ECN in WAN. However, due to the much higher end-to-end delay
    in WAN than in DC, and the frequent occurrence of instantaneous traffic bursts
    in WAN, it is easy to trigger ECN at the wrong time. This draft focuses on the
    precise use of ECN in WAN, by introducing different reactions of ECN in different
    WAN transmission scenarios</p>"

  content: "   When a correspondent node (CN) initiates a session with a multi-homed\n
    \  Mobile Node (MN), it should choose the \"best\" destination address\n   based
    on the available information about the MN.  Presently there is\n   no mechanism
    allowing the MN to indicate on which interface (i.e.,\n   address) a CN may reach
    it.  This draft documents a method whereby\n   the MN may communicate to the CN
    address selection preferences so\n   that the CN may initiate a session to the
    desired address (interface)\n   for of the MN.  The method is based on the notion
    of storing address\n   selection preference information for the MN in the DNS.\n\t "

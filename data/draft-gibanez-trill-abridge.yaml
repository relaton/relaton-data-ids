  content: "RBridges are link layer devices that use routing protocols as \na control
    plane but do not target to scale up to large campus \nnetworks. This document
    contains an alternative proposal to \nlink-state RBridges, named ABridges. ABridges
    overcome \nRBridges L2 network size restrictions allowing applicability \nto very
    large Ethernet campus networks while maintaining zero \nconfiguration and high
    performance, by assuming a topological \nrestriction that is automatically performed.
    The proposal \nincludes a two-layered network architecture with two \nhierarchical
    independent spanning tree layers. Expected \nconvergence is fast, probably below
    two seconds.   \n\n\t "

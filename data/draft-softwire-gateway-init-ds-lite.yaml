  content: "Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack lite (GI-DS-lite) is a modified approach\nto
    the original Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) applicable to certain\ntunnel-based access
    architectures.  GI-DS-lite extends existing\naccess tunnels beyond the access
    gateway to an IPv4-IPv4 NAT using\nsoftwires with an embedded context identifier,
    that uniquely\nidentifies the end-system the tunneled packets belong to.  The
    access\ngateway determines which portion of the traffic requires NAT using\nlocal
    policies and sends/receives this portion to/from this softwire\ntunnel.\n\t "

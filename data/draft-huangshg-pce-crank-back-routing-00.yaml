  script: Latn
  content: "Path computation in large multi-layer and multi-region networks is\n   complex
    and may require special computational components and\n   cooperation between different
    network domains, whereby a failure\n   affect to establish a path or a failure
    of an existing path may be\n   corrected by a new path computation and fresh signaling.
    \ This\n   document specifies the crank-back routing mechanism based on re-\n
    \  routing in crank back Path Computation Element (PCE).  When a Path\n   Computation
    Client (PCC) requests a PCE for a route, it may be useful\n   for the PCC to specify
    Crank-back routing to the path computation,\n   abstract nodes, resources, and
    domains that are to be explicitly\n   excluded from the computed route.  Such
    mechanism is termed Crank-\n   back routing.  The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    is designed as a\n   communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs.  To support
    this\n   mechanism, function of PCE and procedure of PCEP signaling\n   performance
    are extended.\n\n\t "

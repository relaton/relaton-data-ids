  content: "In a link state routing protocol like OSPF, the network and CPU\nbandwidth
    consumed by the routing protocol is primarily to\npropagate and process information
    about the network topology\nand changes in the topology. The 'flooding procedure'
    of OSPF\npropagates the topology change information to all routers in the\nnetwork.
    This procedure delivers the information, multiple times\nto a router (depending
    on the source of the information and its\nconnectivity) even though it needs to
    be delivered only once.\nThe resultant wastage of network bandwidth and CPU processing\ntime
    reduces the scalability of OSPF. In some cases like a fully\nconnected subgraph
    this redundant information increases by an order\nof magnitude (from O(n) to O(n^2)).
    This draft describes a\ntechnique to reduce this redundant information for a fully\nconnected
    subgraph of the network.\n\t "

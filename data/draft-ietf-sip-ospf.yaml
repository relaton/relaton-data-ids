  content: "This specification defines OSPF V2 for use with SIPP, called OSPF-SIPP.
    \ The only changes required to the OSPF *specification* (for convenience, we assume
    'V2' in the remainder of this document) to allow it to work with SIPP is an increase
    in the address size, wherever it appears, from 32 to 64 bits.  That is, the IP
    address is replaced everywhere with the SIPP address.\n\t "

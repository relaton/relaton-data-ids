  content: "   This document describes the need of intertwining of IP networking\n
    \  with geographical addressing. As used today, IP routing and\n   addressing
    are completely unaware of geographic parameters such as\n   coordinates or postal
    addresses. Possible applications of future\n   Internet-wide geo-networking mechanisms
    include, but are not limited\n   to, dissemination of IP packets to geographical
    areas, or precise\n   tracking of package positions during a shipping process,
    with more\n   use-cases under discussion.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and\n
    \  networks.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP,\n   to
    inform a CoAP server of the maximum time that a CoAP client will\n   wait a response
    to its request.  A CoAP server can use this header to\n   ensure that a timely
    response is generated.\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion and suggestions for improvement
    are requested, and should\n   be sent to core@ietf.org.\n\n\t "

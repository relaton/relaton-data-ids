  content: "This memorandum describes a proposed mechanism under which differing schemes
    for the naming, allocation and management of new international top-level domains
    may be tried without their interfering with each other.  This memorandum discusses
    the trademrk issues underlying the current debate on International TLDs, and proposes
    non-interfering simultaneous experiments, following the proposals of [DENNINGER],[HIGGS],[MASEK]
    and [POSTEL].                                                                  This
    memo is being distributed to the Internet community in order to solicit their
    opinions of the proposals contained in it. In particular, The IETF, IANA, NEWDOM
    SHARED-TLD and related mailing lists are invited to read and comment on this material.\n\t "

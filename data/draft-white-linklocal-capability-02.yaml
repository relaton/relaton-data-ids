  script: Latn
  content: "   BGP, described in [RFC4271], was originally designed to provide\n   reachability
    between domains and between the edges of a domain.  As\n   such, BGP assumes the
    next hop towards any reachable destination may\n   not reside on the advertising
    speaker, but rather may either be\n   through a router connected to the same subnet
    as the speaker, or\n   through a router only reachable by traversing multiple
    hops through\n   the network.  Because of this, BGP does not recognize the use
    of IPv6\n   link-local addresses, as described in [RFC4291], as a valid next hop\n
    \  for forwarding purposes.\n\n   However, BGP speakers are now often deployed
    on point-to-point links\n   in networks where multihop reachability of any kind
    is not assumed or\n   desired (all next hops are assumed to be the speaker reachable\n
    \  through a directly connected point-to-point link).  This is common,\n   for
    instance, in data center fabrics.  In these situations, a global\n   IPv6 address
    is not required for the advertisement of reachability\n   information; in fact,
    providing global IPv6 addresses in these kinds\n   of networks can be detrimental
    to Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).\n\n   This draft standardizes the operation
    of BGP over a point-to-point\n   link using link-local IPv6 addressing only.\n\n\t "

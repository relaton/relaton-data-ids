  content: "   This document describes the architecture of NFV configuration in the\n
    \  provider's network through a centralized management system and focus\n   on
    the virtualisation characteristics related issues.  It is also a\n   typical scenario
    in cloud computing environment where end users do\n   not have to install or manage
    their applications on their end hosts,\n   but can install and manage their own
    featured powerful software\n   application in the cloud.  This specification describes
    an\n   architecture of NFV configuration.  It is also applicable to other\n   use
    cases with similar requirements.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the Network Discovery Protocol (NETDIS), a \nprotocol
    that provides a way to broadcast information about the \nnetwork service accessible
    through the access network where the \ninformation is broadcasted. This allows
    several service providers to \nshare the same access network. The public WLAN
    access network is \nparticularly targeted by this protocol. As a result a mobile
    terminal \nlistening NETDIS announcements discovers the list of Service \nproviders
    (Virtual WLAN operator) supported by the WLAN it is \ncurrently attached. \n\t "

  content: "   This document defines an application protocol for WSDB services\n   provided
    to TV Band Devices (TVBDs). The protocol complies with FCC\n   Rules/Requirements
    [FCC 10-174] and in the context of operating an\n   FCC certified database, it
    also complies with requirements defined by\n   IETF PAWS [IETF-PAWS-03]. We believe
    this protocol can be easily\n   extended to include the remaining requirements
    not already satisfied\n   from the IETF PAWS requirements.\n\n\n\n\t "

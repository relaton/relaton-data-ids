- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant networks,\nand
    is a generalization of the architecture designed for the\nInterplanetary Internet:
    a communication system to provide Internet-\nlike services across interplanetary
    distances in support of deep\nspace exploration.  This generalization addresses
    networks whose\noperational characteristics make conventional networking approaches\nbecome
    either unworkable or impractical.  We define a message-based\noverlay that exists
    above the transport layer of the networks on\nwhich it is hosted.  The draft presents
    an architectural overview\nfollowed by discussions of services, topology, routing,
    security,\nreliability and state management.  It concludes with a discussion of\nend-to-end
    information exchange, including an example.\n\n\t "

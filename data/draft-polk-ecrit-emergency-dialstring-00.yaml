  content: "   Most efforts to address emergency calling challenges over IP (and \n
    \  cellular technologies such as GSM, TDMA, CDMA, etc, for that matter)\n   have
    focused on locating the calling user in order to route the \n   emergency call
    set-up request to the appropriate Public Safety \n   Answering Point (PSAP). Little
    or no effort to date has focused on \n   informing the caller what dialstring
    sequence they may need to use \n   to initiate a call for emergency help.  This
    document describes how \n   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REGISTER Request
    message is \n   used to inform a user of which emergency dialstring (of the 60
    known\n   dialstring choices around the world) they should use, for where they\n
    \  are geographically.\n\n\t "

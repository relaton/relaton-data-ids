  content: "   Collective signatures are compact cryptographic proofs showing that\n
    \  several distinct secret key holders, called cosigners, have\n   cooperated
    to sign a given message.  This document describes a\n   collective signature extension
    to the EdDSA signing schemes for the\n   Ed25519 and Ed448 elliptic curves.  A
    collective EdDSA signature\n   consists of a point R, a scalar s, and a bitmask
    Z indicating the\n   specific subset of a known group of cosigners that produced
    this\n   signature.  A collective signature produced by n cosigners is of size\n
    \  64+ceil(n/8) bytes for Ed25519 and 114+ceil(n/8) bytes for Ed448,\n   respectively,
    instead of 64n and 114n bytes for n individual\n   signatures.  Further, collective
    signature verification requires only\n   one double scalar multiplication rather
    than n.  The verifier learns\n   exactly which subset of the cosigners participated,
    enabling the\n   verifier to implement flexible acceptance-threshold policies,
    and\n   preserving transparency and accountability in the event a bad message\n
    \  is collectively signed.\n\n\t "

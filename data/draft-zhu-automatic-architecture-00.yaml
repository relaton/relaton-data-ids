  content: "   Firmware update is one of the key features for all Internet of\n   Things(IoT)
    Devices.  Incentives of firmware update is to fix bugs,\n   upgrade configurations,
    add new services from constained devices to\n   connected vehicles.  The IETF
    SUIT working group is focusing on\n   defining a firmware update solution that
    will be usable on Class 1\n   devices as well as more capable devices with existing
    mechanisms.\n   This document provides an firmware update architechture, that
    aims at\n   helping build a secure, automatic and interoperable IoT firmware\n
    \  update mechanism.\n\n\t "

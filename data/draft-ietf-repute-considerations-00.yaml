  content: "   The use of reputation systems is has become a common tool in many\n
    \  applications that seek to apply collected intelligence about traffic\n   sources.
    \ Often this is done because it is common or even expected\n   operator practice.
    \ It is therefore important to be aware of a number\n   of considerations for
    both operators and consumers of the data.  This\n   document includes a collection
    of the best advice available regarding\n   providers and consumers of reputation
    data, based on experience to\n   date.  Much of this is based on experience with
    email reputation\n   systems, but the concepts are generally applicable.\n\n\t "

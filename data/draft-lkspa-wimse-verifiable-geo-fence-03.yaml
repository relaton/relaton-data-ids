  content: "   Modern cloud and distributed environments face significant risks from\n
    \  stolen bearer tokens, protocol replay, and trust gaps in transit.\n   This
    document presents a framework for modernizing workload security\n   through cryptographically
    verifiable geofencing, proof-of-possession,\n   and protocol-aware residency enforcement.\n\n
    \  By binding workload identity to both geographic and host attributes,\n   and
    supplementing bearer tokens with verifiable, location- and host-\n   bound claims,
    the framework addresses the challenges of bearer token\n   theft, proof-of-possession
    and trust-in-transit for all networking\n   protocols.  Leveraging trusted hardware,
    attestation protocols, and\n   geolocation services, this approach ensures that
    only authorized\n   workloads in approved locations and environments can access
    sensitive\n   data or services, even in the presence of advanced threats.\n\n\t "

  content: "   With ever-increasing pressure to conserve IP address space on the\n
    \  Internet, it makes sense to consider where relatively minor changes\n   can
    be made to fielded practice to improve numbering efficiency.  One\n   such change,
    proposed by this document, is to increase the number of\n   unicast addresses
    in each existing subnet, by redefining the use of\n   the lowest-numbered (zeroth)
    host address in each IPv4 subnet as an\n   ordinary unicast host identifier, instead
    of as a duplicate segment-\n   directed broadcast address.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes an extension to the Session Description \n
    \  Protocol (SDP) that can be used by systems of cooperating networks \n   using
    Application Level Gateways (ALG) to insert border gateways \n   performing as
    Network Address Port Translators (NAPT) between their \n   IP realms to identify
    when border gateways can be bypassed for more \n   efficient media flow.  This
    extension can be used by networks based \n   on a protocol using the SDP offer/answer
    model, such as the IP \n   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) of the Third Generation
    Partnership \n   Project (3GPP), which is based on the Session Initiation Protocol
    \n   (SIP).  ALGs using this extension can determine within a single SDP \n   offer/answer
    transaction when the insertion of a new border gateway \n   would cause the media
    path to re-enter an IP realm visited elsewhere    within the media path, and to
    bypass one or more border gateways \n   that would otherwise be included in the
    media path.  This extension \n   also works with hosted NAPT traversal schemes
    to establish a direct \n   media path between endpoints within the same IP realm.
    \ Optional \n   procedures provide additional means to improve media flow.\n\t "

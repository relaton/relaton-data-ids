  content: "   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an autonomous system routing\n   protocol.
    \ The main function of BGP is to exchange routing and\n   reachability information
    between autonomous systems(AS) on the\n   Internet.  BGP uses TCP to implement
    reliable and orderly\n   transmission of information.  Similar to TCP, QUIC is
    a UDP-based,\n   byte-stream-based reliable data transmission service.  In addition,\n
    \  by integrating with TLS 1.3, QUIC also supports functions such as\n   establishing
    connections with minimum latency and providing\n   confidentiality and integrity
    protection for the transmitted data,\n   and multi-stream multiplexing.  Taking
    use of QUIC for BGP can\n   achieve the possible advantages.  This document defines
    the mechanism\n   of BGP over QUIC to and corresponding procedures.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes structures within a QuickTime movie file which\npermit
    easy transmission of the media content over RTP.  This\nspecification is intended
    to assist those who wish to stream stored\nmovies over RTP, those wishing to prepare
    movies for streaming, and\nfor those who might wish to record into QuickTime while
    preserving\nRTP information. The bit-stream(s) of RTP packets are normally\ncompliant
    with the RTP payload definitions for their content, and\nfull inter-operability
    can be achieved. Each QuickTime media track\nwithin a movie is sent over a separate
    RTP session and synchronized\nusing standard RTP techniques. This specification
    builds on the\npublished QuickTime file format specification.\n\t "

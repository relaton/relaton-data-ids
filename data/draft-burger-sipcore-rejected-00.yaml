  content: "   This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code.  This\n
    \  response code enables calling parties to learn their call was\n   rejected
    by an intermediary and will not be answered.  As a 6xx code,\n   the caller will
    be aware that future attempts to contact the same UAS\n   will be likely to fail.
    \ The present use case driving the need for\n   the 608 response code is when
    the intermediary is an analytics\n   engine.  In other words, the rejection is
    by a machine or other\n   process, as opposed to a human at the target UAS indicating
    the call\n   was not wanted.  This document also defines the use of the Call-Info\n
    \  header in 608 responses to enable rejected callers to contact\n   entities
    that blocked their calls in error.\n\n\t "

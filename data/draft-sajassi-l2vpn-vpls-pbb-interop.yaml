  content: "The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access network can be \nimproved
    by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) \nfunctionality in VPLS access.
    PBB has been standardized as IEEE \n802.1ah-2008, which is an amendment to 802.1Q
    to improve the \nscalability of MAC addresses and service instances in Provider
    \nEthernet networks. This document describes different \ninteroperability scenarios
    where IEEE 802.1ah functionality is used \nin H-VPLS with Ethernet or MPLS access
    network to attain better \nscalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses
    and number \nof service instances. The document also describes the scenarios and
    \nthe mechanisms for incorporating PBB functionality within H-VPLS \nwith existing
    IEEE 802.1ad (aka QinQ) Ethernet access and \ninteroperability among them. Furthermore,
    the document discusses the \nmigration mechanisms and scenarios by which PBB functionality
    can be \nincorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access. \n \n \nConventions
    used in this document \n \nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC
    2119.\n\t "

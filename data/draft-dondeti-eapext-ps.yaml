  content: "The extensible authentication protocol (EAP), specified in RFC3748\n[1]
    is a generic framework supporting multiple authentication\nmethods.  The EAP keying
    hierarchy specified in [2] has two top level\nkeys: a master session key (MSK)
    and an extended MSK (EMSK).  The MSK\nis used for access control enforcement,
    whereas the purpose of EMSK\nis to be defined.  Several proposals for the use
    of the EMSK have\nbeen made, among them are support for efficient re-authentication
    of\nthe EAP peer as it moves from one authenticator to another,\nbootstrapping
    preshared keys, visited domain key management.  In this\ndocument, we explore
    the various proposed uses of the EMSK key\nhierarchy and the design considerations
    in specifying the EMSK key\nhierarchy.\n\n\t "

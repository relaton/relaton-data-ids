  content: "   This document defines an authenticated key agreement method for the\n
    \  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3.  The\n   authentication
    method requires that the server (and optionally\n   client) is pre-provisioned
    with a unique long-term static asymmetric\n   Finite Field Diffie-Hellman (DH)
    or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman\n   (ECDH) keypair; the peer must be able to
    obtain the public key of the\n   endpoint via an out-of-band mechanism (e.g. pre-provisioning).
    \ The\n   handshake provides ephemeral (EC)DH keys, and a common key schedule\n
    \  is agreed using Double- or Triple-(EC)DH.  Confirmation of knowledge\n   of
    the key schedule provides server (and optionally client)\n   authentication.\n\n\t "

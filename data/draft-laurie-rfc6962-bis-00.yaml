abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes an experimental protocol for publicly logging\n
    \  the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as they\n   are
    issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit\n   certificate authority
    (CA) activity and notice the issuance of\n   suspect certificates as well as to
    audit the certificate logs\n   themselves.  The intent is that eventually clients
    would refuse to\n   honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively
    forcing\n   CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.\n\n   Logs are network
    services that implement the protocol operations for\n   submissions and queries
    that are defined in this document.\n\n\t "

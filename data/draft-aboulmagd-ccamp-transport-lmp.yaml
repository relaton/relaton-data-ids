  content: "The Link Management Protocol (LMP) has been developed as part of the \n
    \  Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite to manage Traffic \n   Engineering
    (TE) links. The GMPLS control plane (routing and \n   signaling) uses TE links
    for establishing Label Switched Paths \n   (LSPs). This memo describes the relationship
    of the LMP procedures\n   to 'discovery' as defined in the International Telecommunication
    \n   Union (ITU), and on-going ITU-T work. This document provides an \n   overview
    of LMP in the context of the ITU-T Automatically Switched \n   Optical Networks
    (ASON) and transport network terminology and \n   relates it to the ITU-T discovery
    work to promote a common \n   understanding for progressing the work of IETF and
    ITU-T.\n\t "

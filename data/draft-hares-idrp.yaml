  content: "This memo specifies the adaptation of the ISO Inter-Domain Routing Protocol
    that enables it to be used as an Inter-Autonomous System routing protocol in the
    TCP/IP Internet.  IDRP with this adaptation will be called 'IDRP for IP' in this
    document.  Dual IDRP, that is, a single instance of IDRP that can simultaneously
    support Inter-Domain/Inter-Autonomous System routing in the TCP/IP and OSI Internets
    is outside the scope of this document.\n\t "

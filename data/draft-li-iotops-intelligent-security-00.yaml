  script: Latn
  content: "   Communication technology is becoming more and more developed, the\n
    \  Internet of Things coverage is becoming more and more\n   comprehensive, and
    a large number of data and devices are\n   joining, which also makes more data
    security and privacy\n   issues appear.\n   Therefore, this draft proposes a scheme
    to build an\n   information-centered network. By analyzing common network\n   attack
    methods, an intelligent protection\n   optimization system is established from
    three aspects: naming and\n   parsing, data exchange, and data caching, so as
    to achieve\n   better content privacy protection without adding additional costs.\n\n\t "

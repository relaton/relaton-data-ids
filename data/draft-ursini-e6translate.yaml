  content: "   E6Translate (E6T) is a protocol designed to address the challenges
    of\n   bidirectional communication between IPv4-only hosts and the IPv6\n   Internet.
    \ Leveraging the reserved Class E IPv4 address space\n   (240.0.0.0/4) as temporary
    placeholders for IPv6 destinations, E6T\n   provides a lightweight and scalable
    mechanism for IPv4-to-IPv6\n   mapping and vice versa.  To enable reverse connectivity,
    E6T\n   repurposes a /96 segment of a /64 IPv6 prefix for IPv4-equivalent\n   mapping,
    facilitating port forwarding and external access to legacy\n   devices.  This
    document outlines the design, operation, and practical\n   applications of E6T,
    along with considerations for security,\n   deployment, and protocol standardization.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides the problem statement requirements and\n   scenarios
    for MIF.  These requirements and use case scenarios are\n   intended to define
    an approach to solving common problems presented\n   in MIF.  These MIF requirements
    and scenarios are based around the\n   common and prevalent problem of adaptation
    of a host to attach to\n   multiple networks simultaneously.  Such a host not
    only has to make\n   decisions about selection of service parameters but also
    how to deal\n   with issues relating to contradictory configuration objects.  These\n
    \  MIF scenarios are intended to be part of a set of such scenarios that\n   together
    define the purpose, scope and requirements for proposed and\n   realized capabilities.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a method to encapsulate multiple TCP\n   connections
    using only one UDP port number pair.  Doing so allows for\n   a relatively easy
    implementation of coupled congestion control for\n   the TCP connections.  This
    can have several performance benefits, and\n   it makes it possible to precisely
    assign a share of the congestion\n   window to the connections based on priorities.
    \ It also enables use\n   of UDP-based NAT traversal techniques, and it can act
    as a framework\n   for experimentation with novel changes to the TCP standard.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes a new READPLUS operation for NFSv4.2 to\nsupport
    efficient reading of sparse files, which are growing in the\ndata center due to
    the increasing number of virtual disk images.\nREADPLUS has all the features and
    functionality of READ, but has an\nextensible return value that includes an easy
    and efficient way for\nadministrators to copy and manage sparse files without
    wasting disk\nspace or transferring data unnecessarily.\n\t "

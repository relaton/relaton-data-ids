  content: "This document describes a profile for use in interoperability \ntesting
    of the Megaco/H.248 protocol and a set of scenarios to try \nincreasingly difficult
    mechanisms in the protocol.  To support early \nphase testing, it is useful to
    define a simple, easy to implement \nset of characteristics that allow initial
    implementations to get \nvery basic functions working. By implementing this profile,
    testing \na variety of MGs against a variety of MGCs is possible.  The test \nscenarios
    describe high-level behavior expected by the MGs and MGCs, \nbut not explicit
    message sequences. \n\n   Also included is a set of test messages that may be
    used to verify \n   early stage MG/MGC functionality.  They could be used to test
    \n   parsers, and they can be used to assure that implementations have \n   base
    functionality prior to testing with devices that may not \n   produce the same
    messages.\n\t "

  content: "This memo is an introductory guide to some of the TCP/IP and Internet
    tools and utilities that allow users to access the wide variety of information
    on the network, from determining if a particular host is up to viewing a multimedia
    thesis on foreign policy.  It also describes discussion lists accessible from
    the Internet, ways to obtain Internet and TCP/IP documents, and some resources
    that help users weave their way through the Internet. This memo may be used as
    a tutorial for individual self-learning, a step-by-step laboratory manual for
    a course, or as the basis for a site's users manual. It is intended as a basic
    guide only and will refer to other sources for more detailed information.\n\t "

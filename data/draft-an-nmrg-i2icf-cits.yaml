abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a structured framework for orchestrating, managing,
    and monitoring In-Network Computing Functions (ICFs) in Cooperative Intelligent
    Transportation Systems (C-ITS). For example, in the context of Vehicle-to-Everything
    (V2X) communications, efficient management of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications
    and their integration with C-ITS can greatly benefit from in-network computing.
    By leveraging ICFs, it becomes possible to optimize real- time communication,
    streamline traffic management, and enhance data processing and security services
    at the network edge. Moreover, by incorporating the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication
    paradigm, intelligent agents within vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs), and network
    domains can directly collaborate to negotiate resources, exchange contextual information,
    and coordinate computing tasks, enabling adaptive and scalable orchestration across
    multi-domain C-ITS environments.</p>"

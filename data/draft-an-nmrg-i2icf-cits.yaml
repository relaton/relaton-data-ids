  content: "   This document specifies a structured framework for orchestrating,\n
    \  managing, and monitoring In-Network Computing Functions (ICFs) in\n   Cooperative
    Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS).  For example,\n   in the context of
    Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications,\n   efficient management of Vehicle-to-Vehicle
    (V2V) communications and\n   their integration with C-ITS can greatly benefit
    from in-network\n   computing.  By leveraging ICFs, it becomes possible to optimize
    real-\n   time communication, streamline traffic management, and enhance data\n
    \  processing and security services at the network edge.  Moreover, by\n   incorporating
    the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication paradigm,\n   intelligent agents within
    vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs), and\n   network domains can directly collaborate
    to negotiate resources,\n   exchange contextual information, and coordinate computing
    tasks,\n   enabling adaptive and scalable orchestration across multi-domain\n
    \  C-ITS environments.\n\n\n\t "

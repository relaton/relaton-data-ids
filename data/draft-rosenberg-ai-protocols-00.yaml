  content: "   AI Agents are software applications that utilize Large Language\n   Models
    (LLM)s to interact with humans (or other AI Agents) for\n   purposes of performing
    tasks.  AI Agents can make use of resources -\n   including APIs and documents
    - to perform those tasks, and are\n   capable of reasoning about which resources
    to use.  To facilitate AI\n   agent operation, AI agents need to communicate with
    users, and then\n   interact with other resources over the Internet, including
    APIs and\n   other AI agents.  This document describes a framework for AI Agent\n
    \  communications on the Internet, identifying the various protocols\n   that
    come into play.  It introduces use cases that motivate features\n   and functions
    that need to be present in those protocols.  It also\n   provides a brief survey
    of existing work in standardizing AI agent\n   protocols, including the Model
    Context Protocol (MCP), the Agent to\n   Agent Protocol (A2A) and the Agntcy Framework,
    and describes how\n   those works fit into this framework.  The primary objective
    of this\n   document is to set the stage for possible standards activity at the\n
    \  IETF in this space.\n\n\t "

  content: "   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide local\n
    \  in-network loss recovery.  It can be used with tunneling protocols to\n   efficiently
    recover lost packets on a single segment of an end-to-end\n   path instead of
    leaving recovery to the end-to-end protocol,\n   traversing the entire path.\n\n
    \  Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing mechanisms and\n   steers
    the packets through an policy instantiated as an ordered list\n   of instructions
    called segments.  LOOPS can be embedded in an SR\n   segment to improve the packet
    recovery. draft-welzl-loops-gen-info\n   defines the generic information model,
    without binding that to any\n   specific protocols, to be carried between LOOPS
    ingress and egress\n   nodes, which can be SR segment endpoints.  This document
    specifies\n   the concrete mechanisms to embed LOOPS in SRv6 segment.\n\n\t "

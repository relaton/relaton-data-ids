  content: "This document describes a number of communication performance\nrequirements
    that are imposed by traffic safety applications on a\nnetwork layer.  These traffic
    safety applications and requirements\nhave been derived by the USA VSC (Vehicle
    Safety \nCommunications)and VSC-A (VSC-Applications) projects and by the \nEuropean
    Car to Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) and the ETSI TC \nITS standardization
    body. The goal of this document is to stimulate \nthe discussion on judging whether
    these performance requirements \ncould or could not be supported (currently and
    in the future) by IP \nbased network solutions.\n\t "

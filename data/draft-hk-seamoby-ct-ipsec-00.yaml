  content: "There are a large number of IP access networks where one may wish to \nprovide
    security for end user traffic, or secure the access network \nfrom unauthorized
    traffic.  One protocol which may be used to \nprovide these services is IPSec,
    which requires a node to establish \na security association with the access network
    in order to obtain \nthese services.  Traditionally, such an association is considered
    \nstatic, however, there are many situations in which the ability to \nmove an
    IPSec security association (SA) from one security gateway \n(SG) to another within
    the access network may be beneficial. \nExamples of this include IPSec handover
    in mobile LANs and PANs, \nload-balancing between IPSec SGs, and fail-over applications
    where \nhigh-availability is required.\n\t "

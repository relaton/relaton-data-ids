  content: "This Internet Draft describes a framework of extending SIP to support
    \ncall control across different networks. This extension encapsulates \nBearer
    Independent Call Control (BICC) in the SIP message to provide the \ninformation
    needed across networks. Integrating both SIP and BICC \nfeatures, this extension
    provides service providers a vehicle to deploy \nservices across different administration
    domains and different types of \nnetwork. \n\n\t "

  content: "A growing number of SIP based services depend on the idea that\nclients
    may publish service-related information to network elements.\nThis information
    may then affect further processing of the service.\nExamples of such services
    include presence and CPL.\nMultiple protocols may exists for the actual publication
    of such\ndata.  But regardless of the protocol, a client must know where to\nsend
    it.  This document describes requirements for a mechanism to\ninform clients where
    and how to publish service related information.\n\n\t "

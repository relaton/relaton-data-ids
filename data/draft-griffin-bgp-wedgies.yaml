  content: "It has commonly been assumed that the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\n
    \  is a tool for distributing reachability information in a manner that\n   creates
    forwarding paths in a deterministic manner.  In this memo we\n   will describe
    a class of BGP configurations for which there is more\n   than one potential outcome,
    and where forwarding states other than\n   the intended state are equally stable,
    and that the stable state\n   where BGP converges may be selected by BGP in a
    non- deterministic\n   manner.  These stable, but unintended, BGP states are termed
    here\n   \"BGP Wedgies\".\n\t "

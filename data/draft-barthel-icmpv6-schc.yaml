  content: "   ICMPv6 is a companion protocol to IPv6.  It defines messages that\n
    \  inform the source of IPv6 packets of errors during packet delivery.\n   It
    also defines the Echo Request/Reply messages that are used for\n   basic network
    troubleshooting (ping command).  ICMPv6 messages are\n   transported on IPv6.\n\n
    \  This document describes how to adapt ICMPv6 to Low Power Wide Area\n   Networks
    (LPWANs) by compressing ICMPv6/IPv6 headers and by\n   protecting the LPWAN network
    and the Device from undesirable ICMPv6\n   traffic.\n\n\t "

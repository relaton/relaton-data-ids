  content: "   The unpredictability of consumers, routers, copyholders, and\n   publishers
    for the in-network data retrievals in Content-Centric\n   Networking (CCN) / Named
    Data Networking (NDN) poses a challenge to\n   design an authentication mechanism
    to inhibit the malicious consumers\n   to flood data requests and prevent the
    fake data from being provided.\n   Signature is adopted as the fundamental function
    in CCN / NDN, which\n   however can only provide publisher authentication with
    additional\n   certificate acquisition.  This document describes the Hop-by-Hop\n
    \  Authentication mechanism (HopAuth) integrating certificate collection\n   and
    packet forwarding potentially with the assistance from\n   certificate authority
    to provide consumer authentication, copyholder\n   authentication and path authentication
    to enable the in-network data\n   retrieval to be trustworthy, besides the publisher
    authentication.\n\n\t "

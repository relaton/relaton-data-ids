  script: Latn
  content: "   In transport networks, there are requirements where reverse\n   unidirectional
    LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same\n   path as its forward unidirectional
    LSP.  This document describes how\n   RSVP Extended ASSOCIATION Object can be
    used to bind two co-routed\n   point-to-point unidirectional LSPs into an associated
    co-routed\n   bidirectional LSP in single-sided provisioning case.  The RSVP\n
    \  REVERSE_LSP Object is used to enable an endpoint to trigger creation\n   of
    the reverse LSP along the same path as the forward LSP.\n   Fast-reroute procedures
    to ensure that the traffic flows on the co-\n   routed path after a failure event
    are also described.\n\n\n\t "

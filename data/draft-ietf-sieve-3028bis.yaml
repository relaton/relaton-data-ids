  content: "This document describes a language for filtering email messages at time
    of final delivery.  It is designed to be implementable on either a mail client
    or mail server.  It is meant to be extensible, simple, and independent of access
    protocol, mail architecture, and operating system.  It is suitable for running
    on a mail server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs,
    such as on black box Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) servers, as the base
    language has no variables, loops, or ability to shell out to external programs.

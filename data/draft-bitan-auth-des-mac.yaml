  content: "This draft describes the use of the DES-MAC algorithm [Kaufman95] as\n
    \      an authentication  mechanism within the revised IPSEC Encapsulating\nSecurity
    \ Payload [ESP] and the revised IPSEC Authentication Header [AH]. DES-MAC[Kaufman95]
    is based on the DES encryption algorithm [FIPS-46, FIPS-46-1, FIPS-74, FIPS-81].\n
    \        \nFurther information on the other components necessary for ESP \nand
    AH implementations is provided by [Thayer97a].\n\t "

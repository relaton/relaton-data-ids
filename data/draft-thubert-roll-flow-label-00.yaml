  content: "   In a Low Power Lossy Network, the traditional tuple of source,\n   destination
    and ports might not be the proper indication to isolate a\n   meaningful flow.
    \ For instance, it can be a requirement for the\n   aggregation of related measurements
    from multiple sources to be\n   treated as a single flow following a same path
    in order to experience\n   similar jitter and latency.  In that case, the Flow
    Label in packets\n   outgoing a RPL domain could and sometimes should be set by
    the root\n   of the RPL structure.  It derives that the Flow Label could be reused\n
    \  inside the RPL domain.  This document present how the Flow Label can\n   be
    used inside a LLN as a replacement to the RPL option and provides\n   rules for
    the root to set and reset the Flow Label when forwarding\n   between the inside
    of RPL domain and the larger Internet, in both\n   direction.\n\n\t "

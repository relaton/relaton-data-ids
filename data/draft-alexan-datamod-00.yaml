  content: "   This draft presents a framework document for modeling network\n   elements
    (NE), facilities, lines, protocols and services for\n   substantially easing development
    and operation of element manager\n   systems (EMS), network management systems
    (NMS) and operations\n   support systems (OSS).  The framework is independent
    of the access\n   method used, including SNMP, CLI, Netconf, Corba, CMIP, XML-RPC,\n
    \  etc.)  It covers configuration, alarms, current-historical\n   performance,
    accounting management and security.  The frameworks\n   builds on and reuses the
    existing base of MIBs.  The documents\n   presents a light-weight, structured
    and very simplified framework and\n   method to data modeling for defining and
    maintaining meta models,\n   device etc. models, and device etc. descriptors.\n\t "

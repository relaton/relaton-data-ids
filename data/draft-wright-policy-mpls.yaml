  content: "This memo provides a brief overview of MPLS networks and policy-\nbased
    network architectures. It proposes that MPLS networks be\nPolicy-Enabled in order
    to facilitate easier administration. To\nfacilitate further discussion, an Intra-net
    example of a policy-\nbased MPLS network architecture is described. Example policies\napplicable
    to the MPLS network are discussed.  A scenario of\noperation example is provided
    to illustrate some of the dynamics\nassociated with Policy-Enabled MPLS networks.\n\n\t "

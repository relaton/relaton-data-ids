  content: "This memo describes a new namespace, the Host Identity namespace, and\n
    \  a new protocol layer, the Host Identity Protocol, between the\n   internetworking
    and transport layers.  Herein are presented the\n   basics of the current namespaces,
    their strengths and weaknesses, and\n   how a new namespace will add completeness
    to them.  The roles of this\n   new namespace in the protocols are defined.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 4423 and addresses the concerns raised by\n   the
    IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates\n   lessons learned
    from the implementations of RFC 5201.\n\t "

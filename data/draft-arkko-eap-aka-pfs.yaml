  content: "   Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations\n
    \  associated with pervasive surveillance.  Some of the reported attacks\n   involved
    compromising smart cards, such as attacking SIM card\n   manufacturers and operators
    in an effort to compromise shared secrets\n   stored on these cards.  Since the
    publication of those reports,\n   manufacturing and provisioning processes have
    gained much scrutiny\n   and have improved.  However, the danger of resourceful
    attackers for\n   these systems is still a concern.\n\n   This specification is
    an optional extension to the EAP-AKA'\n   authentication method which was defined
    in RFC 5448 (to be superseded\n   by draft-ietf-emu-rfc5448bis).  The extension,
    when negotiated,\n   provides Perfect Forward Secrecy for the session key generated
    as a\n   part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.  This prevents an\n   attacker
    who has gained access to the long-term pre-shared secret in\n   a SIM card from
    being able to decrypt all past communications.  In\n   addition, if the attacker
    stays merely a passive eavesdropper, the\n   extension prevents attacks against
    future sessions.  This forces\n   attackers to use active attacks instead.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes Internet 2.0, an AI-native extension of the
    traditional web architecture. Unlike the current internet—which is designed primarily
    for document retrieval—Internet 2.0 enables distributed model discovery, intent-based
    routing, and protocol-level AI interaction. Core components include HTTP+AI, an
    AI-aware extension to HTTP; the Model Resolution Network (MRN), an AI-native analogue
    to DNS; and the AI-Aware Browser, a new class of client optimized for intelligent
    interaction rather than document traversal. This architecture treats AI models
    as first-class network entities and provides a foundation for a decentralized,
    semantic, and privacy- preserving AI layer on the internet.</p>"

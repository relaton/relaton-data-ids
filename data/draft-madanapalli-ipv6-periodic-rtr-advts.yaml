  content: "   Periodic IPv6 router advertisements are a concern in mobile and\n   cellular
    networks in which the hosts are attached to the network and\n   access router
    but switch state to dormant mode in order to conserve\n   battery power.  In addition
    the air interface is a resource that\n   should be used optimally and hence periodic
    router advertisements\n   that an access router would send should be limited.
    \ Transmission of\n   Periodic router advertisements to hosts on a link by a router
    should\n   be optional.  At the very least the interval between such router\n
    \  advertisements should be configurable to a value that is\n   significantly
    higher than currently specified.  This document\n   provides a recommendation
    for the periodic router advertisement\n   interval (MaxRtrAdvInterval) and router
    lifetime.\n\t "

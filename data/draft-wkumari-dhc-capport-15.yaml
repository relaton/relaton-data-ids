  content: "   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access\n
    \  (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n   captive
    portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do\n   until the customer
    has authenticated.\n\n   This document describes a DHCP option (and a RA extension)
    to inform\n   clients that they are behind some sort of captive portal device,
    and\n   that they will need to authenticate to get Internet Access.  It is\n   not
    a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may\n   have with captive
    portals; it is designed to be used in larger\n   solutions.  The method of authenticating
    to, and interacting with the\n   captive portal is out of scope of this document.\n\n

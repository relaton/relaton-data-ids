  content: "   This memo introduces an architecture, called IP-ERN, which allows\n
    \  Explicit Rate Notification (ERN) protocols to be inter-operable with\n   current
    IP-based networks.  IP-ERN is based on the execution of both\n   End-to-End (E2E)
    and ERN protocols at the end hosts.  The resulting\n   E2E-ERN protocol provides
    inter and intra protocol fairness and\n   benefits from all ERN advantages when
    possible.  We detail the\n   principle of this novel architecture, which is compliant
    with every\n   TCP feature, as well as IP-in-IP tunneling solutions.  In particular,\n
    \  IP-ERN is an alternative to splitting Performance Enhancement\n   Proxies.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes an algorithm for deterministically generating\n
    \  parameters for elliptic curves over prime fields offering high\n   practical
    security in cryptographic applications, including Transport\n   Layer Security
    (TLS) and X.509 certificates.  It also specifies a\n   specific curve at the ~128-bit
    security level.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document briefly outlines current approaches to indexing and searching,
    proposes some experimental mechanisms which might be deployed within HTTP [1]
    in support of these activities, and concludes with a discussion of the issues
    raised.                                           The key features which are seen
    as desirable are a standardized way of providing a local search capability on
    the information being made available by an HTTP server, and a way of reducing
    both the bandwidth consumed by indexing agents and the amount of work done by
    HTTP servers during the indexing process.\n\t "

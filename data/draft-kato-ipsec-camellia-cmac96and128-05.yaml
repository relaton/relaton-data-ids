  content: "This memo specifies two new algorithms for IPsec.  One is the usage\nof
    Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) with the Camellia\nblock cipher
    as an authentication mechanism in the IPsec\nEncapsulating Security Payload and
    Authentication Header protocols.\nThis algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-96.  The
    other algorithm is a\npseudo-random function (PRF) based on CMAC with the Camellia
    block\ncipher for the Internet Key Exchange, version 2.  This algorithm is\ncalled
    Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted

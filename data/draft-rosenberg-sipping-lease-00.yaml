  content: "Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require\na
    user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used\nby anyone
    on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA\ninstance.  An example of
    such an application is call transfer, based\non the REFER method.  To date, a
    variety of techniques have been\nproposed for the contruction of such URI.  All
    of them have fatal\ndrawbacks.  This document proposes that the problem is actually
    one\nof URI leasing - a feature whereby a UA can dynamically request the\ncreation
    of an address-of-record (AOR) within a domain.  Requirements\nfor a URI leasing
    mechanism are outlined.\n\n\t "

  content: "Spam, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk, is\nlikely
    to become a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks.  A\nnumber of solutions
    have been proposed for dealing with Spam for\nInternet Telephony (SPIT) and unwanted
    communication, such as content\nfiltering, black lists, white lists, consent-based
    communication,\nreputation systems, address obfuscation, limited use addresses,\nturing
    tests, computational puzzles, payments at risk, circles of\ntrust, and many others.\n\nThis
    document describes the big picture that illustrates how the\ndifferent building
    blocks fit together and can be deployed\nincrementally.\n\t "

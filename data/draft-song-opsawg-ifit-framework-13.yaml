  content: "   As networks increase in scale and network operations become more\n
    \  sophisticated, traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance\n   (OAM)
    methods, which include proactive and reactive techniques,\n   running in active
    and passive modes, are no longer sufficient to meet\n   the monitoring and measurement
    requirements.  Emerging on-path\n   telemetry techniques which provide high-precision
    flow insight and\n   real-time issue notification are required to ensure suitable
    quality\n   of experience for users and applications, and identify faults or\n
    \  network deficiencies before they become critical.\n\n   This document outlines
    a high-level framework to provide an\n   operational environment that utilizes
    existing and emerging on-path\n   telemetry techniques to enable the collection
    and correlation of\n   performance information from the network.  The framework
    identifies\n   the components that are needed to coordinate the existing protocol\n
    \  tools and telemetry mechanisms, and addresses key deployment\n   challenges
    for flow-oriented on-path telemetry techniques, especially\n   in carrier networks.\n\n
    \  The framework is informational and intended to guide system designers\n   attempting
    to use the referenced techniques as well as to motivate\n   further work to enhance
    the ecosystem .\n\n\t "

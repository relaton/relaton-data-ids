  content: "   In virtual network, the VSwitch become an important element in the\n
    \  network. It is in charge for both forward management and virtual\n   network
    function. We figure out that to evaluate the performance of\n   VSwitch is not
    like the test on hardware (like using RFC2544). This\n   draft introduce the gap
    of testing for virtual network performance.\n   On chapter 2 we introduce the
    test practices which is the virtual\n   test bad setup and benchmark test. On
    chapter three, we analysis the\n   gap of virtual network performance test.\n\n\t "

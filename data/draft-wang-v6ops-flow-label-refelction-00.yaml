abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   IPv6 Flow Label field in IPv6 packet header is designed to\n   differentiate
    the various traffic flow session within network.\n   Current related RFCs(RFC
    6437 and RFC 6438 etc.)describe the IPv6\n   Flow Label generation recommendation
    and usage in network traffic\n   load balance. But all of these documents focus
    mainly how the packet\n   source forms the value of this field and how the forwarder
    in-path\n   treats it. None of the existing documents describes the relation\n
    \  between the flow label from source nodes and its corresponding value\n   in
    return packet. This draft describes the requirements for flow\n   label reflection
    between the upstream session and the corresponding\n   downstream session, the
    benefit of this mirroring mechanism and its\n   influence to the current proposed
    IPv6 flow label usage. This\n   mechanism is unique to IPv6, and should be exploited
    to promote the\n   deployment of IPv6 technology in more rapid pace.\n\n\t "

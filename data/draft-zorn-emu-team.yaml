  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for\nmultiple
    authentication methods.  This document defines the Tunneled\nExtensible Authentication
    Method (TEAM), which provides an encrypted\nand authenticated tunnel based on
    transport layer security (TLS) that\nencapsulates EAP authentication mechanisms.
    \ TEAM uses TLS to protect\nagainst rogue authenticators, protect against various
    attacks on the\nconfidentiality and integrity of the inner EAP method exchange
    and\nprovide EAP peer identity privacy.  TEAM also provides support for\nchaining
    multiple EAP mechanisms, cryptographic binding between\nauthentications performed
    by inner EAP mechanisms and the tunnel,\nexchange of arbitrary parameters (TLVs),
    and fragmentation and\nreassembly.\n\t "

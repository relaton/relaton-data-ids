  content: "The General Switch Management Protocol [1], [2] allows low level\n  control
    of a label switch. A model for the provision of quality of\n  service must be
    established in order that GSMP can control the\n  capabilities of a label switch
    to provide connections with\n  specified quality of service. This memo presents
    some\n  considerations surrounding the provision of QoS in such an open\n  switch
    control scenario. This discussion leads to a proposal for a\n  service oriented
    QoS model for GSMP. The memo also presents\n  proposed extensions to GSMP to allow
    control of a switch using the\n  Service Model.\n\t "

  content: "   The IETF and the RFC series are trusted names, for producing high\n
    \  quality technical documents that make the Internet work better.\n\n   While
    the success of our documents is variable, many of them are\n   widely used over
    a long time period.\n\n   As norms in the outside world change, our documents
    need to remain\n   relevant and accessible to future generations of those working
    on the\n   internet, everywhere in the world.\n\n   This longevity of our documents,
    and the impossibility of predicting\n   the future, implies that we should be
    conservative in the language\n   that we send.  Effective language expresses our
    intent with clarity,\n   and without distraction.\n\n   This document describes
    a glossary for increasing awareness of terms\n   which are going to be clear and
    effective without turning readers\n   away, to enable our mission of making the
    Internet work better.\n\n\t "

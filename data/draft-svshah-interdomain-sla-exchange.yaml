- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Network administrators typically provision QoS policies for their\n
    \  application traffic (such as voice, video) based on SLAs negotiated\n   with
    their providers, and translate those SLAs to vendor specific\n   configuration
    language.  Both learning of SLA, either thru SLA\n   documents or via some other
    out-of-band method, and translating them\n   to vendor specific configuration
    language is a complex, many times\n   manual, process and prone to errors.  This
    document proposes an in-\n   band method of SLA signaling which can help to simplify
    some of the\n   complexities.\n\n   This document defines an operational transitive
    attribute to signal\n   SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries
    (considered as\n   Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up some of
    the\n   complex tasks.\n\n   Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is
    explicitly defined\n   in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited
    to this\n   use-case only.\n\n\t "

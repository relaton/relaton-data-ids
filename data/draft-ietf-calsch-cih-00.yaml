  script: Latn
  content: "Calendaring Interoperability over HTTP (CIH) is a technique for exchanging
    calendaring information between scheduling systems using the Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). This allows users to schedule meetings with anyone else, no matter
    what scheduling software they use.                  This document is a tentative
    exploration of whether CIH is feasible and what the pros and cons are relative
    to a brand new protocol like the Calendaring Interoperability Protocol (CIP).
    The primary benefit of CIH over CIP and motivation for this project is that we
    avoid implementing a whole new protocol, such as writing and debugging the protocol,
    convincing vendors to write new code to support it, and then convincing users
    to deploy it.\n\t "

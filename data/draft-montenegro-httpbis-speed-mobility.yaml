  content: "   This document describes \"HTTP Speed+Mobility,\" a proposal for HTTP\n
    \  2.0 that emphasizes performance improvements and security while at\n   the
    same time accounting for the important needs of mobile devices\n   and applications.
    \ The proposal starts from both the Google SPDY\n   protocol and the work the
    IETF has done around WebSockets.  The\n   proposal is not a final product but
    rather is intended to form a\n   baseline for working group discussion.\n\n\t "

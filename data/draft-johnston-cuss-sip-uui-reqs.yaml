  content: "This document introduces the transport of call control related User\nto
    User Information (UUI) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),\nand develops
    several requirements for a new SIP mechanism.  Some SIP\nsessions are established
    by or related to a non-SIP application.\nThis application may have information
    that needs to be transported\nbetween the SIP User Agents during session establishment.
    \ A common\nexample in another protocol is the ITU-T Q.931 User to User\nInformation
    Service.  As networks move to SIP it is important that\napplications requiring
    this data can continue to function in SIP\nnetworks as well as the ability to
    interwork with this ISDN service\nfor end-to-end transparency.  This document
    discusses requirements\nand approaches.  This extension will also be used for
    native SIP\nendpoints implementing similar services and interworking with ISDN\nservices.
    \ Example use cases include an exchange between two user\nagents, retargeting
    by a proxy, and redirection.  An example\napplication is an Automatic Call Distributor
    (ACD) in a contact\ncenter.\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides a mechanism to address issues that arise when\n
    \  TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where the\n   sending
    rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion\n   window.  It
    provides an experimental update to TCP that allows a TCP\n   sender to restart
    quickly following a rate-limited interval.  This\n   method is expected to benefit
    applications that send rate-limited\n   traffic using TCP, while also providing
    an appropriate response if\n   congestion is experienced.\n\n   It also evaluates
    the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion\n   Window Validation, CWV, defined
    in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC\n   2861 sought to address important issues,
    but failed to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This document therefore recommends
    that the\n   status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental to Historic, and that\n
    \  it is replaced by the current specification.\n\n\t "

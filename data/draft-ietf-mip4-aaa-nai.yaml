  content: "When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks, it has to be re-authenticated.
    \ If the home network has both multiple Authentication Authorization and Accounting
    (AAA) servers and Home Agents (HAs) in use, the Home AAA server may not have sufficient
    information to process the re-authentication correctly (i.e., to ensure that the
    same HA continues to be used).  This document defines a Mobile IP extension that
    carries identities for the Home AAA and HA servers in the form of Network Access
    Identifiers (NAIs).  The extension allows a Home Agent to pass its identity (and
    that of the Home AAA server) to the mobile node, which can then pass it on to
    the local AAA server when changing its point of attachment.  This extension may
    also be used in other situations requiring communication of a NAI between Mobile
    IP nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

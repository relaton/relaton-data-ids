  content: "   The StealthFlow Protocol (SFP) is a low-observability, stateless\n
    \  pre-authentication and transport armor mechanism designed to precede\n   existing
    TLS or QUIC sessions.  SFP aims to reduce handshake\n   fingerprinting, limit
    asymmetric denial-of-service amplification,\n   and minimize early plaintext metadata
    exposure, while preserving\n   compatibility with the existing PKI and TLS ecosystems.\n\n
    \  SFP does not replace TLS or QUIC.  Instead, it provides an optional\n   single-round
    pre-filtering and authentication layer that enables\n   servers to reject illegitimate
    traffic with minimal computational\n   cost and minimal network observability.\n\n
    \  This document supersedes the prior informal specification known as\n   draft-eli-z-protocol-00.\n\n\t "

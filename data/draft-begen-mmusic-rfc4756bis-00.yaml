  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) supports grouping media lines.\nSDP
    also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source and\nForward Error
    Correction (FEC)-based repair flows.  However, the\nsemantics that were defined
    in RFC 4756 generally fail to provide the\nspecific grouping relationships between
    the source and repair flows\nwhen there are more than one source and/or repair
    flows in the same\ngroup.  Furthermore, the existing semantics also do not support\nadditive
    repair flows and prioritization among the repair flows\nprotecting one or more
    source flows.  This document addresses these\nissues by introducing new FEC grouping
    semantics.\n\t "

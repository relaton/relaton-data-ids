  content: "   In framework of future 6G the need for easy and secure connectivity\n
    \  between a great amount of small devices as sensors and household\n   appliances
    will be essential.  Such massive Internet of Things (mIoT)\n   requires authentication
    methods which are reliable also in case of\n   vulnerable wireless links and work
    for simple cheap (dumb) devices.\n\n   Aim of this document is to lay ground for
    the need for new\n   authentication models and admission methods in the framework
    of\n   devices (e.g., machines in IoT communication) within a (wireless or\n   wireline-based)
    network.\n\n   Simple devices may only have a minimum amount of physical interfaces\n
    \  available.  As an example for establishing an out-of-band channel for\n   exchange
    of authentication material radio sensing technology may\n   serve.  This is currently
    under investigation for Wireless LAN and\n   upcoming cellular radio at both IEEE
    and 3GPP.\n\n\t "

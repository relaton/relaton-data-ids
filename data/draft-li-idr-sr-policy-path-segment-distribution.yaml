  content: "   An SR policy is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more\n
    \  segment lists with necessary path attributes.  For each SR path, it\n   may
    also have its own path attributes, and Path Segment is one of\n   them.  A Path
    Segment is defined to identify an SR path, which can be\n   used for performance
    measurement, path correlation, and end-2-end\n   path protection.  Path Segment
    can be also used to correlate two\n   unidirctional SR paths into a bidirectional
    SR path which is required\n   in some scenarios, for example, mobile backhaul
    transport network.\n\n   This document defines extensions to BGP to distribute
    SR policies\n   carrying Path Segment and bidirectional path information.\n\n\n\t "

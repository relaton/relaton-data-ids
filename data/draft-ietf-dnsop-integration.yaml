abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes considerations when integrating a DNS domain
    name into an application environment. Goals of this document include minimizing
    conflicts between the global DNS and applications that integrate with the global
    DNS, providing a consistent user experience (unique identifier across environments),
    and extending the security, stability, and resiliency of the global DNS. While
    all sources of potential concern cannot be enumerated in one document, accounting
    for at least the considerations discussed here should improve the security posture
    of both the global DNS and integrating applications.</p>"

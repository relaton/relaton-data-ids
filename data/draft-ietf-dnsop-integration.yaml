  content: "   This document describes considerations when integrating a DNS domain\n
    \  name into an application environment.  Goals of this document include\n   minimizing
    conflicts between the global DNS and applications that\n   integrate with the
    global DNS, providing a consistent user experience\n   (unique identifier across
    environments), and extending the security,\n   stability, and resiliency of the
    global DNS.  While all sources of\n   potential concern cannot be enumerated in
    one document, accounting\n   for at least the considerations discussed here should
    improve the\n   security posture of both the global DNS and integrating applications.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo discusses SNMP security protocols insofar as it presents a threat
    analysis and enumeration of goals.  However, its main purpose is to discuss two
    SNMP security algorithms.  First, under the rubric ``Understanding SNMP Security,''
    it describes the design of the algorithms with an emphasis on how their various
    mechanisms collectively realize the design goals and constraints; second, under
    the rubric ``Using SNMP Security,'' it also describes how SNMP security services
    are best exploited to realize effective, secure network management in a variety
    of configurations and environments.\n\t "

  content: "This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service whereby an SMTP client
    and server may negotiate the use of a command streaming implementation model for
    SMTP.  This model enables the batching of the all commands between the EHLO and
    DATA command.  This extension significantly reduces the number of packets and
    round trips to send a message.  Batching the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands for
    multiple receipients significantly decreases the protocol processing overhead
    when sending messsages to multiple receipients.\n\t "

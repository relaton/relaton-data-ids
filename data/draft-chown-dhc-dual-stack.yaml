  content: "   A node may have support for communications using IPv4 and/or IPv6\n
    \  protocols.  Such a node may wish to obtain IPv4 and/or IPv6\n   configuration
    settings via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n   (DHCP).   The original
    version of DHCP [1] designed for IPv4 has now\n   been complemented by a new DHCPv6
    [4] for IPv6. This document\n   describes issues identified with dual IP version
    DHCP interactions.\n\t "

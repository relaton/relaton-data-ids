  content: "   ACME is a critical protocol for accelerating HTTPS adoption on the\n
    \  Internet, automating digital certificate issuing for web servers.\n   Because
    RFC 8555 assumes that both sides (client and server) support\n   the primary cryptographic
    algorithms necessary for the certificate,\n   ACME does not include algorithm
    negotiation procedures.  However, in\n   light of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC),
    many signature algorithm\n   alternatives can be used, allowing for different
    trade-offs (e.g.,\n   signature vs. public key size).  In addition, alternative
    PQC\n   migration strategies exist, such as KEMTLS, which employs KEM public\n
    \  keys for authentication.  This document describes an algorithm\n   negotiation
    mechanism for ACME.  The negotiation allows different\n   strategies and provides
    KEMTLS certificate issuing capabilities.\n\n\t "

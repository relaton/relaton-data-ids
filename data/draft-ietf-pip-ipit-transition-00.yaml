  content: "This document outlines a transition scheme for moving from IP to Pip.
    While this document discusses Pip in particular, it could be applied to any IPng.
    \ The transition scheme discussed here is called IPIT, for IP Independent Transition.
    \ It has been developed to address problems with the IPAE transition scheme, after
    which the previous Pip transition scheme was based.                                                                 The
    shortcomings of IPAE stem from its reliance on IP addresses during the first phases
    of transition.   The result is that IP-only hosts will not be able to talk globally
    to IPng hosts after IP addresses have depleted (they will only be able to talk
    intra-domain).  IPIT allows new Pip systems to talk to IP systems without a globally
    unique IP address.  As a result, IP address depletion is less likely with IPIT,
    and IP-only hosts will be able to talk to Pip hosts forever.  In this sense, IPIT
    is as much a co-existence scheme as it is a transition scheme.\n\t "

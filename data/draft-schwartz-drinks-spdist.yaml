  content: "   This document defines a protocol for distributing session\n   establishment
    data from often centralized Session Data Registries or\n   SIP Service Provider
    data stores into local data repositories for\n   local querying of the data.  The
    distributed data is typically used\n   by various network elements for session
    peering.\n\n   This document describes the Session Peering Distribution Protocol\n
    \  (SPDP) that should be seen as an extension to the session peering\n   provisioning
    protocol defining the provisioning process itself.  The\n   document provides
    a set of guiding principles for the design of this\n   protocol including an extension
    of the SPPP basic data model for\n   distribution purposes and an associated extension
    XML Schema\n   Document.\n\n\t "

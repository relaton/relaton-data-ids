  content: "A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and\nan
    IPsec security association with its home agent before it can start\nutilizing
    Mobile IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of\nthese parameters
    are statically configured.  Ongoing work aims to\nmake this information dynamically
    available to the mobile node.  An\nimportant aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping
    solution is to\nsupport interworking with the existing authentication, authorization\nand
    accounting infrastructure.  This document defines new attributes\nthat facilitate
    Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping via a RADIUS\ninfrastructure.  This information exchange
    may take place as part of\nthe initial network access authentication procedure
    or as part of a\nseparate protocol exchange between the mobile node, the home
    agent\nand the AAA infrastructure.\n\t "

  content: "In some network topologies, it is preferred to have a trusted network\nelement
    between the DHCP client and the L3 relay agent that adds the\nDHCP relay-agent-information
    option but does not set the giaddr\nfield.  They operate in Layer 2 mode and hence
    act as trusted Layer 2\nrelay agents.  The replies from the server are broadcasted
    by the L3\nrelay agents to these L2 relay agents which must be avoided.  This\ndocument
    defines a new sub-option for the relay-agent-information\noption.  With this sub-option,
    the L3 relay agent will always unicast\nthe messages towards the trusted layer
    2 DHCP relay agent with a\nhardware address that is known in the network.  The
    new sub-option is\ncalled the \"unicast-address\" sub-option.\n\n\t "

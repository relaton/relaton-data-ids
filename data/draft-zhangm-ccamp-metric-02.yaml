  content: "   As one of the requirements of link state based routing protocols such\n
    \  as OSPF, link state update packets are intervally or reactively\n   disseminate
    in the network in order to keep the information of\n   topology and links resource
    synchronized at each control node.\n   Considering large scale networks, massive
    messages are flooded in the\n   control plane of General Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) based\n   multi-area networks.  The convergence time of link
    state based\n   routing protocols will have a significant impact on the performance\n
    \  of the networks.  So measuring and analyzing the convergence time of\n   information
    flooding in multi-areas becomes very important.  This\n   document provides suggestions
    for measuring OSPF multi-area control\n   plane convergence.  A performance metric
    of convergence time of\n   information flooding is proposed to characterize the
    ability of\n   information synchronization in multi-area networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Email address forgery is a problem on the Internet today.  Domain\n
    \  owners want to control the use of their names in email, but are\n   helpless
    because they lack the means.  This document introduces a\n   language for domains
    to make email-related declarations in DNS.  It\n   defines in detail one possible
    sender authentication scheme for\n   domains to describe the hosts from which
    they send mail.  SMTP\n   receivers can use this scheme to detect sender forgery.\n\t "

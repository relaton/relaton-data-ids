- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a multicast solution which provides adaptive\n
    \  stateless traffic engineering along an explicit P2MP path/tree.  Each\n   portion
    of the tree is encoded by a most efficient encoding method.\n   A tree portion
    includes all or some of the links/branches/subtrees\n   from any number of nodes
    on the tree.  An IPv6 extension header is\n   used to encapsulate a packet which
    is to be multicast at the ingress.\n   The overhead of the encapsulated packet
    is minimal.  The packet is\n   delivered to the egresses along the tree.  There
    is no state stored\n   in the core of the network.\n\n\n\n\t "

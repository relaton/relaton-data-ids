  content: "   This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries in\n
    \  Real-Time Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as\n   Session
    Border Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT\n   Traversal (HNT).  HNT
    is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying\n   and latching, that such intermediaries
    use to enable other RTC\n   devices behind NATs to communicate with each other.\n\n
    \  This document is non-normative, and is only written to explain HNT in\n   order
    to provide a reference to the IETF community, as well as an\n   informative description
    to manufacturers, and users.\n\n   Latching, which is one of the components of
    the HNT components, has a\n   number of security issues covered here.  Because
    of those, and unless\n   all security considerations explained here are taken
    into account and\n   solved, the IETF advises against use of this mechanism over
    the\n   Internet and recommends other solutions such as the Interactive\n   Connectivity
    Establishment (ICE) protocol.\n\n\t "

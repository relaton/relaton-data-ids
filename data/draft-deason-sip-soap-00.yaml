  content: "This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP) [1] . The purpose of this extension is to provide\nan extremely generic
    and extensible framework through which SIP\nnodes can request additional services
    from remote nodes. Examples of\nsuch nodes include SIP Network Servers, SIP User
    Agents, SIP/PSTN\nGateways, SIP/H.323 Gateways and SIP Enabled Application Service\nBrokers.
    It also a candidate for providing a remote procedure call\nmechanism for Call
    Processing Language (CPL) scripts [2] .\nThis proposal is based upon a new SIP
    method, called SERVICE. The\nSERVICE method can carry a Simple Object Access Protocol
    (SOAP) [3]\nmessage as it's payload. SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange\nof
    information in a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAP\ndefines a framework
    for encoding request and response messages in\nXML. Typically SOAP uses HTTP as
    a transport protocol but this\nproposal enables SIP to be used instead.\n\n\t "

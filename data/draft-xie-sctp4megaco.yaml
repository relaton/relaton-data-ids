  content: "This document discusses the use of the Simple Control Transmission \nProtocol
    (SCTP) [1], for carrying MEGACO [2] messages between an MGC \nand an MG. SCTP
    is currently being developed by IETF SIGTRAN Working \nGroup. The framework architecture
    defined in RFC 2719 [3] can be used \nas a guideline for transporting MEGACO messages
    using SCTP.\n\nMEGACO implementations targeting for high capacity and high \navailability
    deployment can especially benefit from the stream \ncapability, redundant network
    support, congestion avoidance, and \nstrong security features provided by SCTP.\n\t "

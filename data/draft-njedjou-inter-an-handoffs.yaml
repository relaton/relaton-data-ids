  content: "In the near future, multi-interfaces Mobile Nodes will be used for \nconnecting
    to the Internet by way of a multitude of Radio Access \nNetworks including 802.11
    based WLANs, GPRS, CDMA2000 and 3G based \ncellular networks. Ensuring the non-disrupted
    flow of real-time \napplications data, as well as adhering to subscribed service
    profiles \nwhile the Mobile Node moves between Access Networks of different \ntechnologies,
    is an issue that needs to be addressed. It is assumed \nthat a unified and external
    IP core network is used to support such a \nmultitude of Access Networks. This
    will probably be the case for a \nmobile network operator intending to benefit
    its subscribers with its \nown hot-spots broadband internet access. Consequently,
    the need \narises to define managed handoff mechanisms between heterogeneous \nattachment
    networks, while providing service continuity to the Mobile \nNode. \nAs such,
    information necessary for the Mobile Node to performing a \njudicious handoff
    across Wireless Access Networks, will have to be \ngathered from the involved
    Access Networks, transferred across the IP \nnetwork that interconnects them,
    to the operators home network. \nThis document discusses the desirability of a
    network controlled \nhandoff process for optimizing inter-Access Network Mobile
    Node \nmobility. The approach presented provides the means for the operator \nhome
    network to achieve the best possible selection of the Mobile \nNode target Access
    Network for handoff, on the basis of information \ngathered on the most relevant
    nodes. It introduces a new function \nlocated in the operator network and referred
    to as a Mobility \nManager. It also introduces the concepts for implementing such
    a \nhandoff process to make it compatible with Mobile IPv6. Other \ndocuments
    will be needed to specify the protocol structures that are \nintended for handling
    the handoff process hereafter described. \n       \n\t "

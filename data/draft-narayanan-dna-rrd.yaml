  script: Latn
  content: "   Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) requires the rapid detection of\n
    \  link identity and validation of the current IP configuration [3].\n   Even
    though acquiring the configuration for a new link is outside the\n   scope of
    DNA, mechanisms that can accomplish both DNA and collect\n   possible configuration
    information about the current link will prove\n   to be very useful in rapidly
    changing network environments.  RFC 2461\n   defines a Router Discovery (RD) procedure
    [1] to learn about the\n   available access routers on an L3 link.  RFC 2461 [1]
    also defines\n   Neighbor Discovery (ND) procedure to discover neighbors in the
    same\n   link.  This draft recommends a few simple modifications to the Router\n
    \  Discovery (RD) procedure defined by RFC 2461 [1] that can lead to\n   efficient
    Router Reachability Detection (RRD), while enabling the\n   quick learning of
    other available routers if the current router is\n   not available.\n\t "

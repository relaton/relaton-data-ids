  content: "   [draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sr-policy]The SR Candidate Path State TLV\n
    \  conveys the operational status and attributes of an SR Policy at the\n   candidate
    path level. The SR Candidate Path State is frequently\n   extended to carry new
    attributes and states for CPaths. However,\n   only a few bits remain unassigned
    in the Flags field of the current\n   implementation.\n\n   This document addresses
    the issue of insufficient flag bits in the\n   SR Candidate Path State TLV by
    defining a variable-length SR\n   Candidate Path State Extend TLV for BGP-LS SR-Policy.
    This\n   enhancement ensures scalability and flexibility in signaling\n   additional
    attributes and states for SR Policy candidate paths.\n\n\t "

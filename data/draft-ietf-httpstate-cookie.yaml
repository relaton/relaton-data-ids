  content: "This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.  These
    header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP
    user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless
    HTTP protocol.  Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade
    their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely
    used on the Internet.  This document obsoletes RFC 2965. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

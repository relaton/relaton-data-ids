  content: "A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)\n   have
    been proposed.  Some have been implemented, and some are\n   advancing toward
    standardization.  It is likely that additional\n   enhancements will be proposed
    in the future.  At present LDP has no\n   guidelines for advertising such enhancements
    at LDP session\n   initialization time.  There is also no mechanism to enable
    and\n   disable enhancements after the session is established.  This document\n
    \  provides guidelines for advertising LDP enhancements at session\n   initialization
    time.  It also defines a mechanism to enable and\n   disable enhancements after
    LDP session establishment.\n\t "

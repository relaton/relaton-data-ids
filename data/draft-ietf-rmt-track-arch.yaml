  content: "One of the protocol instantiations the RMT WG is chartered to create is
    a TRee-based ACKnowledgement protocol (TRACK).  Rather than create a set of monolithic
    protocol specifications, the RMT WG has chosen to break the reliable multicast
    protocols in to Building Blocks (BB) and Protocol \nInstantiations (PI).  A Building
    Block is a specification of the algorithms of a single component, with an abstract
    interface to other BBs and PIs.  A PI combines a set of BBs, adds in the additional
    required functionality not specified in any BB, and specifies the specific instantiation
    of the protocol. For more information, see the Reliable Multicast Transport Building
    Blocks and Reliable Multicast Design Space documents [2][3].\n\n\t "

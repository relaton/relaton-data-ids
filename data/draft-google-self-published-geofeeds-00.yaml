  content: "   This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish\n
    \  a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information,\n   colloquially
    termed a geolocation \"feed\".  Interested parties can\n   poll and parse these
    feeds to update or merge with other geolocation\n   data sources and procedures.\n\n
    \  Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one\n   conference
    location to the next have already experimentally published\n   small geolocation
    feeds.  At least one consumer (Google) has\n   incorporated these ad hoc feeds
    into a geolocation data pipeline.\n\n\t "

  content: "   DNS zone administrators occasionally need to update data published
    by\n   a parent zone, such as NS and DS records.  Traditionally these\n   updates
    have happened out-of-band: through DNS registrar interfaces,\n   EPP, websites,
    or manually by operators.  Some updates could also be\n   done using DNS Dynamic
    Update [RFC2136].\n\n   The IETF's DNSOP working group is considering proposing
    additional\n   mechanisms for such updates, possibly leveraging DNSSEC for\n   authentication.\n\n
    \  This document presents some use cases to drive this design work.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748, provides
    support for multiple authentication methods. Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides
    for mutual authentication, integrity-protected ciphersuite negotiation, and key
    exchange between two endpoints. This document defines EAP-TLS, which includes
    support for certificate-based mutual authentication and key derivation.\n\n This
    document obsoletes RFC 2716. A summary of the changes between this document and
    RFC 2716 is available in Appendix A. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

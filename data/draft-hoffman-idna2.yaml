  content: "IDNA has been a world-wide success since it was introduced over five\nyears
    ago.  However, it has some notable deficiencies, including\nbeing tied to an old
    version of the Unicode standard and needless\nrestrictions that prevented some
    languages from being used.  This\ndocument describes IDNA version 2, which rectifies
    those problems\nwhile making the fewest changes necessary to the original protocol.\n\t "

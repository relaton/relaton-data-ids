  content: "Whenever a prefix is withdrawn using BGP withdrawal mechanism, it\ntriggers
    a number of updates in certain scenarios before the prefix\nis completly withdrawn
    from the entire BGP network.  This phenomenon\nis popularly known as _path exploration_
    or _path hunting_ and occurs\nbecause of path vector property of BGP.  It results
    in a series of\nunwanted or redundant transitions that overloads the BGP network.\n\nThis
    document describes a mechanism to help limit the amount of such\npath exploration
    by defining two optional transitive path attributes\nfor BGP: SPEAKERID_PATH and
    ROOT_CAUSE.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There exists a class of modems that would benefit from supporting the\n
    \  Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] but do not present a\n   single
    Layer 2 network domain as required by DLEP.  Such devices may\n   be:\n\n   o
    \ Modems that maintain a varying link to some upstream backbone\n      network
    infrastructure, where the ability to announce link state\n      and DLEP metrics
    is desired, but the concept of a DLEP destination\n      router for the backbone
    does not apply.  Examples of such devices\n      can include LTE modems, IEEE
    802.11 stations not in ad-hoc mode,\n      and some satellite terminals.\n\n   o
    \ Modems that provide Layer 3 wide area network connectivity between\n      devices,
    where remote DLEP destinations do exist, but are not\n      directly reachable
    by MAC address, such as modems that contain\n      embedded routing functionality.\n\n
    \  This document introduces an optional extension to the core DLEP\n   specification,
    allowing DLEP to be used between routers and modems\n   that operate in this way.\n\n
    \  Note:\n\n   o  This document is intended as an extension to the core DLEP\n
    \     specification, and readers are expected to be fully conversant\n      with
    the operation of core DLEP.\n\n\t "

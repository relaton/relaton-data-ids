  content: "This memo aims to highlight specific \"residual\" threats in Mobile\nIPv6
    protocol.  We call these threats \"residual\" simply because they\nwere rightfully
    deemed not urgent during the design of Mobile IPv6\nprotocol.  However, these
    threats are somehow benefiting from new\nmechanisms and/or extensions built on
    top of Mobile IPv6 protocol to\nimprove their effects and likelihood.  Hence,
    our main goal is to\nmotivate designers to re-assess their potential taking into\nconsideration
    these new mechanisms.\n\t "

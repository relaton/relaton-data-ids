  content: "   This document describes a way to perform mobility in IPv4 \n   (potentially
    IPv6) without requiring any new entity in networks \n   infrastructure (e.g. Home
    Agent, Foreign Agent, etc.). Instead of \n   using infrastructure entities this
    method delegates all the mobility \n   function to the end nodes. The method relies
    on source and \n   destination address translation at the end nodes, and signaling
    \n   between end nodes to perform hand offs - all these function can be \n   encapsulated
    in an entity called Mobility Agent (MA) in the end \n   nodes. \n\t "

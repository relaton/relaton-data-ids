  content: "   Multipath transport is an important way to improve the efficiency of\n
    \  data delivery. This document defines a multipath transport system\n   framework
    in which application-level relays are deployed to provide\n   the conditions to
    enable multiple paths between source and\n   destination. In the proposed framework,
    endpoints are allowed to use\n   multiple paths, including the default IP path
    and relay paths, to\n   transport data in a single session. A relay path may via
    one or more\n   relays which provide application-level relay services for endpoints.\n
    \  This framework defines three kinds of logical entities including user\n   agent,
    relay server and relay controller. Relay server provides relay\n   service for
    user agents based on a local path-table. Relay controller\n   manages relay servers
    and relay paths. User agent maintains multiple\n   end-to-end paths which include
    a default path and multiple relay\n   paths. The framework also defines a relay
    service control protocol\n   named OpenPath protocol in control plane to manage
    relay paths, and a\n   profile of multipath transport protocol suite in data plane
    to\n   facilitate multipath data transport. The multipath transport system\n   framework
    can support various applications including applications\n   requiring timely delivery
    of real-time data such as streaming media,\n   and applications requiring ordered
    reliable delivery of stream of\n   data such as file transfer.\n\n\t "

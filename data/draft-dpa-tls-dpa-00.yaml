  content: "   TLS-DPA is an experimental, identity-bound security protocol inspired\n
    \  by the design of TLS 1.3 ( [RFC8446] ).  It is intended to operate\n   consistently
    across environments where conventional IP address and\n   port semantics are weak,
    unstable, or intentionally absent, including\n   zero-port transports such as
    UZP ( [UZP] ).  TLS-DPA generalises the\n   handshake so it is not tied to server-side
    listeners, binds\n   authentication to Service Identities rather than network
    coordinates,\n   reduces metadata exposure to intermediaries (including rendezvous\n
    \  nodes in UZP fabrics), provides a unified hybrid-KEM post-quantum\n   transition
    model ( [NIST-PQC] ), and supports session continuity\n   across overlay path
    changes (e.g., QUIC Connection IDs; [RFC9000] ).\n\n\t "

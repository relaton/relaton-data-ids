  content: "This memo describes TCP/IP field behavior in the context of header compression.
    \ Header compression is possible because most header fields do not vary randomly
    from packet to packet.  Many of the fields exhibit static behavior or change in
    a more or less predictable way.  When a header compression scheme is designed,
    it is of fundamental importance to understand the behavior of the fields in detail.
    \ An example of this analysis can be seen in RFC 3095.  This memo performs a similar
    role for the compression of TCP/IP headers.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

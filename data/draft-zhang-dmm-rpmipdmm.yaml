  content: "       Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based centralized mobility\n
    \      management protocol, which has many disadvantages for utilizing the\n       centralized
    anchor LMA. As networks are moving towards flat\n       architectures, a distributed
    approach is needed to PMIPv6. This\n       document defines a robust solution
    for PMIPv6-based distributed\n       mobility management which ensures the robustness
    by organizing the\n       distributed anchors (MAARs) into a Chord ring.\n\n    \n\t "

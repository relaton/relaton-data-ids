  content: "Some NAT boxes/routers allow the establishment of IPv6 tunnels from \nsystems
    in the private LAN (using private IPv4 addresses) to routers \nor tunnel servers
    in the public Internet. \nAs far as we know this is not a common way of use IPv6
    tunnels; the \nusual way is to finish the tunnel directly in a device with an
    IPv4 \npublic address. \nThis behavior provides a big opportunity to rapidly deploy
    a huge \nnumber of IPv6 nodes and networks, without the need of new transition
    \nmechanism. This option is very important to facilitate the IPv6 \ndeployment.
    \nThis document describes this behavior and provides hints that should \nbe applied
    in the NAT boxes and tunnel brokers to facilitate it.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a service affinity solution between client and
    server based on Transport Layer Security (TLS). An extension to Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) 1.3 to enable session migration. This mechanism is designed for
    modern network architectures, particularly for multi-homed servers that possess
    multiple network interfaces and IP addresses. Comparing to the existing solutions
    such as maintaining the customer- based connection status table in network devices,
    HTTP redirection and DNS redirection, this solution can avoid the waste of resources
    caused by saving a large amount of customer status data in the network devices,
    and realize the optimized scheduling of resources based on network conditions
    and computing resources in the computing- aware traffic steering scenario, so
    as to realize the reasonable operation of network resources, cloud resources and
    computing resources.</p>"

  content: "When using IPv6 within a single L2 network segment it is neccesary to\nensure
    that all routers advertising their services within it are\nvalid.  In cases where
    it is not convinient or possible to use SeND\n[1] a rogue Router Advertisement
    (RA) [2] could be sent by accident\ndue to misconfiguraton or ill intended.  Simple
    solutions for\nprotecting against rogue RAs are beneficial in complementing SeND
    in\nsecuring the L2 domain for ceratin types of devices or in certain\ntransitional
    situations.\n\nThis document proposes a solution to reduce the threat of rogue
    RAs\nby enabling layer 2 devices to forward only RAs received over\ndesignated
    ports.\n\t "

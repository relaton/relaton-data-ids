  content: "   This document introduces a use case of packets' significance\n   difference
    embedded with media scalability.  With the dominance of\n   video traffic on the
    Internet, selectively dropping packets or parts\n   of packets from competing
    media streams becomes a complementary\n   mechanism when dealing with network
    congestion.\n\n   The document describes the characteristics of media scalability,
    some\n   limitations of existing end-to-end congestion control mechanisms\n   through
    rate control and adaptation, explains why current ways of\n   entire packet dropping
    at the traffic class level using in-network\n   active queue management are not
    most appropriate to meet end users'\n   Quality of Service expectations.  The
    document identifies that there\n   exists \"significance difference\" among packets
    or even among parts of\n   the packets within a flow, and brings out a new set
    of requirements\n   for application and network to support packet significance
    difference\n   to improve the Quality of Experience of end users.\n\n\t "

  content: "Server Cache Synchronization Protocol SCSP [1], [2], [3], [4] is used\n
    \  to solve the generalized cache synchronization/cache -replication\n   problem
    for distributed protocol entities. In a client-server\n   paradigm, SCSP synchronizes
    caches (or a portion of the caches) of a\n   set of server entities of a particular
    protocol which are bound to a\n   Server Group.\n \n   This document provided
    a security analysis of the current SCSP\n   framework and identified potential
    threats to the protocol operation.\n   Possible solutions to secure the SCSP from
    potential attacks are\n   presented and discussed.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a technique for upgrading a DNS TCP\n   connection
    to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) over standard ports.\n   Encryption provided
    by DNS-over-TLS eliminates opportunities for\n   eavesdropping of DNS queries
    in the network.  The proposed mechanism\n   is backwards compatible with clients
    and servers that are not aware\n   of DNS-over-TLS.\n\n\t "

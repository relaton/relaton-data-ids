  content: "ALTO has been proposed to help peer-to-peer (P2P) applications make \n
    \  better decisions with respect to peer selection. It provides the \n   underlying
    network view for P2P users to choose the optimal resource \n   instances. The
    usage of ALTO has covered nearly all the P2P \n   applications, such as file sharing,
    media streaming, real time \n   communications and etc. In real time communication
    where the source \n   and destination are fixed, it is used to choose relays.
    \n\n   This document defines the relay usage for ALTO in real time \n   communication.
    Beside the relay for NAT traversal mentioned before, \n   this document introduce
    a relay called Qos relay to improve the \n   performance. After analyzing the
    necessity of this type of relay and \n   the benefits of combining ALTO with relay,
    two models of combination \n   are described according to the coupling tightness
    between ALTO and \n   relay service. One is called \"integrating relay service
    into alto \n   service\" and the other is \"cooperation between P2P application
    \n   provider and ISP\". In all, the usage of ALTO in real time \n   communication
    has been developed in this document.\n\n\t "

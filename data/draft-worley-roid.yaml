  content: "   Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the\n
    \  Internet infrastructure to access data by unique names.  ROID\n   (\"Resolver
    for OIDs\") is an experimental protocol to support simple\n   implementation of
    ICN.  ROID defines a simple model for mapping data\n   names -- in the form of
    URNs of the \"oid\" scheme -- into URLs which\n   can be used to access the data
    objects.  This experimental version of\n   ROID provides the resolution information
    via DNS records that can be\n   served by a standard DNS server (named a/k/a Bind).
    \ This structure\n   is designed for easy deployment of ROID in existing environments
    in\n   order to support proof-of-concept implementations of ICN.\n\n\t "

  content: "   As important security devices, firewalls are widely deployed in ISP\n
    \  and enterprise networks. However, currently firewalls, which are\n   essentially
    designed for fixed networks, are difficult to support\n   Mobile IPv6. Unless
    firewalls are aware of the detail of mobile IPv6\n   protocol, they impacts smooth
    operation of the protocol and can be\n   harmful to mobile IPv6 deployment.\n\n
    \  This internet draft intends to show some ideas to solve the problems\n   on
    mobile IPv6 firewall traversal. The solutions proposed are not an\n   overall
    solution to fix all the traversal problems.\n\n\t "

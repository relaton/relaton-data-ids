  content: "   Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a \n
    \  consequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has \n   been
    developed and is currently being deployed.  RFC 3471 [RFC3471] \n   has defined
    that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) \"only has \n   significance between
    two neighbors\".  However, in a network composed \n   of a new generation of lambda
    switch-capable equipment, this document \n   explains new models that require
    standardization of the label.  It \n   highlights new operator requirements and
    describes signaling \n   extensions to satisfy those requirements. \n\n   This
    document is a companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label \n   Switching
    (GMPLS) signaling.  It defines the Label Switching Capable \n   (LSC) technology
    specific information needed when using GMPLS.  \n\n\t "

  content: "The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet
    hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not
    require modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet,
    i.e., its routers.  In the current Internet, however, many devices other than
    routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These
    \"middleboxes\" are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the
    standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination
    hosts.  Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others
    can affect some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication
    impossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication
    across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network
    address translators and firewalls.  It identifies and discusses issues in the
    current HIP specifications that affect communication across these types of middleboxes.
    \ This document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft introduces PSN independent overlay network (PION)\n   architecture
    for intra- and inter-datacenter (DC) connections.  The\n   motivations, protocol
    layers, applications, and etc, for PION are\n   also discussed.  PION provides
    a virtualized underlying-PSN-\n   independent network in order to maximize the
    reuse of IETF protocol\n   definitions and implementations.  The inter- and intra-DC
    connection\n   provided by PION could be from endpoint to endpoint, or endpoint
    to\n   network, or network to network.  The packet transport capabilities\n   provided
    by the overlay network are determined by the capability of\n   the underlying
    PSN.\n\n\t "

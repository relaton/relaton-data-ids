  content: "   Given the ever-increasing importance of configuration tasks for the
    \n   provisioning of a wide range of IP resources, networks, and services \n   in
    today's Internet, this draft aims at listing the basic \n   requirements that
    should drive the specification of a protocol to \n   convey configuration information
    towards network devices. This memo \n   doesn't aim at listing candidate protocols
    to convey such \n   information, nor at choosing one of these. This draft basically
    \n   describes a whole set of issues a service provider has to deal with, \n   hence
    a list of requirements to better address such issues.  \n    \n\t "

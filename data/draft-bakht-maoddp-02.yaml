  content: "Wireless Sensors networks (WSNs) are type of wireless ad-hoc \nnetworks
    with reduced or no mobility. These networks combine \nwireless communication with
    minimal onboard computation facilities \nfor sensing and monitoring of physical
    and environmental phenomena.\nMuch work has been reported on different aspects
    of wireless sensors \nnetworks;however,less attention has been paid on addressing
    fault \ndetection and recovery in these networks.\nFault could be any thing which
    can lead communication break down as a \nwhole or part of a wireless sensors network.Thus,
    detection of such \nfault attains a primary focus to support routine operations
    within \nsuch networks.\nMobile Ad-hoc On Demand Data Delivery Protocol (MAODDP)
    belongs to \non-demand data delivery type routing family of mobile ad-hoc networks.\nThe
    contribution of this paper is to introduce an efficient fault \ndetection and
    recovery mechanism for WSNs network. We believe proposed\ntwo step model can offer
    a robust solution for the fault management \nin Wireless Sensors Network.   \n\n\t "

  content: "       This document presents a straightforward address\n       autoconfiguration
    mechanism for RPL over low power and lossy\n       networks (LLN). A solution
    is proposed to add the capability\n       of reusable address allocation. In this
    solution, nodes are\n       assigned with unique IPv6 addresses according to their
    positions\n       in the network. The amount of routing entries kept at each node\n
    \      is reduced. Also, this document introduces a dynamic adjustment\n       strategy
    for adapting to uneven distribution of node density.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an authentication protocol intended for\n   Internet
    applications which may require a robust and non-leaky\n   exchange of credentials
    even under adverse network conditions.  The\n   protocol has the ability to recover
    from packet loss during the\n   authentication process, as for example, should
    the Internet\n   application use the UDP transport protocol under lossy network\n
    \  conditions.  It does so by allowing the retransmission of lost\n   packets
    during authentication.  The protocol follows the Extensible\n   Authentication
    Protocol (RFC 3748 and RFC 5247) framework, which\n   allows for the use of multiple
    authentication mechanisms.  It\n   utilizes Secure Remote Password protocol (RFC
    2945), with strong,\n   password-based cryptographic hashing.  It utilizes the
    Secure Hashing\n   Algorithm message digest algorithm as the hashing mechanism.
    \ The\n   authentication protocol allows for one Server and one or more\n   Clients.
    \ Where multiple Clients exist, each may communicate only\n   with the Server.
    \ Clients initiate the authentication exchange\n   process.  Until the authentication
    completes successfully, the Server\n   and Client ignore/discard any packets except
    those supporting the\n   authentication process.  The authentication algorithm
    is based on a\n   username/password or passphrase pair.  These are used to generate\n
    \  secure ephemeral keys.  The Server has a store of all valid usernames\n   and
    password hashes.  Each Client stores its own username and\n   password.  The authentication
    algorithm provides for each side to\n   prove to the other that it has a valid
    username/password or\n   passphrase pair, in a way that a third-party monitoring
    the\n   transactions could not use intercepted information to later\n   successfully
    authenticate.  This mutual authentication exchange\n   consists of several pairs
    of interactions.  The first is a request\n   for authentication by the Client,
    containing the Client name, to\n   which the Server responds with a challenge
    for its identity.  The\n   Client responds with the Server name for verification
    purposes.\n   Thereafter, Client and Server each exchange three values consisting\n
    \  of password salts, ephemeral public keys, and hash values.  These are\n   generated
    and verified by Client and Server in accordance with SRP\n   against the stored
    password/passphrase hashes.  While any step in the\n   process may be repeated
    to provide for dropped packets should a\n   response not be received, the authentication
    process is terminated by\n   any incorrect value received in any response.  Multicast
    UDP\n   authentication is also supported, with certain limitations.\n\n\t "

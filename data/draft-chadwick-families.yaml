  content: "This document describes protocol support, in the form of LDAP\ncontrols,
    for compound entries. A compound entry logically allows\ncollections of attributes
    to be grouped together as though they were\npresent in the single compound entry,
    whereas in fact they are held\nin a hierarchical set of entries beneath the compound
    entry. The LDAP\ncontrols allow the user to treat a compound entry as either separate\nentries
    or as a single compound entry when both searching, retrieving\nand deleting information
    from the DIT. Compound entries are briefly\ndescribed here and a full description
    of them can be found in the\ndraft version of X.500 (2000)[FPDAM].\n\t "

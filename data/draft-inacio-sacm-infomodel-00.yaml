  content: "   This defines the information model for the Security Automation and\n
    \  Continuous Monitoring (SACM) standards.  The working group faces a\n   set
    of complex issues when trying to define an information model that\n   complicates
    this effort:\n\n   o  There are many standards in the SACM space which are not\n
    \     interoperable\n\n   o  There exists an extremely large and diverse set of
    data types\n      which are desirable to exchange\n\n   o  Many data types depend
    on the operating systems from which they\n      are collected; making a universal
    typing harder\n\n   o  A goal of SACM is to cover a diverse set of system types\n\n
    \  These complex needs create a information model which is difficult to\n   unify
    within the environment.  Instead, this information model design\n   is focused
    on minimum needed functionality with the desire to include\n   a type system design
    into the information model allowing for easy\n   expandability.  It is envisioned
    that this information model will\n   serve the following purposes:\n\n   o  Enough
    well specified elements in order to exchange key data\n      fields between systems\n\n
    \  o  Sufficient typing system to expand key fields over time and use of\n      a
    registry to standardize common expansions\n\n   o  Meta information such that
    compplete information exchange using\n      various other formats understood by
    all parties can be used as\n      needed to exchange complete records on demand\n\n
    \  o  Sufficient action verbs defined to allow orchestration between\n      various
    systems to allow unified control of federated components\n\n\t "

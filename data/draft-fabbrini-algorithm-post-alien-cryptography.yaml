  content: "   This memo aims to introduce the concept of \"post-alien cryptography\",\n
    \  presenting a symmetric encryption algorithm which, in our opinion,\n   can
    be considered the first ever designed to face the challenges\n   posed by contact
    with an alien civilization. FC1 cipher offers an\n   unprecedented grade of confidentiality.
    Based on the uniqueness of\n   the modular multiplicative inverse of a positive
    integer a modulo n\n   and on its computability in a polynomial time, this non-deterministic\n
    \  cipher can easily and quickly handle keys of millions or billions of\n   bits
    that an attacker does not even know the length of.\n   The algorithm's primary
    key is the modulo, while the ciphertext is\n   given by the concatenation of the
    modular inverse of blocks of\n   plaintext whose length is randomly chosen within
    a predetermined\n   range. In addition to the full specification here defined,
    in a\n   related work we present an implementation of it in Julia Programming\n
    \  Language, accompanied by real examples of encryption and decryption.\n\n\n\t "

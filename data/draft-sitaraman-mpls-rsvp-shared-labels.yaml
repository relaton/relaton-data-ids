  content: "   As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, so the number of\n
    \  Label Switched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements\n   has
    increased.  Various implementation recommendations have been\n   proposed to manage
    the resulting increase in control plane state.\n\n   However, those changes have
    had no effect on the number of labels\n   that a transit Label Switching Router
    (LSR) has to support in the\n   forwarding plane.  That number is governed by
    the number of LSPs\n   transiting or terminated at the LSR and is directly related
    to the\n   total LSP state in the control plane.\n\n   This document defines a
    mechanism to prevent the maximum size of the\n   label space limit on an LSR from
    being a constraint to control plane\n   scaling on that node.  That is, it allows
    many more LSPs to be\n   supported than there are forwarding plane labels available.\n\n
    \  This work introduces the notion of pre-installed 'per Traffic\n   Engineering
    (TE) link labels' that can be shared by MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs\n   that traverse these
    TE links.  This approach significantly reduces\n   the forwarding plane state
    required to support a large number of\n   LSPs.  This couples the feature benefits
    of the RSVP-TE control plane\n   with the simplicity of the Segment Routing MPLS
    forwarding plane.\n\n   This document also introduces the ability to mix different
    types of\n   label operations along the path of an LSP, thereby allowing the\n
    \  ingress router or an external controller to influence how to\n   optimally
    place a LSP in the network.\n\n\n\t "

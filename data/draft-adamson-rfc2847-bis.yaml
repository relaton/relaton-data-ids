  content: "   This memorandum describes a method whereby one can use GSS-API\n   [RFC2078]
    to supply a public-key based secure channel between a\n   client and a server
    without the need for an external Public Key\n   Infrastructure for certificate
    verification.  The method leverages\n   the existing Simple Public Key Mechanism
    (SPKM), and is specified as\n   two separate GSS-API mechanisms, SPKM-3 and LIPKEY,
    with LIPKEY\n   layered above SPKM-3.\n\n   SPKM-3 describes a method for creation
    of the secure channel using\n   mutual authentication where both a user and server
    authenticate with\n   public-key certificates [RFC3280].  SPKM-3 also describes
    a method\n   for creation of the secure channel where only the server\n   authenticates
    with a public-key certificate, and the user is\n   anonymous.  LIPKEY then uses
    the SPKM-3 anonymous secure channel to\n   authenticate a user with a password,
    completing the mutual\n   authentication.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a methodology for isolating the location and\n
    \  reasons for IPv6 Extension Headers blockage in a network where the\n   operator
    has access to install products and run diagnostic tests on\n   both the client
    and server.  The client and server will be both\n   inside and outside the Cloud
    topology.  This document will discuss\n   the testing and topology which need
    to be considered.  This document\n   is a part of the Deep Dive into EH Testing
    set of documents.\n\n\t "

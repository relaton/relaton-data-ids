  content: "   ISA100.11a is a Working Group at the ISA SP100 standard committee\n
    \  that covers Wireless Systems for Industrial Automation and Process\n   Control.
    \ The WG is mandated to design a scalable, industrial grade\n   LowPAN for devices
    such as sensors, valves, and actuators.  The\n   upcoming standard uses the 6LoWPAN
    format for the network header.  It\n   also introduces the concept of a Backbone
    Router to merge small\n   LoWPANs via a high speed transit and scale the ISA100.11a
    network.\n   This paper proposes an IPv6 version of the Backbone Router concept.\n\t "

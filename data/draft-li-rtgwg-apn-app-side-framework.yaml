  content: "   The Application-aware Networking (APN) framework defines that\n   application-aware
    information (i.e. APN attribute) including APN\n   identification (ID) and/or
    APN parameters (e.g. network performance\n   requirements) is encapsulated at
    network edge devices and carried in\n   packets traversing an APN domain in order
    to facilitate service\n   provisioning, perform fine-granularity traffic steering
    and network\n   resource adjustment.  This document defines the extension of the
    APN\n   framework for the application side.  In this extension, the APN\n   resources
    of an APN domain is allocated to applications which compose\n   and encapsulate
    the APN attribute in packets.  When the network\n   devices in the APN domain
    receive the packets carrying APN attribute,\n   they can directly provide fine-granular
    traffic operations according\n   to these APN attributes in the packets.\n\n\t "

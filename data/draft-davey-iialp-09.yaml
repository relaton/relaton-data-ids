  content: "This draft describes a system by which Internet Annoyances can be\n  logged
    quickly and automatically using IIALP (Iowa Internet Annoyance\n  Logging Protocol).
    \ The annoyance logs on a particular IIALP Server\n  are condensed and forwarded
    up the IIALP hierarchy to central Root\n  IIALP Servers for central annoyance
    queries.  Serial numbers and TTL\n  values keep the individual reports organized
    and dated.  One unique\n  complaint per IP per epoch period prevents flooding.
    \ Differences\n  in detail and propagation parameters exist between Root and\n
    \ Subordinate IIALP Servers to allow for more detail to be kept at the\n  originating
    IIALP Server. Standard XML and TCP security techniques,\n  and Hierarchy Structure
    eliminate erroneous reporting.  Routers and \n  software running IIALP can use
    IIALP to create dynamic QOS\n  lists for abusing Internet assets exceeding a set
    limits. IIALP allows\n  for an infinite number of different types of annoyances
    to exist but\n  has concise templates for common annoyances such as SPAM.  IIALP\n
    \ is a centralized logging system for Internet annoyance event\n  reporting.\n\t "

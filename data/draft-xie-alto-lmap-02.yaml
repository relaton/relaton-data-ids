  content: "   Measuring broadband performance on a large scale for network\n   diagnostics
    is important to providers and users, as well as for\n   public policy.  The Large-scale
    Measurement of Broadband Performance\n   (LMAP) framework, information model,
    and protocol have been developed\n   for measurement task dissemination, initialization,
    reporting and\n   storing.\n\n   This document uses the ALTO protocol to provide
    access to large-scale\n   network measurement results, which could be useful to
    constitute the\n   ALTO cost map service and the endpoint cost service.  Potential
    ALTO\n   protocol extensions are also discussed to better leverage LMAP\n   measurement
    results.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In a number of environments, a component external to a network is\n
    \  called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and\n   current
    state of the connections within the network, including\n   Traffic Engineering
    (TE) information.  This is information typically\n   distributed by IGP routing
    protocols within the network.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism by which
    link-state and TE\n   information can be collected from networks and shared with
    external\n   components using the BGP routing protocol.  This is achieved using
    a\n   new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding\n   format.
    \ The mechanism is applicable to physical and virtual IGP\n   links.  The mechanism
    described is subject to policy control.\n\n   Applications of this technique include
    Application-Layer Traffic\n   Optimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs).\n\n\n\t "

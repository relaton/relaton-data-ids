  content: "   This document attempts the case for new work that needs to be\n   developed
    for 5G users to improve faster download and upload of\n   user's data in a scenario
    of dual-connectivity for non-3GPP access\n   outlinig the poor wifi coverage issues.
    This document also outlines\n   the faster user data mechanism accompanying non-3GPP
    access of 5G\n   user device via split bearer in case of a poor coverage.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo discusses the applicability of the General Switch\n   Management
    Protocol, GSMP, to network control protocols such\n   as Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS).   It discusses the\n   need for this protocol to be standardized and discusses\n
    \  areas where development is still necessary.  Finally, it\n   recommends that
    the IETF establish a working group with the\n   objective of furthering the protocol
    and  working toward\n   making it a standard.\n\n   A PDF version of this draft
    can be found at: http://www.\n   apocalypse.org/~avri/papers/draft-doria-gsmp-applicability-00.pdf\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), in RFC 5730, defines the\n
    \  use of authorization information to authorize a transfer.  The\n   authorization
    information is object-specific and has been defined in\n   the EPP Domain Name
    Mapping, in RFC 5731, and the EPP Contact\n   Mapping, in RFC 5733, as password-based
    authorization information.\n   Other authorization mechanisms can be used, but
    in practice the\n   password-based authorization information has been used at
    the time of\n   object create, managed with the object update, and used to authorize\n
    \  an object transfer request.  What has not been fully considered is\n   the
    security of the authorization information that includes the\n   complexity of
    the authorization information, the time-to-live (TTL)\n   of the authorization
    information, and where and how the authorization\n   information is stored.  This
    document defines an operational\n   practice, using the EPP RFCs, that leverages
    the use of strong random\n   authorization information values that are short-lived,
    that are not\n   stored by the client, and that are stored using a cryptographic
    hash\n   by the server to provide for secure authorization information used\n
    \  for transfers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes SVDC, a highly-scalable and low-overhead\n
    \  virtualization architecture designed for large layer-2 data center\n   networks.
    By leveraging the emerging software defined network\n   framework, SVDC decouples
    the global identifier of a virtual network\n   from the identifier carried in
    the packet header. Hence, SVDC can\n   scale to a large scale of virtual networks
    with a very short tag in\n   the packet header, which is never achieved by previous
    network\n   virtualization solutions. SVDC enhances MAC-in-MAC encapsulation in
    a\n   way that packets with overlapped MAC addresses are correctly\n   forwarded
    even without in-packet global identifiers to differentiate\n   the virtual networks
    they belong to. Besides, scalable and efficient\n   layer-2 multicast and broadcast
    within virtual networks are also\n   supported in SVDC. This document also introduces
    a basic framework to\n   illustrate SVDC deployment.\n\n\t "

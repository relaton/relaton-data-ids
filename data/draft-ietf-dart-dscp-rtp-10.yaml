  content: "This memo describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (Diffserv)
    network quality-of-service (QoS) functionality and real- time network communication,
    including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  Diffserv
    is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets
    whose IP headers are marked with different Diffserv Codepoints (DSCPs).  WebRTC
    applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple
    traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple.
    \ The results of using multiple DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within
    a single network 5-tuple have transport protocol interactions, particularly with
    congestion control functionality (e.g., reordering).  In addition, DSCP markings
    may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination.  This memo
    covers the implications of these Diffserv aspects for real-time network communication,
    including WebRTC.\n\t "

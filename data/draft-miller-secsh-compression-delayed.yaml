- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo describes a new compression method for the SSH protocol.\n
    \  This new method uses the same zlib compression algorithm as the\n   existing
    method described in the core SSH drafts but delays the start\n   of compression
    until after user authentication has completed.  This\n   eliminates the risk of
    a bug in compression libraries resulting in a\n   pre-authentication compromise
    of an SSH server.\n\n\t "

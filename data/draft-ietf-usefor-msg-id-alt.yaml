  content: "   [RFC822] and [RFC1036] define so-called 'Message-IDs' that represent\n
    \  a unique identifier for email and netnews messages. A similar\n   identifier
    is also used by [RFC2045] for the 'Content-ID' label.\n \n   For each of these
    protocols, uniqueness of the identifiers generated\n   is more or less essential.
    Unfortunately, the original Message-ID\n   specification requires that the generator
    have an own, non-temporary\n   full qualified domain name available, which does
    not allow hosts that\n   are connected via dialup lines and get dynamically assigned
    IP\n   addresses (and hostnames) to generate unique IDs offline.\n \n   This memo
    provides recommendations for the generation of such IDs\n   without risking non-uniqueness.\n\n\t "

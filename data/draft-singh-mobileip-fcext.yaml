abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes extensions to the mobile IP as used in third\ngeneration
    wireless network [7,1,14] to provide a flow control\nmechanism on a per-session
    basis for data sent from the packet data\nservicing node (PDSN) to a radio network
    node (RNN). This extension\nsolves the problem of significant performance degradation
    when\npackets are dropped at the RNN due to channel setup latency and rate\nmismatch
    between the air interface and link between the RNN and PDSN\n(RP link).\n\t "

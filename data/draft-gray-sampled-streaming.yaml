  content: "   This document standardizes both 1) a means of requesting a stream of\n
    \  packet samples from any device generating, routing, or forwarding\n   traffic,
    and 2) receiving metadata information from the network\n   element about these
    packet samples, and the structure of said stream\n   metadata.  A main design
    requirement is to provide network elements\n   with widely varying capabilities
    (e.g., ASICs, NPUs, NICs, vSwitches,\n   CPUs) a mechanism to sample and export
    packets at high rates, by\n   allowing communication of the specific bit formats
    of internal data\n   headers applied to the packet flow, in a way that enhances\n
    \  interoperability between traffic sources and sinks.  Historically,\n   Netflow
    and similar mechanisms have been used for these use cases;\n   however, the increasing
    packet rates of very high-speed devices and\n   increasing variance in the information
    available to data planes lends\n   itself to both a less-prescriptive set of packet
    formats as well as a\n   decoupling of the sampling action from the collection
    and analysis\n   mechanisms.\n\n\t "

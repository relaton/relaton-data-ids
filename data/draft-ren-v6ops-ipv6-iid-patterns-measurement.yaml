abstract:
- content: <p>Interface Identifiers (IIDs) are critical components of IPv6 addresses,
    significantly impacting user privacy and the feasibility of network reconnaissance.
    RFC 7707 previously provided a comprehensive analysis of IID patterns based on
    data from the early stages of IPv6 deployment. However, with the widespread adoption
    of privacy-enhancing standards such as RFC 7217, historical data no longer accurately
    reflects the current IPv6 ecosystem. This document provides updated measurements
    of IID patterns by utilizing an improved pattern recognition method and incorporating
    novel data sources, such as public mailing lists. The measurement data reveals
    that while "Low-byte" patterns have decreased significantly in server addresses,
    a substantial number of seemingly random addresses actually belong to non-random,
    specific patterns, implying that heuristic scanning remains a viable vector. Furthermore,
    while client devices have widely adopted randomized addresses-effectively enhancing
    privacy-Client Premise Equipment (CPE) routers continue to exhibit a high usage
    rate of IEEE EUI-64 addresses, constituting an often-overlooked privacy risk.
    This document aims to update the statistics and analysis regarding IID pattern
    distribution found in RFC 7707, providing essential insights for modern network
    defense strategies and standard compliance.</p>

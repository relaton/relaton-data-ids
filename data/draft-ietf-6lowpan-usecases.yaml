  content: "This document investigates potential application scenarios and use cases
    for low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs).  This document provides
    dimensions of design space for LoWPAN applications.  A list of use cases and market
    domains that may benefit and motivate the work currently done in the 6LoWPAN Working
    Group is provided with the characteristics of each dimension.  A complete list
    of practical use cases is not the goal of this document.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "In some cases, it is desirable not to route transit traffic via a\nspecific
    OSPF router.  However, OSPF [RFC2328] does not specify a\nstandard way to accomplish
    this. This memo describes a backward-\ncompatible technique that may be used by
    OSPF implementations to\nadvertise unavailability to forward transit traffic or
    to lower the\npreference level for the paths through such a router.\n\t "

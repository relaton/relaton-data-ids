  content: "   Link-state routing protocols suffer from excessive flooding in dense\n
    \  network topologies.  RFC 9667, \"Dynamic Flooding on Dense Graphs\",\n   alleviates
    the problem by decoupling the flooding topology from the\n   physical topology.
    \ Link-state protocol updates are flooded only on\n   the sparse flooding topology
    while data traffic is still forwarded on\n   the physical topology.\n\n   This
    document describes an algorithm to obtain a sparse subgraph from\n   a dense graph.
    \ The resulting subgraph has certain desirable\n   properties and can be used
    as a flooding topology in dynamic\n   flooding.\n\n   This document discloses
    the algorithm that we have developed in order\n   to make it easier for other
    developers to implement similar\n   algorithms.  We do not claim that our algorithm
    is optimal, rather it\n   is a pragmatic effort and we expect that further research
    and\n   refinement can improve the results.\n\n   We are not proposing that this
    algorithm be standardized, nor that\n   the working group use this as a basis
    for further standardization\n   work, however we have no objections if the working
    group chooses to\n   do so.\n\n\t "

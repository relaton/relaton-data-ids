  content: "This document addresses how to securely achieve the nested tunnels \noptimization
    using nested path information that reflects the \noptimized path from Top Level
    Mobile Router(TLMR) to Mobile \nRouter(MR) in nested mobile networks.  The solution
    is based on \nReverse Routing Header(RRH) idea and the concern of security problem
    in RRH. By carefully taking a look at the simplicity of \nRouting Header Type
    2 routing mechanism and the complexity of \nAccess Router Option(ARO) based solution
    to get rid of the threat \nof possible attack for RRH, the proposed solution has
    been \nconsidered to preserve the efficiency of RRH without the lack of \nsecurity.

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two mechanisms in QUIC. The first is the delayed
    transmission, in which the sender would negotiate a proper time to send traffic
    to the receiver. The second is the store-and- forward, in which the sender would
    send the traffic to another place that supports temporary data store and data
    upload instead of the sender.</p>"

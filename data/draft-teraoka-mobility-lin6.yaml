  content: "This document describes the protocol specification of LIN6.  LIN6\nsupports
    both macro and micro mobility in IPv6[RFC2460].  LIN6 has\nseveral advantages
    in comparison with Mobile IPv6[MIPv6] as follows:\no  LIN6 has no header overhead
    because it does not use any extension\nheaders of IPv6 while Mobile IPv6 uses
    the Destination Options\nHeader for the Home Address Option and the Routing Header.\no
    \ LIN6 is more fault tolerant than Mobile IPv6.  In Mobile IPv6, the  Home Agent
    cannot be replicated to the subnet other than the home\nlink of the mobile node.
    \ LIN6 introduces the Mapping Agent which\ncan be replicated anywhere in the Internet.\no
    \ LIN6 keeps end-to-end communication model, that is, LIN6 does not\nuse any packet
    intercepter/forwarder such as the Home Agent of\nMobile IPv6.  There is no tunneling
    in LIN6.\n\n\t "

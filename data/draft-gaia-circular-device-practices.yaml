abstract:
- content: "<p>This document systematizes operational practices observed across multiple
    community-centred deployments that aim to improve meaningful connectivity and
    digital sovereignty through the circular management of end-user and network devices.
    It is published as an Informational RFC on the IRTF stream and does not define
    Internet standards or protocol requirements. The document addresses a foundational
    but often overlooked dependency of Internet access deployments: the availability,
    repairability, governance, and lifecycle management of network and user devices
    required to meaningfully use access networks. It is based on operational experience
    from deployments in Spain, Argentina, and Senegal—including eReuse.org, EKOA/UNLP,
    Solidança, TAU/RAEE, and Hahatay. It describes practices that have demonstrated
    positive access, social, and environmental outcomes. These practices are presented
    as descriptive guidance derived from operational experience rather than as normative
    requirements. They complement research within the IRTF GAIA Research Group by
    documenting reproducible approaches that improve the sustainability, autonomy,
    and long-term viability of Internet access in underserved contexts.</p>"

  content: "   The home network naming architecture as described in\n   [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation]
    requires a complex\n   naming configuration on the CPE.  This configuration MAY
    not be\n   handled easily by the average end user.  Furthermore, such\n   misconfiguration
    MAY result in making home network unreachable.\n\n   This document proposes a
    DHCP option that provides the CPE all\n   necessary parameters to set up the home
    network naming architecture.\n\n   First, this DHCP option provides automatic
    configuration and avoids\n   most end users' misconfigurations.  Most average
    end users may not\n   require specific configuration, and their ISP default configuration\n
    \  MAY fully address their needs.  In that case, the naming homenet\n   architecture
    configuration will be completely transparent to the end\n   users.  Then, saving
    naming configuration outside the CPE, makes it\n   resilient to change of CPE
    or CPE upgrades.  Such configuration may\n   also be configured by the end user,
    via the customer area of their\n   ISP.\n\n\t "

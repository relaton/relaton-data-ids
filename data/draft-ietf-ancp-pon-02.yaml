  script: Latn
  content: "     The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of the \n
    \    Access Node Control Mechanism, as described in [RFC5851], \n     to PON based
    broadband access. The need for an Access Node Control \n     Mechanism between
    a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node \n     Complex (a combination
    of Optical Line Termination (OLT) and \n     Optical Network Termination (ONT)
    elements) is described in a \n     multi-service reference architecture in order
    to perform QoS-\n     related, service-related and Subscriber-related operations.
    The \n     Access Node Control Mechanism is also extended for interaction \n     between
    components of the Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT). The \n     Access Node Control
    mechanism will ensure that the transmission of \n     information between the
    NAS and Access Node Complex (ANX) and \n     between the OLT and ONT within an
    ANX does not need to go through \n     distinct element managers but rather uses
    a direct device-to-\n     device communication and stays on net. This allows for
    performing \n     access link related operations within those network elements
    to \n     meet performance objectives.  \n\n\t "

  content: "A Mobile IPv6 node requires a Home Agent address, a home address, and
    IPsec security associations with its Home Agent before it can start utilizing
    Mobile IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these are statically
    configured.  This document defines how a Mobile IPv6 node can bootstrap this information
    from non-topological information and security credentials pre-configured on the
    Mobile Node.  The solution defined in this document solves the split scenario
    described in the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem statement in RFC 4640.  The
    split scenario refers to the case where the Mobile Node's mobility service is
    authorized by a different service provider than basic network access.  The solution
    described in this document is also generically applicable to any bootstrapping
    case, since other scenarios are more specific realizations of the split scenario.

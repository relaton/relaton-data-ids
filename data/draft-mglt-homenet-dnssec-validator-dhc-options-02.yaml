  content: "   DNSSEC provides data integrity and authentication for DNSSEC\n   validators.
    \ However, without valid trust anchor(s) and an acceptable\n   value for the current
    time, DNSSEC validation cannot be performed.\n   As a result, there are multiple
    cases where DNSSEC validation MUST\n   NOT be performed.  In addition, this list
    of exceptions is expected\n   to become larger over time.\n\n   Considering an
    increasing number of cases where DNSSEC is disabled\n   adds complexity to the
    DNSSEC validator implementations and increases\n   the vectors that disable security.\n\n
    \  This document assumes that DNSSEC adoption by end devices requires\n   that
    end devices MUST be able to support a DNSSEC validation always\n   set.  This
    MUST be valid today as well as in the future.\n\n   This document describes DHCP
    Options to provision the DHCP Client\n   with valid trust anchors and time so
    DNSSEC validation can be\n   performed.\n\n\t "

  content: "   When using a TURN relay, ICE connectivity checks require an explicit\n
    \  permission or channel binding to be established for each peer address\n   to
    be checked.  This requires the answerer to send its candidate\n   addresses to
    the offerer via the rendezvous server, which can impose\n   a latency penalty
    when the rendezvous server is centrally located.\n   This document defines a new
    type of TURN permission that will allow\n   any ICE connectivity check message
    that contains the offerer's ufrag\n   value to be accepted on a relay address
    for delivery over the\n   associated TURN tunnel.\n\n\t "

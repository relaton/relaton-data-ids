  content: "The transition from circuit based voice telephony network to pure\npacket
    based voice telephony network requires huge investment. It\nalso requires setting
    of a parallel packet voice telephony network\ncomponents with definition of packet
    network signalling protocols\nand packet network bearer transport protocols and
    in addition,\nsupport for intelligent services on packet network.\n \nThis paper
    defines a Packet-SS7 network.\n \nThis paper tries to explore the idea of modifying
    existing SS7\nnetwork protocol and network architecture to support packet voice\nservices
    on it. It can also provide an easy transition path from\ncircuit voice network
    to pure packet voice network.\n\t "

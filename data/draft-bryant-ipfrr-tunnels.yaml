  content: "This draft describes an IP fast re-route mechanism that provides\nbackup
    connectivity in the event of a link or router failure.  In the\nabsence of single
    points of failure and asymmetric costs, the\nmechanism provides complete protection
    against any single failure.\nIf perfect repair is not possible, the identity of
    all the\nunprotected links and routers is known in advance.\nThis IP Fast Reroute
    advanced method was invented in 2002 and draft\n(draft-bryant-ipfrr-tunnels-00.txt)
    describing it was submitted to\nthe IETF in May 2004.  It was one of the first
    methods of achieving\nfull repair coverage in an IP Network, and as such the draft
    has been\nwidely referenced in the academic literature.\n\nThe authors DO NOT
    propose that this IPFRR method be implemented\nsince better IPFRR advanced method
    capable of achieving full repair\ncoverage have subsequently been invented.\n\t "

  content: "To date, the scenario of multiple IP addresses for same domain name \narises
    for the case where either we have multihomed IP hosts or we \nhave multiple servers
    having the same domain name and application \non the client needs to approach
    only one of those IP hosts. However, \nthe penetration of mobile hosts and personal
    devices identified, on \nthe internet, by the user's Network Access Identifier
    (NAI) may \ncreate a scenario where multiple devices may have same domain name
    \nbut different IP addresses and all of those devices may need to get \nthe service
    or data from the application which only identifies them \nby their host name.\n
    \ \nThis document proposes to add a new Resource Record called the \nMultiple
    Unicast Resource Record (MURR) to the DNS system. This \nresource record is added
    for a domain name where the applications \nretrieving the IP address for the domain
    name have to provide the \nservice  (like PUSH data) to all the IP addresses retrieved
    in the \nmultiple MURRs for the domain name. \n\t "

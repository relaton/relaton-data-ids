  content: "   This document provides a core narrative that walks through an\n   automated
    enterprise vulnerability assessment scenario.  It is\n   aligned with the SACM
    use cases and begins with an enterprise\n   ingesting vulnerability description
    data, followed by identifying\n   endpoints on the network and collecting and
    storing information about\n   them to enable posture assessment, and finally ends
    with assessing\n   these endpoints against the vulnerability description data
    to\n   determine which ones are affected.  Processes that specifically\n   overlap
    between this scenario and SACM use cases will be noted where\n   applicable.  Specifically,
    the relationship between this document and\n   the SACM use case building block
    capabilities and the usage scenarios\n   will be covered.\n\n\t "

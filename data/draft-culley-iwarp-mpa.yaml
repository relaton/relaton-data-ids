- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "A framing protocol is defined for TCP that is fully compliant with\napplicable
    TCP RFCs and fully interoperable with existing TCP\nimplementations. The framing
    mechanism is designed to work as an\n'adaptation layer' between TCP and the Direct
    Data Placement [DDP]\nprotocol, preserving the reliable, in-order delivery of
    TCP, while\nadding the preservation of higher-level protocol record boundaries\nthat
    DDP requires.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes an IPv6 network attachment detection \n   mechanism
    in which access routers disseminate the identifiers of on-\n   link access points
    reported by hosts.  By caching the identifiers, \n   hosts assess the likelihood
    of an L3 link change right after an \n   access point change.  The hosts are hence
    able to quickly determine \n   whether an existing IP address configuration can
    be reused or a new \n   one should be acquired.  The mechanism aims to achieve
    fast L3 \n   connectivity re-establishment with less signaling overhead. \n\t "

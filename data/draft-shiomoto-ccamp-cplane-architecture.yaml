  content: "This document addresses control plane architecutre in GMPLS enabled IP-\nOptical
    networks. Two different control plane architectures are consid-\nered: symmetical
    and asymmetrical control plane architectures. Addressing (router-ID, control plane
    address, and TE link address) and RSVP message handling (routing, HOP and ERO
    objects processing) are discussed for both architectures.The document also recommends
    normal practises for identification of TE links. Interwork between symmetrical
    and asymmetrical control plane is addressed.\n\t "

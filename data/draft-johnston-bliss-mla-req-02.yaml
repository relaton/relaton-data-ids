abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements and implementation of a group
    telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA) or Multiple
    Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA). When implemented
    using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as Multiple Appearances
    (MA) since SIP does not have lines. This feature is commonly offered in the IP
    Centrex services and IP-PBX offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP
    telephones and SIP feature servers used in a business environment. This document
    lists requirements and compares implementation options for this feature. Extensions
    to the SIP dialog event package are proposed.</p>"

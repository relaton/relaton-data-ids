  content: "   This memo describes the interaction between Differentiated Services\n
    \  (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-\n   time
    network communication, including communication based on the\n   Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP).  DiffServ is based on network\n   nodes applying different forwarding
    treatments to packets whose IP\n   headers are marked with different DiffServ
    Code Points (DSCPs).\n   WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications,
    have\n   begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation\n
    \  mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS\n   requirements
    using the same network 5-tuple.  Use of different DSCPs\n   to obtain different
    QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple,\n   the results (e.g., reordering)
    may cause transport protocol\n   interactions, particularly with congestion control
    functionality.  In\n   addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between
    the traffic\n   source and destination.  This memo covers the implications of
    these\n   DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including\n   WebRTC.\n\n\t "

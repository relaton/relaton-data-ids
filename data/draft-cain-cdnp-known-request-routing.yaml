  content: "The work presents a summary of Request-Routing techniques that are \nused
    to direct client requests to surrogates based on various \npolicies and a possible
    set of metrics. In this memo the term \nRequest-Routing represents techniques
    that are commonly called \ncontent routing or content redirection. In principle,
    \nRequest-Routing techniques can be classified under: DNS \nRequest-Routing, Transport-layer
    Request-Routing, and \nApplication-layer Request-Routing.\n\t "

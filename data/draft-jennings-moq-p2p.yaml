  content: "   This protocol is designed for small groups of users sending\n   relatively
    small messages.  It is optimized for the assumption that a\n   node will come
    online and collect all messages at least once every 15\n   days and that some
    nodes that act as mirrors will be online most of\n   the time but may come and
    go over long periods of time.\n\n\t "

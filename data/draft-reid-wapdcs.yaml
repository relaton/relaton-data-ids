  content: "This document describes a service concept implementation of a Dynamic
    \nCall Screening  Service  (DCS) made available to WAP endpoints.  This\nwork
    builds on an existing Internet Call Waiting (ICW)  [1]  platform\nto  provide
    \ enhanced call screening and control capabilities via the\nWAP interface to wireless
    handsets.  This extends the current ICW [1] \nservice to provide  a  'WAP  Proxy'
    \ which  supports  call  screening\nnotification and automatic disposition capabilities.
    \ In this way the \nservice  evolves  from  an Internet Call Waiting service for
    wireline\nsubscribers to a  network-based  user  agent  with  which  users  can\nregister
    \ to  direct  incoming  call n otifications to any of several\nendpoint device
    types depending  on  their  current  preferences  and\navailability.\n\t "

  content: "Realizing the important role that photonic switches can play in \ndata-centric
    networks, work has been going on within the IETF to \ncombine the control plane
    of MPLS (more specifically traffic \nengineering) with the point-and-click provisioning
    capabilities of \nphotonic switches [1]. This document outlines a proposal to
    expand \nthis initiative to include DWDM, OADM and ATM systems. It also \nproposes
    to expand the work beyond simple establishment of optical \npaths and include
    optical performance monitoring and management. The \ncombined path routing and
    performance information that will be \ncarried and shared between these network
    elements will allow the \nelements or element management system (EMS) to adequately
    assess the \n'health' of an optical path (which can be a wavelength or fiber \nstrand).
    The routers and/or ATM switches at the edges of the \nphotonic network will then
    use this information to dynamically \nmanage the millions of wavelengths available
    in the photonic layer.\n\t "

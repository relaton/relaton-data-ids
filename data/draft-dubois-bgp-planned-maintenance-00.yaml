  content: "   To ease the maintenance of BGP-4 sessions and limit the amount of \n
    \  traffic that is lost during planned maintenance on routers, a \n   specific
    mechanism is proposed in order to gracefully shutdown a \n   router or a session.
    \n   It's proposed that a router first withdraw its route to its peer \n   to
    initiate their convergence. After a timer the router can proceed \n   with the
    closing of the BGP sessions and consequently remove its \n   peers'routes from
    it's RIB (Routing Information Base).\n\t "

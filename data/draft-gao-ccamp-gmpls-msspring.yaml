  content: "   In order to provide high availability for transport networks, link
    \n   protection technologies are adopted in the data plane. In present \n   Synchronous
    Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Synchronous Optical Network \n   (SONET) optical transport
    networks, one of these protection \n   technologies, shared ring protection technologies,
    such as the 2/4-\n   Fiber Bi-directional Multiplex Section Shared Protection
    Ring(MS-\n   SPRing), are widely used. The same technologies can also be applied
    \n   in Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). This document describes a set \n   of
    issues to be addressed when applying GMPLS) to support MS-SPRings, \n   and sets
    out how GMPLS can be applied. \n\n\t "

  content: "There already exist several mobility support solutions and each\nsolution
    uses its own method to achieve specific goals.But\ndifferent solutions may not
    work properly when they are combined in\nan integrated application environment
    because network entities have\nlittle information about each other.Specially when
    PMIP meet with the\nNemo network environment something need to be considered more.
    This \ndocument describes several limitations on NEMO application and \nprovides
    a possible solution.\n\t "

  content: "TCP congestion control is based on the assumption that the end-to-end\npath
    of a connection changes only insignificantly after connection\nestablishment.
    \ Network layer mobility protocols that change a\nconnection's point of attachment
    transparently to the transport layer\nmay violate this assumption and cause TCP
    to make congestion control\ndecisions based on invalid information.  This document
    describes a\n\nTCP option that allows a connection endpoint to inform a peer when
    it\nchanges location.  This document also outlines the proper congestion\ncontrol
    behavior that should take place in the face of such network\nlayer mobility.\n\n\n\n\t "

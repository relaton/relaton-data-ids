  content: "   DNS queries and responses are visible to network elements on the path\n
    \  between the DNS client and its server.  These queries and responses\n   can
    contain privacy-sensitive information which is valuable to\n   protect.  An active
    attacker can send bogus responses causing\n   misdirection of the subsequent connection.\n\n
    \  To counter passive listening and active attacks, this document\n   proposes
    the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for DNS,\n   to protect against
    passive listeners and certain active attacks.  As\n   DNS needs to remain fast,
    this proposal also discusses mechanisms to\n   reduce DTLS round trips and reduce
    DTLS handshake size.  The proposed\n   mechanism runs over the default DNS port
    and can also run over an\n   alternate port.\n\n\t "

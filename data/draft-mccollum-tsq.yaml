  content: "   This document proposes a modern, secure, and extensible time\n   synchronization
    protocol designed to operate over the QUIC transport\n   protocol.  Known as TSQ
    (Time Synchronization over QUIC), this\n   protocol aims to address the limitations
    of traditional NTP by\n   leveraging QUIC's encryption, widespread UDP/443 acceptance,
    and\n   multiplexed stream capabilities.  TSQ is designed for contemporary\n   deployment
    environments, including enterprise networks, cloud-native\n   systems, containers,
    and mobile devices, where traditional UDP-based\n   NTP struggles with security,
    scalability, or operational reliability.\n\n\t "

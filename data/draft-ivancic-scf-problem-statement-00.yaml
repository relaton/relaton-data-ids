  content: "   This document provides a problem statement for non-realtime\n   communication
    between systems that are generally disconnected,\n   requiring multiple network
    hops between source and destination, that\n   may never be fully connected end-to-end
    at any given time.  This\n   document describes a number of use cases that motivate
    having a\n   standard method to communicate between such systems, as multi-\n
    \  organization and multi-vendor support and interoperability is highly\n   desirable.
    \ These include dismounted soldiers, sensorwebs, medical\n   devices, animal tracking,
    low-earth-orbiting satellites and data mule\n   scenarios.  To avoid confusion
    in terminology when trying to focus on\n   the problem and requirements without
    bias towards particular\n   technical solutions, at this time, we refer to the
    protocol instances\n   that would support such communications as Store, Carry,
    and\n   Forwarding (SCF) agents, and refer to their activity as SCF\n   networking.
    \ The concepts involved in SCF networking are not entirely\n   new and several
    facets of the problem have been solved in multiple\n   incompatible ways in existing
    or historic systems.  This document\n   describes the core SCF problem and gives
    an assessment of the ability\n   to use existing technologies as solutions.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document updates the session matching procedure defined in\nsection
    7.3 of RFC 4975, so that an MSRP UA only uses the session-id\npart of the MSRP
    URI in order to perform the consistency checks.  The\nupdate allows intermediate
    network entities (ALGs) to modify the\naddress information in the MSRP URI of
    the SDP a=path attribute,\nwithout the need for the intermediate to terminate
    and do the\ncorrelating modifications in the associated MSRP messages.\n\nStatus

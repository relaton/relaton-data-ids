  content: "   This document defines YANG models to add support for classifying\n
    \  traffic received on interfaces as Ethernet/VLAN framed packets to\n   sub-interfaces
    based on the fields available in the Ethernet/VLAN\n   frame headers.  Primarily
    the classification is based on VLAN\n   identifiers in the 802.1Q VLAN tags, but
    the model also has support\n   for matching on some other layer 2 frame header
    fields and is\n   designed to be easily extensible to match on other arbitrary
    header\n   fields.\n\n   The model differs from an IEEE 802.1Q bridge model in
    that the\n   configuration is interface/sub-interface based as opposed to being\n
    \  based on membership of a 802.1Q VLAN bridge.\n\n\t "

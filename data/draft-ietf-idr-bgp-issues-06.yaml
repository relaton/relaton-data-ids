  content: "   This document records the issues discussed and the consensus reached\n
    \  in the Interdomain Routing (IDR) Working Group during its efforts to\n   revise
    and bring up to date the base specification for the BGP-4\n   protocol as documented
    in RFC1771.  The document focuses on the\n   changes tracked from August 2002
    when the last major push for\n   revision began.  The results of these efforts
    are encoded in RFC4271,\n   which should be taken as normative for any of the
    issues that were\n   discussed.  The discussion here is intended to record how
    and why\n   some of the changes to BGP were made.\n\n\t "

  content: "   During the introduction phase of IPv6 (as of Jan 2013) many existing\n
    \  mail servers are not able to do IPv6 communication, yet.  However new\n   networks
    will be assigned IPv6 addresses only so new mail servers\n   will not be able
    to do IPv4 communication.\n\n   This document proposes the installation of special
    servers that are\n   able to route mail between IPv4-only and IPv6-only mail servers
    to\n   solve this problem.\n\n\t "

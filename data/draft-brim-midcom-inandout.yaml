  content: "A midcom agent does not know whether to ask for a ruleset to be\ninstalled
    in a middlebox or not.  Even when it does ask, in some\nsituations the middlebox
    does not know how to apply the ruleset.\nThis document tries to solve these problems
    without adding an\noverwhelming amount of complexity to every agent and middlebox.\n\t "

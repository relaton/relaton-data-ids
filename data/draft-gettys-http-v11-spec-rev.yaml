  content: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level \nprotocol
    for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information \nsystems. It is a generic,
    stateless, protocol which can be used for \nmany tasks beyond its use for hypertext,
    such as name servers and \ndistributed object management systems, through extension
    of its \nrequest methods, error codes and headers [I36]. A feature of HTTP is
    \nthe typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems \nto be
    built independently of the data being transferred.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft proposes a mechanism for bidirectional IPv4 communication\n
    \  between IPv4 Internet and end hosts or IPv4 networks sited in IPv6\n   access
    network.  This mechanism follows the softwire hub and spoke\n   model and uses
    IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel as basic method to traverse IPv6\n   network.  By allocating
    public IPv4 addresses to end hosts/networks\n   in IPv6, it can achieve IPv4 end-to-end
    bidirectional communication\n   between these hosts/networks and IPv4 Internet.
    \ This mechanism is an\n   IPv4 access method for hosts and IPv4 networks sited
    in IPv6.\n\n\t "

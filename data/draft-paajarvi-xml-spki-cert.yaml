  content: "This draft suggests a standard form for encoding SPKI certificates in\nXML
    as opposed to the original s-expression encoding defined in\n[SPKI].  The standard
    form is defined as an XML document type\ndefinition (DTD).  The main emphasis
    is on the XML-encoding of an\nauthorization certificate that is the basic SPKI
    certificate form.\nThis draft provides also a brief introduction to XML and a
    short\ndiscussion about the benefits of choosing XML as the certificate\nencoding
    format.\nIn addition, this draft discusses the problems of automatic\nprocessing
    of tags (attributes and authorizations transferred by a\ncertificate are called
    tags in SPKI) when reducing certificates.  An\nexample of encoding Java permissions
    in an SPKI certificate is given\nto demonstrate the problem and, finally, a solution
    to this problem\nis suggested.\n\n\t "

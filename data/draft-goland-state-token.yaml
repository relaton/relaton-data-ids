  content: "There are times when a principal will want to predicate successful execution
    of a method on the current state of a resource. While HTTP/1.1 provides a mechanism
    for conditional execution of methods using entity tags via the 'If-Match' and
    'If-None-Match' headers, the mechanism is not sufficiently extensible to express
    conditional statements involving more generic state indicators, such as lock tokens.
    \                            This draft defines the term 'state token' as an identifier
    for a state of a resource. This draft defines requirements for state tokens and
    provides a state token syntax, along with two new headers which are used to express
    method preconditions using state tokens.\n\t "

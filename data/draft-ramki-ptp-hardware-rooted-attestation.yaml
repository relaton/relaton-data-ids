  content: "   This document defines an extension to Precision Time Protocol (PTP)\n
    \  that provides per-event cryptographic attestation using\n   non-exportable
    asymmetric keys resident in TPMs or HSMs, and an\n   optional PTP-in-HTTPS/MTLS
    encapsulation mode.  When combined with\n   freshness and multi-observer correlation,
    this provides defensible\n   proof of proximity for timing events.  PTP-in-HTTPS/MTLS
    adds\n   end-to-end confidentiality for timing payloads across untrusted\n   fabrics.\n\n
    \     NOTE: This note is a placeholder to show the correct structure\n      that
    avoids the \"setup generated\" error (Line 53).  All paragraphs\n      inside
    a note must be separated by a blank line.\n\n      *setup generated*\n\n\t "

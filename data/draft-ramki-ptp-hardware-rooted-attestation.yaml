abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines an extension to Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
    that provides per-event cryptographic attestation using non-exportable asymmetric
    keys resident in TPMs or HSMs, and an optional PTP-in-HTTPS/MTLS encapsulation
    mode. When combined with freshness and multi-observer correlation, this provides
    defensible proof of proximity for timing events. PTP-in-HTTPS/MTLS adds end-to-end
    confidentiality for timing payloads across untrusted fabrics. NOTE: This note
    is a placeholder to show the correct structure that avoids the "setup generated"
    error (Line 53). All paragraphs inside a note must be separated by a blank line.

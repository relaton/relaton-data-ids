  content: "RFCs 951 [1], 1541 [2], and 1542 [3] describe the interactions of BOOTP
    [1] and DHCP [2] client, server, and relay agents.  However, further experience
    with these protocols has revealed the existence of an interoperability issue.
    \ The issue occurs when a given IP subnet is constructed over one link-layer network
    inter-connected by translational bridges to other dissimilar link-layer networks.
    \ The following information attempts to address this problem.   It is impossible
    for a BOOTP or DHCP client, server, or relay agent to know in advance whether
    or not it will be operating in a mixed media link-layer network environment.  Given
    this fact, all BOOTP and DHCP client, server, and relay agents SHOULD adopt the
    recommendations defined in this memo.\n\t "

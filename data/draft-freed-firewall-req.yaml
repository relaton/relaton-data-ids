  content: "This memo defines a basic transparency requirement for\nInternet firewalls.
    \ While such a requirement may seem\nobvious, the fact of the matter is that firewall
    behavior is\ncurrently either unspecified or underspecified, and this lack\nof
    specificity often causes problems in practice. This\nrequirement is intended to
    be a necessary first step in making\nthe behavior of firewalls more consistent
    and correct.\n\t "

  content: "This memo discusses the relationship between unicast and multicast service
    support in the IP over ATM environment, and explores some implications of noting
    that unicasting can be considered as a subset of multicasting. Specifically it
    is shown how the Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS) in draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt
    might be used to provide IP unicast address resolution service, acting as a substitute
    for an RFC1577 ARP Server. It is also noted that an RFC1577 ARP Server can be
    built as a 'front end' to a MARS.                                                     This
    memo is intended as a companion to the ideas contained in draft-smith-ipatm-bcast-00.txt,
    which noted how IP broadcast could be supported by the MARS as a special case
    of multicast.\n\t "

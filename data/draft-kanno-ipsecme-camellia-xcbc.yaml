  content: "This memo specifies two new algorithms.  One is the usage of XCBC\nmode
    with Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism of\nthe IPsec Encapsulating
    Security Payload and Authentication Header\nprotocols.  This algorithm is called
    Camellia-XCBC-96.  Latter is\npseudo-random function based on XCBC with Camellia
    block cipher for\nInternet Key Exchange.  This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-PRF-\n128.\n\t "

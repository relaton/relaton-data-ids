  script: Latn
  content: "Most CPEs should soon be dual stack, but a large installed base of\nIPv4-only
    CPEs is likely to remain for several years.  Also, with the\nIPv4 address shortage,
    more and more ISPs will assign private IPv4\naddresses to their customers.  The
    need for IPv6 connectivity\ntherefore concerns hosts behind IPv4-only CPEs, including
    such CPEs\nthat are assigned private addresses.  The 6a44 mechanism specified
    in\nthis document addresses this need, without limitations and\noperational complexities
    of Tunnel Brokers and Teredo to do the same.\n\n6a44 is based on an address mapping
    and on a mechanism whereby\nsuitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6
    connectivity via\na stateless 6a44 server function operated by their Internet
    Service\nProvider.  With it, IPv6 traffic between two 6a44 hosts in a single\nsite
    remains within the site.  Except for IANA numbers that remain to\nbe assigned,
    the specification is intended to be complete enough for\nrunning codes to be independently
    written and interwork.\n\t "

    \  standards by means that allow to replace or extend text-based email\n   messages
    with message parts that describe content (full or in parts)\n   in a machine-readable
    way.  This would enable rich and structured\n   interaction for its recipients
    - may it be human users or agents on\n   their behalf.\n\n\t "

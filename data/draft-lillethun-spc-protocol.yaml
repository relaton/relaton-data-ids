  content: "   The Simple Path Control Protocol (SPC) defined in this document is
    a\n   new protocol defined to enable processes external to networks to\n   establish,
    delete and monitor paths, including lightpaths. The\n   architecture of this protocol
    establishes a method of providing\n   messages, and procedures that allow such
    external processes to\n   use those messages to directly request network resources
    related to\n   path provisioning.\n\t "

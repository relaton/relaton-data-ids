  content: "   We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to assess
    if\n   a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target\n
    \  Transport Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to\n   successive
    subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly\n   applied to key infrastructure,
    such as interconnects or even\n   individual devices, to accurately detect if
    any part of the\n   infrastructure will prevent paths traversing it from meeting
    the\n   Target Transport Performance.\n\n   For Bulk Transport Capacity, the IP
    diagnostics are built on test\n   streams that mimic TCP over the complete path
    and statistical\n   criteria for evaluating the packet transfer statistics of
    those\n   streams.  The temporal structure of the test stream (bursts, etc)\n
    \  mimic TCP or other transport protocol carrying bulk data over a long\n   path
    but are constructed to be independent of the details of the\n   subpath under
    test, end systems or applications.  Likewise the\n   success criteria evaluates
    the packet transfer statistics of the\n   subpath against criteria determined
    by protocol performance models\n   applied to the Target Transport Performance
    of the complete path.\n   The success criteria also does not depend on the details
    of the\n   subpath, end systems or application.\n\n   Model Based Metrics exhibit
    several important new properties not\n   present in other Bulk Transport Capacity
    Metrics, including the\n   ability to reason about concatenated or overlapping
    subpaths.  The\n   results are vantage independent which is critical for supporting\n
    \  independent validation of tests by comparing results from multiple\n   measurement
    points.\n\n   This document does not define the IP diagnostic tests, but provides
    a\n   framework for designing suites of IP diagnostic tests that are\n   tailored
    to confirming that infrastructure can meet the predetermined\n   Target Transport
    Performance.\n\n\t "

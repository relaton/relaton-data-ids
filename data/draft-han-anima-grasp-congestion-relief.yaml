abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a method for automatic congestion relief using the
    Grasp protocol. In operator networks, in response to network failures such as
    fiber optic cable faults and optical module malfunctions, network devices can
    automatically respond and achieve real-time self-healing, thereby ensuring the
    stable operation of the network.</p>"

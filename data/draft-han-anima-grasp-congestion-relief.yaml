- language: en

  content: "   This draft defines a method for automatic congestion relief using the\n
    \  Grasp protocol.  In operator networks, in response to network\n   failures
    such as fiber optic cable faults and optical module\n   malfunctions, network
    devices can automatically respond and achieve\n   real-time self-healing, thereby
    ensuring the stable operation of the\n   network.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "Mobile IPv6 relies on IPsec for securing the signaling between the MN\n
    \  and HA.  However, the tight coupling of the mobility protocol with\n   IPsec
    is detrimental to broader implementation and deployment.\n\n   This document proposes
    a scheme based on Identity-Based Cryptography\n   mechanism to authenticate the
    mobile node and signaling of home\n   biding update to home agent.  Hence, the
    use of IPsec could be\n   avoided.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a mechanism under which a client can request\n
    \  that an upstream recursive resolver perform DNS filtering on behalf\n   of
    a client-requested policy.  This is may be done, for example,\n   under a subscription
    model, where the client wishes not to get\n   redirected to domains known to host
    malware or malicious content.\n   This request is sent as an EDNS0 option with
    every DNS request, or\n   potentially to just the first DNS request in a stream
    when using DNS\n   over TLS, DNS over DTLS or DNS over DOH for example.\n\n\t "

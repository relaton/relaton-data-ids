  content: "This memo proposes a scheme that utilizes only pre-established bi-\ndirectional
    tunnels between LMA and MAGs to support a fast handover\neffectively in Proxy
    Mobile IPv6.  To expedite the handover\nprocedure, we define new signaling messages,
    Fast PBU/PBA and Reverse\nPBU/PBA, exchanged by LMA and MAGs.  Because any signaling
    messages\nexchanged by two MAGs are neither created nor utilized and thus bi-\ndirectional
    tunnel between MAGs is not created, the proposed scheme\nputs less overload upon
    network than the existing fast handover\nscheme for PMIPv6.  It can also tackle
    effectively with the so-called\nping-pong movement of mobile nodes.\n\t "

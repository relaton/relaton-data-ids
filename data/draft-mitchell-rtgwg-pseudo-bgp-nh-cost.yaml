abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This describes a local router implementation option that provides a\n
    \  facility for the manipulation of the costs of IGP learned routes that\n   are
    utilized as BGP NextHops rather than using the SPF calculated\n   cost to the
    same route when running the BGP path selection algorithm.\n   The result is something
    that works like a pseudo-routing protocol but\n   only impacting the BGP decision
    making process.\n\n\t "

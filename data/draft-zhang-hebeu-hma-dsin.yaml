  content: "   The increasing world-wide demands in deep space scientific missions,\n
    \  such as Lunar, Mars and other Planetary Exploration, along with the\n   rapidly
    growing advances in space communication technologies have\n   triggered the vision
    of so called future Deep Space Information\n   Networks (DSINs). The coined DSIN
    paradigm is envisioned to be an\n   integrated high speed self-organizing hypernetwork
    consisting of the\n   terrestrial ground-based information networks and the outer
    space-\n   based entities to provide maximum network capacity. In this document,\n
    \  the problem of network infrastructure and architecture for DSINs is\n   investigated.
    Taking into account the major challenges or\n   characteristics affecting link,
    networking, transport, and security\n   design of DSINs, this document employs
    hypergraph theory to construct\n   network infrastructure and node architecture
    of space optical\n   switching, and further presents a five-layered hypernetwork
    model of\n   DSINs to enhance network connectivity. Combining with the benefits\n
    \  in interconnection and interoperability of heterogeneous challenged\n   networks,
    brought by the well-known Delay-and Disruption-Tolerant\n   Networking (DTN) architecture,
    this document proposes a novel\n   architecture of DSINs from two levels including
    Layered Protocol\n   Stack and Management Plane. The proposed architecture preliminarily\n
    \  achieves the basic concepts and the relevant mechanisms of wisdom\n   network,
    and the performance and quality of service (QoS) of DSINs\n   are thereby improved.\n\n\t "

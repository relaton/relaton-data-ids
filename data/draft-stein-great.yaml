  content: "   VoIP is commonly perceived to be a low quality, but low cost,\n   alternative
    to standard telephony.  This poor perception is often\n   well deserved, being
    fueled by implementations designed without\n   regard to characteristics of IP
    networks.  This problem statement\n   attempts to catalog the shortcomings of
    current implementations, in\n   order to explore the IETF community's interest
    in working to improve\n   this situation.\n\t "

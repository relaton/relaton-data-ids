abstract:
- content: <p>IEEE-754 NaN formations are not numbers and have no equivalence class.
    They are not comparable to anything, including reflexively, and therefore each
    attribute - sign bit, signaling/quiet bit, payload bits, and representation width
    (binary16, binary32, binary64) - can carry meaning for an implementation. CBOR
    permits encoding NaNs as floating-point values, but generic processing, preferred
    serialization, and deterministic profiles may canonicalize or otherwise alter
    NaN encodings, losing information. This document defines a CBOR tag, colloquially
    "nan-bstr", whose content is a byte string carrying the exact IEEE-754 NaN bit
    pattern so that all attributes are preserved across encode/decode, enabling use
    cases like NaN boxing, platform-specific error signaling, diagnostics, and forensics.</p>

  content: "   The Internet's Domain Name System is designed and built on a single\n
    \  root, known as the Root Server System.\n\n   Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production
    root server testbed that\n   provides an environment where technical and operational
    experiments\n   can safely be performed without risk to production root server\n
    \  infrastructure.  Yeti DNS is an independently-coordinated project and\n   is
    not affiliated with ICANN, IANA or any Root Server Operator.\n\n   The Yeti DNS
    testbed implementation includes various novel and\n   experimental components.
    \ These differences from the Root Server\n   System have operational consequences;
    by deploying such a system\n   globally but outside the production DNS system,
    the Yeti DNS project\n   provides an opportunity to gain insight into those consequences\n
    \  without threatening the stability of the DNS.\n\n   This document neither addresses
    the relevant policies under which the\n   Root Server System is operated nor makes
    any proposal for changing\n   any aspect of its implementation or operation.  This
    document aims\n   solely to document the technical and operational experience
    of\n   deploying a system which is similar to but different from the Root\n   Server
    System.\n\n\t "

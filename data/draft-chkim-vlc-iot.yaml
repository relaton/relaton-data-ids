  content: "   The LED-based Visible Light Communication (VLC) has been proposed as\n
    \  the IEEE 802.15.7-2011 standard and regarded as a new wireless access\n   medium
    in IoT environment. With this trend, many works have so far\n   been made to improve
    the performance of VLC. However, how to\n   effectively integrate VLC services
    into IoT networks has not been\n   studied enough. In this document, we propose
    a scheme for device\n   management and data transport in IoT networks using VLC.\n
    \  Specifically, we discuss how to manage VLC transmitters and\n   receivers,
    and to support VLC data transmission in IoT networks. The\n   proposed scheme
    considers uni-directional VLC transmissions from\n   transmitter to receivers
    for delivery of location-based VLC data. The\n   backward transmission from VLC
    receivers will be made by using\n   platform server and aggregation agents in
    the network.\n\n\t "

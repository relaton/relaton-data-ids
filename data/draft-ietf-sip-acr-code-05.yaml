  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows for users to make anonymous
    calls.  However, users receiving such calls have the right to reject them because
    they are anonymous.  SIP has no way to indicate to the caller that the reason
    for call rejection was that the call was anonymous.  Such an indication is useful
    to allow the call to be retried without anonymity.  This specification defines
    a new SIP response code for this purpose. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

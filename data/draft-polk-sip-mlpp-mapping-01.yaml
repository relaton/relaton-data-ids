  content: "This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation \nProtocol
    [1] to allow SIP (and IP) into existing Voice Backbone\nInfrastructures that require
    Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-\nemption [2] Service throughout those networks.
    This document \nwill also allow MLPP networks that are ISDN-based now to evolve/\nmigrate
    or be replaced by a SIP-based Voice Signaling network \nwith no loss in capability
    of that original network. More likely\nis the case that additional functionality
    and capabilities can \nbe realized such as mobility and reduced user headaches
    (ex-\nplained later) with SIP being MLPP enabled within a network \ninfrastructure.\n\t "

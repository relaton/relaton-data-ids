  content: "This document describes UDT, or the UDP based Data Transfer protocol.
    \nUDT is designed to be an alternative data transfer protocol for the \nsituations
    when TCP does not work well. One of the most common cases, \nand also the original
    motivation of UDT, is to overcome TCP's \ninefficiency in high bandwidth-delay
    product (BDP) networks. Another \nimportant target use scenario is to allow networking
    researchers, \nstudents, and application developers to easily implement and deploy
    \nnew data transfer algorithms and protocols. Furthermore, UDT can also \nbe used
    to better support firewall traversing. \n    \nUDT is completely built on top
    of UDP. However, UDT is connection \noriented, unicast, and duplex. It supports
    both reliable data \nstreaming and partial reliable messaging. The congestion
    control \nmodule is an open framework that can be used to implement and/or \ndeploy
    different control algorithms. UDT also has a native/default \ncontrol algorithm
    based on AIMD rate control.\n\t "

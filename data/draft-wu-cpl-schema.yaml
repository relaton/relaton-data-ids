  content: "This document provides an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema for\nthe
    Call Processing Language (CPL). The original CPL specification\nonly provides
    a Document Type Declaration (DTD) to describe the\nstructure of the language.
    Compared with XML DTDs, XML schemas have\nmany advantages such as performing stricter
    type checking, providing\npre-defined data types and being able to derive new
    data types from\nexisting ones.  We further split the CPL schema into two parts,
    one\ncontains elements common to all the telecommunication entities, such\nas
    user agents or presence agents. The other contains elements, such\nas 'proxy',
    specifically for network servers.\n\t "

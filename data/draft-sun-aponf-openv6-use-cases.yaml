  content: "   The IPv6 transition has been an ongoing process throughout the world\n
    \  due to the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space.  However, this\n   transition
    leads to costly end-to-end network upgrades and poses new\n   challenges of managing
    a large number of devices with a variety of\n   transitioning protocols.  While
    IPv6 transition tools exist, there\n   are still new issues exist.  Operators
    may need various types of IPv6\n   transition technologies depending on performance
    requirements,\n   deployment scenarios, etc.\n\n   To address these difficulties,
    a software defined unifying approach\n   would provide a unified way to deploy
    IPv6 in a cost-effective,\n   flexible manner.\n\n   This document describes use
    cases of IPv6 transition (Openv6) and\n   also requirements in APONF architecture.\n\n\t "

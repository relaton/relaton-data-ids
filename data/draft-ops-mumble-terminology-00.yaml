  content: "Policy Based Networking (PBN) is a topic of interest to many areas\nwithin
    the networking community. Initially considered for the\nimplementation and control
    of QoS services, several groups are\nlooking to deploy policy-based networks for
    a wider variety of\napplications, such as security and VPN. We have found, when
    trying\nto coordinate efforts of the different groups, that there are some\nmisunderstandings
    among the groups, some of which can be attributed\nto the different terminology
    that has propagated through the groups.\nIn this draft, we attempt to clear up
    some of these\nmisunderstandings, concentrating on PBN for Policy Provisioning\n(rap),
    Differentiated Services (diffserv), IP Security (ipsp), and\ngeneral Policy Framework
    (policy). The terminology discussed here is\nnot meant to be an exhaustive list
    of PBN-related terms and\nconcepts, but it is intended to represent at least the
    four areas\nmentioned.\nIt is NOT intended that this draft defines an architecture
    or\nframework for PBN _ each group is clearly qualified to define these\nfor themselves.
    Instead, we identify the terminology common to all\nPBN applications and suggest
    definitions, which are meaningful and\nuseful, yet general enough to be applicable
    across all PBN\napplications.\n\t "

  content: "\n   We discuss several methods that can be used to accelerate the \n
    \  verification step of ECC-based signature schemes. These include a \n   40%
    efficiency improvement of ordinary ECDSA signature verification \n   and even
    a factor 2.4x efficiency improvement when ECDSA certificate \n   verification
    is combined with the key computation step in Diffie-\n   Hellman-based  protocols,
    \ such  as  static-ECDH  and  ECMQV.  This \n   challenges the conventional wisdom
    that with ECC-based signature \n   schemes, signature verification is always considerably
    slower than \n   signature generation and slower than RSA signature verification.
    \n   Results apply to all prime curves standardized by NIST, the NSA \n   'Suite
    B' curves, and the so-called Brainpool curves.  \n\n   While the efficiency advantages
    of these methods are most apparent \n   for a slightly modified version of ECDSA,
    these can also be enjoyed \n   if the signer appends a small number of bits (\"side
    information\") to \n   standardized ECDSA signatures or generates these ECDSA
    signatures in \n   a particular \"fast verification friendly\" way. Since the
    latter can \n   be done as a post-processing operation by any third party, this
    does \n   not require changes to the standardized specifications of ECDSA (or,
    \n   e.g., recertification by a Certificate Authority). \n\t "

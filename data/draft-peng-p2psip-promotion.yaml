abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes extensions to RELOAD to support flexible\n   client
    promotion and demotion modes.  RELOAD aims at providing a\n   uniform protocol
    for both overlay clients and peers, where promotion\n   of a client to peer is
    triggered and completed at the client's\n   pleasure.  It is proposed that RELOAD
    provide a more restrictive\n   framework to enable passive promotion and demotion,
    where decisions\n   are made by the network rather than individual user-owned
    nodes.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies the TCP Low Latency option, which TCP\n   connections
    can use during the connection establishment handshake to\n   communicate extra
    parameters that can improve performance in low-\n   latency environments.  With
    the first such parameter, a TCP data\n   receiver can advertise a hint about the
    Maximum ACK Delay (MAD) it\n   will schedule for its own delayed ACK mechanism.
    \ This enables the\n   TCP data sender to achieve lower latencies during loss
    recovery by\n   using the Maximum ACK Delay advertised by the remote receiver
    to help\n   compute retransmission timeouts that are potentially much lower than\n
    \  would otherwise be feasible.  The Low Latency option is extensible,\n   and
    later versions of this draft will introduce other mechanisms,\n   including TCP
    timestamps with a finer granularity than those\n   supported by RFC 7323.\n\n\t "

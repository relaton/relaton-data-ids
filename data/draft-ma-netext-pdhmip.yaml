  content: "   This document explains how network mobility and DHCPv6-based Prefix\n
    \  Delegation works with hierarchy mobile IPv6.  It is an extension of\n   HMIPv6
    and allows a mobile network to attach to a MAP via a mobile\n   router.  It also
    makes use of the mechanism of DHCPv6PD to assign\n   mobile network prefix (es)
    to the mobile router which plays the role\n   of requesting router.\n\n\t "

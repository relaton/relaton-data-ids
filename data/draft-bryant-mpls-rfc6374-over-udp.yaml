  content: "   In draft-bryant-mpls-synonymous-flow-labels the concept of MPLS\n   synonymous
    flow labels (SFL) was introduced and it was shown how they\n   could be used to
    support RFC6374 loss measurements.  In draft-bryant-\n   mpls-sfl-control the
    request, lifetime management and withdrawal of\n   SFLs was described.  In this
    memo we show how these two protocols can\n   be run over UDP to support the operation
    of RFC6374 in systems that\n   do not support the Generic Associated Channel Label
    (GAL) (RFC5586).\n\n\t "

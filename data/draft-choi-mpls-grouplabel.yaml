  content: "As the group communication become more important, the special label \nshould
    be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. \nThe allocation
    mechanism of group label can be applied to a point-to-\nmultipoint communication
    in MPLS networks. Currently used label is \nlocally significant, while this special
    label should be common object \nwithin a single MPLS domain. This document specifies
    the allocation \nmechanism of group label in order to perform unidirectional point-to-\nmultipoint
    communication. \n                        \n\t "

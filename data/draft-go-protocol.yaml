abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a deterministic algorithm for resolving shortlinks
    (compact string identifiers) into fully-qualified URLs. The algorithm supports
    both absolute URL destinations and origin- relative internal redirects with loop
    protection. It defines deterministic precedence rules for combining query parameters
    and fragments from multiple sources during resolution, enabling consistent behavior
    across clients, servers, and command-line tools.</p>"

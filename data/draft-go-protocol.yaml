  content: "   This document specifies a deterministic algorithm for resolving\n   shortlinks
    (compact string identifiers) into fully-qualified URLs.\n   The algorithm supports
    both absolute URL destinations and origin-\n   relative internal redirects with
    loop protection.  It defines\n   deterministic precedence rules for combining
    query parameters and\n   fragments from multiple sources during resolution, enabling\n
    \  consistent behavior across clients, servers, and command-line tools.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a SCITT-based mechanism for creating verifiable
    records of AI content refusal events. It defines how refusal decisions can be
    encoded as SCITT Signed Statements, registered with Transparency Services, and
    verified by third parties using Receipts. This specification provides auditability
    of refusal decisions that are logged, not cryptographic proof that no unlogged
    generation occurred. It does not define content moderation policies, classification
    criteria, or what AI systems should refuse; it addresses only the audit trail
    mechanism. This revision (-01) incorporates lessons from the January 2026 Grok
    NCII incident, aligns with the CAP-SRP v1.0 specification, and addresses emerging
    regulatory requirements including EU AI Act Article 12/50 and the Korea AI Basic
    Act.</p>"

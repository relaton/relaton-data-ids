  content: "   This document explains how to interconnect IPv4 islands over a\n   Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv6-only core.  This\n   approach relies on IPv4
    Provider Edge routers (4PE), which are Dual\n   Stacks in order to connect to
    IPv4 islands and to the MPLS core.  The\n   4PE routers exchange the IPv4 reachability
    information transparently\n   over the core using the Multiprotocol Border Gateway
    Protocol (MP-\n   BGP).  MP-BGP is extended to do this.  A new Subsequence Address\n
    \  Family Identifier (SAFI) with corresponding new format Network Layer\n   Reachability
    Information (NLRI), is introduced.  The BGP Next Hop\n   field is used to convey
    the IPv4 address of the 4PE router, a field\n   is added in Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) to convey\n   the IPv6 address of the 4PE router, so that dynamically
    established\n   IPv6-signaled MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be used without\n
    \  explicit tunnel configuration.\n\n\n\t "

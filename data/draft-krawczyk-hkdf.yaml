  content: "This document specifies a simple Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)-based
    key derivation function (HKDF), which can be used as a building block in various
    protocols and applications.  The key derivation function (KDF) is intended to
    support a wide range of applications and requirements, and is conservative in
    its use of cryptographic hash functions.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

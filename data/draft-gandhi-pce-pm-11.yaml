abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss,
    delay, and delay variation, as well as bandwidth utilization, are critical measures
    for Traffic Engineering (TE). These data provide operators with the characteristics
    of their networks for the performance evaluation required to ensure the Service-Level
    Agreements (SLAs). The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations
    in response to Path Computation Clients' (PCCs') requests. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Traffic Engineering LSPs for Segment Routing (SR) and
    RSVP using PCEP. This document describes PCEP extensions for enabling and reporting
    end-to-end performance measurements and liveness detection for both PCE-Initiated
    and PCC-Initiated LSPs for SR-TE over MPLS and IPv6 data planes and MPLS-TE to
    an Active Stateful PCE.</p>"

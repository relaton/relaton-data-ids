abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   Like other internet activities, multicast is affected by the fact\n
    \  that the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is occurring over a period of\n   years,
    via multiple transition paths.  As a result, mechanisms need\n   to be added to
    the basic multicast architecture to assist in specific\n   transition scenarios.
    \ This document describes detailed use cases so\n   that the requirements for
    the multicast transition mechanisms can be\n   better understood.\n\n   The considered
    opinion in discussions to date on multicast transition\n   requirements has been
    that the two most important transition\n   scenarios in the near future will be
    the \"4-6-4\" and \"6-4\" network\n   scenarios.  These scenarios are described
    in detail below, in their\n   several possible variants, showing the new issues
    that IPv6\n   transition raises for multicast operation.\n\n   There is further
    general agreement that Any-Source Multicast (ASM)\n   (the service, not necessarily
    the technology) is no longer an\n   important use case.  As a result, this document
    restricts itself to\n   scenarios where the set of multicast sources is separate
    from the set\n   of multicast receivers.  As a final restriction, it assumes a
    single\n   administrative provider domain.\n\n\t "

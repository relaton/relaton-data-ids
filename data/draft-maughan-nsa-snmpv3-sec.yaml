- language: en

  content: "This document presents simpler and more secure \narchitectures for SNMPv3
    agents than the ones specified in RFCs\n2271-2275. Agent security is improved
    by restricting each\nmodule's access to data, using the 'principle of least\nprivilege'.
    The new agent architectures are analyzed in terms of\nsoftware complexity as well
    as security, and are shown in some\nrespects to be simpler. Finally, an implementation
    \nprototype of this architecture is presented.\n\n\n\t "

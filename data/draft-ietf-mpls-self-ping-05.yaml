  content: "   When certain RSVP-TE optimizations are implemented, ingress LSRs can\n
    \  receive RSVP RESV messages before forwarding state has been installed\n   on
    all downstream nodes.  According to the RSVP-TE specification, the\n   ingress
    LSR can forward traffic through an LSP as soon as it receives\n   a RESV message.
    \ However, if the ingress LSR forwards traffic through\n   the LSP before forwarding
    state has been installed on all downstream\n   nodes, traffic can be lost.\n\n
    \  This document describes LSP Self-ping.  When an ingress LSR receives\n   an
    RESV message, it can invoke LSP Self-ping procedures to ensure\n   that forwarding
    state has been installed on all downstream nodes.\n\n   LSP Self-ping is a new
    protocol.  It is not an extension of LSP Ping.\n   Although LSP Ping and LSP Self-ping
    are named similarly, each is\n   designed for a unique purpose.  Each protocol
    listens on its own UDP\n   port and executes its own procedures.\n\n   LSP Self-ping
    is an extremely light-weight mechanism.  It does not\n   consume control plane
    resources on transit or egress LSRs.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "In some Mobile IPv6 deployments, identifying the mobile node or the mobility
    service subscriber is not enough to distinguish between multiple services possibly
    provisioned to the said mobile node and its mobility service subscription.  A
    capability to specify different services in addition to the mobile node identity
    can be leveraged to provide flexibility for mobility service providers on provisioning
    multiple services to one mobility service subscription.  This document describes
    a Service Selection Mobility Option for both conventional Mobile IPv6 and Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 that is intended to assist home agents to make a specific service
    selection for the mobility service subscription during the binding registration
    procedure.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

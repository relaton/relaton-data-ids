  content: "   The number and types of devices that are Internet connected continues\n
    \  to grow.  Sensors, appliances, utility meters, medical devices etc.\n   are
    Internet connected for various reasons.  Many of these newer\n   devices are constrained
    in terms of processing power, memory,\n   communication capability and, available
    power.  Devices such as\n   sensors and similar very small devices often lack
    a proper user\n   interface and hence configuring even the most basic parameters
    for\n   enabling Internet connectivity on these is extremely difficult.  Some\n
    \  of the existing configuration protocols can help in autoconfiguring\n   various
    parameters of the IP stack needed for Internet connectivity.\n   However this
    is not sufficient if the devices are using a web service\n   application.  There
    is a need for additional information such as\n   service provider name and username/password
    etc. for authentication\n   etc.  A configuration protocol solution for resource
    constrained\n   devices is needed in order to enable the potential enabled by\n
    \  Internet connectivity.  This document outlines the use cases and\n   requirements
    for user friendly configuration of such information on a\n   constrained device,
    and specifies a Constrained Application Protocol\n   (CoAP) based mechanism to
    meet the requirements.\n\n\t "

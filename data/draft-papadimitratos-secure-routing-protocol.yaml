  content: "This document describes the Secure Routing Protocol (SRP), a route discovery
    protocol for ad hoc networks that mitigates the detrimental effects of maliciously
    behaving nodes that disrupt the route discovery in order to obstruct or disable
    the network operation. Our protocol provides correct routing information; i.e.,
    factual, up-to-date and authentic connectivity information regarding a pair of
    nodes that wish to communicate in a secure manner. The sole requirement is that
    any two such end nodes have a security association. \nAccordingly, SRP does not
    require that any of the intermediate nodes perform cryptographic operations or
    have a prior association with the end nodes. The end-to-end operation of SRP allows
    for efficient cryptographic mechanisms, such as message authentication codes.
    More importantly, SRP can be used in a wide range of MANET instances, without
    restrictive assumptions on the underlying trust, network size and membership.\n\t "

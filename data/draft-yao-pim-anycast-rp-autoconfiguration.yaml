  content: "\n   Anycast RP (Rendezvous Point) is widely supported by router \n   vendors.
    \ Each RP in the anycast RP set is configured with the RP \n   Address (RPA),
    and the addresses of all members/routers in the \n   anycast-RP set.  If the number
    of anycast RP members is more than 1, \n   manual configuration of RP information
    is prone to inconsistency \n   which can cause connectivity problems, especially
    when the addresses \n   are IPv6 address or the members of anycast RP set need
    to be changed \n   (e.g.some new members are added, or some old members are removed
    from\n   the anycast RP set).  Aiming to this problem, this document provides\n
    \  a mechanism to automatically configure anycast RP members/routers.  \n   In
    this mechanism,only one RP member/router in the anycast RP set \n   needs to be
    configured firstly, so it knows the anycast RP address \n   and the addresses
    of all members in the anycast RP set. It sends \n   anycast RP configuration information
    (including the anycast RP \n   address and an address list) to each of other member
    in the \n   anycast-RP set.  Other members will check the information and \n   configure
    itself after receiving the anycast RP configuration \n   information,and respond
    the firstly configured RP with checking \n   results and configuration results.\n\t "

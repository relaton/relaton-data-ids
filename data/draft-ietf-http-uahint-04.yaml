  content: "   This document proposes a HTTP response header called UA-Hint, which\n
    \  can be used by applications (servers) to describe handling hints\n   which
    will allow user agents to more accurately reflect the intent of\n   the web application
    designer for the handling and presentation of the\n   response entity.  The UA-Hint
    header is intended to be an extensible\n   general mechanism by which the application
    can suggest user agent\n   behaviors which alter or extend the behaviors specified
    in HTTP/1.1\n   (RFC 2068) with the express purpose of improving the usability
    of the\n   resulting application.  Intended considerations include enablement
    of\n   a safe POST and refined handling of the traditional history buffer.\n\t "

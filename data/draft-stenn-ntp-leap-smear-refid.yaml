  content: "   Leap Seconds are part of UTC.  NTP timestamps are based on POSIX\n
    \  timestamps, which require each day to have exactly 86,400 seconds per\n   day.
    \ Some applications and environments choose to \"smear\" leap\n   second corrections
    over a period that can last up to 24 hours' time,\n   and implement NTP servers
    that offer smeared time to clients asking\n   them for the time.\n\n   Both NTP
    clients and operators have no current way to tell if an NTP\n   server is offering
    leap-smeared time or not.  This is a problem.\n\n   Similarly, an NTP server may
    choose to offer leap-smeared time to\n   clients that do not appear to know that
    a leap event is in-process.\n   This is a problem.\n\n   This proposal offers
    a mechanism that provides a simple and clean\n   solution to problems, by giving
    a way that clients (and operators)\n   can trivially ask for leap-smeared time
    and detect a server that is\n   offering leap-smeared time.\n\n\t "

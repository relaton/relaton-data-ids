  content: "This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier\n
    \   4, the Small-Packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in\n    the
    Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  CCID 4 is for\n    experimental
    use, and uses TFRC-SP [TFRC-SP], a Small-Packet (SP)\n    variant of TFRC designed
    for applications that send small packets.\n    The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve
    roughly the same bandwidth in\n    bits per second (bps) as a TCP flow using packets
    of up to 1500\n    bytes but experiencing the same level of congestion.  CCID
    4 is for\n    experimental use for senders that send small packets and would like\n
    \   a TCP-friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion\n    Notification
    (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.\n\t "

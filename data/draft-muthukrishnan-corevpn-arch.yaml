  content: "      This draft presents an approach for building core VPN services in\n
    \     the service provider backbone, as described in [Heinanen].  This\n      approach
    does not depend on MPLS running in the backbone but will\n      benefit from it.
    The central vision is for the service provider to\n      provide a virtual router
    service to their customers. Ease of\n      configuration, dynamic neighbor discovery,
    scaling and the use of\n      existing routing protocols as they exist today without
    any\n      modifications are the keystones of this architecture.\n\n\t "

  content: "In the framework document <draft-irtf-smug-framework-00.txt>, \nthe Secure
    Multicast Group (SMuG) has identified three functionalities \nthat deal with security
    transformations for the multicasted \ndata. These are data encryption, source
    authentication, and group \nauthentication. This document expands on the issues
    to be taken \ninto consideration when designing transforms that realize these
    \nfunctionalities. These issues include the order of applying the \ntransforms,
    their placement in the  communication layers, possible \naggregation of several
    functionalities in a single transform, and \nthe relationships with other protocols
    (such as reliable multicast \nprotocols). Next a specific design is proposed,
    that attempts to meet \nthe requirements of prominent application in a simple
    yet flexible way. \n\n\t "

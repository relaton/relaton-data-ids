  content: "   This document defines several mechanisms which can be used by a\n   client
    such as a Mail User Agent or Mail Submission Agent, to query\n   an SMTP server
    which is configured to accept incoming mail for a mail\n   domain, to obtain information
    associated with an email address based\n   in that domain.  Among other purposes,
    these mechanisms are intended\n   to facilitate discovery of senders' and/or recipients'
    public keys\n   for use in automatic verification of whole-message digital signatures\n
    \  and automatic whole-message encryption of email sent to recipients.\n\n\t "

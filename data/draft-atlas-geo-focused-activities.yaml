  content: "   The IETF has a variety of activities beyond those that are part of\n
    \  the standards process.  IETF activities that aren't part of the\n   standards
    process are still quite useful for the IETF mission.  Some\n   of these activities,
    such as IETF hackathons, tutorials, and\n   mentoring, occur at in-person meetings.
    \ There has been and continues\n   to be interest in having such activities located
    in different\n   geographical areas.\n\n   The document defines how the IETF organizes
    our Geographically-\n   Focused Activities.  It is intended for eventual publication
    as a BCP\n   but this is currently an initial strawman proposal based upon the\n
    \  existing variety of experience with the experimental activities in\n   this
    space over the past several years.\n\n\t "

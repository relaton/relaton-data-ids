  content: "This memo discusses the relationship between the packet sampling \n(PSAMP)
    Working Group and the IP flow information export (IPFIX) \nWorking Group.  The
    goals of writing this memo are: avoiding \nduplication of work, increase mutual
    benefits between the groups, \nand harmonize the documents and standards developed
    by the groups. \nTherefore, potential overlap of both group's activities is analyzed,
    \nactivities in both groups that potentially complement each other are \npointed
    out, and common issues are listed that should be harmonized \nbetween the groups.
    \n \n\t "

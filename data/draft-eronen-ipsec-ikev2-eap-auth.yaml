- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IKEv2 specifies that EAP authentication must be used together with\npublic
    key signature based responder authentication.  This is\nnecessary with old EAP
    methods that provide only unilateral\nauthentication using, e.g., one-time passwords
    or token cards.\n\nThis document specifies how EAP methods that provide mutual\nauthentication
    and key agreement can be used to provide extensible\nresponder authentication
    for IKEv2 based on methods other than public\nkey signatures.\n\t "

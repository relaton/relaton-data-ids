  content: "DHCPv4 (RFC 2131) is a stable, widely used protocol for \nconfiguration
    of host systems in a TCP/IPv4 network.  It did not \nprovide for authentication
    of clients and servers, nor did it \nprovide for data confidentiality.  This is
    reflected in the original \n\"Security Considerations\" section of RFC 2131, which
    identifies a \nfew threats and leaves development of any defenses against those
    \nthreats to future work.  In about 1995, DHCP security began to \nattract attention
    from the Internet community, eventually resulting \nin the publication of RFC
    3118 in 2001.  Although RFC 3118 was a \nmandatory prerequisite for the DHCPv4
    Reconfigure Extension, RFC \n3203, it has had no known usage by any commercial
    or private \nimplementation since its adoption.  The DHC Working Group adopted
    a \nwork item for 2003 to review and modify or replace RFC 3118 to \nafford a
    workable, easily deployed security mechanism for DHCPv4.  \nThis memo provides
    a threat analysis of the Dynamic Host \nConfiguration Protocol for Ipv4 (DHCPv4)
    for use both as RFC 2131 \nadvances from Draft Standard to Full Standard and to
    support our \nchartered work improving the acceptance and deployment of RFC 3118.\n\t "

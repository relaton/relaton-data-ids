  content: "   EVPN enables all-active multi-homing for a CE (Customer Equipment)\n
    \  device connected to two or more PE (Provider Equipment) devices via a\n   LAG
    (Link Aggregation), such that bridged and routed traffic from\n   remote PEs to
    hosts attached to the Ethernet Segment can be equally\n   load balanced (it uses
    Equal Cost Multi Path) across the multi-homing\n   PEs.  EVPN also enables multi-homing
    for IP subnets advertised in IP\n   Prefix routes, so that routed traffic from
    remote PEs to those IP\n   subnets can be load balanced.  This document defines
    extensions to\n   EVPN procedures to optimally handle unequal access bandwidth\n
    \  distribution across a set of multi-homing PEs in order to:\n\n   *  provide
    greater flexibility, with respect to adding or removing\n      individual multi-homed
    PE-CE links.\n\n   *  handle multi-homed PE-CE link failures that can result in
    unequal\n      PE-CE access bandwidth across a set of multi-homing PEs.\n\n   In
    order to achieve the above, it specifies signaling extensions and\n   procedures
    to:\n\n   *  Loadbalance bridged and routed traffic across egress PEs in\n      proportion
    to PE-CE link bandwidth or a generalized weight\n      distribution.\n\n   *  Achieve
    BUM (Broadcast, UnknownUnicast, Multicast) DF (Designated\n      Forwarder) election
    distribution for a given ES (Ethernet Segment)\n      across the multi-homing
    PE set in proportion to PE-CE link\n      bandwidth.  Section 6 of this document
    further updates [RFC8584],\n      [EVPN-PER-MCAST-FLOW-DF], and [EVPN-DF-PREF]
    in order for the DF\n      election extension defined in this document to work
    across\n      different DF election algorithms.\n\n   NOTE TO IESG (TO BE DELETED
    BEFORE PUBLISHING): This draft lists six\n   authors which is above the required
    limit of five.  Given significant\n   and active contributions to the draft from
    all six authors over the\n   course of six years, we would like to request IESG
    to allow\n   publication with six authors.  Specifically, the three Cisco authors\n
    \  are the original inventors of these procedures and contributed\n   heavily
    to rev 0 draft, most of which is still intact.  AT&T is also\n   a key contributor
    towards defining the use cases that this document\n   addresses as well as the
    proposed solution.  Authors from Nokia and\n   Juniper have further contributed
    to revisions and discussions\n   steadily over last six years to enable respective
    implementations and\n   a wider adoption.\n\n\t "

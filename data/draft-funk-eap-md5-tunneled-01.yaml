  script: Latn
  content: "EAP-MD5-Tunneled is an EAP protocol designed for use as an inner \nauthentication
    protocol within a tunneling EAP protocol such as EAP-\nTTLS or EAP-PEAP. It is
    cryptographically equivalent to standard \nCHAP and the EAP-MD5-Challenge protocol.
    It can be used inside an \nEAP tunnel without exposing the system to the type
    of man-in-the-\nmiddle attack which use of CHAP or the original MD5 Challenge
    \nprotocol is subject to, yet it is capable of being converted to CHAP \ncredentials
    at the tunneling endpoint for proxy forwarding to legacy \nAAA servers, with no
    modification required of the legacy AAA server.  \nIt may also be converted to
    EAP-MD5-Challenge credentials at the \ntunneling endpoint for the purpose of proxy;
    however, the downstream \nserver that terminates the EAP-MD5-Challenge must be
    modified to \nprovide a challenge that meets certain criteria.\n\t "

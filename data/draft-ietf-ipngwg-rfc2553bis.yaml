  content: "The de facto standard Application Program Interface (API) for TCP/IP applications
    is the \"sockets\" interface.  Although this API was developed for Unix in the
    early 1980s it has also been implemented on a wide variety of non-Unix systems.
    \ TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed a
    high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6 applications.
    \ But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes
    these changes.  These include a new socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses,
    new address conversion functions, and some new socket options.  These extensions
    are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required by TCP and
    UDP applications, including multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change
    into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications.
    \ Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access to
    the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

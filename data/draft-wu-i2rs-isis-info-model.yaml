  content: "   IS-IS is a widely deployed link-state protocol in routing networks.\n
    \  During the past decades, it has been operated and maintained through\n   typical
    CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.  With the expansion and complication\n   of modern networks,
    the necessity for rapid and dynamic control has\n   been increased.  The I2RS
    is a standard-based interface which\n   provides a programmatic way to achieve
    this goal.\n\n   This document specifies an information model for the IS-IS protocol\n
    \  to facilitate the definition of a standardized data model, which can\n   be
    used to define interfaces to the IS-IS from an entity that may\n   even be external
    to the routing system.  Based on standardized data\n   model and interfaces, use
    cases of IGP protocols defined by I2RS-WG\n   can be supported.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an abstract programming interface to the\n
    \  transport layer, following the Transport Services Architecture.  It\n   supports
    the asynchronous, atomic transmission of messages over\n   transport protocols
    and network paths dynamically selected at\n   runtime.  It is intended to replace
    the traditional BSD sockets API\n   as the lowest common denominator interface
    to the transport layer, in\n   an environment where endpoints have multiple interfaces
    and potential\n   transport protocols to select from.\n\n\t "

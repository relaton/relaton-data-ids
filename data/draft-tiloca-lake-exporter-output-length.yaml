  content: "   The lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol Ephemeral Diffie-\n
    \  Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) allows two peers to compute a shared secret\n   session
    key.  Once the session key is available, the two peers can\n   use the EDHOC_Exporter
    interface, e.g., to derive keying material for\n   an application protocol.  This
    document defines an in-band approach\n   that can be used by the two peers to
    agree about the lengths of the\n   outputs produced with the EDHOC_Exporter interface.
    \ The defined\n   approach relies on an EDHOC External Authorization Data (EAD)
    item\n   that can be exchanged in the first two EDHOC messages of an EDHOC\n   session.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a simple extension to the Path Computation\n
    \  Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) using which a PCEP\n   speaker
    can enforce one or more policies on the other PCEP speaker.\n   A policy is represented
    by a numeric value which can be interpreted\n   only by the receiving PCEP speaker.
    \ Using the proposed extension, a\n   path computation client (PCC) can signal
    one or more policies that\n   must be taken into consideration by a PCE during
    path computation.\n   Similarly, when initiating or updating a path, a stateful
    PCE can\n   signal one or more policies (e.g., traffic steering rules) that a
    PCC\n   is expected to apply to the path.\n\n\n\t "

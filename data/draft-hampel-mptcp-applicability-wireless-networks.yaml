  content: "   This document analyses the applicability of Multipath TCP to wireless\n
    \  access networks with overlapping coverage area, and it discusses\n   potential
    protocol extensions that aim to improve operation in such\n   environments.  The
    analysis attempts to identify use cases, benefits\n   as well as technical and
    functional obstacles encountered in the\n   current version of the protocol.  Based
    on this analysis,\n   recommendations are made on feature-, signaling- and policy\n
    \  extensions that promise to enhance Multipath-TCP's value, versatility\n   and
    market acceptance in wireless access networks.\n\n\n\n\t "

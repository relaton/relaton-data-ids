  content: "   This document provides an interoperable specification for Merkle tree\n
    \  ladder (MTL) mode, a technique for using an underlying signature\n   scheme
    to authenticate an evolving series of messages.  MTL mode can\n   reduce the signature
    scheme's operational impact.  Rather than\n   signing messages individually, the
    MTL mode of operation signs\n   structures called \"Merkle tree ladders\" that
    are derived from the\n   messages to be authenticated.  Individual messages are
    then\n   authenticated relative to the ladder using a Merkle tree\n   authentication
    path and the ladder is authenticated using the public\n   key of the underlying
    signature scheme.  The size and computational\n   cost of the underlying signatures
    are thereby amortized across\n   multiple messages, reducing the scheme's operational
    impact.  The\n   reduction can be particularly beneficial when MTL mode is applied
    to\n   a post-quantum signature scheme that has a large signature size or\n   computational
    cost.  As an example, the document shows how to use MTL\n   mode with SPHINCS+,
    the stateless hash-based signature scheme\n   selected by NIST for standardization.
    \ Like other Merkle tree\n   techniques, MTL mode's security is based only on
    cryptographic hash\n   functions, so the mode is quantum-safe based on the quantum-\n
    \  resistance of its cryptographic hash functions.\n\n\t "

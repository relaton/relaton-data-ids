  content: "   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n   mechanisms
    to support the next generation of emergency calls  placed\n   by vehicles (automatically
    in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle
    occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the
    crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n
    \  (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\" (AACN), even in the\n   case
    of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers to the\n   ability to carry
    a richer set of data.\n\n   This document also registers a MIME Content Type and
    an Emergency\n   Call Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location
    data\n   (often referred to as \"crash data\" even though there is not\n   necessarily
    a crash).\n\n   Profiling and simplifications are possible due to the nature of
    the\n   functionality that is provided in vehicles with the usage of Global\n
    \  Satellite Navigation System (GNSS).\n\n\t "

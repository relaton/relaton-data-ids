  content: "   Several MANET routing protocols have been recently promoted to\n   experimental
    RFCs.  However, autoconfiguration of MANET networks is\n   still an unsettled
    area.  This document proposes a protocol for\n   autoconfiguration for both IPv4
    or IPv6.  Its corner stone is an\n   conflict-detection algorithm.  It aims at
    conceptual simplicity:\n   essentially, each node periodically sends its addresses
    and an\n   identifier.  Conflicts are detected as identifier mismatches.  This\n
    \  protocol might be used with any MANET protocol, although it naturally\n   suits
    the OLSR routing protocol (on which we focus), with a light\n   increase of control
    message overhead.\n\t "

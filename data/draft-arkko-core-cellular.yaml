  content: "   This memo discusses the use of the Constrained Application Protocol\n
    \  (CoAP) protocol in building sensors and other devices that employ\n   cellular
    networks as a communications medium.  Building communicating\n   devices that
    employ these networks is obviously well known, but this\n   memo focuses specifically
    on techniques necessary to minimize power\n   consumption.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple\n   communication
    networks based on different technology implementations\n   and network architectures
    like WiFi, LTE, DSL.  In such multi-\n   connectivity scenario, it is desirable
    to combine multiple access\n   networks or select the best one to improve quality
    of experience for\n   a user and improve overall network utilization and efficiency.
    \ This\n   document presents the control plane protocols, as well as describes\n
    \  control plane procedures for configuring the user plane in a multi\n   access
    management services (MAMS) framework that can be used to\n   flexibly select the
    combination of uplink and downlink access and\n   core network paths, and user
    plane treatment for improving network\n   efficiency and enhanced application
    quality of experience.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol\n   supports
    creation and management of identity resources such as users\n   between a client
    and a service provider.  In some instances, a SCIM\n   service provider may maintain
    a list of DNS domains that an\n   organization using that service has registered
    for their exclusive\n   use with the service.  This registration of domains is
    frequently\n   tied to some form of ownership verification for each domain.  This\n
    \  document defines an extension to the SCIM protocol introducing a new\n   'VerifiedDomains'
    resource type in order to allow a SCIM client to\n   confirm what domains have
    had ownership verified by the SCIM service\n   provider, as well as some information
    about whether the User\n   resource's userName and emails attributes require domain
    verification\n   in order for a value to possess that domain suffix.\n\n\t "

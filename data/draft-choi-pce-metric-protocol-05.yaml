- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In this draft, we propose an analysis of a Path Computation \n   Element
    Metric Protocol (PCEMP) that acts as a generic computation\n   model for path
    based metrics in large multi-domain or multi-layer\n   networks. The mechanism
    that is described in this draft is generic\n   and can serve as an application
    path computation framework for any\n   Path Computation Element (PCE). We describe
    a protocol message\n   format for PCE-PCC and PCE-PCE communications derived from
    this \n   computation model. \n\n   This draft proposes to elucidate protocol
    independent metrics\n   defining path quality measurement criteria, algorithm
    complexity\n   and scalability criteria related to path computation techniques
    \n   through the PCEMP along with a PCE peer communication protocol \n   and is
    in line with the PCE WG Charter. \n\t "

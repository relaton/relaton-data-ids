  content: "This memo describes a format for security advisories. An advisory is\na
    document describing a vulnerability of a program, an operating\nsystem or, more
    generally, a software or hardware component of the\ninformation system.\n\nThis
    specification tries to minimize changes in issuer and readers\ncurrent practices
    (messages style), and by trying to help a program\nre-read the advisory tries
    also to keep advisories easily and friendly readable by humans.  It focuses on
    structure of documents.\n\nThis specification is primarily useful for advisories
    issuers such as\nCSIRTs [RFC2350] and users and is linked with intrusion detection.\n\n\t "

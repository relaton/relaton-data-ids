  script: Latn
  content: "   In the context of BGPsec, a withdrawal suppression occurs when an\n
    \  adversary AS suppresses a prefix withdrawal with the intension of\n   continuing
    to attract traffic for that prefix based on a previous\n   (signed and valid)
    BGPsec announcement that was earlier propagated.\n   Subsequently if the adversary
    AS had a BGPsec session reset with a\n   neighboring BGPsec speaker and when the
    session is restored, the AS\n   replays said previous BGPsec announcement (even
    though it was\n   withdrawn), then such a replay action is called a replay attack.
    \ The\n   BGPsec protocol should incorporate a method for protection from\n   Replay
    Attack and Withdrawal Suppression (RAWS), at least to control\n   the window of
    exposure.  This informational document provides design\n   discussion and comparison
    of multiple alternative RAWS protection\n   mechanisms weighing their pros and
    cons.  This is meant to be a\n   companion document to the standards track draft-ietf-sidrops-bgpsec-\n
    \  rollover that will specify a method to be used with BGPsec for RAWS\n   protection.\n\n\t "

  content: "Recent years have seen electronic mail becomes the first mode of \ncommunication.
    Electronic mail allows users to exchange information \nusing different formats
    such as files, pictures, videos and text \nmessages. Electronic mail is quicker
    and faster than other modes of \ncommunication but it generates more problems,
    such as email bombing, \nemail virus, email spoofing, anonymous email, relaying
    email and in \nparticular spam email. \nThis Internet Draft aims at solving or
    reducing the above problems \nby proposing a new transfer protocol, Authenticated
    Mail Transfer \nProtocol. Authenticated Mail Transfer Protocol is a second modified
    \nversion of the current transfer protocol, Simple Mail Transfer \nProtocol. It
    identifies a sender, differentiates a server from a \nuser, changes the electronic
    mail structure and improves the \nelectronic mail transaction. \n\n\t "

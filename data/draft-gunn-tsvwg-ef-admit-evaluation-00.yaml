  content: "\n   A new Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), EF-ADMIT, has been
    \n   recommended for a class of real-time traffic conforming to the \n   Expedited
    Forwarding (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB) and admitted using a \n   strong Call Admission
    Control (CAC) procedure incorporating capacity \n   assurance, as compared to
    a class of real-time traffic conforming to \n   the EF PHB but not subject to
    strong CAC.  This document presents \n   modeling results demonstrating that EF-ADMIT
    traffic will experience \n   low packet drop rates even when lack of strong CAC
    results in EF \n   traffic experiencing high packet drop rates.  The modeling
    shows the\n   performance benefit is material at low to medium network access
    \n   speeds (e.g., 256 Kb/s to 1.5 Mb/s), but relatively inconsequential \n   at
    high access speeds (e.g., 45 Mb/s) and, by inference, backbone \n   speeds (100Mb/s
    and higher) where more bandwidth headroom is assumed.  \n   Furthermore, mixing
    relatively long packets (e.g., 1500 byte video \n   packets) with relatively short
    packets (e.g., 200 byte voice packets) \n   in EF PHB causes significant degradation
    to short packet performance\n   at low to medium access speeds.  Finally, the
    results show that \n   implementation can be effective utilizing either one queue
    with \n   combined EF and EF-ADMIT flows, or two queues with one forEF-ADMIT \n
    \  flows and one for EF flows, with the choice of approach mostly a \n   matter
    of policy.\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "To support real-time services such as VoIP in Mobile IPv4/v6, several\nfast
    handover methods have been proposed. The fast handover method\nusing BET is one
    of them and was chosen as an alternate protocol to\nFMIPv6 version 4. BET has
    advantage in reducing the handover latency\nbecause it does not perform the layer
    3 registration. However, the\nlong BET in certain situation could be not acceptable.
    In that case,\na mechanism is needed to limit the tunnel length of BET. In this\ndraft,
    we propose to group the ARs by predefined value to limit the\ntunnel length of
    BET. An anchor router is changed whenever a MN\nchanges its associated group.\n\n\n\t "

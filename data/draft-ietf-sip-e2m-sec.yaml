  script: Latn
  content: "   Some services provided by intermediaries depend on their ability to\n
    \  inspect a message body in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n   When sensitive
    information is included in the message body, a SIP\n   User Agent (UA) needs to
    protect it from other intermediaries than\n   those that the UA agreed to disclose
    it to.  This document proposes a\n   mechanism for securing information passed
    between an end user and\n   intermediaries using S/MIME.  It also proposes mechanisms
    for a UA to\n   discover intermediaries which need to inspect an S/MIME-secured\n
    \  message body, or to receive the message body with data integrity\n\n   This
    specification is approved at the proposed standards level due to\n   the IANA
    registration requirements.  Is is of sufficient quality for\n   that level, however,
    the use of this mechanism in this specification\n   are considered experimental.\n\n\t "

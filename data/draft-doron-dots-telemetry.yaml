  content: "   This document aims to enrich DOTS Signaling with various telemetry\n
    \  attributes allowing optimal DDoS/DoS attack mitigation.  The nature\n   of
    the DOTS architecture is to allow DOTS Agents to be integrated in\n   highly diverse
    environments.  Therefore, the DOTS architecture\n   imposes a significant challenge
    in delivering optimal mitigation\n   services.  The DOTS Telemetry covered in
    this document aims to\n   provide all needed attributes and feedback signaled
    from DOTS Agents\n   such that optimal mitigation services can be delivered based
    on DOTS\n   Signaling.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the reservation of the IPv6 address block 44::/16
    for use by the Amateur Radio Digital Communications network (44Net, also known
    as AMPRNet). 44Net has historically used IPv4 network 44.0.0.0/8 as a globally-unique
    space for amateur radio digital communications. We present the rationale for an
    IPv6 counterpart, detailing the unique technical and social characteristics of
    44Net that distinguish it from the commercial Internet, and the global public
    service it enables. While 44Net operates under amateur radio licensing and usage
    policies (non- commercial, experimental use by licensed operators), the proposed
    IPv6 block will be part of the global Internet routing table to facilitate interoperability,
    gateways, and research. This document includes background on 44Net, justification
    for the 44::/16 allocation, technical requirements (routing and DNS considerations),
    and the IANA action requested to reserve 44::/16 for Amateur Radio use as a special-purpose
    IPv6 prefix.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes MIME types as per the rules defined in RFC\n
    \  2048 [2] for application/SCCP and application/TCAP objects, for use\n   in
    SIP applications. These MIME definitions will be typically used\n   in deployments
    where interworking to the PSTN is required for call\n   related and non-call related
    messages exchanged using services of\n   SCCP and TCAP SS7 stack layers.\n\t "

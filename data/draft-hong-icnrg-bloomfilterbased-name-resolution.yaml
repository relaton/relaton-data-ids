abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "  In information-centric networking (ICN), uniquely identifiable and\n
    \ location independent names are assigned directly to the named data\n  which
    raises scalability issues and they get even worse with flat\n  names. Accordingly,
    name resolution system required for lookup-by-\n  name routing in ICN has to be
    designed to scale, also considering\n  mobility support. In this draft, a bloom
    filter-based flat name\n  resolution system (B-NRS) is proposed where the bloom
    filter as an\n  aggregated form of names and hierarchical structure of the B-NRS
    are\n  exploited to address the scalability issues.\n\n\t "

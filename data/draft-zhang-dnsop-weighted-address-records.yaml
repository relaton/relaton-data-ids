  content: "   Scheduling traffic in proportion to different nodes can optimize\n
    \  bandwidth utilization and improve user experience when the Internet\n   traffic
    exceeds the bandwidth limit of a CDN cache node.  This\n   document defines AX
    and AAAAX RR types by adding weight field to\n   existing A and AAAA resource
    records.  A group of weighted records\n   will be sorted in the DNS response according
    to the weight in AX and\n   AAAAX records.\n\n\t "

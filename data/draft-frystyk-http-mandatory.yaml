  script: Latn
  content: "       HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities\n
    \      than the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging from\n       distributed
    authoring, collaboration, and printing, to various remote\n       procedure call
    mechanisms. This document proposes the use of a\n       mandatory extension mechanism
    designed to address the tension between\n       private agreement and public specification
    and to accommodate\n       extension of applications such as HTTP clients, servers,
    and proxies.\n       The proposal associates each extension with a URI[2], and
    use a few\n       new RFC 822[1] style header fields to carry the extension identifier\n
    \      and related information between the parties involved in an extended\n       transaction.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document introduces a Wireless Channel Model Based rate control\nscheme
    for improving the behavior of real time multimedia streams\nwith TFRC [2] in wireless-wired
    heterogeneous networks.  Based on\nwireless channel characteristics, the method
    can first identify the\nlevel of packet losses of two different types by sending
    large and\nsmall packets alternately, then adopt different adaptive rate control\nstrategies
    to increase the network throughput and decrease congestion\npacket loss rate,
    to improve transmission quality of real-time\nmultimedia stream.  The proposed
    method is compared with previously\nreported algorithms [3-4] by simulation.  It
    is shown from the\nsimulation results in different network topology environments,
    the\nperformance the proposed algorithm is better than existing algorithms\nin
    the aspects of network bandwidth utilization and congestion packet\nloss control.
    \ Parts of this method published in the IEEE Wireless\nCommunications and Networking
    Conference (WCNC2007) and in a pending\nChina patent (access number: CN101686100).\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7
    \n   MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the \n
    \  services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Some parts of \n   the
    specification are unclear that may lead to misinterpretations \n   that may impair
    interoperability between different implementations. \n   RFC 4666 doesn't define
    the application of IPSTP-IPSEP interface. For \n   the signalling network management
    function, messages and procedures, \n   it needs more contributes. \n\n   This
    document provides clarifications and amendments to RFC 4666. \n\n\t "

  content: "   The IETF Network Slice service aims to meet the connectivity demands\n
    \  of a network slice customer with specific Service Level Objectives\n   (SLOs)
    and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay\n   network.  A Network
    Resource Partition (NRP) is a set of network\n   resources that are allocated
    from the underlay network to carry a\n   specific set of network traffic and meet
    the required SLOs and SLEs.\n   One or multiple IETF Network Slice services can
    be mapped to one NRP.\n\n   As the demand for IETF Network Slice services increases,
    scalability\n   would become an important factor for the large scale deployment
    of\n   IETF Network Slices.  Although the scalability of IETF Network Slices\n
    \  can be improved by mapping a group of IETF Network Slices to one NRP,\n   there
    are concerns about the scalability of NRPs.  This document\n   describes the scalability
    considerations about NRPs in the network\n   control plane and data plane, and
    some optimization mechanisms are\n   proposed.\n\n\t "

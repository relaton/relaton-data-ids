  content: "This memo is informational.  It specifies a clarification of the meaning
    and use of the STATUS clause in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management
    Information Base (MIB) modules, which are defined by the Structure of Management
    Information (SMI).  There are two versions of the SMI.  The first, called SMIv1,
    is defined by RFCs 1155[1],  1212[2], and 1215[3].  The second, called SMIv2,
    is defined by RFCs 1902[4], 1903[5], and 1904[6].  Many of the MIB module constructs
    defined by the SMIs such as OBJECT-IDENTITY, OBJECT-TYPE, and NOTIFICATION-TYPE
    contain the STATUS clause.  However, the SMIs do not provide a complete definition
    of the STATUS clause, nor do they provide guidance to MIB designers and users
    on the interpretation and action required dependent upon the value or change of
    value for a STATUS clause.  Users include agent and application developers, and
    operators of SNMP-managed networks.                        This memo specifies
    a clarification for both version 1 and version 2 of the SNMP SMI, which is a standard
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "In many protocols, such as IP Paging [1] and PANA [2], there is the\nneed
    for the user to discover an agent in the network: In IP Paging,\nthe user first
    needs to discover the address of the Paging agent in\norder to perform Paging
    registration, Paging Area Update and other\npaging procedures. In the same way,
    in PANA, the user first needs to\ndiscover the PANA Authentication Agent to know
    where to send its\ncredential.  This document describes an efficient method for
    a user\nto discover one, or many agents in the network.\n\n\t "

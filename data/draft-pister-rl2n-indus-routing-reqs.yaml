  content: "Wireless, low power field devices enable industrial users to\nsignificantly
    increase the amount of information collected and the\nnumber of control points
    that can be remotely managed.  The\ndeployment of these wireless devices will
    significantly improve the\nproductivity and safety of the plants while increasing
    the efficiency\nof the plant workers.  For wireless devices to have a significant\nadvantage
    over wired devices in an industrial environment the\nwireless network needs to
    have three qualities: low power, high\nreliability, and easy installation and
    maintenance.  The aim of this\ndocument is to analyze the requirements for the
    routing protocol used\nfor low power and lossy networks (L2N) in industrial environments.\n\t "

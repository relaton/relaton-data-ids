- language: en

  content: "The NSIS Work group will develop the requirements, architecture and\nprotocols
    for the next IETF steps on signaling.  Two approaches for a\nsignaling model have
    been discussed: path-coupled and path-decoupled\n(previously denoted as on-path
    and off-path).  This draft provides a\nconceptual comparison between path-coupled
    and path-decoupled\nsignaling together with reasons for why an NSIS protocol should
    be\ndesigned to support both cases.  The collection of data objects to be\ncarried
    by the protocol should basically be the same in both cases\nand will evolve over
    time as new usages for NSIS protocol are\nidentified.  The differences between
    the two flavors of this NSIS\nprotocol are then explained.\n\n\n\n\t "

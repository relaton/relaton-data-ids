  content: "Multihomed mobile nodes are capable of simultaneous attachment to\nmultiple
    access networks.  In this case, a PMIPv6-enabled local\nmobility anchor should
    distribute the application traffic to a proper\naccess network which the mobile
    nodes wish to receive from.  This\ndocument specifies how mobile nodes send their
    desire to the attached\nmobile access gateway, which then relays it to a local
    mobility\nanchor.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted to

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Of the many variations of PWE3 Encapsulations and Modes (e.g.\nEthernet,
    Port Mode, VLAN Mode, etc), only five have the Control Word\n(CW) as being optional.
    \ As a result, this causes an issue with VCCV\nControl Channel selection.  This
    draft endeavors to resolve the issue\ngoing forward by making the Control Word,
    and subsequently the CW-\nbased VCCV Control Channel, mandatory for all PWE3 Encapsulations.\n\t "

  content: "   Network requirements have evolved from data communications between\n
    \  two hosts to large-scale information access through networks. The\n   current
    Internet employs an address-centric network communication\n   model, which is
    efficient for communications between hosts, but not\n   efficient for communications
    between a host and a network. Given\n   this fact, Information-centric Networking
    (ICN) has become a hot\n   spot to meet the new requirement.  In ICN there exists
    a congestion\n   problem which hasn't been well solved. We provide a new congestion\n
    \  control protocol, RRCP, since the congestion control protocols in IP\n   networks
    are not suitable for ICN transport.  RRCP, with XCP and ICN\n   transport characteristics,
    advances a receiver-driven and router-\n   feedback mechanism.  RRCP can stay
    efficient, fair and stable via\n   the validation of simulation.\n\n\t "

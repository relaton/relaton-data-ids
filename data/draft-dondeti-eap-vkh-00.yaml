abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a visited domain key hierarchy derived from\n
    \  the extended master session key (EMSK) from EAP to facilitate visited\n   domain
    key management for various purposes including fast handovers\n   and visited domain
    services.  The visited domain key hierarchy avoids\n   the latency associated
    with communicating with the home domain as in\n   case of a full EAP method run
    or even in a single round trip as with\n   the EAP efficient reauthentication
    scheme, and that is especially\n   desirable when the protocol is in the critical
    path of a handover.\n\n\t "

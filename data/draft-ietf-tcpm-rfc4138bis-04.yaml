abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of this document is to move the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery)
    functionality for TCP in RFC 4138 from Experimental to Standards Track status.
    The F-RTO support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) in RFC 4138
    remains with Experimental status. See Appendix B for the differences between this
    document and RFC 4138.\n\n Spurious retransmission timeouts cause suboptimal TCP
    performance because they often result in unnecessary retransmission of the last
    window of data. This document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm for detecting
    spurious TCP retransmission timeouts. F-RTO is a TCP sender-only algorithm that
    does not require any TCP options to operate. After retransmitting the first unacknowledged
    segment triggered by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP sender monitors
    the incoming acknowledgments to determine whether the timeout was spurious. It
    then decides whether to send new segments or retransmit unacknowledged segments.
    The algorithm effectively helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions
    and thereby improves TCP performance in the case of a spurious timeout. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

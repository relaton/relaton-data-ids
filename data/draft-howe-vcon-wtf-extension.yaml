abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the World Transcription Format (WTF) extension
    for Virtualized Conversations (vCon). The WTF extension provides a standardized
    method for representing speech-to-text transcription data from multiple providers
    within vCon containers. This extension enables consistent transcription storage,
    analysis, and interoperability across different transcription services while preserving
    provider-specific features through extensible fields. The WTF extension is designed
    as a Compatible Extension that introduces transcription attachments without altering
    existing vCon semantics, ensuring backward compatibility with existing vCon implementations.</p>"

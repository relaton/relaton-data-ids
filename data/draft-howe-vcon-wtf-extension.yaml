abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the World Transcription Format (WTF) extension
    for Virtualized Conversations (vCon). The WTF extension provides a standardized
    analysis framework for representing speech-to-text transcription data from multiple
    providers within vCon containers. This extension defines a comprehensive analysis
    format that enables consistent transcription processing, quality assessment, and
    interoperability across different transcription services while preserving provider-specific
    features through extensible fields. The WTF extension is designed as a Compatible
    Extension that introduces a new analysis type for transcription data without altering
    existing vCon semantics, ensuring backward compatibility with existing vCon implementations.</p>"

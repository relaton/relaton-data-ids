  content: "This document proposes a solution for Service Network discovery \nand
    selection that could be implemented within the existing EAP \nspecification framework.
    \ The purpose of Service Network discovery \nand selection here is to help a WLAN
    client using EAP for \nauthentication to decide whether or not to connect to a
    WLAN \nAccess Network, and help it select the most appropriate Mediating \nNetwork
    as a next hop for routing AAA packets in roaming \nsituations where the WLAN Access
    Network has agreements with more \nthan one Mediating Network affiliated with
    the client’s Home \nService Network. \nThe proposed solution has 3 components:
    a delivery mechanism for \nconveying Access Network and Service Network Information
    to a WLAN \nclient, a data model/syntax for structuring the information in a \ngeneric
    manner, and a method by which the WLAN client can indicate \nits selection to
    the WLAN Access Network.\n\t "

  content: "     There are a number of design principles which come into play over\n
    \    and over again when designing application protocols.  Many of these\n     are
    entrenched in IETF lore and spread by word of mouth.  Most have\n     been learned
    the hard way many times.\n \n     This is an attempt to codify some of these principles
    so they can\n     be referenced rather than spread by word of mouth.  The author
    has\n     not invented any of these ideas and while the exercise of finding\n
    \    the originator of the ideas would be interesting, it is not deemed\n     necessary
    for this project.\n \n     Many of these principles have a much wider scope than
    application\n     protocol design.  However, the author's primary experience is
    with\n     application protocols and examples provided usually involve\n     application
    protocols or elements.\n \n     [Disclaimer: this is a preliminary draft.  Some
    of the case studies\n     and exceptions need tuning.  Suggestions welcome.]\n\n\t "

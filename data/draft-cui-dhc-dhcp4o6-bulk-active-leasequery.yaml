  content: "   As networks migrate towards IPv6, some entities still have the\n   requirement
    for IPv4 configuration.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341]\n   provides a mechanism
    for obtaining IPv4 configuration information\n   dynamically in IPv6 networks.
    \ DHCPv4/DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery and\n   Active Leasequery allow a client to get
    DHCP address binding\n   information data in bulk transfer or in real-time via
    TCP.  This\n   document describes an extension of DHCPv6 Bulk and Active Leasequery\n
    \  that provides a mechanism to get DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 lease\n   information.\n\n\t "

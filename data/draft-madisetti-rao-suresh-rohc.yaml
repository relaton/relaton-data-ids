  content: "Enhanced Compressed RTP (ECRTP) and Robust Header Compression\n(ROHC)
    are IP header compression schemes that have been \nproposed for use in wireless
    applications, primarily for\nvoice and audio applications.  While ROHC offers
    a high\ndegree of compression and is robust, it is also computationally\nexpensive.
    On the other hand, ECRTP does not achieve as high\na compression, while being
    less expensive computationally. \nOur porposal, E2CRTP, is an enhanced version
    of ECRTP that\noffers a middleground between the ROHC and ECRTP, providing\nrobustness,
    compression efficiency, and moderate computational\ncomplexity. \n\n\t "

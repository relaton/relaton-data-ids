- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft introduces Mapped-BGP, a routing protocol that uses BGP to\ndistributed
    tunnel endpoint-to-prefix mappings.  The goal of this\ndraft are to present preliminary
    concepts and get feedback.  It is\nnot meant to be a fully-formed proposal.  The
    goals of Mapped-BGP\nare: 1) to reduce the processing required to run BGP, 2)
    to speed up\ninter-domain convergence, 3) to improve the cross-ISP load balancing\ncapabilities
    of BGP, and where possible, 4) to enable forms of\naddress aggregation like geographical
    addressing (i.e. for IPv6).\nImproved address aggregation is unlikely to be very
    useful for IPv4,\nbecause most addresses have already been assigned.  This design
    takes\nthe position that Mapped BGP is useful even without better\naggregation,
    because 1) FIB size can be reduced through FIB\nsuppression with Virtual Aggregation,
    and 2) RIB size per se is not\nthe growth bottleneck.\n\t "

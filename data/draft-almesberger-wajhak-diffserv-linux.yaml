  content: "Recent Linux kernels offer a wide variety of traffic control\nfunctions,
    which can be combined in a modular way. We have designed\nsupport for Differentiated
    Services based on the existing traffic\ncontrol elements, and we have implemented
    new components where\nnecessary. In this document we give a brief overview of
    the structure\nof Linux traffic control, and we describe our prototype\nimplementation
    in more detail.\n\t "

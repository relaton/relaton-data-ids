  content: "Today, the wireless network arena is made up of different types of\n     access
    (TDMA, CDMA, GSM, etc) and core network technologies (IS-41\n     and MAP over
    SS7, etc). The heterogeneous nature of today's\n     wireless and wireline packet
    data networks limits the scope of\n     mobility between these heterogeneous networks.
    However, as these\n     heterogeneous networks evolve, the mobility management
    provided by\n     them must evolve to insure seamless roaming between the networks.\n
    \n     With the convergence of voice and data, networks of the future will\n     be
    built on IP packet switched technology, mostly due to inherent\n     advantages
    offered by the technology.\n \n     This document identifies several drivers that
    provide input for an\n     IP Mobility based network and also describes a high
    level IP\n     Mobility architecture that extends the current third generation\n
    \    IMT2000 wireless architecture and builds on Mobile IP concepts.\n\t "

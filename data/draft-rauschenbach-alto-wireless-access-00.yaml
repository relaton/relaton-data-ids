  content: "   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) specification\n   defines
    the concept of Provider-defined Identifiers (PIDs) as the\n   aggregation of network
    endpoints for network nodes.  Each PID can be\n   associated with a set of endpoint
    addresses, e.g. aggregating\n   endpoints that use the same network access point.\n\n
    \  This document focuses on mobile networks and introduces proposes the\n   toidea
    of using use cells of cellular access networks as an\n   aggregation points.  This
    allows applications to make decisions based\n   on the path cost of using the
    current cell as a network attachment\n   point, or to even choose which network
    access points network\n   attachment point to select.  Use cases are described
    which can\n   benefit from this.  The draft elaborates on possible ALTO\n   modifications
    enabling such use cases.  The intent of the draft is to\n   start discussion on
    the topic.\n\n\n\t "

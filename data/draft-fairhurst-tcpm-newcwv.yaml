  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that\n
    \  arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where\n   the
    sending rate is limited by the application rather than the\n   congestion window.
    \ It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart\n   quickly following either
    an idle or rate-limited interval.  This\n   method is expected to benefit applications
    that send rate-limited\n   traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate
    response if\n   congestion is experienced.\n\n   It also evaluates TCP Congestion
    Window Validation, CWV, an IETF\n   experimental specification defined in RFC
    2861, and concludes that\n   CWV sought to address important issues, but failed
    to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This document therefore proposes an update
    to\n   the status of RFC 2861 by recommending it is moved from Experimental\n
    \  to Historic status, and that it is replaced by the current\n   specification.\n\n\t "

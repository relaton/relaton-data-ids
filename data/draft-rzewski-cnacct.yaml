  content: "One of the goals of 'content peering' is to allow content providers\nto
    receive detailed information on the utilization of their content\nin remote networks.
    In order to provide this, a simple, commonly\naccepted log format must be used
    on systems that deliver content.\nAlso, a commonly accepted mechanism is required
    to pass these logs\nbetween networks. This draft proposes a log format and log
    passing\nmechanism specifically for HTTP content.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a solution for point to multipoint (P2MP) \nTraffic
    Engineering (TE). The objective is to optimize packet \nreplication and minimize
    state and intelligence in the core of the \nnetwork, while performing P2MP TE.
    The solution relies on RSVP-TE \nin the core of the network. It is based on setting
    up a P2MP LSP by \nmerging P2P LSPs in the network. The setup of P2P LSPs is source\nintiated.
    Simple enhancements are made to RSVP-TE to facilitate the set\nup of a P2MP TE
    LSP. There is no need to run a multicast routing \nprotocol in the network core.
    There can be various applications for \nP2MP TE LSPs such as multicast. Specification
    of how such applications \nwill use a P2MP LSP is outside the scope of this document.\n\t "

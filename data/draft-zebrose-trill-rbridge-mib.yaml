  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\nfor
    use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines\nobjects for
    managing RBridges, which are devices that implement the\nTRILL base protocol.
    \ Since RBridges provide optimal pair-wise\nforwarding without configuration there
    is no required configuration.\nStatus information that may be helpful in network
    management is\nspecified.  The MIB is specified with all objects read-only for\nsimplicity
    and since that is how the MIB is expected to be used.  The\ndescription is used
    to indicate those objects that can be configured,\nalthough the actual configuration
    is outside the scope of this\ndocument.\n\t "

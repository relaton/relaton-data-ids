  content: "This document proposes extensions to existing CR-LDP for setting up \nMPLS
    backup tunnels. These tunnels can protect Label Switched Paths  \non an exclusive
    bandwidth basis or shared bandwidth on the back up \npaths, as desired by the
    initiator of the tunnel at the head end \nnode. Several backup segments are maintained
    for a single LSP and \nthey are meant to provide link and node failure protection
    along \nvarious segments of the LSP. Sharing of backup segments across \nmultiple
    LSPs is also facilitated to achieve scalability \n  \n\t "

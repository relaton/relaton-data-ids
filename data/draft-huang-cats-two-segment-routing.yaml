  content: "   CATS (Computing Aware Traffic Steering) is designed to enable the\n
    \  routing network to be aware of computing status thus deliver the\n   service
    flow accordingly.  Nevertheless, computing and networking is\n   quite different
    in terms of resource granularity as well as its\n   status stability.  It would
    gain significant benefits to accommodate\n   the computing status to that of networking
    by employing a\n   hierarchical computing routing segment scheme.  The network-\n
    \  accommodated computing status could be maintained at remote CATS\n   nodes
    while the rest could reside at local CATS nodes.  By enabling\n   the network
    to schedule and route computing services in a compatible\n   way with the current
    IP routing network, CATS would bring benefits to\n   the industry by both efficiently
    pooling the computing resources and\n   rendering services through perspective
    of converged networking and\n   computing.\n\n\t "

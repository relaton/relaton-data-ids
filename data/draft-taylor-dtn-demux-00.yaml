abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Since the publication of [RFC5050] a number of transport and\n   convergence
    layer protocols have been developed to carry bundles\n   between nodes in a delay-tolerant
    network.  Before the publication of\n   Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) in [RFC9171],
    there was only one\n   standardized version of the Bundle Protocol, version 6,
    and as many\n   of these transport and convergence-layer protocols pre-date the\n
    \  publication of version 7, they do not include any protocol mechanism\n   to
    differentiate between versions of the Bundle Protocol.\n\n   This document updates
    [RFC9171] by defining a CBOR [RFC8949] tag that\n   should be used as an explicit
    indicator that a particular CBOR array\n   is a Bundle Protocol version 7 bundle.
    \ It also describes a mechanism\n   by which an implementation can determine the
    version of the Bundle\n   Protocol that was used to encode a bundle by examining
    the initial\n   octets of the encoded data.\n\n\t "

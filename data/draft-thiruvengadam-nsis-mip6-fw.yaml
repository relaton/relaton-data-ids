  content: "Most of the firewalls deployed today are Mobile IPv6 unaware.\nWidespread
    Mobile IPv6 deployment is not possible unless Mobile IPv6\nmessages can pass through
    these firewalls.  One approach is to use a\nsignaling protocol to communicate
    with these firewalls and instruct\nthem to bypass these Mobile IPv6 messages.
    \ The goal of this document\nis to describe the interaction between NSIS and Mobile
    IPv6 for\nenabling Mobile IPv6 traversal.\n\t "

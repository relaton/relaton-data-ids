  content: "   Capacity demands, Traffic Engineering (TE) and determinism are some\n
    \  of key requirements for various cellular, edge and industrial\n   deployments.
    \ These deployments span from many underlying data pane\n   technologies including
    native IPv4, native IPv6 along with MPLS and\n   Segment Routing (SR).\n\n   This
    document provides a framework for Preferred Path Routing (PPR).\n   PPR is a method
    of providing path based dynamic routing for a number\n   of packet types including
    IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS.  This seamlessly works\n   with a controller plane which
    holds both complete network view of\n   operator policies, while distributed control
    plane providing self-\n   healing benefits in a near-real time fashion.\n\n   PPR
    builds on existing encapsulations at the edge nodes to add path\n   identity to
    the packet.  This reduces the per packet overhead\n   required for path steering
    and therefore has a smaller impact on both\n   packet MTU, data plane processing
    and overall goodput for small\n   payload packets, while extending path steering
    benefits to any\n   existing data plane.\n   A number of extensions that allow
    expansion of use beyond simple\n   point-to-point-paths are also described in
    this memo.\n\n\t "

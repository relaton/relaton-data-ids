  content: "This document defines an IPv6 Provider-Independent global unicast \naddress
    format for use in the Internet.  The address format defined \nin this document
    is consistent with the IPv6 Protocol [1] and the \n\"IPv6 Addressing Architecture\"
    [2].  It is designed to facilitate \nscalable Internet routing when sites attach
    to multiple service \nproviders, by using a prefix based on a geographic reference
    to the \nsite. A natural byproduct of this address allocation mechanism is \nthat
    all addresses are fixed allowing sites to change providers at \nwill without requiring
    their network to renumber. \n\n\t "

  content: "   When segment routing is used in a network that is controlled by a\n
    \  link state IGP (such as ISIS or OSPF), each node in the network can\n   be
    assigned one or more index numbers, known as \"node-SIDs\".  The\n   node-SIDs
    are unique within the network, and are known to all the\n   nodes in the network.
    \ If an ingress node has a data packet to be\n   sent to an egress node, the ingress
    node may select a node-SID\n   corresponding to the egress node, and \"translate\"
    that node-SID to an\n   MPLS label.  The MPLS label represents a particular path
    to the\n   egress node; the path is determined by applying a routing algorithm\n
    \  to a particular view of the network topology and a particular set of\n   metric
    assignments to the links of that topology.  The packet can\n   then be forwarded
    by pushing the label on the packet's label stack\n   and transmitting the packet
    to the next hop on the corresponding path\n   to the egress node.  This document
    compares two different procedures\n   for translating a node-SID to the MPLS label
    that represents a path\n   chosen by a particular algorithm operating on a particular
    topology.\n   It also specifies the ISIS extensions needed to support one of the\n
    \  procedures (known as the \"per-topology/per-algorithm label block\"\n   procedure).\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Defense Information Systems Agency of the United States\n   Department
    of Defense, with its contractors, has proposed a service\n   architecture for
    military (NATO and related agencies) telephone\n   systems.  This is called the
    Assured Service, and is defined in two\n   documents: \"Architecture for Assured
    Service Capabilities in Voice\n   over IP\" and \"Requirements for Assured Service
    Capabilities in Voice\n   over IP\".  Responding to these are three documents:
    \"Extending the\n   Session Initiation Protocol Reason Header to account for Preemption\n
    \  Events\", \"Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation\n   Protocol\",
    and the \"Multi-Level Expedited Forwarding Per Hop\n   Behavior\" (MLEF PHB).
    \ MLEF, as currently defined, has serious\n   problems, which this draft seeks
    to discuss.\n\t "

  content: "With the development of new multimedia applications, such as voice,\n
    \  audio, picture, and video communication, the demands on the resource\n   reservation
    service are increasing, especially as Internet traffic\n   volume grows explosively
    due to these applications.  Therefore,\n   tariff systems for Internet service
    have tended to adopt measured\n   rate billing, and the resource reservation setup
    protocol [1, 2] is\n   increasingly important as a method for implementing measured
    rate\n   billing.  The resource reservation setup protocol must support\n   billing
    if it is to be applied to the commercial Internet, especially\n   measured rate
    billing between interconnected Internet Service\n   Providers (ISPs) is needed.\n
    \n   The purpose of this document is to clarify the architecture that\n   should
    be used for the resource reservation service for the\n   commercial Internet.
    \ First, this document explains the basis of the\n   tariff for current telecommunication
    and Internet services.  Then it\n   clarifies problems in the billing for Internet
    service, and describes\n   how billing can be improved by using the resource reservation
    setup\n   protocol.  Finally, it also studies technical and application models\n
    \  for a commercial resource reservation service model, and clarifies an\n   architecture
    for the resource reservation setup protocol.\n\n   Incidentally, it is essential
    to examine billing based on business\n   administration issues, not technical
    ones.  For example, on a\n   telephone service, it technically makes sense to
    charge the caller\n   when the user being called is on another line.  This is
    because,\n   telephone switches were in operation when they notified the caller\n
    \  that the number he called was busy.  However, such a billing policy\n   is
    contrary to the customs of business. Readers should note that the\n   billing
    problems and solutions discussed in this document are not\n   only based on the
    technical viewpoint.\n\t "

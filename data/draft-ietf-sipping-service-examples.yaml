  content: "This document gives examples of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) services.
    \ This covers most features offered in so-called IP Centrex offerings from local
    exchange carriers and PBX (Private Branch Exchange) features.  Most of the services
    shown in this document are implemented in the SIP user agents, although some require
    the assistance of a SIP proxy.  Some require some extensions to SIP including
    the REFER, SUBSCRIBE, and NOTIFY methods and the Replaces and Join header fields.
    \ These features are not intended to be an exhaustive set, but rather show implementations
    of common features likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones in a business
    environment.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
    Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

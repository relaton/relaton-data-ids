abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document outlines a method for authenticating and authorizing \nMobile
    IPv6 [MIPv6] Binding Updates between a Correspondent Node and \na Mobile Node
    where there exists no pre-established direct or \nindirect security relationship
    between those two entities. The \nmethod uses a new security technique called
    Address Based Keys. \nAddress Based Keys are an alternative to other cryptographic
    address \nmechanisms for optimizing Binding Update security to avoid the need
    \nfor Return Routability checks on each binding update. Address Based \nKeys use
    some mathematical results in identity based cryptosystems \nthat have been known
    to cryptographers for some time, but have not \nbeen widely discussed in the network
    security community.\n\t "

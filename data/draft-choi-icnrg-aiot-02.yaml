  content: "    This document describes the requirements and challenges to employ
    artificial\nintelligence     (AI) into the constraint Internet of Things (IoT)
    service environment for\nembedding     intelligence and increasing efficiency.\n
    \   The IoT service environment includes heterogeneous and multiple IoT devices
    and\nsystems     that work together in a cooperative and intelligent way to manage
    homes, buildings,\nand     complex autonomous systems. Therefore, it is becoming
    very essential to integrate IoT\nand     AI technologies to increase the synergy
    between them. However, there are\nseveral     limitations to achieve AI enabled
    IoT as the availability of IoT devices is not always\nhigh,     and IoT networks
    cannot guarantee a certain level of performance in real-time\napplications     due
    to resource constraints.\n    This document intends to present a right direction
    to empower AI in IoT for learning\nand     analyzing the usage behaviors of IoT
    devices/systems and human behaviors based\non     previous records and experiences.
    With AI enabled IoT, the IoT service environment can\nbe     intelligently managed
    in order to compensate for the unexpected performance\ndegradation     often caused
    by abnormal situations.\n\n   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance
    with the\n   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.\n\n   Internet-Drafts are working
    documents of the Internet Engineering\n   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other
    groups may also distribute\n   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list
    of current Internet-\n   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.\n\n
    \  Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months\n   and
    may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any\n   time.  It
    is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference\n   material or to cite them
    other than as \"work in progress.\"\n\n   This Internet-Draft will\nexpire on
    May 19, 2020\n\n\t "

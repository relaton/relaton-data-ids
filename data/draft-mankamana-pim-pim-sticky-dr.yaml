  content: "   This draft proposes a mechanism to enhance the stability of Protocol\n
    \  Independent Multicast (PIM) Designated Router (DR) election by\n   introducing
    the concept of a Sticky DR.  In traditional PIM\n   operations, the DR role on
    a LAN may change dynamically in response\n   to router availability or priority
    changes, leading to potential\n   multicast service disruptions or state reinitialization.
    \ The Sticky\n   PIM DR approach aims to retain the previous DR role whenever\n
    \  feasible.  By minimizing DR churn, this mechanism improves multicast\n   session
    continuity, reduces unnecessary Join/Prune message\n   propagation, and enhances
    operational stability in dense multicast\n   deployments.  The draft outlines
    the procedural extensions to\n   existing PIM DR election, compatibility considerations,
    and\n   configuration guidelines to support backward interoperability.\n\n\t "

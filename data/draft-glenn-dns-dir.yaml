  content: "An Internet Directory is a necessity.  The lack of an Internet\n   Directory
    is posing serious problems.  There are several Directory\n   Protocols ready for
    \ deployment  in  the Internet. But, among other\n   factors, content generation
    for the directory has been a major\n   stumbling block. A  simple and straight-forward
    \ method of\n   generating contents for a directory of organizations  and their\n
    \  network services using information from the Domain Name System (DNS)\n   and
    the WHOIS servers is described in this memo.\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses the operating principles of Network Address\n
    \  Translator (NAT) devices and the behavioral properties required to\n   make
    NAT more predictable and compatible with diverse application\n   protocols. First,
    this document presents an architectural model for\n   NAT devices and defines
    important terms used in conjunction with\n   NAT operation. The architectural
    model sets the stage for a set of\n   concrete recommendations for NAT implementers.
    The recommendations\n   made by this document are independent of transport protocol.
    A set\n   of companion documents provide behavioral recommendations specific\n
    \  to particular transport protocols.\n\t "

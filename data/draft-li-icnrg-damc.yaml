  content: "   This draft defines a new communication architecture, called\n   Distributed
    Architecture for Microservices Communication (DAMC).  It\n   includes multiple
    aspects of microservice communication, such as\n   service registration, service
    discovery, service routing, service\n   scheduling, and more , Which to achieve
    all the essential\n   functionalities provided by current centralized service
    networks.\n   The purpose of this draft is to combine the Information-Centric\n
    \  Networking (ICN) concept to enhance the overall performance,\n   scalability
    and reliability of microservices communication.  The DAMC\n   architecture provides
    a powerful framework for managing the complex\n   communication requirements of
    distributed microservices, ensuring\n   integrity, security and efficient resource
    utilization.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies additional information that can inserted in\n
    \  IS-IS LSPs to convey link capabilities that may be useful in certain\n   applications.
    \ In particular, an IS may convey that zero or more of\n   its links are explicit
    marked and/or implicit U-turn recipient\n   capable, which may be described as
    capable of identifying traffic as\n   U-turn traffic and redirecting the traffic
    to a suitable alternate.\n   The immediate applicability for these two link capabilities
    is in\n   support of local protection, provided by a U-turn alternate, in the\n
    \  event of a link and/or node failure while the IS-IS area is\n   reconverging
    onto a new topology.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "As the use of IP multicasting and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technologies
    increases, it becomes important to think about ways that IP multicast routing
    protocols interface to ATM networks.  The Multicast Address Resolution Server
    (MARS) [1] addresses the problem of determining group membership within a single
    ATM Logical IP Subnet (LIS) and provides a mapping between IP multicast addresses
    and ATM addresses while [2] looks at the issues of short cut routing for PIM Sparse
    Mode and CBT.  In this document, the general problems of IP multicast routing
    protocols over ATM networks are explored and the issues related to the different
    forms of multicast routing protocols; dense vs. sparse, shared tree vs. source
    tree, etc. are addressed.  Additionally, the issues related to short cut and QoS
    routing are discussed.  This document is intended as a starting point for exploring
    the issues of IP multicast routing over ATM.\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes a new mechanism called 'Connection/Link Status\nInvestigation
    (CSI)'. It is designed to collect status information of\nnodes along the communication
    path. One new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option\n(CSI option) and three new ICMPv6 messages
    (Status Request/Reply, and\nStatus Report) are proposed as extensions for the
    CSI mechanism.\nThe CSI mechanism is based on hop-by-hop data acquisition operations\nand
    realtime 'boomerang' action messages. It is simple and can\ninvestigate both outgoing
    and incoming paths between the source and\nthe destination with minimum investigation
    packets.\nIt can provide various new functions (e.g. realtime consumed\nbandwidth
    measurement, etc.). Since it has good characteristics, it\nis possible to innovate
    current investigation functions (e.g.,\n'traceroute', 'pathchar', etc.)\nThis
    document describes specifications of the CSI mechanism and\ndefines a set of basic
    data types. The CSI mechanism is designed as a\ngeneric framework mechanism. By
    defining new data types to collect,\nit can be easily applied to various advanced
    usages.\n\t "

  content: "In the 802.16 Per-MS interface prefix model, one prefix can only be\nassigned
    to one interface of a mobile station by an access router and\ndifferent mobile
    stations can't share a prefix.  Managing Per-MS\ninterface prefixes is likely
    to increase the processing load at the\naccess router.  Based on the idea that
    DHCPv6 servers can manage\nprefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique
    in which\nthe access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the\nprefixes
    to an DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a\nprefix for an incoming
    mobile station to the DHCPv6 server.  The\naccess router next advertises the prefix
    information to the mobile\nstation with a Router Advertisement message.  When
    the mobile station\nhands off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server.  We
    also\ndescribe how AAA servers can help in prefix delegation.\n\t "

  content: "   This is a working document intended to focus discussion on\n   requirements
    for multicast in Low-power and Lossy Networks in the\n   area of M2M communication
    for control applications.  The Trickle\n   algorithm, which uses random re-broadcasting
    to assure that messages\n   arrive at all destinations, has been proposed in the
    Trickle\n   Multicast Forwarding ROLL WG draft as the basis for a multicast\n
    \  routing protocol.  In this draft additional requirements on multicast\n   routing
    are presented, such as timeliness, motivated by building\n   control.  Random
    re-broadcasting and timeliness can be difficult to\n   reconcile.  This draft
    presents some simulation results in typical\n   control settings which show that
    achieving latencies below 400 ms is\n   feasible with Trickle.  Recommendations
    are proposed for the current\n   Trickle Multicast Forwarding draft to achieve
    optimal performance and\n   meet the stated requirements.\n\n\t "

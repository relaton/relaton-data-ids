  content: "This memo describes a packetization scheme for MPEG video and audio \nstreams.
    \ The scheme proposed can be used to transport such a video \nor audio flow over
    the transport protocols supported by RTP.  Two \napproaches are described. The
    first is designed to support maximum \ninteroperability with MPEG System environments.
    \ The second is \ndesigned to provide maximum compatibility with other RTP-encapsulated
    \nmedia streams and future conference control work of the IETF. \nMost of this
    memo is identical to RFC 2250, an Internet standards \ntrack RTP payload format
    definition. No changes have been made in the \npacket formats on the wire. The
    main reason for this revision is to \nallow the use of this payload format with
    dynamic payload types  \nthat can specify the timestamp clock frequency by non-RTP
    means for \nimproved jitter compensation. We used this opportunity to improve
    the \ndescription of the payload format specification by clarifying some \nwording
    that have been reported to be problematic. \n\t "

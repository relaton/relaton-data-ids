  content: "  In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), the PE devices provide a \n  logical
    interconnect such that CE devices belonging to a specific \n  VPLS instance appear
    to be connected by a single LAN.  A VPLS \n  solution performs replication for
    multicast traffic at the ingress PE \n  devices.  When replicated at the ingress
    PE, multicast traffic wastes \n  bandwidth when 1. Multicast traffic is sent to
    sites with no members, \n  and 2. Pseudo wires to different sites go through a
    shared path.  \n  This document is addressing the former by IGMP and PIM snooping.

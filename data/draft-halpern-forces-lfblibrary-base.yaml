  content: "The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) working group\nis
    defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to control the\nbehavior of
    a Forwarding Element (FE).  The manipulations used by\nthis protocol operate in
    terms of adjustments to Logical Function\nBlocks (LFBs) whose structure is defined
    my a model RFC produced by\nthe working group.  In order to build an actual solution
    using this\nprotocol, there needs to be a set of Logical Function Block\ndefinitions
    that can be instantiated by FEs and controlled by CEs.\nThis document provides
    an initial set of such definitions.  It is\nanticipated that additional defining
    documents will be produced over\ntime.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Mobile-IP, together with several other supporting standards such\nas Reverse
    Tunneling and the Challenge-Response extensions, have\nall been recently revised.
    \ Although such revisions are for the\nmost part backward compatible with the
    original versions,\nsometimes static configuration of Mobile Nodes and Mobility
    Agents\nis required to ensure smooth transition and avoid any possible\nconflict
    between different standard versions implemented by\nalready-deployed equipment.
    \ In this draft we define compatibility\nextensions for Mobile-IP Agent Advertisement,
    Registration Request\nand Registration Reply messages that allow all Mobile-IPv4\nentities
    to dynamically synchronize their 'compatibility\nversions', defined as the versions
    of the Mobile-IP standards that\na particular node is able to support.  This solution
    offers a\ndynamic mechanism which informs all entities involved in a\nMobile-IP
    exchange of the version of the standard they support,\ntherefore reducing the
    need to statically configure such\ninformation at Mobile Nodes or Mobility Agents\n\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines a simple protocol framework for reliable multicast
    dissemination of data files. The general framework was originally developed and
    used by the Image Multicaster (IMM) application within the Internet MBone for
    dissemination of satellite imagery.  This document describes the more general
    use of the protocol framework as a reliable bulk file transfer technique.  We
    discuss the present operational modes, some performance issues, and the basic
    application data units (ADUs) used.  This is not intended to be a detailed protocol
    specification document, but rather a broad description of the basic protocol features
    and a discussion of issues. Further detailed description of the protocol implementation
    may be provided in future documents.\n\t "

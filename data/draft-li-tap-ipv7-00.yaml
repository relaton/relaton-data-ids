  content: "This paper discusses some of the issues in addressing plan for IPv7.  It
    is not exhaustive.  There are a variety of issues which are not dealt with in
    this paper and remain topics of future deliberation.  This is a general discussion
    in the sense that it delineates guidelines for addressing under IPv7 and proposes
    the global infrastructure for addressing, but it explicitly delegates details
    of the addressing plan to appropriate local authorities.\n\t "

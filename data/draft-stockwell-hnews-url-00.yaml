  content: "HNEWS [1] is an HTTP-tunneling variant of the NNTP news protocol.\nThis
    document defines the format of Uniform Resource Locators(URLs)\nidentifying news
    messages and groups provided by HNEWS servers.\nThe syntax of 'hnews' URLs is
    designed to be compatible with the\ncurrent common usage of the 'news' URL scheme.
    \ Specifically, the\n'hnews' URL scheme is designed according to recommendations
    made in\n[NEWS_URL_SCHEME].  [NEWS_URL_SCHEME] is based on the general\nspecification
    of all URL schemes in 'Uniform Resource Locators (URL):\nGeneric Syntax and Semantics'
    [RFC URI SYNTAX].\n\n\t "

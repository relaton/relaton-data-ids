  content: "The present document focuses on the MPLS Fast Reroute many-to-one \nsolution.
    It defines on the one hand, a specific PLR behavior for the \ndynamic setup of
    bypass LSPs, and on the other hand a distributed \nbypass LSP path computation
    mechanism, taking into account the \npossibility to share protection resources.
    \nIt proposes ISIS-TE/OSPF-TE and RSVP-TE extensions required to \nsupport the
    described functionality.\n\t "

  content: "   The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label\n
    \  Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n   Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been\n   identified as a key
    requirement for P2P and P2MP scenarios.  In this\n   context, a domain is a collection
    of network elements within a common\n   sphere of address management or path computational
    responsibility\n   such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems.  This document\n
    \  specifies a standard representation and encoding of a domain\n   sequence,
    which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains\n   traversed to reach the
    destination domain.  This document also\n   defines new sub-objects to be used
    to encode domain identifiers.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent\n
    \  routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each\n   mobile node
    is always identified by its home address, regardless of\n   its current point
    of attachment to the Internet.  While situated\n   away from its home, a mobile
    node is also associated with a\n   care-of address, which provides information
    about its current\n   point of attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides
    for\n   registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent\n   sends
    datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to\n   the care-of address.
    \ After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each\n   datagram is then delivered
    to the mobile node.\n\t "

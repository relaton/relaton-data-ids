  content: "   ASBP (Asynchronous Services Bus Protocol) is a simple command based\n
    \  application-level protocol for routing data and messages.  ASBP\n   is intended
    to allow implementation of fully Asynchronous\n   Service Bus Architectures, in
    a simple standardized\n   manor.  ASBP is intended to be layered over\n   WebSocket
    or HTTP.  The protocol consists of a simple UTF-8\n   key value(s) header and
    any arbitrary data (text, binary, XML, JSON,\n   etc.), which the application's
    specific Command-Attendant or\n   Command-Respondent processes.  In addition this
    document touches on\n   an extension to ASBP, CP (Conversation Protocol) a protocol
    used\n   to facilitate communication between Asynchronous Service Busses\n   implemented
    or hosted by different organizations.  CP will be\n   covered in more detail in
    another RFC still in progress.\n\nInternet-Draft\n\n      This Internet-Draft
    is submitted in full conformance with the\n      provisions of BCP 78 and BCP
    79.\n\n      Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering\n
    \     Task Force (IETF). Note that other groups may also distribute\n      working
    documents as Internet-Drafts. The list of current\n      Internet-Drafts is at
    http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current.\n\n      Internet-Drafts are draft
    documents valid for a maximum of six\n      months and may be updated, replaced,

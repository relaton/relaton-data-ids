  script: Latn
  content: "   LTE, 4G mobile networks use IP transport which is not optimized for\n
    \  data transport. IP unicast routing from server to clients is used for\n   delivery
    of multimedia content to User Equipment (UE), where each\n   user gets separate
    stream. From bandwidth and routing perspective\n   this approach is inefficient.
    Multicast and broadcast technologies\n   have emerged recently for mobile networks,
    but their deployments are\n   very limited or at an experimental stage due to
    complex architecture\n   and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly emerging
    technology with\n   built in features for efficient multimedia data delivery,
    however\n   majority of the work is focused on fixed networks. The main focus
    of\n   this draft is on native deployment of ICN in cellular mobile networks\n
    \  by using ICN into 3GPP protocol stack. ICN has an inherent capability\n   for
    multicast, anchorless mobility, security and it is optimized for\n   data delivery
    using local caching at the edge. The native ICN or dual\n   stack (along with
    IP) deployment will bring all inherent benefits and\n   help in optimizing mobile
    networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In networks supporting IPv6 the Internet Control Message Protocol\n
    \  version 6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of\n   functions,
    and a correspondingly large number of message types and\n   options.  A number
    of security risks are associated with uncontrolled\n   forwarding of ICMPv6 messages,
    and it is desirable to configure site\n   firewalls to intercept inappropriate
    usages of ICMPv6 which might\n   allow an attacker outside a site to probe or
    compromise the site\n   network.  On the other hand, compared with IPv4 and the
    corresponding\n   protocol ICMP, ICMPv6 is essential to the functioning of IPv6
    rather\n   than a useful auxiliary.  Hence too aggressive filtering of ICMPv6\n
    \  messages can be detrimental to the establishment of IPv6\n   communications.
    \ This means that effective filtering of ICMPv6\n   requires a more complex configuration
    than was needed for ICMP.  This\n   document provides some recommendations for
    ICMPv6 firewall filter\n   configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6
    messages that are\n   needed to maintain the functioning of the network but drop
    messages\n   which are potential security risks.\n\t "

  content: "   Following the recent pervasive monitoring revelations, one of the\n
    \  discussed remedies has been opportunistic encryption.  In this paper,\n   we
    give an overview of various opportunistic and unauthenticated\n   encryption techniques,
    discuss their benefits, limits, and\n   disadvantages, and try to conclude how
    effective they are as a mean\n   to thwart pervasive monitoring.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251] is widely used for purposes\n
    \  including secure remote administration, file transfer using SFTP and\n   SCP,
    and encrypted tunneling of TCP connections.  Because it is based\n   on TCP, SSH
    suffers similar problems as motivate the HTTP protocol to\n   transition its transport
    to UDP-based QUIC [QUIC].  These include:\n   unauthenticated network intermediaries
    can trivially disconnect SSH\n   sessions; SSH connections are lost when mobile
    clients change IP\n   addresses; performance limitations in OS-based TCP stacks;
    any many\n   round-trips to establish the connection.  This memo specifies SSH
    key\n   exchange over UDP and leverages QUIC to provide a UDP-based\n   transport.\n\n\t "

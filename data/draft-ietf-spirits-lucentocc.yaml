  content: "This document describes the pre-SPIRITS Implementation of the\nSPIRITS-like
    services in the Lucent Technologies Online\nCommunications Center (OCC). To this
    end, this document is a\ncontribution to the future Informational RFC, which is
    to be\npublished by the SPIRITS WG as indicated in its charter.\nOn the PSTN side,
    the OCC platform systematically uses the\nIntelligent Network (IN) solutions,
    which were industry-proven to be\nreliable, scalable, and compatible with the
    existing PSTN\ninfrastructure and services, yet easily adaptable to the Internet\nrequirements.
    Other essential elements of the platform include the\nuse of\n1) Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) messaging services\n2) Point-to-Point (PPP) Protocol\n3) Interactions
    with the Voice-over-IP (VoIP) Gateway and Gatekeeper\nfor establishing the combined
    voice path through PSTN and Internet\n4) Microsoft NetMeeting (tm) software at
    the end-users' PCs (or\nInternet appliances)\n5) Java (tm) Run-Time Environment
    (JRE), and\n6) 1.2 Java Native Interface (JNI) for certain security capabilities\n\n\t "

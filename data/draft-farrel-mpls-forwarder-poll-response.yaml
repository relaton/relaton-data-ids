  content: "   As part of he work on MPLS Network Actions (MNA) several questions\n
    \  arose concerning how existing MPLS implementations handle Special\n   Purpose
    Labels (SPLs).  The details of MNA protocol extensions may\n   depend on how existing
    implementations may react when they see those\n   extensions.\n\n   In order to
    discover what deployed implementations currently do, the\n   MPLS working group
    chairs polled participants to answer specific\n   questions.  This document is
    intended to report anonymized answers to\n   that poll.\n\n   It is not intended
    that this document should progress to publication\n   as an RFC.\n\n\t "

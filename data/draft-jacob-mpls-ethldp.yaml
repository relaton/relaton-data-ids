  content: "MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS\ncan
    carry anydata payload which gives the flexibility to the service\nprovider to
    provision new service with any expense.The benefit of this\ntechnology is core
    router need not understand  the full customer route.\nIf the service a layer 2
    then thereis no need of vrf, for customer the\nservice provider cloud is like
    a virtual switch.The protocol used for\nlabel distribution is LDP, BGP,RSVP. The
    most popular protocol for\nouter label distribution is LDP. LDP has the benefit
    of  adding more TLV to\nits payload. In this the possibility of using ldp for
    generating labels\nfor mac address rather for ip address which gives  the benefit
    to service\nprovider not to run complex routing protocol on core, this does not
    require\nip address. This gives service provider the flexibility to deploy any
    services,\nthere is no need for changes in network layer when the customer goes
    for\nipv4 to ipv6. This can reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of the customer and reduces\nthe
    hardware cost too.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo is an implementation report about the peer-to-peer SIP\nsystem
    developed in the European IST Ambient Networks research\nproject.  This system
    replaces the traditional SIP proxy-registrar\nfunction with a distributed lookup
    mechanism, adds overlay\nfunctionality to the SIP signalling and to RTP traffic,
    takes care\nabout media/packet relay lookup and insertion into the SIP/RTP paths,\nplus
    automatic adaptation of the voice transmission according to\nchanging network
    conditions.  Standard, unmodified SIP user agents\nare used for communication.
    \ The presented system is work in progress\nand this memo is an attempt to gather
    IETF community feedback about\nthe described approach.\n\t "

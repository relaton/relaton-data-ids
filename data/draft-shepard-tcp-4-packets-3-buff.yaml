  content: "This memo is to document a simple experiment.  The experiment showed that
    in the case of a TCP receiver behind a 9600 bps modem link at the edge of a fast
    Internet where there are only 3 buffers before the modem (and the fourth packet
    of a four-packet start will surely be dropped), no significant degradation in
    performance is experienced by a TCP sending with a four-packet start when compared
    with a normal slow start (which starts with just one packet).  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

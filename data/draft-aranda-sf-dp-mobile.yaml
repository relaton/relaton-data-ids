  script: Latn
  content: "   The evolution of the network towards 5G implies a challenge for the\n
    \  infrastructure. The targeted services and the full deployment of\n   virtualization
    in all segments of the network will need service\n   function chains that previously
    resided in the(local and remote)\n   infrastructure of the Network operators to
    extend to the radio access\n   network (RAN).\n\n   The objective of this draft
    is to provide a non-exhaustive but\n   representative list of service functions
    in 4G and 5G networks. We\n   base on the problem statement [RFC 7498] and architecture
    framework\n   [SFC-Arch] of the working group, as well on the existing mobile\n
    \  networks use cases [SFC-mobile-uc] and the requirement gathering\n   process
    of different initiatives around the world [5GPPP, IMT2020,\n   5G-FK, IMT2020-CN
    ] to anticipate network elements that will be\n   needed in 5G networks.\n\n\n\n\t "

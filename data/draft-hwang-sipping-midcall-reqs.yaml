  content: "In its current form, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows session
    \ninvitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered \nfrom one
    party to another. However it doesnot explicitly permit \nmidcall events such as
    hook/flash from the user to be passed on to \nthe network application server.
    Without such ability, it is not clear \nhow SIP can be used to provide certain
    network controlled services. \nThis document identifies a set of requirements
    for extensions to SIP \nto provide a MidCall-based communications framework. \n\t "

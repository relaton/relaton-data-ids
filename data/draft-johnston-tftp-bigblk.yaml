  content: "This document describes a mechanism that can be used by \nTFTP and multicast
    TFTP (MTFTP) clients and servers to \nreliably transfer very large files without
    embedding \nadditional alignment information into the data stream and \nwithout
    experiencing dropped connections when the Block \nNumber field in the DATA/ACK
    packets rolls over to zero.\n\t "

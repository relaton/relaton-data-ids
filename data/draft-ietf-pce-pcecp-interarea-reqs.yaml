  content: "For scalability purposes, a network may comprise multiple Interior Gateway
    Protocol (IGP) areas.  An inter-area Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP)
    is an LSP that transits through at least two IGP areas.  In a multi-area network,
    topology visibility remains local to a given area, and a head-end Label Switching
    Router (LSR) cannot compute an inter-area shortest constrained path.  One key
    application of the Path Computation Element (PCE)-based architecture is the computation
    of inter-area TE-LSP paths.  The PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP) is used to
    communicate computation requests from Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to PCEs,
    and to return computed paths in responses.  This document lists a detailed set
    of PCECP-specific requirements for support of inter-area TE-LSP path computation.
    \ It complements the generic requirements for a PCE Communication Protocol.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

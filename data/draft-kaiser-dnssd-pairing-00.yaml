  content: "   This document proposes a device pairing mechanism that establishes
    a\n   relationship between two devices by agreeing on a secret and manually\n
    \  verifying the secret's authenticity using an SAS (short\n   authentication
    string).  Pairing has to be performed only once per\n   pair of devices, as for
    a re-discovery at any later point in time,\n   the exchanged secret can be used
    for mutual authentication.\n\n   The proposed pairing method is suited for each
    application area where\n   human operated devices need to establish a relation
    that allows\n   configurationless and privacy preserving re-discovery at any later\n
    \  point in time.  Since privacy preserving applications are the main\n   suitors,
    we especially care about privacy.\n\n\t "

  content: "\n   This document describes extensions to Single Hop Virtual Circuit
    \n   Connectivity Verification (SH-VCCV) procedures for segmented pseudo \n   wires
    to test the end-to-end forwarding datapath and to provide a MS-\n   PW segment
    trace capability. This is accomplished by changing the \n   adaptation function
    for the Single Hop VCCV parameter at the \n   switching point between two distinct
    PW control planes. \n \n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the usage of the Border Gateway Protocol \n(BGP)
    \ to establish Transparent LAN Services (TLS) tunnels across \nAutonomous System
    (AS) boundaries. TLS is described in [MARTINI-\nSIG] and [LASSERRE-TLS]. The focus
    of this document is to explain \nhow to achieve the tunnel LSP between Provider
    Edge (PE) routers in \ndifferent ASes. The method described herein may also be
    used in \n[BGP-VPN] implementations.\n\t "

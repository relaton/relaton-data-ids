abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In order to implement the Simple Internet Protocol (SIPP) in an operating
    system based on 4.x BSD, changes must be made to some of the application program
    interfaces (APIs).  TCP/IP applications written for BSD-based operating systems
    have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability because most of the systems
    derived from BSD provide the same API, known informally as 'the socket interface'.
    \ We would like the same portability to be possible with SIPP applications.  This
    memo presents a set of changes to the BSD socket API to support SIPP.  The changes
    include a new data structure to carry SIPP address sequences, new name to address
    translation library functions, new address conversion functions, and some new
    setsockopt() options. The changes are designed to be minimal and to provide source
    and binary compatibility for existing applications.\n\t "

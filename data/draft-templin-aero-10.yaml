  script: Latn
  content: "   Nodes attached to common multi-access link types (e.g., multicast-\n
    \  capable, shared media, non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA), etc.)\n   can
    exchange packets as neighbors on the link, but may not always be\n   provisioned
    with sufficient routing information for optimal neighbor\n   selection.  Such
    nodes should therefore be able to discover a trusted\n   intermediate router on
    the link that provides both forwarding\n   services to reach off-link destinations
    and redirection services to\n   inform the node of an on-link neighbor that is
    closer to the final\n   destination.  This redirection can provide a useful route\n
    \  optimization, since the triangular path from the ingress link\n   neighbor,
    to the intermediate router, and finally to the egress link\n   neighbor may be
    considerably longer than the direct path from ingress\n   to egress.  However,
    ordinary redirection may lead to operational\n   issues on certain link types
    and/or in certain deployment scenarios.\n   This document therefore introduces
    an Asymmetric Extended Route\n   Optimization (AERO) capability that addresses
    the issues.\n\n\t "

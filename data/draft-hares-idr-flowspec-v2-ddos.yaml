  content: "   BGP flow specification version 1 (FSv1), defined in RFC 8955, RFC\n
    \  8956, and RFC 9117 describes the distribution of traffic filter\n   policy
    (traffic filters and actions) distributed via BGP.  During the\n   deployment
    of BGP FSv1 a number of issues were detected, so version 2\n   of the BGP flow
    specification (FSv2) protocol addresses these\n   features.  In order to provide
    a clear demarcation between FSv1 and\n   FSv2, a different NLRI encapsulates FSv2.\n\n
    \  IDR requires two implementations prior to standardization.\n   Implementers
    feedback on FSv2 was that the complete FSv2 has the\n   contains the correct information,
    but that breaking FSv2 into a\n   progression of documents would be helpful.  The
    first priority in\n   this progression is expanded IP DDOS capabilities.  This
    document\n   contains original FSv2 IP DDOS capabilities in FlowSpec v2 using
    just\n   the extended communities to define actions.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The purpose of this Internet Draft is  to  start  discussion  on  the\n
    \  issues  involved  in  PSTN  Internet  Notification  (PIN), as part of\n   interconnecting
    IP and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  with\n   the intent of converging
    existing and creating new hybrid PSTN and IP\n   services.   PSTN  Events  Notification,
    \ based  on  open well-defined\n   protocols, will promote interoperability of
    \ both  the  networks  and\n   systems built by different vendors.  This Internet
    Draft is submitted\n   with the goal of becoming an informational RFC.\n \n   The
    rest of this document is as follows:\n \n   Section 2 briefly describes the PIN
    services.\n \n   Section  3 describes the scope of the proposed project by introducing\n
    \  its  overall  architecture  and  identifying  the  interfaces  to  be\n   standardized.\n
    \n   Sections  4,  5,  and 6 respectively address security considerations,\n   supply
    references, and provide the authors address,  as  required  by\n   [1].\n \n   Section
    \ 7  acknowledges  individuals  providing  assistance  in  the\n   creation of
    this document.\n\n\t "

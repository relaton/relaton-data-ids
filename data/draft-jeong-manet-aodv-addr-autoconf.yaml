  content: "This document specifies the steps a node running AODV in ad hoc \n   network
    takes in deciding how to autoconfigure its IPv4 or IPv6 \n   address in network
    interface.  Because the ad hoc IP address \n   autoconfiguration in this document
    considers ad hoc network's \n   partition and mergence, the address duplication
    caused by ad hoc \n   network's mergence can be resolved through address resolution
    \n   protocol.  Also, this document specifies how to resolve the address \n   duplication
    in order to guarantee the maintenance of upper-layer \n   sessions, such as TCP
    session.\n\t "

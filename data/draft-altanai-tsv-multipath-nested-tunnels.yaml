abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the transport-layer challenges of path selection
    in environments with multiple available tunneling options and congestion control
    mechanisms. It identifies congestion control conflicts that arise from nested
    tunneling protocols and proposes a congestion-aware multipath tunnel selection
    algorithm that conforms to the guidelines established in [RFC9599] for adding
    congestion notification to protocols that encapsulate IP. The proposed approach
    considers Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) propagation, transport protocol
    characteristics, and network conditions to optimize path selection while avoiding
    multilevel congestion control issues. This work aligns with current Transport
    and Services Working Group efforts on Non-Queue-Building (NQB) behaviors, careful
    congestion control resume, and multipath transport protocols.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes a service chaining mechanism, which is used\n
    \  to indicate the data packets going through multiple Service\n   Processing
    Entities and processed by those Service Processing\n   Entities with preset order.
    This document also provides a new service\n   chaining header encapsulation for
    packets in a service chain. The\n   system can get the information of the next
    Service Processing Entity\n   where the data packet should go by checking the
    service chaining\n   header.\n\n\t "

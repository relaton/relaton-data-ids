  content: "   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices.\n   These
    devices typically have some combination of limited battery\n   power, small memory
    footprint and low throughput links.  It is\n   expected that in CoAP networks
    there will be a certain portion of\n   devices that are \"sleepy\" and which may
    occasionally go into a sleep\n   mode (i.e. go into a low power state to conserve
    power) and\n   temporarily suspend CoAP protocol communication.  This document\n
    \  proposes a minimal and efficient mechanism building on the Resource\n   Directory
    concept to enhance sleepy node support in CoAP networks.\n\n\t "

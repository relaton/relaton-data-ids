  content: "   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for\n
    \  multiple authentication methods.  This document defines the EAP-UTE\n   authentication
    method for a User-assisted Trust Establishment between\n   the peer and the server.
    \ The EAP method is intended for\n   bootstrapping Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices
    without preconfigured\n   authentication credentials.  The trust establishment
    is achieved by\n   transmitting a one-directional out-of-band (OOB) message between
    the\n   peer and the server to authenticate the in-band exchange.  The peer\n
    \  must have a secondary input or output interface, such as a display,\n   camera,
    microphone, speaker, blinking light, or light sensor, so that\n   dynamically
    generated messages with tens of bytes in length can be\n   transmitted or received.\n\n\t "

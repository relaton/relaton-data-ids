  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format\n(IDMEF)
    is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing\ninformation of
    interest to intrusion detection and response systems,\nand to the management systems
    which may need to interact with them.\nThe goals and requirements of the IDMEF
    are described in [3].\nTwo implementations of the IDMEF data format have been
    proposed: one\nusing the Structure of Management Information (SMI) to describe
    an\nSNMP MIB, and the other using a Document Type Definition (DTD) to\ndescribe
    XML documents.  Both representations appear to have their\ngood and bad traits,
    and deciding between them is difficult.\nTo arrive at an informed decision, the
    working group tasked the\nauthors to identify and analyze the pros and cons of
    both approaches,\nand present the results in the form of an Internet-Draft.\n\t "

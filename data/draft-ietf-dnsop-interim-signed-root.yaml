  content: "This memo documents a proposed mechanism for a first stage of a\ntransition
    from an unsigned DNS root to a signed root, such that\nthe data in the root zone
    is accompanied by DNSSEC signatures to\nallow validation.\nThe underlying reason
    for signing the root zone is to be able to\nprovide a more secure DNS hierarchy,
    where it is possible to\ndistinguish false answers from correct answers.\nFor
    the special case of the DNS root zone, an interim scheme is\nproposed. This scheme
    is mostly aimed at securing the root zone\nitself for technical and operational
    reasons, and to give\noperational experience of DNSSEC.\n\n\t "

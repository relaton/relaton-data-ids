  script: Latn
  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) introduces new mobility entities: the\n   local
    mobility anchor (LMA) and the mobile access gateway (MAG).  The\n   LMA and MAG
    manage bi-directional tunnels between themselves to\n   provide a network-based
    mobility service to mobile nodes (MNs) within\n   a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain).
    \ The failure of LMA\n   connected with its MAGs causes the communication failure
    of MNs\n   attached to the MAGs.  Thus, the early failure detection of LMA is\n
    \  desirable for appropriate countermeasures.  This document specifies a\n   heartbeat
    mechanism for LMAs to detect the current reachability\n   between the LMAs.\n\t "

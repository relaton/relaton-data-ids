  content: "   Mobile IP (MIP) is the well-known protocol to handle the mobility of\n
    \  IP-based mobile nodes (MN). However, MIP has some drawbacks,\n   including
    high latency in updates during a handover, and the need for\n   infrastructure
    in the home networks of MNs. To enhance the mobility\n   of nodes within a single
    domain, an access network (AN), several\n   local mobility (also called micro
    mobility) management protocols have\n   been suggested. All these protocols have
    their strengths and\n   drawbacks. The deployment of these protocols is a chicken
    and egg\n   problem, since both the AN and the MNs must support the same\n   protocol.
    This draft presents a new protocol that can be used to\n   replace the communication
    between the AN and the MNs in the existing\n   local mobility management schemes.
    The protocol hides from MNs the\n   AN-internal mobility management mechanisms
    and, therefore, allows MNs\n   to log in to and roam within any AN regardless
    of the local mobility\n   scheme used.\n\t "

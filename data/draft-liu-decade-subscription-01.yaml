  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a potential performance issue in DECADE to\n
    \  support real-time applications.  It shows the current content hashing\n   based
    naming scheme might harm the performance when the content data\n   is generated
    in real time and low propagation latency of the data is\n   required.  This draft
    propose a new naming scheme and protocol,\n   subscribe/unsubscribe, for real-time
    applications to address the\n   problem caused by content hashing.  DECADE clients
    use subscribe/\n   unsubscribe to express their interests to receive data streaming.\n
    \  DECADE servers pro-actively push stream data to eligible clients,\n   which
    saves the time consumed on exchanging the hashing of new\n   generated data.\n\n\t "

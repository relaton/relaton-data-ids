  content: "   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection\n   protocol
    that can quickly determine a communication failure between\n   devices and notify
    upper-layer applications [RFC5880].  BFD has\n   asynchronous detecting mode and
    demand detection mode to satisfy\n   different scenarios, also supports echo function
    as an adjunct to\n   both modes to reduce the device requirement for BFD.\n\n
    \  Unaffiliated BFD echo function described in this document reuses the\n   BFD
    echo function as described in [RFC5880] and [RFC5881], but\n   independent of
    BFD asynchronous mode or BFD demand mode, that means\n   it doesn't need BFD protocol
    capability of state machine, but only\n   BFD echo function to a deployed device
    supporting BFD detection.\n   When using unaffiliated BFD echo function, just
    the local device\n   works on BFD protocol and the BFD peer doesn't, which only
    loopback\n   the received BFD echo packets as usual data packets without enabling\n
    \  BFD protocol.\n\n   Section 6.2.2 of [BBF-TR-146] describes one use case of
    the\n   unaffiliated BFD echo function, and at least one more use case is\n   known
    in the field BFD deployment.\n\n\t "

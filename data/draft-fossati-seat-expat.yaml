abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a method for two parties in a communication
    interaction to exchange Evidence and Attestation Results using exported authenticators,
    as defined in [RFC9261]. Additionally, it introduces the cmw_attestation extension,
    which allows attestation credentials to be included directly in the Certificate
    message sent during the Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake authentication.
    The approach supports both the passport and background check models from the RATS
    architecture while ensuring that attestation remains bound to the underlying communication
    channel.</p>"

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines a method for two parties in a\n   communication
    interaction to exchange Evidence and Attestation\n   Results using exported authenticators,
    as defined in [RFC9261].\n   Additionally, it introduces the cmw_attestation extension,
    which\n   allows attestation credentials to be included directly in the\n   Certificate
    message sent during the Exported Authenticator-based\n   post-handshake authentication.
    \ The approach supports both the\n   passport and background check models from
    the RATS architecture while\n   ensuring that attestation remains bound to the
    underlying\n   communication channel.\n\n\t "

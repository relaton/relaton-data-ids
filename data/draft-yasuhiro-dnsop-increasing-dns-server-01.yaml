  content: "Currently, it is thought that the maximum number of DNS servers for a\nzone
    is 13. In fact, current root and some TLD zones have 13 DNS\nservers. But this
    is not enough for DNS stability and robustness\nespecially root and/or TLD server,
    therefore, IP anycast [Hardie, 2002]\nis introduced on some root servers.\n\nThis
    draft proposes an another approach for increasing of DNS server\nhosts without
    changing DNS protocol by using 'multiple-addresses per\nhost' method.\n\nAnd this
    draft also considers what is the most suitable number of the IP\naddresses for
    one DNS server name.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the command/response protocol currently used\n
    \  in the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and\n   other
    power devices often deployed in small offices, and in IT\n   installations subject
    to an erratic public power supply.  The UPS\n   units typically interface to an
    Attachment Daemon in the system they\n   protect.  This daemon is in turn polled
    by a Management Daemon which\n   notifies users and system administrators of power
    supply incidents,\n   and automates system shutdown decisions.  The commands and
    responses\n   described by this document are exchanged between the UPS Attachment\n
    \  Daemon and the Management Daemon.  Current practice when this text\n   was
    written risks weak security and this is addressed in the Security\n   Considerations
    sections of this document.\n\n\t "

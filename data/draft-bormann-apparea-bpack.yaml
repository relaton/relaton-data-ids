- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the\n   representation
    of structured information, supporting Boolean values,\n   numbers, strings, arrays,
    and tables.  Recently, a number of\n   applications have started to look for binary
    representation formats\n   that solve a similar problem.  In particular, constrained
    node\n   networks can benefit from such a binary representation format.\n\n   A
    very successful binary representation that is otherwise comparable\n   to JSON
    is MessagePack.  Recently, a number of implementations have\n   modified or extended
    MessagePack such that it allows for\n   distinguishing UTF-8 strings from binary
    data.  Further discussion on\n   the MessagePack repository has resulted in proposals
    how to integrate\n   such an addition back into the MessagePack community.\n\n
    \  This draft, as an independent effort, documents one such format,\n   tentatively
    calling it BinaryPack1pre2 while the MessagePack\n   extension proposals make
    their way through the MessagePack community.\n\n   The current version -01 of
    this document is a snapshot that\n   demonstrates a general direction.  The details
    may change in future\n   versions based on the development of the MessagePack
    specification.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document walks through various examples and call flows for\n   implementing
    \"call pickup\" operations in SIP telephony.  It focuses\n   on distributing as
    much processing as possible in the user agents in\n   accordance with the philosophy
    of end-point controlled call-control\n   (EPCC).\n\n   Various difficulties in
    implementing call pickup are discussed, and\n   further suggestions and discussion
    are solicited.\n\n\t "

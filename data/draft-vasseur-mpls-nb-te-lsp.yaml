  content: "Several Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and ISIS in the\ncontext
    of MPLS Traffic Engineering in order to convery some link\ncharacteristics such
    as the available bandwidth, traffic enginering\nmetric, adminstrative group and
    so on.  There are various\ncircumstances where it would be useful to also know
    the number of\nunconstrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path(s) (TE LSP).\nThis
    document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering sub-TLV\nused to advertise
    the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled\nacross a specific link.\n\t "

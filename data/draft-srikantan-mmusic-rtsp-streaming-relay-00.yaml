  content: "Delivery of streaming media to a large number of clients distributed\nacross
    several geographic and network boundaries presents several\nchallenges in terms
    of scalability and stream quality. This document\ndescribes N-tier relays to address
    scalability and quality issues in\nthe delivery of stored and live content. This
    document addresses\nissues in stream synchronization, content announcement/expiry,\nreliability
    of transport, failover/recovery, administration, and\nsecurity issues. This document
    propose a set of primitives to enable\nimplementation of Push and Pull mechanisms
    for N-tier relays. We also\nprovide usage scenarios where each approach is most
    useful. The Pull\nand Push  mechanisms are complementary and provide valuable
    building\nblocks in N-tier relays. This document introduces a few new RTSP\nmethods
    and headers. \n\n\t "

  content: "   With the rapid development of AI technology, intelligent computing\n
    \  and super-computing services, the demand for wide-area transmission\n   of
    massive data is increasing.  This paper makes full use of the\n   advantages of
    IP network, such as statistical reuse and elastic\n   supply, and proposes a reference
    architecture of high elasticity and\n   high throughput data express based on
    IP network.  In order to\n   support differentiated data express services and
    create task-type\n   data express services, the \"one low and three high\" technical
    system\n   is proposed.\n\n\n\t "

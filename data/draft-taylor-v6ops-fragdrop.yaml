  content: "   This memo was written to make application developers and network\n
    \  operators aware of the significant possibility that IPv6 packets\n   containing
    fragmentation extension headers may fail to reach their\n   destination.  Some
    protocol or application assumptions about the\n   ability to use messages larger
    than a single packet may accordingly\n   not be supportable in all networks or
    circumstances.\n\n   This memo provides observational evidence for the dropping
    of IPv6\n   fragments along a significant number of paths, explores the\n   operational
    impact of fragmentation and the reasons and scenarios\n   where drops occur, and
    considers the effect of fragment drops on\n   applications where fragmentation
    is known to occur, particularly\n   including DNS.\n\n\t "

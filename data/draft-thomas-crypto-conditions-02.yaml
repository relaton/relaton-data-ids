abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The crypto-conditions specification defines a set of encoding formats\n
    \  and data structures for *conditions* and *fulfillments*.  A condition\n   uniquely
    identifies a logical \"boolean circuit\" constructed from one\n   or more logic
    gates, evaluated by either validating a cryptographic\n   signature or verifying
    the preimage of a hash digest.  A fulfillment\n   is a data structure encoding
    one or more cryptographic signatures and\n   hash digest preimages that define
    the structure of the circuit and\n   provide inputs to the logic gates allowing
    for the result of the\n   circuit to be evaluated.\n\n   A fulfillment is validated
    by evaluating that the circuit output is\n   TRUE but also that the provided fulfillment
    matches the circuit\n   fingerprint, the condition.\n\n   Since evaluation of
    some of the logic gates in the circuit (those\n   that are signatures) also take
    a message as input the evaluation of\n   the entire fulfillment takes an optional
    input message which is\n   passed to each logic gate as required.  As such the
    algorithm to\n   validate a fulfillment against a condition and a message matches
    that\n   of other signature schemes and a crypto-condition can serve as a\n   sophisticated
    and flexible replacement for a simple signature where\n   the condition is used
    as the public key and the fulfillment as the\n   signature.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A power saving scheme for switching of TCAM banks of fine granularity\n
    \  is discussed in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This scheme switches of TCAM\n   banks
    of fine granularity and their corresponding SRAM banks\n   depending on the occupancy
    of routes and their rewrites within the\n   TCAM of a intelligent router line
    card (where one or more such TCAM\n   entities along with their SRAM banks may
    reside) by using an\n   algorithm specified in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This takes
    care of\n   switching off TCAM and SRAM banks within a router's line card and\n
    \  correspondingly saves power when the traffic matrix is not large with\n   respect
    to the routes the packets lookup where the occupancy of such\n   routes is low
    in the line card. This is with reference to both single\n   and multi-chassis
    devices. The algorithm specified therein tends to\n   switch off banks which are
    not in use. The aim of this draft is to\n   use the device level characteristic
    in the form of a TCAM Power Ratio\n   and disseminate it as a metric within an
    area or an Autonomous system\n   (where multiple such areas exist within an AS)
    to compute power\n   saving paths through the set of routers where the TCAM-POWER-RATIO
    is\n   low. The TCAM-POWER-RATIO is arrived at by dividing the number of\n   bits
    in the TCAM banks that are switched off by the Total Available\n   TCAM bank space
    in bits. This ratio is then subjected to the SPF\n   algorithm as in a link state
    protocol like OSPF or IS-IS with\n   available utilization on the links also being
    a factor. This way\n   those routers that have more TCAM banks switched off are
    avoided and\n   those with higher power consumption but with available bandwidth
    are\n   used hence not increasing the total power consumed within the area\n   and
    hence within the AS.\n\n\t "

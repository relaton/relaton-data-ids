  content: "During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the \ninteroperation
    between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential. \nMulticast services across
    IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed. \nBesides the packet-based multicast translation
    mechanism, this \ndocument describes a multicast proxy solution. The multicast
    proxy is \ndeployed at the border of IPv6/IPv4 networks. It is mainly based on
    \ncontent cache concept. Without packet-based translation, it retires \nthe content
    data from IPvX network, caches the data, and multicasts \nthe data in IPvY network.
    It acts as a multicast leaf in the IPvX \nnetwork where the data source locates.
    It also acts as a multicast \nsource in IPvY network where the multicast client
    locates.\n\t "

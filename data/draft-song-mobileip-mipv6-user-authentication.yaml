  content: "The demand for wireless mobile networking has been dramatically \nincreased
    thanks to rapid development of Wireless technology and \nde facto Mobile IP technology.
    \ Mobile IP, as originally specified, \ndefines the protocol enhancements that
    can provide IP mobility over \nthe Internet.  The mobile node, identified by its
    Home Address \nregardless its attaching point can have transparent routing of
    IP \ndatagrams.  However it is also necessary to provide User Mobility in \nnowadays
    wireless mobile network.  The user authentication which is \ndefining in this
    document is to help user to originate and terminate \nthe packet regardless of
    the location of mobile terminal and \nwithout home address through AAA infrastructure.
    \ This document \nspecifies the mechanism for the MN-AAA authentication in Mobile
    IPv6 \nfor IP User Mobility support.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: '<p>This document presents a systemic meditation on how the Internet arrived
    at its present connectivity equilibrium. The analysis proceeds by retrospective
    reconstruction: examining observable adaptations, constraints, and deferred decisions
    across multiple layers of the stack, rather than by benchmarking, simulation,
    or protocol comparison. The term "meditation" is used deliberately to indicate
    a method grounded in historical observation, accumulated operational experience,
    and the interpretation of persistent compensatory mechanisms as empirical evidence
    of structural conditions. The document does not assign fault, advocate specific
    remedies, or propose new protocol mechanisms. Instead, it seeks to explain how
    a sequence of locally rational responses to real pressures interacted over time
    to produce a stable, but heavily mediated, connectivity equilibrium at Internet
    scale.</p>'

  content: "   The HOKEY WG is developing solutions for optimizations as well as\n
    \  security key hierarchy specifications for handovers.  The key\n   derivation
    specifications all draw from a trust relationship that is\n   created as a result
    of a \"2-party\" EAP authentication between a peer\n   and a backend server, while
    distributing the resulting keys to third\n   parties other than the peer and the
    backend server.  This document\n   describes problem statement and requirements
    on a three-party key\n   distribution protocol for handover keyings.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation \n    functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label \n    Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. \n     \n    MPLS and GMPLS networks may
    be constructed from layered service \n    networks. It is advantageous for overall
    network efficiency to \n    provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple
    network \n    layers through a process called inter-layer traffic engineering.
    \n    PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.\n\t "

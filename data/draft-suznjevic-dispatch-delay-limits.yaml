  content: "   Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the\n   Quality
    of Experience (QoE) of network services.  This document\n   surveys a set of recommendations
    about the maximum latency tolerated\n   by the users of services with delay constraints.
    \ Some\n   recommendations already exist for e.g.  VoIP, but emerging services\n
    \  as e.g. online gaming, have different requirements.  Different papers\n   in
    the literature reporting these constraints are surveyed, and a\n   summary of
    the latency limits for each service is provided.\n\n\t "

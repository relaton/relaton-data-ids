  content: "VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP. When MPLS\n   Labels
    are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an\n   MPLS VPN, the
    packet header is typically 48 bytes, while the voice\n   payload is often no more
    than 30 bytes, for example. Header\n   compression can significantly reduce the
    overhead through various\n   compression mechanisms.  MPLS is used to route header-compressed
    (HC)\n   packets over an MPLS LSP without compression/decompression cycles at\n
    \  each router.  Such an HC over MPLS capability increases the bandwidth\n   efficiency
    as well as processing scalability of the maximum number of\n   simultaneous compressed
    flows that use HC at each router.  MPLS\n   pseudowires are used to transport
    the HC context and other control\n   messages between the ingress and egress MPLS
    label switched router\n   (LSR), and the pseudowires define a point to point instance
    of each\n   HC session at the header decompressor.  Standard HC methods (e.g.,\n
    \  ECRTP, ROHC, etc.) are re-used to determine the context.\n\t "

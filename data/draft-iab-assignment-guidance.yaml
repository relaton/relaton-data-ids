  content: "The IAB suggests that while RFC 1597 establishes reserved IP address space
    for the use of private networks which are isolated and will remain isolated from
    the Internet, any enterprise which anticipates external connectivity to the Internet
    should apply for a globally unique address from an Internet registry or service
    provider.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
    does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.\n\t "

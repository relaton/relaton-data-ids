  content: "This document describes the Intrazone Routing Protocol (IARP), a\nlimited
    scope proactive routing protocol used to improve the\nperformance of existing
    globally reactive routing protocols.  With\neach node monitoring changes in its
    surrounding R-hop neighborhood\n(routing zone), global route discoveries to local
    destinations can be\navoided.  When a global route search is needed, the IARP's
    routing\nzones can be used to efficiently guide route queries outwards (via\nbordercasting)
    rather than blindly relaying queries from neighbor\nto neighbor.  The proactive
    maintenance of routing zones also helps\nimprove the quality of discovered routes,
    by making them more robust\nto changes in network topology.  Once routes have
    been discovered,\nIARP's routing zone offers enhanced, real-time, route maintenance.\nLink
    failures can be bypassed by multiple hop paths within the\nrouting zone.  Similarly,
    suboptimal route segments can be identified\nand traffic re-routed along shorter
    paths.\n\t "

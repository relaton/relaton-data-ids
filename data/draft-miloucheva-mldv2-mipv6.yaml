  content: "Protocol mechanisms for fast mobile multicast in IPv6 based on multicast\nlistening
    context transfer are proposed. \nThe focus is the context transfer for mobile
    multicast listeners using\nMulticast Listener Discovery protocol Version 2 (MLDv2).\nMulticast
    context transfer block and operational considerations for\noptimised multicast
    context transfer based on Fast Handovers for Mobile\nIPv6 and Candidate Access
    Router Discovery are described.  \nThe requirements for MLDv2 context extension
    and operation at access\nrouters to support multicast context transfer for mobile
    IPv6 are\nspecified. \nInteractions of MLDv2 with Protocol Independent Multicast
    Sparse Mode\n(PIM-SM) for multicast routing state update based on multicast\nlistening
    context transfer are overviewed.\nOperational considerations for MLDv2 and PIM-SM
    to support multicast\nreceiver and source mobility based on context transfer are
    discussed.\nComparison with other multicast protocol proposals for Mobile IPv6\n(MIPv6)
    is given. \n\t "

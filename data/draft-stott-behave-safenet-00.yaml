  content: "   One of the main challenges hindering the acceptance of VoIP is a \n
    \  standards-based solution for traversing middleboxes such as Network \n   Address
    Translation (NAT) and FireWall (FW) boxes.  This Internet-\n   Draft presents
    SAFENeT, a protocol that is intended to operate in an \n   enterprise environment
    and that allows the accommodation of real-time \n   services by the call server,
    internal to the enterprise network, to \n   communicate with the NAT/FW to enable
    the transversal of real-time \n   services including VoIP.  This document describes
    the SAFENeT \n   architecture and protocol and shows how it overcomes the problems
    \n   caused by NATs/FWs.  The SAFENeT architecture also enables security \n   features
    such as data confidentiality and digital integrity to be \n   used for the VoIP
    traffic traversing the NAT/FW.  \n\t "

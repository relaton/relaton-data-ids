  content: "   This document discusses notion and actual mechanisms of\n   \"Corresponding
    Auto Names\" for IPv6 Addresses. With this mechanism,\n   all IPv6 addresses (even
    if they are link-local scoped addresses)\n   can obtain their own Names, and it
    will be able to use Names\n   anywhere instead of IPv6 Addresses.\n\n   IPv6 address
    is too long and complicated to remember, and it is\n   very nuisance thing to
    type a literal IPv6 address manually as an\n   argument of applications. Also,
    it is very difficult for human\n   beings to tell which IPv6 address is set to
    which actual IPv6 node.\n   In this sense, literal IPv6 address information can
    be called\n   meaningless information for human beings.\n\n   In order to solve
    above problems and to make the information\n   meaningful, mechanisms called Corresponding
    Auto Names for IPv6\n   addresses is introduced. They will become gentle information
    for\n   human beings. By applying a simple naming rule to the Auto Names\n   (e.g.,
    use the same name-prefix for IPv6 addresses that are set to\n   the same interface
    (node)), this will contribute to help people to\n   understand which IPv6 address
    / Name indicates which actual IPv6\n   node.\n\n\n\t "

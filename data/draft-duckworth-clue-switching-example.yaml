  content: "   This document presents an example multipoint use case scenario for\n
    \  CLUE.  This example uses the media switching variety of the Topo-\n   Mixer
    RTP topology.  This example is intended to promote discussion\n   about how to
    implement it using the CLUE Framework, and whether or\n   not the framework as
    currently defined is sufficient to enable this\n   use case.\n\n   This version
    is incomplete, and is intended to raise questions and\n   prompt discussion.\n\n\t "

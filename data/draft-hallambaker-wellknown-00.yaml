abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Under the current system of registration, separate requests are\n   required
    to register entries for .well-known HTTP services, discovery\n   via DNS mechanisms
    such as SRV and NAPTR and for a URI prefix.  This\n   proposal encourages Web
    Services to adopt a consistent approach to\n   configuration through a 'one stop'
    registration system whereby\n   assignment of a .well-known identifier automatically
    assigns DNS and\n   URI prefixes.\n\n\t "

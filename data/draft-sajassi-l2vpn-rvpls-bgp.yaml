  content: "VPLS, as currently defined, has challenges pertaining to the areas \nof
    redundancy and multicast optimization. In particular, multi-\nhoming with all-active
    forwarding cannot be supported and there's no \nknown solution to date for leveraging
    MP2MP MDTs for optimizing the \ndelivery of multi-destination frames. This document
    defines an \nevolution of the current VPLS solution, referred to as Routed VPLS
    \n(R-VPLS), to address these shortcomings. In addition, this solution \noffers
    several benefits over current VPLS such as: ease of \nprovisioning, per-flow load-balancing
    of traffic from/to multi-homed \nsites, optimum traffic forwarding to PEs with
    both single-homed and \nmulti-homed sites, support for flexible multi-homing groups
    and fast \nconvergence upon failures. \n \n \nConventions \n \nThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119\n\t "

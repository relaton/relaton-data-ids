  content: "   \"Happy Eyeballs\" (RFC6555) is the name for a technique of reducing\n
    \  user-visible delays on dual-stack hosts.  Since one address family\n   (IPv4
    or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network,\n   clients that
    attempt connections for both address families in\n   parallel have a higher chance
    of establishing a connection sooner.\n   Now that this approach has been deployed
    at scale and measured for\n   several years, the algorithm specification can be
    refined to improve\n   its reliability and generalization.\n\n\t "

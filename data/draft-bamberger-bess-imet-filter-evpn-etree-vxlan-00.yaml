abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 8317 defines EVPN Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) and associated filtering\n
    \  rules for both known unicast and broadcast, unknown unicast, and\n   multicast
    (BUM) traffic, using Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\n   encapsulation.  The
    processes and protocols specified in RFC 8317 for\n   performing E-Tree filtering
    on known unicast traffic are implemented\n   entirely with EVPN routes, and are
    thus also applicable to networks\n   using Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) encapsulation.
    \ However, E-Tree\n   filtering for BUM traffic is accomplished using specific
    features of\n   MPLS encapsulation, and is thus not applicable for networks using\n
    \  VXLAN encapsulation.\n\n   In networks where E-Tree root/leaf role classification
    is done per-\n   provider edge (PE) device, or per-attachment circuit (AC) on
    each PE\n   device, an extension to EVPN type-3 inclusive multicast (IMET) routes\n
    \  can be added to allow E-Tree filtering for BUM traffic in networks\n   using
    VXLAN encapsulation.  Additionally, this proposal specifies\n   filtering BUM
    traffic on ingress, as opposed to the egress filtering\n   specified by RFC 8317,
    which can be considered to be more optimal, as\n   it reduces the amount of unnecessary
    BUM traffic transmitted over the\n   network.\n\n\t "

  content: "   NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of\n
    \  translations and information about the resources it is managing.\n   With the
    wide deployment of Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices, the\n   logging of events
    have become very important for legal purposes.  The\n   logs are required in many
    cases to identify an attacker or a host\n   that was used to launch malicious
    attacks and/or for various other\n   purposes of accounting.  Since there is no
    standard way of logging\n   this information, different NAT devices behave differently
    and hence\n   it is difficult to expect a consistent behavior.  The lack of a\n
    \  consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector applications\n   that
    would receive this data and process it to present useful\n   information.  This
    document describes the information that is\n   required to be logged by the NAT
    devices.\n\n\t "

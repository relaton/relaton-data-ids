abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies SOCKS 4A, an extension to the SOCKS Version
    4 protocol. This extension allows SOCKS clients to delegate domain name resolution
    to the SOCKS server. This is particularly useful in environments where the client
    host cannot resolve the destination host's domain name due to restrictive network
    policies or lack of DNS access. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before
    publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found
    at https://github.com/4socks/socks4.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service\n   Application
    Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the Simple\n   Authentication and Security
    Layer (SASL) framework.  This is done by\n   defining a new SASL mechanism family,
    called GS2.  This mechanism\n   family offers a number of improvements over the
    previous \"SASL/\n   GSSAPI\" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages
    for the\n   authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of\n
    \  channel binding.  This is an update of RFC 5801 that relaxes the\n   requirement
    for channel binding support and mutual authentication in\n   the underlying GSS-API
    mechanism.\n\n\t "

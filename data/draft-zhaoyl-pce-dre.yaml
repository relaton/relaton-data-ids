  content: "   Path Computation Element (PCE) is proposed for path computation in\n
    \  multi-layer and multi-domain networks where PCE can be implemented in\n   either
    centralized method or distributed method.  In the former case,\n   PCE can serve
    tens or hundreds of nodes simultaneously, while in the\n   later case, each node
    is equipped with a PCE, which can be regarded\n   as a distributed routing controller
    (DRC) in GMPLS networks and each\n   one of those provides similar path computation
    capability.  PCE and\n   DRC have different advantages in path computation respectively.
    \ PCE\n   is suitable for cross-layer and cross-domain path computation,\n   especially
    in multi-constraints environment.  But distributed routing\n   controller is good
    at path computation in parallel ways and\n   distributed network control in local
    domain.  A cooperative path\n   computation architecture named Dual Routing Engine
    (DRE) is necessary\n   to be used in the future networks, for it based on the
    ideas of the\n   cooperation of these two types of path computation engines and
    can\n   take the advantages of both centralized and distributed method by\n   which
    the PCE is implemented.  The corresponding PCE communication\n   protocol extension
    and other protocol requirements for cooperation\n   between PCE and distributed
    routing controller are listed in this\n   document to recommend the standard interfaces
    between different\n   components in DRE architecture.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple\n   communication
    networks based on different technology implementations\n   and network architectures
    like WiFi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. In such\n   scenario, it is desirable to combine
    multiple access networks to\n   improve quality of experience. For example, an
    IP flow may be\n   delivered over both LTE and Wi-Fi network for higher end-to-end\n
    \  throughput. In another example, lost packets may be retransmitted\n   when
    the device switches from Wi-Fi to LTE. However, such multi-\n   access optimization
    requires inserting additional control\n   information, e.g. Sequence Number, into
    each IP packet.\n\n   Unfortunately, there is no existing IP protocol for such
    purpose. As\n   a result, IP-over-IP tunneling has been used in today's solutions,\n
    \  e.g. [LWIPEP] [GRE], to insert the GRE header, and then encode\n   additional
    control information in the GRE header fields, e.g. Key,\n   Sequence Number. However,
    there are two main drawbacks with this\n   approach: 1) IP-over-IP tunneling leads
    to higher overhead\n   especially for small packet. For example, the overhead
    of IP-over-\n   IP/GRE tunneling with both Key and Sequence Number is 32 Bytes,\n
    \  which is 80% of a 40 Bytes TCP ACK packet; 2) It is difficult to\n   introduce
    new control fields using the existing GRE header format.\n\n   This document presents
    a new light-weight and flexible encapsulation\n   protocol to support multi-access
    solutions [ATSSS] [MAMS] [LWIPEP]\n   without IP-over-IP tunneling.\n\n\t "

  content: "Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) [1] integrates the label swapping\nforwarding
    paradigm with network layer routing. To deliver reliable service, MPLS requires
    a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on the label
    switched paths (LSPs). This requires that the label switched routers (LSRs) support
    failure detection, failure notification,  and protection mechanisms, and that
    LSP signaling support the configuration of working and protection paths. With
    these objectives in mind, this document specifies a framework for MPLS protection,
    and discusses the requirements and mechanisms necessary to implement protection
    in MPLS networks.\n\t "

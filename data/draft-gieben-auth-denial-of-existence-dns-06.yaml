  content: "Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that a
    certain domain name does not exist. It is also used to signal that a domain name
    exists but does not have the specific resource record (RR) type you were asking
    for. When returning a negative DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) response, a name
    server usually includes up to two NSEC records. With NSEC version 3 (NSEC3), this
    amount is three.\n\n This document provides additional background commentary and
    some context for the NSEC and NSEC3 mechanisms used by DNSSEC to provide authenticated
    denial-of-existence responses.\n\t "

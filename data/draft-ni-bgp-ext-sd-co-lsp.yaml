  content: "   In some large scale L3VPN deployment scenarios like mobile backhaul\n
    \  network, it is required that tunnels between two PEs could be setup\n   automatically
    driven by L3VPN service to reduce manual configuration\n   effort. Moreover the
    tunnels must be setup co-routed for the\n   goodness of performance monitoring
    and uniform protection behavior\n   for link failure on two directions. This is
    described in [I-D.li-\n   mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk]. This document introduces
    a new\n   BGP VT route based on [I-D.ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-pm]. The route is\n   utilized
    by on side PE to advertise Tunnel ID to other side PE,\n   so inverse direction
    co-routed LSPs can be setup based on path\n   information of member LSPs in the
    first tunnel.\n\n\t "

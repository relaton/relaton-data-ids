  content: "This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6 \n
    \  addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is \n   known
    as Address Resolution (AR), or Neighbour Discovery (ND). Such \n   address resolution
    complements the higher layer resource discovery \n   tools that are used to advertise
    IP sessions. In MPEG-2 networks, an \n   IP address must be associated with a
    Packet ID (PID) and a specific \n   Transmission Multiplex The document reviews
    current methods. It also \n   describes the interaction with well-known protocols
    for address \n   management including DHCP, ARP, and NDP, and provides guidance
    on \n   usage.\n\t "

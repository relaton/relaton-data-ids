  content: "   The objectives of this document are to analyze the various design\n
    \  options, and provide a set of recommendations to be followed during\n   the
    design phase of the Service Function Chaining solution(s).  Note:\n\n   o  The
    analysis does not claim to be exhaustive.  The list includes a\n      preliminary
    set of potential solutions; other proposals can be\n      added to the analysis
    if required.\n\n   o  The analysis is still ongoing.  The analysis text will be
    updated\n      to integrate received comments and inputs.\n\n   o  Sketched recommendations
    are not frozen.  These recommendations\n      are provided as proposals to kick-off
    the discussion and to\n      challenge them.\n\n   o  The analysis does not cover
    any application-specific solution\n      (e.g., HTTP header) because of the potential
    issues inherent to\n      (TLS) encrypted traffic.\n\n   o  The analysis will
    be updated to take into account the full set of\n      SFC requirements.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This protocol describes a transformation method for representing non-\nASCII
    characters in domain names in a fashion that is completely\ncompatible with the
    current DNS. It meets the many requirements for\ninternationalization of domain
    names.\n\nNote: this protocol is quite experimental and should not be deployed
    in\nthe Internet until it reaches standards track in the IETF.\n\t "

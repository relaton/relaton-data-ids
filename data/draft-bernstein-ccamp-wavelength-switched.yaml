  content: "This memo provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi-\n   Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element \n   (PCE) architecture
    to the control of wavelength switched optical \n   networks (WSON).  In particular
    we provide control plane models for \n   key wavelength switched optical network
    subsystems and processes. The \n   subsystems include wavelength division multiplexed
    links, tunable \n   laser transmitters, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers
    \n   (ROADM) and wavelength converters.  \n\n   Lightpath provisioning, in general,
    requires the routing and \n   wavelength assignment (RWA) process. This process
    is reviewed and the \n   information requirements, both static and dynamic for
    this process \n   are presented, along with alternative implementation scenarios
    that \n   could be realized via GMPLS/PCE and/or extended GMPLS/PCE protocols.
    \n   This memo does NOT address optical impairments in any depth and \n   focuses
    on topological elements and path selection constraints that \n   are common across
    different WSON environments.  It is expected that a \n   variety of different
    techniques will be applied to optical \n   impairments depending on the type of
    WSON, such as access, metro or \n   long haul. \n\n\t "

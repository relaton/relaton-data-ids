  content: "This document describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) for a device\nimplementing
    the BGP/MPLS VPN [2547bis] Architecture. The \nProvisioning Classes defined here
    provide policy control of resources \nimplementing the BGP/MPLS VPN Architecture.
    These Provisioning \nClasses can be used with other non BGP/MPLS VPN Provisioning
    Classes \n(defined in other PIBs) to provide for a comprehensive policy \ncontrolled
    mapping of service requirements to device resource \ncapability and usage.\nThe
    COPS-PR protocol offers significant advantages when dealing with \ndynamic configuration
    and when compared to traditional management \nsolutions. Moreover, dynamic VPN
    resource assignment is crucial to \ncope with the frequent changes requests from
    customer's (e.g., sites \njoining or leaving a VPN), as well as to achieve scalability.
    The PEs \nshould be able to dynamically assign the VPN resources. This \ncapability
    is especially important for dial and wireless VPN    \nservices.\n\t "

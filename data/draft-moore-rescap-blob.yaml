  content: "This memo describes the Binary Low-Overhead Block (BLOB) protocol for\non-the-wire
    presentation of data in the context of higher-level\nprotocols.  BLOB is designed
    to encode and decode data with low overhead\non most CPUs, to be reasonably space-efficient,
    and for its\nrepresentation to be sufficiently precise that it is suitable as
    a\ncanonical format for digital signatures.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing in the Network (COIN) has the potential to enable a wide
    variety of use cases. The diversity in use cases makes general considerations
    challenging. In an effort to capture the breadth of possible scenarios, another
    COINRG document presents a selection of concrete use cases, each representing
    a broader set of settings. This document analyzes the described use cases (and
    potentially further settings) to identify general aspects of interest across all
    use cases to steer future COIN discussions.</p>"

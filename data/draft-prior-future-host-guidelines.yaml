  content: "    The IETF is an international group that conducts most of its\n    business
    using electronic mail however three times a year it\n    conducts an open meeting
    for one week. For the most part the actual\n    mechanics of the meeting are organised
    by the IETF secretariat but\n    there are some requirements placed on the organisation
    hosting the\n    meeting.\n \n    This document attempts to provide some guidelines
    for organisations\n    that wish to volunteer to act as host for one of these
    open\n    meetings. As the IETF growth pattern mirrors the Internet itself\n    this
    document expresses sizes as a percentage of the expected\n    attendance rather
    than use fixed numbers as we expect these numbers\n    to change for each meeting.
    At the last meeting, in Washington DC\n    there were just over 1900 attendees.\n\n\t "

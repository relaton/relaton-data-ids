abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a differentiated services per-domain behavior (PDB)
    whose traffic may be \"starved\" (although starvation is not strictly required)
    in a properly functioning network.  This is in contrast to the Internet's \"best-effort\"
    or \"normal Internet traffic\" model, where prolonged starvation indicates network
    problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a \"lower\"
    priority than the normal \"best-effort\" Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called
    \"Lower Effort\" (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly
    limit the effect of its traffic on \"best-effort\"/\"normal\" or all other Internet
    traffic.  This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining
    the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic.\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines the needs and requirements for a protocol to control
    distributed speech processing of audio streams.  By speech processing, this document
    specifically means automatic speech recognition (ASR), speaker recognition --
    which includes both speaker identification (SI) and speaker verification (SV)
    -- and text-to-speech (TTS).  Other IETF protocols, such as SIP and Real Time
    Streaming Protocol (RTSP), address rendezvous and control for generalized media
    streams.  However, speech processing presents additional requirements that none
    of the extant IETF protocols address.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

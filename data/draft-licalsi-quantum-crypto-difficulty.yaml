  script: Latn
  content: "   From the communication viewpoint, qubits are different from classical\n
    \  bits.  A qubit may be transmitted directly but it can’t be cloned or\n   measured
    without altering its state, so existing copy-and-resend\n   schemes can’t be used
    to handle a transmission failure.  Moreover, in\n   some cases, the sender does
    not know the state of the transmitted\n   qubit, so a qubit loss may cause irrevocable
    damage.  This draft\n   presents the causes of transmission failures, and analyses
    the\n   vulnerabilities of several crypto protocols that such defects may\n   bring
    forth.  Thus, quantum teleportation is highly recommended for\n   certain applications.\n\n\t "

  content: "If a host is located behind a NAT, it can be impossible for that host
    to communicate directly with other hosts (peers) in certain situations. In these
    situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate
    node that acts as a communication relay. This specification defines a protocol,
    called \"Traversal Using Relays around NAT\" (TURN), that allows the host to control
    the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay.
    TURN differs from other relay control protocols in that it allows a client to
    communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address.\n\n The TURN protocol
    was designed to be used as part of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE) approach to NAT traversal, though it can also be used without ICE.\n\n This
    document obsoletes RFCs 5766 and 6156.\n\t "

  content: "   The DELEG Working Group has chosen a base protocol that describes how\n
    \  resolvers will be able to get a new DNS resource record to create a\n   new
    process for DNS delegation.  After a resolver gets this new type\n   of record,
    it needs to know how to process the record in order to get\n   a set of nameservers
    for a zone.  This document lists many of the\n   considerations for that process,
    including many open questions for\n   the DELEG Working Group.  More considerations
    and open questions\n   might be added in later versions of this draft.\n\n   Note
    that this draft is _not_ intended to become an RFC.  It is being\n   published
    so that the DELEG Working Group has a place to point its\n   efforts about how
    resolvers get nameservers for a zone while it\n   continues to work on choosing
    a base protocol.  The work that results\n   from this might be included in the
    base protocol specification, or in\n   a new draft authored by some of the many
    people who have done earlier\n   work in this area.\n\n\t "

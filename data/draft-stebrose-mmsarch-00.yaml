  content: "The increasing importance of messaging as a potential source of \nrevenue
    for mobile networks has led operators to build or procure \nmobile messaging solutions.
    \ Some operators have built mobile \nmessaging solutions using IETF standards
    (IMAP, SMTP, MIME).  Another \nsolution has been developed by consensus in the
    3GPP and OMA groups, \nbased on MIME, HTTP methods and WAP PUSH, which has been
    deployed by \nmany operators.  \nThis document presents a taxonomy of messaging
    architecture \ncomponents and models, providing a comparison of their feature
    sets.  \nIt also identifies the commonalities of these mobile messaging \nsolutions
    and abstracts from these a set of mobile messaging \nrequirements. \nThe information
    is provided to inform and encourage future discussion \nof and improvements to
    Internet messaging in order to increase their \napplicability to mobile messaging
    systems. \n\n\t "

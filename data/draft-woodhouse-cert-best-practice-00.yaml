  content: "   X.509 certificates are widely used for client authentication in many\n
    \  protocols, especially in conjunction with Transport Layer Security\n   ([RFC5246])
    and Datagram Transport Layer Security ([RFC6347].  There\n   exist a multitude
    of forms in which certificates and especially their\n   corresponding private
    keys may be stored or referenced.\n\n   Applications have historically been massively
    inconsistent in which\n   subset of these forms have been supported, and what
    knowledge is\n   demanded of the user.  This memo sets out best practice for\n
    \  applications in the interest of usability and consistency.\n\n\t "

  content: "In certain networks, there is dependency on the edge-to-edge Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) setup by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), e.g., networks that
    are used for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN)
    applications.  For such applications, it is not possible to rely on Internet Protocol
    (IP) forwarding if the MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately.  Blackholing of
    labeled traffic can occur in situations where the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
    is operational on a link on which LDP is not.  While the link could still be used
    for IP forwarding, it is not useful for MPLS forwarding, for example, MPLS VPN
    applications or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route-free cores.  This document
    describes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without introducing
    any protocol changes.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol\n(HIP).
    \ HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and\nmaintain shared IP-layer
    state, allowing separation of the identifier\nand locator roles of IP addresses,
    thereby enabling continuity of\ncommunications across IP address changes.  HIP
    is based on a SIGMA-\ncompliant Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key
    identifiers\nfrom a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.\nThe
    protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS)\nand man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) attacks.  When used together with\nanother suitable security protocol,
    such as the Encapsulated Security\nPayload (ESP), it provides integrity protection
    and optional\nencryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.\n\nThis
    document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by\nthe IESG, particularly
    that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates\nlessons learned from the implementations
    of RFC 5201.\n\t "

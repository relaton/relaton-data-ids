  content: "   Considerable effort has been spent on securing existing Internet\n
    \  standard authentication and authorization protocols such as TLS,\n   Kerberos,
    and OAuth, among others. It would save a lot of effort if\n   these protocols
    could be profiled to be feasible for constrained\n   environments, with some easily
    obtainable security considerations.\n\n   However, these protocols were typically
    not designed with constrained\n   environments in mind, so profiling of an existing
    protocol may result\n   in a far from optimal solution. Moreover they are not
    necessarily\n   complying with their original design objectives outside their\n
    \  intended domain of application.\n\n   This document examines the impact of
    typical characteristics of\n   security protocols (e.g. cryptographic calculations,
    number and size\n   of protocol messages) in a constrained environment.  The goal
    is to\n   provide decision support when different resource usage optimizations\n
    \  are possible in the adaptation of a security protocol for this\n   setting.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a Group Security Association Management\n   (GSAM)
    protocol, which manages the IPsec Group Security Associations\n   that are used
    to protect some packets of Secure IGMP (SIGMP) and\n   Secure MLD (SMLD).  In
    GSAM, one router is elected as the group\n   controller / key server to create
    group security associations for all\n   the interesting secure groups and distribute
    them to authorized users\n   and other routers.\n\n\t "

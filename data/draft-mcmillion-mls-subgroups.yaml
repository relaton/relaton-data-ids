  content: "   This document describes how the user of an MLS-based messaging\n   service
    can synchronize the operation of its devices, such that they\n   behave as a single
    virtual MLS client.  This prevents other users of\n   the messaging service from
    being able to tell when a user changes its\n   set of authorized devices, or which
    device the user sent a message\n   from.\n\n\t "

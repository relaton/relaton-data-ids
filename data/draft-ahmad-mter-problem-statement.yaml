  content: "   The objective of this document is to begin a discussion that will \n
    \  determine the level of interest at the IETF in documenting how \n   multiple
    recovery techniques can successfully be combined to protect \n   a set of network
    resources and the various interactions between these \n   recovery techniques.
    Potential outcome of this work could be to \n   define new MIBs and/or OAM techniques
    devoted to such interactions. \n\t "

  content: "   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way\n   Active
    Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) are used for performance\n   monitoring in IP networks.
    Delay measurement is performed in these\n   protocols by using timestamped test
    packets. Some implementations use\n   hardware-based timestamping engines that
    integrate the accurate\n   transmission timestamp into every outgoing OWAMP/TWAMP
    test packet\n   during transmission.  Since these packets are transported over
    UDP,\n   the UDP checksum field is then updated to reflect this modification.\n
    \  This document proposes to use the last 2 octets of every test packet\n   as
    a Checksum Trailer, allowing timestamping engines to reflect the\n   checksum
    modification in the last 2 octets rather than in the UDP\n   checksum field. The
    behavior defined in this document is completely\n   interoperable with existing
    OWAMP/TWAMP implementations.\n\n\t "

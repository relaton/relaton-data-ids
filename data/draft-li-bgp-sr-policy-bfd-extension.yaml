abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) Policies require fast failure detection for Candidate
    Paths (CPs) to enable rapid rerouting and high availability. Currently, the provisioning
    of SR Policies and the configuration of associated Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) or Seamless BFD (S-BFD) sessions are performed independently. This often
    necessitates separate mechanisms (e.g., manual configuration, NETCONF, or additional
    signaling) to associate BFD/S-BFD sessions with the SR Policies, resulting in
    complex and error-prone operations This document defines extensions to BGP SR
    Policy for the simultaneous provisioning of SR Policy CPs and their BFD/S-BFD
    configuration parameters during policy advertisement. The extensions include optional
    sub-TLVs within the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute to carry BFD/S-BFD configuration
    parameters (e.g., discriminators, intervals, multipliers). These extensions simplify
    deployment in distributed or controller- based environments, reduce configuration
    overhead, and enhance operational efficiency for SR-based traffic engineering.</p>"

  content: "Currently, more and more hosts have multiple interfaces such as GPRS,\nWiFi
    etc.  One key issue is how to make the applications on the host\naccess the network
    accordingly through the proper interfaces.  The\napproach presented in this document
    is to define new DHCPv6 option to\nconfigure route tables of the hosts.  In this
    way, the hosts can\nselect a appropriate route.\n\t "

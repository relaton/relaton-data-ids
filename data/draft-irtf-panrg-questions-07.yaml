- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware\n   internetworking
    architecture has two important properties: it exposes\n   the properties of available
    Internet paths to endpoints, and provides\n   for endpoints and applications to
    use these properties to select\n   paths through the Internet for their traffic.
    \ This document poses\n   questions in path-aware networking open as of 2020,
    that must be\n   answered in the design, development, and deployment of path-aware\n
    \  internetworks.  It was originally written to frame discussions in the\n   Path
    Aware Networking proposed Research Group (PANRG), and has been\n   published to
    snapshot current thinking in this space.\n\n\t "

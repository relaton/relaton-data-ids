- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet
    Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Security and Stability Advisory
    Committee have focused on the problems that the DNS is likely to experience with
    top-level domains (TLDs) that contain address records (so-called \"dotless domains\").
    \ In order to help researchers determine the extent of the issues with dotless
    domains, this document lists the current dotless TLDs and gives a script for finding
    them.  This document lists data about dotless TLDs but does not address the policy
    and technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.\n\t "

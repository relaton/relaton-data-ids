  content: "This draft describes a method for providing IP Integrated Services with
    RSVP over ATM switched virtual circuits (SVCs).  It provides an overall approach
    to the problem as well as a specific method for running over today's ATM networks.
    \ There are two parts of this problem.  This draft provides guidelines for using
    ATM VCs with QoS as part of an Integrated Services Internet.  A related draft[6]
    describes service mappings between IP Integrated Services and ATM services.                                  Authors'
    Note                                                           The postscript
    version of this document contains figures that are not included in the text version,
    so it is best to use the postscript version.  Figures will be converted to ASCII
    in a future version.\n\t "

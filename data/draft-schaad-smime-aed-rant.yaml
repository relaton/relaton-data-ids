  content: "The Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type allows for the use of\nAuthenticated-Enveloped
    modes with block cipher algorithms.  At the\ntime of the original design there
    was discussion about the relative\nlocation of the authenticated attributes and
    the encrypted content in\nthe ASN.1 structure.  With the benefits of implementation
    experience\nI revisit the discussion made at the time and re-evaluate the\ndecision
    made.\n\t "

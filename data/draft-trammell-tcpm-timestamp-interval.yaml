abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The TCP Timestamp option would be useful for additional measurements\n
    \  if it could be assumed that the interval between ticks of the\n   timestamp
    clock are regular, and if that interval were known.  In\n   practice, many implementations
    do use a timestamp clock source that\n   has a regular interval.  This draft specifies
    a compact encoding for\n   exposing the timestamp interval to a receiver, and
    discusses\n   applications therefor.\n\n\t "

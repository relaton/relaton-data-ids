  content: "   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) can have several modes of\n   operation
    over ATM. The MPLS Framework document [1] indicates that\n   MPLS MUST allow 'ships
    in the night' (SIN) operation with existing L2\n   switching protocols (e.g.,
    ATM Forum Signaling).\n \n   This document identifies the technical requirements
    that have to be\n   resolved in order to allow for a successful SIN operation
    between\n   MPLS and ATM Forum protocol stack. Solutions to the various\n   challenges
    are proposed.\n\n\t "

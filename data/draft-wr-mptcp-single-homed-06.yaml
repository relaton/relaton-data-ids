  content: "   Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths between end-\n
    \  systems.  These are typically provided by using different IP\n   addresses
    obtained by different ISPs at the end-systems.  While this\n   scenario is certainly
    becoming increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile\n   devices), currently most end-systems
    are single-homed (e.g. desktop\n   PCs in an enterprise).  It seems also likely
    that a lot of network\n   sites will insist on having all traffic pass a single
    network element\n   (e.g. for security reasons) before traffic is split across
    multiple\n   paths.  This memo therefore describes mechanisms to make multiple\n
    \  paths available to multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not\n   available
    directly at the end-systems but somewhere within the\n   network.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides an extensible \ninterface
    to various authentication mechanisms.  Some EAP methods \nderive cryptographic
    material between the EAP peers; these keys can \nbe used, for instance, with IEEE
    802.11i encryption. This document \nproposes a mechanism that can be used to derive
    cryptographically \nseparate keys for more than one cryptographic application,
    such as \nprotecting subsequent EAP messages, distributing credentials for re-\nauthentication,
    or handoff mechanisms involving multiple WLAN access \npoints.\n\t "

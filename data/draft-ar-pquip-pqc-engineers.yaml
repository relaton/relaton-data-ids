  content: "   The presence of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)\n
    \  would render state-of-the-art, public-key cryptography deployed today\n   obsolete,
    since all the assumptions about the intractability of the\n   mathematical problems
    that offer confident levels of security today\n   no longer apply in the presence
    of a CRQC.  This means there is a\n   requirement to update protocols and infrastructure
    to use post-\n   quantum algorithms, which are public-key algorithms designed
    to be\n   secure against CRQCs as well as classical computers.  These\n   algorithms
    are just like previous public key algorithms, however the\n   intractable mathematical
    problems have been carefully chosen, so they\n   are hard for CRQCs as well as
    classical computers.  This document\n   explains why engineers need to be aware
    of and understand post-\n   quantum cryptography.  It emphasizes the potential
    impact of CRQCs on\n   current cryptographic systems and the need to transition
    to post-\n   quantum algorithms to ensure long-term security.  The most important\n
    \  thing to understand is that this transition is not like previous\n   transitions
    from DES to AES or from SHA-1 to SHA2, as the algorithm\n   properties are significantly
    different from classical algorithms, and\n   a drop-in replacement is not possible.\n\n\t "

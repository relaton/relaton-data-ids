  content: "This document describes a set of Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) Attribute
    Value Pair (AVP) extensions designed to carry the subscriber Access Line identification
    and characterization information that arrives at the Broadband Remote Access Server
    (BRAS) with L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) functionality.  It also describes a
    mechanism to report connection speed changes, after the initial connection speeds
    are sent during session establishment.  The primary purpose of this document is
    to provide a reference for DSL equipment vendors wishing to interoperate with
    other vendors' products.  The L2TP AVPs defined in this document are applicable
    to both L2TPv2 and L2TPv3.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies how Host Identity Protocol (HIP) can be\nutilized
    in Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP)\nnetworks.  Peers in a P2PSIP
    network need to have long-lived\nconnections to other peers in the network, and
    HIP can be utilized to\nsetup and maintain those connections.  HIP is a good choice
    for\nconnection maintenance, because it provides functionalities like\nNetwork
    Address Translation (NAT) traversal, mobility, multi-homing,\nand enhanced security
    properties.\n\t "

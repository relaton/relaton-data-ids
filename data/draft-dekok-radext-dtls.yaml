  content: "The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authentication\nand
    encryption of RADIUS packets.  The protocol transports data \"in\nthe clear\",
    although some parts of the packets can have \"hidden\"\ncontent.  Packets may
    be replayed verbatim by an attacker, and\nclient-server authentication is based
    on fixed shared secrets.  This\ndocument specifies how the Datagram Transport
    Layer Security (DTLS)\nprotocol may be used as a fix for these problems.  It also
    describes\nhow implementations of this proposal can co-exist with current RADIUS\nsystems.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The BIER Encapsulation RFC8296 specifies that the \"Proto\" field in\n
    \  the BIER header is set to 1 if an MPLS label stack follows the BIER\n   header
    and the top of the stack label is a downstream-assigned label,\n   and is set
    to 2 if the top of stack label is an upstream-assigned\n   label, which is looked
    up in the context-specific label forwarding\n   table that can be derived from
    the BIER header.\n\n   The terms upstream/downstream-assignment are inappropriate
    to\n   describe the required forwarding for new MPLS label semantics such as\n
    \  SRGB and DCB labels as defined in RFC8402 and RFC9573 respectively.\n   This
    can result in potentially inconsistent implementation choices\n   causing potential
    interoperability issues.\n\n   This document rectifies this situation by changing
    the IANA BIER Next\n   Protocol Identifier semantic for MPLS code points from
    their label\n   semantic to the required LFIB in the forwarding plane, hence covering\n
    \  those new type of labels without changing behavior for existing\n   upstream/downstream-assigned
    labels.\n\n\t "

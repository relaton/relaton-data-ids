  content: "   This document defines a new protocol value \"Application\" for the\n
    \  Reason Header field and a new IANA Registry for registering\n   application
    types.  This new value enables signaling that a request\n   or response has been
    issued as a result of a decision made by a\n   particular type of application
    or that an initial request has been\n   retargeted as a result of an application
    decision.\n\n\n\t "

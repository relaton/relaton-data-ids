  content: "\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) enables and permits endpoints\n
    \  in an INVITE transaction to send media packets before an SDP offer/\n   answer
    exchange has completed; we refer to such media packets as\n   early media.  The
    use of early media is common in current SIP\n   implementations, and causes several
    problems, which have been\n   documented elsewhere.  This document puts forward
    the goal of\n   modifying SIP so that compliant implementations will complete
    an SDP\n   exchange before sending media, and lays out high-level requirements\n
    \  for such a solution.  The set of possible solutions is then laid out,\n   and
    each possibility examined in light of these requirements.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a QUIC convergence layer (QUICCL) for Delay-\n
    \  Tolerant Networking (DTN).  QUICCL uses BPv7 bundles encoded by the\n   Concise
    Binary Object Representation (CBOR) as its service data unit\n   being transported
    and makes use of either QUIC streams (RFC 9001) or\n   QUIC datagrams (RFC 9221)
    to transport such bundles.  QUICCL design\n   is largely based on TCPCLv4 specification
    (RFC9174), with three\n   significant differences.  First, as QUIC incorporates
    TLS security,\n   all security related parts of TCPCLv4 were dropped.  Second,
    QUICCL\n   provides two new transport services, notified and unreliable, in\n
    \  addition to the reliable service; Third, in the reliable service, by\n   taking
    advantage of QUIC streams, four levels of priority are\n   offered.\n\n\t "

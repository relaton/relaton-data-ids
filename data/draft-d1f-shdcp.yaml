  content: "   The Simple Host Discovery and Configuration Protocol (SHDCP)\n   provides
    a mechanism used when an Internet host with almost no\n   configuration has to
    be discovered and, at the same time,\n   configured to some IPv4 network.\n   This
    task can not be accomplished by DHCP.\n   Other known protocols are too complicated
    or proprietary.\n   The key feature of the proposed protocol is simplicity.\n\n\n\t "

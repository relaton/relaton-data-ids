  content: "   Exposure of network and service abstractions to external systems via\n
    \  YANG-based APIs has become an important means for operators to\n   enhance
    their competitiveness.  Despite the availability of numerous\n   YANG data models,
    operators continue to face significant challenges\n   in operationalizing these
    APIs in a consistent, scalable, and\n   interoperable manner.  Based on a typical
    use case, this document\n   describes the problem space associated with operationalizing
    YANG-\n   based service APIs, drawing on operator experience, IAB workshop\n   findings
    to motivate requirements for improving API predictability\n   and operational
    effectiveness through the upcoming ONSEN WG.  In\n   addition, it intends to gather
    operational needs and motivations for\n   network and service abstractions to
    inform YANG data model refresh\n   work.\n\n\t "

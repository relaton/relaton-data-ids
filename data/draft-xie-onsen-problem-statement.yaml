abstract:
- content: "<p>This document illustrates major operational challenges in deploying
    IETF YANG-based service and network abstractions, despite widespread model availability.
    It introduces the Data Transmission Service for Data-Intensive workloads (DTS-I)-
    an typical use case requiring ultra-high bandwidth, deterministic scheduling,
    and multi-domain coordination to illustrate gaps in existing L2SM/L3SM/LxNM models.
    Key issues include fragmented lifecycle management, inconsistent service semantics
    across APIs, poor abstraction-layer alignment, and limited observability. Based
    on on the findings of IAB NEMOPS workshop, this document outlines the problem
    space for the proposed ONSEN Working Group, which aims to improve operationalization,
    semantic coherence, and interoperability of YANG-based service APIs without proposing
    new models or protocols.</p>"

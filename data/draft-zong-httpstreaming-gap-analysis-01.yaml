  content: "With the explosive growth of the Internet usage and increasing demand\nfor
    multimedia information on the web, media delivery over Internet\nattract substantial
    attention from media industry.  To meet above\nrequirements, HTTP Streaming technology
    is designed and gradually\nplays an important role in recent years.  Several leading
    Standard\nDevelopment Organizations (SDOs) have been producing a series of\ntechnical
    specifications to define streaming over HTTP.  Moreover,\nseveral companies have
    devoted to developing private HTTP-based media\ndelivery platform to provide high
    quality, adaptive viewing\nexperience to customers.  Following a brief survey
    of existing HTTP\nstreaming standards and implementations, this document gives
    a brief\nsummary on these related work, analyzes the potential challenges\nespecially
    from the network point of view, and lists the gap between\nexisting work and possible
    working scope on the topic of HTTP\nstreaming in IETF.\n\t "

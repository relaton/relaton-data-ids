  content: "   When the 'out-of-band' content coding ('OOB') is used for delivering\n
    \  a number of resources from a primary server via a secondary server,\n   the
    additional round trips for OOB responses and load on the primary\n   server can
    be a significant nuisance.\n\n   In such situations, it is useful for the primary
    server to be able to\n   provide the client with OOB response information for
    several\n   resources in one go anticipating future client requests.\n\n   This
    document describes a format for providing the client with the\n   information,
    called a resource map, and how the resource map could be\n   delivered to a client.\n\n\t "

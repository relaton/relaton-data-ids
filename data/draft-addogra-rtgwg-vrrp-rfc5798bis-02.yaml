  content: "   This document defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)\n
    \  for IPv4 and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it\n   is
    based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and\n   in \"Virtual
    Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6\".  VRRP specifies an\n   election protocol
    that dynamically assigns responsibility for a\n   virtual router to one of the
    VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router\n   controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es)
    associated with a virtual\n   router is called the Active router, and it forwards
    packets sent to\n   these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  VRRP Active routers are configured\n
    \  with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup routers infer\n   the
    address family of the virtual addresses being carried based on\n   the transport
    protocol.  Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers in\n   each of the IPv4 and
    IPv6 address families are a domain unto\n   themselves and do not overlap.  The
    election process provides dynamic\n   failover in the forwarding responsibility
    should the Active become\n   unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained from
    using VRRP is a\n   higher-availability default path without requiring configuration
    of\n   dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For\n
    \  IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker\n   switchover
    to Backup routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery
    mechanisms.\n\n   The VRRP terminology has been updated be in line with inclusive\n
    \  language used in the industry.  This document obsoletes VRRP Version\n   3
    [RFC5798].\n\n\t "

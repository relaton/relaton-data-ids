  content: "   Reliability is a fundamental concern for the network. As a solution
    \n   to improve network stability, the non-stop forwarding paradigm \n   depends
    on protocol recovery based on graceful restart techniques. \n   One of the proposed
    graceful restart techniques for [OSPF], a widely \n   deployed IGP, is described
    in [OSPF-GR]. This technique has a \n   limitation of not being backward compatible,
    in the sense that if a \n   neighbor does not support the helper mode described
    in [OSPF-GR], \n   the graceful-restart procedure will fail (i.e., revert to normal
    \n   restart). For large multi-vendor networks, this scenario is fairly \n   common.
    In this draft, we describe techniques that can achieve OSPF \n   graceful restart
    even if a neighboring router does not support the \n   helper-mode of [OSPF-GR].

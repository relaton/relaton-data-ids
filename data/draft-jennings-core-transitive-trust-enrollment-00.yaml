  content: "   This is a copy of the paper sent to the \"Smart Object Security\"\n
    \  workshop March 23, 2012 in Paris.  It is submitted as an IETF draft\n   to
    have a record of it in the draft archive.  The original\n   publication date of
    this work was Feb 14, 2012.  Readers are\n   encouraged to read later versions
    of this draft.\n\n   This document provides a very early sketch of a enrollment
    protocol\n   that allows constrained internet devices to securely enroll into
    a\n   system.  As the work is in its early phase, many details remain to be\n
    \  resolved.  The solution is based on the idea that each device will be\n   manufactured
    with a one time password that can be used by the\n   customer to tell the device
    which controller to enroll with.\n\n\t "

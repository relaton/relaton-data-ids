  content: "This draft aims at analysing the solution space for the ad hoc IP\nautoconfiguration
    problem, based on the problem statement draft and\nthe MANET architecture draft.
    \ Some evaluation considerations, are\nalso taken into account.  This draft classifies,
    at a generic level,\nthe solution space of the possible approaches that could
    be followed\nto solve the IPv6 autoconfiguration for MANETs problem.  The various\napproaches
    of IPv6 autoconfiguration for MANETs are illustrated, and\nthe benefits and tradeoffs
    in different aspects of IPv6\nautoconfiguration are explored.\n\t "

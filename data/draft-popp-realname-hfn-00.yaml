- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "  The notion of a 'Human Friendly Naming scheme' (HFN) has been\n  discussed
    in a variety of contexts, as an alternative to the use of\n  URIs or URNs as a
    way of designating Internet resources (see [RFC\n  2276], for example).\n \n  This
    document introduces the RealName system, and its use as a\n  HFN. It provides
    a mapping for RealNames into a URN namespace ('rn')\n  as well as a URL scheme
    ('vnd.rn').\n \n  This is a preliminary draft, intended to raise the discussion
    of\n  HFNs and the uses of RealNames as an initial example in creating a\n  standard
    for access and resolution.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Many enhancements to the email service have appeared since its basic\n
    \  format and protocol were defined.  However, the lines between these\n   are
    sometimes blurred as a result of the evolution of the software\n   that implements
    them.  This document provides observations about\n   these points and some clear
    guidelines for those interested in\n   developing further enhancements.\n\n\t "

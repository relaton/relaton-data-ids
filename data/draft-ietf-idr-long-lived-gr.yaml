abstract:
- content: <p>In this document, we introduce a new BGP capability termed "Long- lived
    Graceful Restart Capability" so that stale routes can be retained for a longer
    time upon session failure than is provided for by BGP Graceful Restart (RFC 4724).
    A well-known BGP community "LLGR_STALE" is introduced for marking stale routes
    retained for a longer time. A second well-known BGP community, "NO_LLGR", is introduced
    to mark routes for which these procedures should not be applied. We also specify
    that such long-lived stale routes be treated as the least-preferred, and their
    advertisements be limited to BGP speakers that have advertised the new capability.
    Use of this extension is not advisable in all cases, and we provide guidelines
    to help determine if it is. We update RFC 6368 by specifying that the LLGR_STALE
    community must be propagated into, or out of, the path attributes exchanged between
    PE and CE.</p>

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In this document, we introduce a new BGP capability termed \"Long-\n
    \  lived Graceful Restart Capability\" so that stale routes can be\n   retained
    for a longer time upon session failure than is provided for\n   by BGP Graceful
    Restart (RFC 4724).  A well-known BGP community\n   \"LLGR_STALE\" is introduced
    for marking stale routes retained for a\n   longer time.  A second well-known
    BGP community, \"NO_LLGR\", is\n   introduced to mark routes for which these procedures
    should not be\n   applied.  We also specify that such long-lived stale routes
    be\n   treated as the least-preferred, and their advertisements be limited\n   to
    BGP speakers that have advertised the new capability.  Use of this\n   extension
    is not advisable in all cases, and we provide guidelines to\n   help determine
    if it is.\n\n   This memo updates RFC 6368 by specifying that the LLGR_STALE\n
    \  community must be propagated into, or out of, the path attributes\n   exchanged
    between PE and CE.\n\n\t "

  content: "Despite the growing availability of good measurement platforms, it \nis
    still impossible to generalize IPPM metrics measurement among \nheterogeneous
    points of measure. To do so, the extra information \ninserted in the IP packets
    to perform the measurement has to be \nstandardized. \nThis document defines an
    IPPM measurement signature suitable for \nperforming the measure of the current
    IPPM metrics, for integrating \nthose used by manufacturers and for allowing the
    IPPM WG to define \nother measurement signature in the future. \n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies use of the BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding\n
    \  Detection) protocol in RBridge campuses based on the OAM (Operations,\n   Administration,
    and Maintenance) Channel extension to the TRILL\n   (TRansparent Interconnection
    of Lots of Links) protocol.\n\n   BFD is a widely deployed OAM mechanism in IP
    and MPLS networks.\n   However, in the present form a BFD packet cannot be sent
    over a TRILL\n   network as it is either IP/ UDP encapsulated or encapsulated
    directly\n   over MPLS or using ACH encapsulation.  This document also defines
    BFD\n   encapsulation over TRILL to address this shortcoming.\n\n\t "

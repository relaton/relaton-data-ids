  content: "   Identification and treatment of application flows are important to\n
    \  many application providers and network operators.  They often rely on\n   these
    capabilities to deploy and/or support a wide range of\n   applications.  These
    applications generate flows that may have\n   specific connectivity requirements
    that can be met if made known to\n   the network.  Historically, this functionality
    has been implemented\n   to the extent possible using heuristics, which inspect
    and infer flow\n   characteristics.  Heuristics may be based on port ranges, network\n
    \  separation (e.g. subnets or VLANs, Deep Flow Inspection (DFI), or\n   Deep
    Packet Inspection (DPI).  But many application flows in current\n   usages are
    dynamic, adaptive, time-bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer,\n   asymmetric, used on
    multipurpose devices, and have different\n   priorities depending on direction
    of flow, user preferences, and\n   other factors.  Any combination of these properties
    renders heuristic\n   based techniques less effective and may result in compromises
    to\n   application security or user privacy.\n\n\t "

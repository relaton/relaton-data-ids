  content: "In Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), a mobile node (MN) moving from \n
    \  one MAP domain to another can experience both long handover latency \n   and
    packet loss due to the distance between the two MAPs. To solve \n   the problems,
    this document describes two fast handover schemes that \n   support fast macro
    mobility handover. These fast handover schemes can\n   reduce both the handover
    latency and the pakcet loss. The schemes \n   described in this document adopt
    the fast handover of FMIPv6 protocol \n   to the edge access routers in MAP domains.
    The schemes support two \n   fast handover modes for macro mobility handover in
    HMIPv6.\n\n\t "

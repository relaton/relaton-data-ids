  content: "This memo is a clarification of the structure of management information
    (SMI) for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  SMIv2 is
    defined in RFCs 1902[1], 1903[2] and 1904[4].  This version is a rough first draft
    as requested by the SNMPv2 WG at the SMI Documentation BOF during the June 1996
    IETF.                                             This memo assumes that the reader
    has already read RFCs 1902-4 and generally understands the concepts defined in
    these documents.\n\t "

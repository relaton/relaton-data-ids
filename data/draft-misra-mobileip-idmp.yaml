  content: "This document  introduces  IDMP, a mobility  protocol  that  supports\nrouting
    of  datagrams  to a mobile node inside a mobility  domain.  A\nmobility domain
    essentially identifies a collection of IP subnets and\nnetworks  that are  aggregated
    \ together  based  on  factors  such as\ngeographic  proximity  or  administrative
    \ control.  In  addition  to\nsupporting  basic  redirection  of packets to mobile
    nodes, IDMP also\nprovides  fast handoff  support,  with minimal  packet  losses
    due to\nmobility-related   transients,  and  paging  support  to  reduce  the\nsignaling
    burden on mobile nodes.  IDMP uses two care-of addresses to\nmanage mobility.
    \ The global care-of address  identifies the mobile's\ncurrent  domain and remains
    \ unchanged as long as the mobile does not\nchange  domains.  The local care-of
    \ address  identifies the mobile's\ncurrent  point of  attachment  and  changes
    \ every time a mobile node\nchanges  subnets.  IDMP specifies two types of agents,
    \ Subnet Agents\nand Mobility  Agents, to support this two-layer  mobility  hierarchy.\nBy
    \ using  two  care-of   addresses  ,  IDMP  removes  the  need  for\nhost-specific
    \ routing  inside  the  domain  and  allows  the  use of\nmultiple alternative
    protocols for supporting global mobility.\n\n\t "

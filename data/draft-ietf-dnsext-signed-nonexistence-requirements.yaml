  content: "   DNSSEC-bis uses the NSEC record to provide authenticated denial of\n
    \  existence of RRsets.  NSEC also has the side-effect of permitting\n   zone
    enumeration, even if zone transfers have been forbidden.\n   Because some see
    this as a problem, this document has been assembled\n   to detail the possible
    requirements for denial of existence A/K/A\n   signed proof of non-existence.\n\n\t "

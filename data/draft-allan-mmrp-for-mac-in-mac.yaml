- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes how MAC filtering programmed by the IEEE \n   multiple
    MAC registration protocol (MMRP or 802.1ak) can be employed \n   by VPLS-PE devices
    as the exclusive mechanism for interworking with \n   802.1ah PBBNs. No new protocol
    standardization is required to do \n   this, however there are small procedural
    changes associated with the \n   interworking of protocols. \n\t "

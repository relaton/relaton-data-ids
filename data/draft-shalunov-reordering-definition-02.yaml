  content: "Various pieces of network testing equipment currently often report a\ncharacteristic
    that is referred to as a 'degree (or percentage) of\npacket reordering'.  The
    way this metric is computed is often\nundocumented and it differs between vendors.
    \ Having a useful numeric\nmeasure of the degree of packet reordering is important
    for\napplications such as TCP and VoIP on different ends of the spectrum.\nHowever,
    the metric that makes sense for one application may have no\nor little applicability
    to another.  This document introduces a\ndefinition of reordering metric that
    is hoped to be applicable to a\nnumber of different applications by parametrizing
    the metric.\n\t "

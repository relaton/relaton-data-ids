  content: "   This document presents a mechanism for fault management during a\n
    \  MPTCP session.  It is used to convey subflow failure information from\n   client
    to server by other subflow running normally.  It includes: 1)\n   a new Fault
    Announce Option for describing subflow failure, 2)\n   implementation and interoperability
    of this option during a MPTCP\n   session when one subflow suffers a failure.
    \ In fact, the server is\n   able to determine network problems accurately based
    on these fault\n   information reported from multiple clients for their connections.\n\n\t "

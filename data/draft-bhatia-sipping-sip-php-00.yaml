  content: "Due to the similarity of SIP and HTTP, many mechanisms that have \nbeen
    instrumental in the success of the World Wide Web have been \nreplicated in SIP.
    PHP is a robust, cross-platform scripting \nlanguage, which has been tailored
    to simplify and accelerate service \ndevelopment on the World Wide Web while empowering
    the developer \nwith easy and yet reliable connectivity with all modern databases.
    \nThis draft discusses the creation of SIP services using PHP.\n\t "

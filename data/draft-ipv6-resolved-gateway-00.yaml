  content: "   This document requests the allocation of a new IPv4 special-purpose\n
    \  address from the IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry.  The\n   proposed
    address, 192.0.0.11/32, is intended to serve as a signal to\n   IPv4 hosts in
    IPv6-only networks that the link-layer resolution for\n   the default gateway
    should be derived from the IPv6 default gateway\n   learned via IPv6 Router Advertisements
    and Neighbor Discovery.\n\n   This approach enables IPv4 communication without
    requiring IPv4\n   subnets or the use of ARP.  It maintains backward compatibility
    with\n   existing IPv4 host software that expects a default gateway IP\n   address,
    while avoiding the need to implement legacy link-layer\n   protocols.\n\n\t "

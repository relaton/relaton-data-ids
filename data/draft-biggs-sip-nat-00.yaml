  content: "This document describes an Application Level Gateway (ALG) for the\nSession
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) by which IP addresses in the SIP\nmessage and in the
    SDP body are statically mapped from one group to\nanother.  The SIP ALG is a specific
    case of an Application Level\nGateway as described in [1].\nTransparent use of
    SIP-based devices in a Network Address Translation\n(NAT) scenario requires that
    modifications be made to the SIP\nmessages.  These modifications are performed
    by the ALG.\n\n\t "

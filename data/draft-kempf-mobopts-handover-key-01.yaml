  script: Latn
  content: "Multiple IPv6 handover optimization protocols (for example, Fast Mobile
    \nIPv6 and Context Transfer Protocol) require an Access Router to verify \nthat
    signaling received to perform an IP handover operation originated \nfrom a Mobile
    Node having authorization to claim a particular address \non the Access Router's
    wireless subnet. In this document, a method for \nsecuring such signaling is defined.
    The method utilizes a secret key \nsent from the Access Router to the Mobile Node
    prior to handover, \nencrypted with an RSA public key that the Mobile Node used
    to generate \nits Cryptographically Generated Address. The ability of the Mobile
    Node \nto decrypt the secret key verifies its possession of the private key \ncorresponding
    to the public key used to generate the address. This \nallows the Mobile Node
    to use the secret key to sign and authorize \nsignaling causing changes affecting
    traffic to and from that address. \nThe use of symmetric cryptography avoids the
    time consuming public key \noperation associated with using the RSA key directly
    during \nperformance-sensitive IP subnet handover.  \n\t "

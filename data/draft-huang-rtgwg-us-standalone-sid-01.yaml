  content: "   More and more emerging applications have raised the demand for\n   establishing
    networking connections anywhere and anytime, alongside\n   the availability of
    highly distributive any-cloud services.  Such a\n   demand motivates the need
    to efficiently interconnect heterogeneous\n   entities, e.g., different domains
    of network and cloud owned by\n   different providers to reduce cost, e.g., overheads
    and end-to-end\n   latency, while ensuring the overall performance satisfies the\n
    \  requirements of the applications.  Considering that different network\n   domains
    and cloud providers may adopt different types of\n   technologies, the key to
    interconnection and efficient coordination\n   is to employ a unified interface
    that can be understood by\n   heterogeneous parties, which could derive the consistent
    requirements\n   of the same service and treat the service traffic appropriately
    by\n   their proprietary policies and technologies.\n\n   This document provides
    use cases and problem statements from two main\n   Internet traffic categories:
    one is the traditional north-south\n   traffic which is defined from clients to
    entities (such as servers or\n   DCs), and the other is east-west traffic, which
    refers to traffic\n   between entities (such as inter-server or inter-\n   service).Furthermore,the
    requirements for a standalone Service ID are\n   also detailed in this document.\n\n\t "

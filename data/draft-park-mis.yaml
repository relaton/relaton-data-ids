  content: "   In this draft, we discuss how to make use of multiple interfaces in
    a\n   single mobile router.  We will focus on the scenario in which each\n   interface
    is attached to different access network.  Especially, we\n   propose how a mobile
    router selects proper interfaces to provide\n   services to different traffic
    flows.  We suggest a new option carried\n   in IPv6 hop-by-hop options header
    to maintain and advertise the flow\n   requirment and characteristics.  New option
    contains a service type\n   value and a preference value.  A servie type value
    is used for\n   traffic classification, and a preference value enables mobile
    router\n   to control the traffic in detail.  The propsed multiple interface\n
    \  selection mechanism in a multihomed mobile router (MMR) chooses an\n   appropriate
    interface for each flow, depending on traffic\n   requirements and access network
    characteristics.\n\n\n\t "

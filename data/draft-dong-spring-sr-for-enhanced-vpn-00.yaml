  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN technology to enable it\n
    \  to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications\n   that
    are associated with 5G services.  These applications require\n   better isolation
    and have more stringent performance requirements\n   than can be provided with
    overlay VPNs.  The characteristics of an\n   enhanced VPN as perceived by its
    tenant needs to be comparable to\n   those of a dedicated private network.  This
    requires tight\n   integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay network\n
    \  resources in a scalable manner.  An enhanced VPN may form the\n   underpin
    of 5G network slicing, but will also be of use in its own\n   right.  This document
    describes the use of segment routing based\n   mechanisms to provide the enhanced
    VPN service with dedicated\n   underlay network resources.\n\n\n\t "

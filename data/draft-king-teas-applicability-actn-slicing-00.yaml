  content: "   Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network\n
    \  domain to manage network resources to create a virtualized network\n   that
    is under the control of a network operator (or perhaps the\n   customer).\n\n
    \  Network slicing is an approach to network operations that builds on\n   the
    concept of network abstraction to provide programmability,\n   flexibility, and
    modularity.  It uses techniques such as Software\n   Defined Networking (SDN)
    and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)\n   to create multiple logical (virtual)
    networks, each tailored for a\n   given use case, on top of a common network.\n\n
    \  These logical networks are referred to as network slices. A network\n   slice
    does not necessarily represent dedicated resources in the\n   server network,
    but does constitute a commitment by the service\n   provider to provide a specific
    level of service.\n\n   The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
    (ACTN)\n   defines an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts of\n
    \  network and service abstraction to detach network and service\n   control from
    the underlying data plane.\n\n   This document outlines the applicability of ACTN
    to network\n   slicing in an IETF technology network.  It also identifies the\n
    \  features of network slicing not currently within the scope of ACTN,\n   and
    indicates where ACTN might be extended.\n\n\n\t "

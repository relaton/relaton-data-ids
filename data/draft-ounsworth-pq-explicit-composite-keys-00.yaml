- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come\n
    \  the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n   cryptographic
    algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum algorithms
    is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to be performed
    in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for holding composite
    public\n   keys and composite signature data.  This draft defines a structure\n
    \  generic enough to be useful beyond the post-quantum transition for\n   any
    situation where a widely-supported but untrusted algorithm is\n   being migrated
    to newer cryptography.\n\n   This document defines structures for binding an explicit
    pair of\n   cryptographic algorithms together into a single object identifier,\n
    \  and it provides ASN.1 structures for encoding these pairwise\n   composite
    public keys, private keys in wire protocols, as well as\n   using them in conjunction
    with composite signatures, encryption and\n   key transport mechanisms.\n\n\t "

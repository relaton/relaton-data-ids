  content: "   In a dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) environment, the procedures of RFC\n
    \  3263 by which a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) client contacts a\n   server
    may not suffice to provide a good user experience.  This\n   document describes
    \"Happy Eyeballs\" modifications -- modifications of\n   the procedures of RFC
    3263, as well as additional client procedures\n   -- which improve the SIP user
    experience in many circumstances.\n\n\t "

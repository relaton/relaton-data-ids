  content: "This Internet-Draft describes DNS name server and stub resolver\nbehavior
    that results in a significant query volume sent to the\nroot and top-level domain
    (TLD) name servers.  In some cases we\nrecommend minor additions to the DNS protocol
    specification and\ncorresponding changes in name server implementations to alleviate\nthese
    unnecessary queries.  In one case, we have highlighted\nbehavior of a popular
    name server implementation that does not\nconform to the DNS specification.  The
    recommendations made in this\ndocument are a direct byproduct of observation and
    analysis of\nabnormal query traffic patterns seen at two of the thirteen root\nname
    servers and all thirteen com/net/org TLD name servers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance\n   guarantees
    to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates\n   and bounded latency.
    \ As a result, securing a DetNet implies that in\n   addition to the best practice
    security measures taken for any\n   mission-critical network, additional security
    measures may be needed\n   whose purpose is exclusively to secure the intended
    operation of\n   these novel service properties.  This document addresses specifically\n
    \  those security considerations, with the assumption that the reader is\n   already
    familiar with network security best practices for the data\n   plane technologies
    underlying a given DetNet implementation.  This\n   document defines a threat
    model and a taxonomy of relevant attacks,\n   including their potential impacts
    and mitigations.\n\n   A given DetNet may require securing only certain aspects
    of DetNet\n   performance, for example extremely low data loss rates but not\n
    \  necessarily bounded latency.  Therefore this document provides an\n   association
    of threats against various use cases by industry, and\n   also against the individual
    service properties as defined in the\n   DetNet Use Cases.\n\n   This document
    also addresses common DetNet security considerations\n   related to the IP and
    MPLS data plane technologies (the first to be\n   identified as supported by DetNet),
    thereby complementing the\n   Security Considerations sections of the various
    DetNet Data Plane\n   (and other) DetNet documents.\n\n\t "

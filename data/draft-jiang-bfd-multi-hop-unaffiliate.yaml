  content: "   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection\n
    \  protocol designed to rapidly identify communication failure between\n   two
    forwarding engines. This document suggests utilizing BFD Echo\n   when the local
    system supports BFD, but the neighboring system does\n   not. BFD Control packets
    and their processing procedures can be\n   executed over the BFD Echo port, where
    the neighboring system solely\n   loops packets back to the local system.\n\n
    \  This document serves as an update to RFC 5880 and draft-ietf-bfd-\n   unaffiliate-echo-10.\n\n\t "

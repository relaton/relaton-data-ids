  content: "   On IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA is deployed using RoCEv2\n   protocol.
    RoCEv2 specification does not define the strong congestion\n   management mechanisms
    and load balancing methods. RoCEv2 relies on\n   the existing Link-Layer Flow-Control
    IEEE 802.1Qbb(Priority-based\n   Flow Control, PFC)to provide a lossless fabric.
    RoCEv2 Congestion\n   Management(RCM) use ECN(Explicit Congestion Notification,
    defined in\n   RFC3168) to signal the congestion to the destination and use the\n
    \  congestion notification to reduce the rate of injection and increase\n   the
    injection rate when the extent of congestion decreases. More and\n   more practice
    of congestion management for RoCEv2 appear in the\n   industry, such as DCQCN(Data
    Center Quantized Congestion\n   Notification). There is a demanding for the new
    RoCEv3 protocol to\n   provide stronger congestion management and load balancing
    mechanisms\n   for RDMA deployment in modern datacenter.\n\n\t "

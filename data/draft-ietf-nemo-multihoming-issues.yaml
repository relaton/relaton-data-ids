  content: "This document is an analysis of multihoming in the context of network
    mobility (NEMO) in IPv6.  As there are many situations in which mobile networks
    may be multihomed, a taxonomy is proposed to classify the possible configurations.
    \ The possible deployment scenarios of multihomed mobile networks are described
    together with the associated issues when network mobility is supported by RFC
    3963 (NEMO Basic Support).  Recommendations are offered on how to address these
    issues.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents simulation work and first results related to MPL
    performance evaluation. The simulation makes it possible to evaluate MPL performances
    in the context of a large network. The simulated network introduces 500 nodes.
    The general principles of the simulator are described. Then reference settings
    are introduced, and evaluation indicators are proposed. Finally preliminary results
    are presented under the form of a few tables, that show the proposed indicator
    values depending on some specific parameter which is used as a variable argument.
    Among various results, the advantage of using reactive mode for MPL is shown in
    terms of the capability to maintain loss free diffusion in harsh radio conditions.</p>"

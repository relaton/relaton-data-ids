  content: "   Mobility solutions at the IP layer have been specified in the IETF\n
    \  for IPv4 and IPv6.  These solutions include host and network based\n   mobility.
    \ All of the mobility protocols enable IP session continuity\n   by providing
    the mobile host with an IP address or prefix that\n   remains constant even as
    the host moves and attaches to different\n   access networks and points of attachment.
    \ Mobile hosts are anchored\n   at a gateway via a tunnel and the address/prefix
    provided to the host\n   via the gateway remains unchanged across mobility events.
    \ All IP\n   sessions initiated or terminated at a mobile host are anchored via\n
    \  the gateway.  A gateway centric approach such as Mobile IP, raises\n   certain
    concerns in terms of cost and efficiency.  A mobility model\n   wherein the network
    entities enabling mobility are distributed is a\n   way of alleviating the concerns
    of a gateway centric approach.  This\n   document considers ways to alleviate
    anchored mobility issues with\n   approaches that could be considered in a deployment.\n\n\t "

  content: "   DNS queries and responses can contain information that reveals\n   important
    information about the person who caused the queries, and it\n   would be better
    if eavesdroppers were unable to see DNS traffic.\n   This document describes how
    to use TLS for encrypting DNS traffic\n   between a system acting as a DNS stub
    resolver and a system acting as\n   a DNS recursive resolver.  It provides two
    alternatives that are\n   based on different design goals.\n\n\t "

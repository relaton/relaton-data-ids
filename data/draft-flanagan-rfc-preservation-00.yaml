  content: "   The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for the RFC\n
    \  Series.  This document applies specifically to the archivist role of\n   the
    RFC Editor.  It provides guidance on when and how to preserve\n   RFCs, and the
    tools required to view or re-create RFCs as necessary.\n   This document also
    highlights where gaps are in the current process,\n   and where compromises are
    suggested to balance cost with ideal best\n   practice.\n\n\t "

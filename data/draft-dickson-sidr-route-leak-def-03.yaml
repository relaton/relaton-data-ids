  content: "   The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to\n
    \  advertise reachability for IP prefixes.  This reachability\n   information
    is propagated in a peer-to-peer topology.  Routes may be\n   announced to neighbors,
    contrary to the receiver's local peering\n   policy.  If that occurs, those routes
    may then be propagated\n   indiscriminantly, once they have been accepted.\n\n
    \  This document considers the situations that can lead to routes being\n   leaked,
    and tries to find acceptable definitions for describing these\n   scenarios.\n\n
    \  The purpose of these definitions is to facilitate analysis of what a\n   route
    leak is, and what the scope of the problem space for route\n   leaks is.\n\n   This,
    in turn, is intended to inform a requirements document for\n   detection of (and
    prevention of) route leaks.  And finally, the\n   definitions and requirements
    are intended to allow proposed solutions\n   which meet these criteria, and to
    facilitate evaluation of proposed\n   solutions.\n\n   The ultimate goal is to
    \"solve the route leaks problem\".\n\n\t "

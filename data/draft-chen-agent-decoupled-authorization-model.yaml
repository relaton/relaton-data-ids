abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a framework for dynamic, intent-based authorization
    for AI Agents. The primary goal is to enable fine- grained, Just-in-Time (JIT)
    permissions based on an agent's specific intent and behavioral trustworthiness,
    rather than a long-lived identity or role, achieve decoupling of authorization
    policies from business operations.</p>"

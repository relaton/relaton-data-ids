abstract:
- content: <p>According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives
    an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to reset the session
    over which the offending attribute was received. RFC7606 revises the error handling
    procedures for a number of existing attributes. The use of the "treat-as-withdraw"
    and "attribute discard" approaches significantly reduces the likelihood of BGP
    sessions being reset when receiving malformed BGP update messages, thereby greatly
    enhancing network stability. However, in practical applications, there are still
    numerous instances where BGP session oscillations occur due to the receipt of
    malformed BGP update messages, unrecognized attribute fields, or routing rules
    generated by a certain BGP AFI/SAFI that affect the forwarding of BGP messages.
    This document introduces some approaches to enhance the stability of BGP sessions.</p>

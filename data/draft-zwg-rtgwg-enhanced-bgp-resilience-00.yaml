abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives\n
    \  an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to\n   reset
    the session over which the offending attribute was received.\n   RFC7606 revises
    the error handling procedures for a number of\n   existing attributes.  The use
    of the \"treat-as-withdraw\" and\n   \"attribute discard\" approaches significantly
    reduces the likelihood\n   of BGP sessions being reset when receiving malformed
    BGP update\n   messages, thereby greatly enhancing network stability.  However,
    in\n   practical applications, there are still numerous instances where BGP\n
    \  session oscillations occur due to the receipt of malformed BGP update\n   messages,
    unrecognized attribute fields, or routing rules generated\n   by a certain BGP
    AFI/SAFI that affect the forwarding of BGP messages.\n\n   This document introduces
    some approaches to enhance the stability of\n   BGP sessions.\n\n\n\n\t "

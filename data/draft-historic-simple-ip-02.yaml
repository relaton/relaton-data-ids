  content: "   This document is published for the historical record.  The Simple\n
    \  Internet Protocol was the basis for one of the candidates for the\n   IETF's
    Next Generation (IPng) work that became IPv6.\n\n   The publication date of the
    original Internet-Draft was November 10,\n   1992.  It is presented here substantially
    unchanged and is neither a\n   complete document nor intended to be implementable.\n\n
    \  The paragraph that follows is the Abstract from the original draft.\n\n   This
    document specifies a new version of IP called SIP, the Simple\n   Internet Protocol.
    \ It also describes the changes needed to ICMP,\n   IGMP, and transport protocols
    such as TCP and UDP, in order to work\n   with SIP.  A companion document [SIP-ADDR]
    describes the addressing\n   and routing aspects of SIP, including issues of auto-configuration,\n
    \  host and subnet mobility, and multicast.\n\n\t "

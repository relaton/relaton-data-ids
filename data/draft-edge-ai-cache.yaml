- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Watching videos (Contents) from mobile devices has been causing most of\nthe
    network traffic and is projected to remain to increase\nexponentially. Thus, numerous
    types of content and chunk based caching\nschemes have been proposed to handle
    the increasing traffic. Those\ncaching schemes cache the whole videos at the edge
    nodes, but most\nof the users view only the beginning of the videos. Hence, caching\nthe
    complete video on the edge node is an ineffective solution to\nreduce the network
    traffic as well as to improve the cache\nutilization. Thus, a chunk-level caching
    scheme to store popular\nvideos partially and a smart prefetching scheme is needed
    to\nprovide the missing chunks of the video.\n\nThis Internet-Draft will expire
    on August 09, 2021.\n\n\t "

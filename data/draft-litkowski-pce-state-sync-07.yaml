  content: "   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides\n
    \  mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n   computations
    in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The stateful PCE
    extensions allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS)
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSPs) using PCEP.\n\n   A Path
    Computation Client (PCC) can synchronize an LSP state\n   information to a Stateful
    Path Computation Element (PCE).  The\n   stateful PCE extension allows a redundancy
    scenario where a PCC can\n   have redundant PCEP sessions towards multiple PCEs.
    \ In such a case,\n   a PCC gives control on a LSP to only a single PCE, and only
    one PCE\n   is responsible for path computation for this delegated LSP.  The\n
    \  document does not state the procedures related to an inter-PCE\n   stateful
    communication.\n\n   There are some use cases, where an inter-PCE stateful communication\n
    \  can bring additional resiliency in the design, for instance when some\n   PCC-PCE
    sessions fails.  The inter-PCE stateful communication may\n   also provide a faster
    update of the LSP states when such an event\n   occurs.  Finally, when, in a redundant
    PCE scenario, there is a need\n   to compute a set of paths that are part of a
    group (so there is a\n   dependency between the paths), there may be some cases
    where the\n   computation of all paths in the group is not handled by the same
    PCE:\n   this situation is called a split-brain.  This split-brain scenario\n
    \  may lead to computation loops between PCEs or suboptimal path\n   computation.\n\n
    \  This document describes the procedures to allow a stateful\n   communication
    between PCEs for various use-cases and also the\n   procedures to prevent computations
    loops.\n\n\n\t "

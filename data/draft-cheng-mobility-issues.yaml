  content: "   The draft listed out some of the issues related to IP mobility that
    \n   may have impact on the design and implementation of the NSIS \n   protocols.
    These issues, namely, the multiple flow support and the \n   ping-pong type of
    movement, needs to be considered in the context of \n   the QoS NSLP protocol
    design, so that the NSIS framework would not \n   break when they present.  \n\t "

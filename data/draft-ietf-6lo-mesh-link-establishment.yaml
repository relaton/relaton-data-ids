  content: "   This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for\n
    \  establishing and configuring secure radio links in IEEE 802.15.4\n   radio
    mesh networks.  MLE extends IEEE 802.15.4 for use in multihop\n   mesh networks
    by adding three capabilities: 1) dynamically\n   configuring and securing radio
    connections between neighboring\n   devices, 2) enabling network-wide changes
    to shared radio parameters,\n   and 3) allowing the determination of radio link
    quality prior to\n   configuration.  MLE operates below the routing layer, insulating
    it\n   from the details of configuring, securing, and maintaining individual\n
    \  radio links within a larger mesh network.\n\n\t "

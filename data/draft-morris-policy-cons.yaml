  content: "Without doubt the Internet infrastructure developed far beyond the\nexpectations
    of the original funding agencies, architects,\ndevelopers, and early users.  The
    society's current use and\nexpectations often lead to the need to take the economical
    and\npolitical context in which technology is deployed into consideration.\n\nThis
    document aims to make protocol designers aware of the public\npolicy-related questions
    that may impact standards development.  This\ndocument contains questions, as
    opposed to guidelines or strict rules\nthat should in all cases be followed.  This
    document provides a\nframework for identifying and discussing questions of public
    policy\nconcern and serves as an umbrella for related policy documents.\n\t "

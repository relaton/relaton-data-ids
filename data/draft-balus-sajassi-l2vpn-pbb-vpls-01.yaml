  content: "IEEE 802.1ah standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider Backbone \nBridges
    (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols for \ninterconnection of multiple
    Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was \ndefined in IEEE as a connectionless
    technology based on multipoint \nVLAN tunnels. MSTP is used as the core control
    plane for loop \navoidance and load balancing. As a result, the coverage of the
    \nsolution is limited by STP scale in the core of large service \nprovider networks.
    PBB on the other hand can be used to attain better \nscalability in terms of number
    of customer MAC addresses and number \nof service instances that can be supported.
    \ \n\nVirtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4762] provides a solution for \nextending
    Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, \nthrough a routed MPLS
    backbone without running (M)STP across the \nbackbone. As a result, VPLS has been
    deployed on a large scale in \nservice provider networks.  \n\nThis draft discusses
    extensions to the VPLS PE model required to \nincorporate desirable PBB components
    while maintaining the Service \nProvider fit of the initial model.\n\t "

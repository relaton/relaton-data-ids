  content: "This Internet Draft presents the multi-hop Backbone Wireless Mesh\nNetwork
    scenario, summarising its basic characteristics and\ndescribing the requirements
    and desired properties of an IP\nAutoconfiguration mechanism aimed at being used
    in this kind of\nnetworks.\n\nOnce that the AUTOCONF WG has almost finalised the
    documents that\ndescribe the general architecture of MANETs and the IP\nautoconfiguration
    problem statement in MANETs, the WG is expected to\nstart working on solutions.
    \ This document describes an ad-hoc\nscenario that is getting a lot of attention
    from both\ntelecommunication operators and end-users: Backbone/infrastructure\nWireless
    Mesh Networking.  This document identifies and explains the\nrequirements posed
    by this particular scenario to an IP\nautoconfiguration mechanism.  The goal is
    to help the AUTOCONF WG\nidentify the requirements that need to be taken into
    account when\ndesigning IP autoconfiguration solution(s) suitable for this Wireless\nMesh
    environment.\n\t "

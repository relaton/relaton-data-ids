  content: "   This document presents the basis for a procedure that enables a host\n
    \  or router to automatically setup an IPvX in IPvY tunnel.  Basically,\n   the
    document considers several scenarios, from the most common today\n   \"dominant
    IPv4\" networks to new \"dominant IPv6\" networks, which can\n   even support
    the use of multicast.\n\n   A basic requirement is that the host or router is
    a dual stack node\n   and it will have either native IPv4-only access (dominant
    IPv4\n   network) or native IPv6-only access (dominant IPv6 network).\n   Consequently,
    either IPv6 will be transported in the existing IPv4-\n   only infrastructure,
    or IPv4 will be transported in the existing\n   IPv6-only infrastructure.  Other
    combinations are possible, such as\n   IPv6 in IPv6 (for example to support IPv6
    multicast in an IPv6-\n   unicast-only infrastructure).\n\n   The procedure follows
    the work from [1], [2], [3], [4] and mainly\n   [5], trying to be compliant with
    the requirements enumerated in those\n   documents.\n\t "

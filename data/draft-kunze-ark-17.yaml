  content: "   The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to\n   facilitate
    the high-quality and persistent identification of\n   information objects.  A
    founding principle of the ARK is that\n   persistence is purely a matter of service
    and is neither inherent in\n   an object nor conferred on it by a particular naming
    syntax.  The\n   best that an identifier can do is to lead users to the services
    that\n   support robust reference.  The term ARK itself refers both to the\n   scheme
    and to any single identifier that conforms to it.  An ARK has\n   five components:\n\n
    \  [http://NMAH/]ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]\n\n   an optional and mutable Name
    Mapping Authority Hostport (usually a\n   hostname), the \"ark:\" label, the Name
    Assigning Authority Number\n   (NAAN), the assigned Name, and an optional and
    possibly mutable\n   Qualifier supported by the NMA.  The NAAN and Name together
    form the\n   immutable persistent identifier for the object independent of the
    URL\n   hostname.  An ARK is a special kind of URL that connects users to\n   three
    things: the named object, its metadata, and the provider's\n   promise about its
    persistence.  When entered into the location field\n   of a Web browser, the ARK
    leads the user to the named object.  That\n   same ARK, inflected by appending
    a single question mark (`?'),\n   returns a brief metadata record that is both
    human- and machine-\n   readable.  When the ARK is inflected by appending dual
    question marks\n   (`??'), the returned metadata contains a commitment statement
    from\n   the current provider.  Tools exist for minting, binding, and\n   resolving
    ARKs.\n\n\t "

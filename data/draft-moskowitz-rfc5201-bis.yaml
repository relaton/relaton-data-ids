  content: "This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol\n   (HIP).
    \ HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and\n   maintain shared IP-layer
    state, allowing separation of the identifier\n   and locator roles of IP addresses,
    thereby enabling continuity of\n   communications across IP address changes.  HIP
    is based on a Sigma-\n   compliant Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key
    identifiers\n   from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.\n
    \  The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS)\n   and
    man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with\n   another suitable
    security protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security\n   Payload (ESP), it provides
    integrity protection and optional\n   encryption for upper-layer protocols, such
    as TCP and UDP.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns
    raised by\n   the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates\n
    \  lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.\n\t "

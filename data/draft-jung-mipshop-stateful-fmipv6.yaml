  content: "The DAD procedure for NCoA validation is a burden for achieving the \nfast
    MIPv6 handover. The existing stateless and DHCPv6-based stateful \nNCoA configuration
    schemes are all concerned with the DAD process at \nNAR. This document describes
    an NCoA address pool based stateful NCoA \nconfiguration for MIPv6 fast handover
    (FMIPv6). To reduce the DAD \nhandling time during the handover, the NCoA pools
    are established at \nNAR (in the reactive stateful scheme) or PAR (in the proactive
    \nstateful scheme). An NCoA pool maintains a list of NCoAs already \nconfirmed
    by the corresponding NAR. In response to a handover request, \nthe NAR or PAR
    will allocate a confirmed NCoA to the MN. By the \naddress pool based stateful
    NCoA configuration, the handover latency \ncan be significantly reduced, and a
    tunneling for handover can be \nextended to an NCoA address, instead of NAR. \n

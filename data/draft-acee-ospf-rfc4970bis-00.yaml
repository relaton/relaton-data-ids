abstract:
- content: "<p>It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to know
    the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the routing domain. This
    document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 for advertising optional router
    capabilities. A new Router Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is
    proposed for this purpose. In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with a new
    opaque LSA type ID. In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a new LSA type
    function code. In both protocols, the RI LSA can be advertised at any of the defined
    flooding scopes (link, area, or autonomous system (AS)). This document obsoletes
    RFC 4970 by providing a revised specification including support for advertisement
    of multiple instances of the RI LSA and a TLV for functional capabilities.</p>"

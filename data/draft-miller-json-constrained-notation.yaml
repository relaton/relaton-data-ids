  content: "   This specification addresses the challenges of using JavaScript\n   Object
    Notation (JSON) with constrained devices by providing a\n   standard set of mapping
    rules to Concise Binary Object Representation\n   (CBOR) that preserve all semantic
    information, such that the original\n   JSON string can be identically re-created.
    \ JSON Constrained Notation\n   can also be used by devices as a native data format,
    which can then\n   be represented as JSON when necessary for diagnostics, compatibility,\n
    \  and ease of integration with higher-level systems.\n\n\t "

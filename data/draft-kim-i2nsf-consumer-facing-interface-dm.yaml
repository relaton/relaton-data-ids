  content: "   This document describes a data model for security management that is\n
    \  based on Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) by using\n   Network
    Functions Virtualization (NFV).  This document proposes a\n   security management
    architecture based on I2NSF framework.  Note that\n   the I2NSF framework consists
    of I2NSF User, Security Management\n   System (i.e., Security Controller and Developer's
    Management System),\n   and NSF instances in the lowest layer of the framework.
    \ I2NSF User\n   consists of Application Logic, Policy Updater, and Event Collector.\n
    \  Security Controller consists of Security Policy Manager and NSF\n   Capability
    Manager.  This document explains a data model to perform\n   the missions for
    a security service (i.e., VoIP-VoLTE) in I2NSF\n   security management system.\n\n\t "

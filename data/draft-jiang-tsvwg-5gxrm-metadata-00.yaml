  content: "   Extended Reality & multi-modality communication, or XRM, is a type
    of\n   advanced service that has been studied and standardized in 3GPP.  The\n
    \  service features at achieving high data rate, high reliability and\n   low
    latency.  The multiple streams of an XRM service use IP sessions\n   to transport
    media contents with the provisioning of advanced QoS\n   settings.  The XRM Metadata
    or PDU Set QoS marking is used to\n   differentiate the PDU Set requirements to
    the 5GS.  RTP header\n   extension (HE), as defined by 3GPP, can be used to transport
    XRM\n   Metadata for un-encrypted media streams, while the encrypted XRM\n   streams
    post challenges for UPFs to extract the Metadata.  This draft\n   proposes to
    use the IETF UDP Option extension, by defining a new SAFE\n   type, to help enhance
    the carry & transport of encrypted XRM\n   Metadata.\n\n\t "

  content: "When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over \nwireless
    links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the \ncharacteristics of the
    link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make \nforwarding decisions. In mobile or
    other environments where these \ncharacteristics change frequently, manual configurations
    or the  \ninference of state through routing or transport protocols does not \nallow
    the router to make the best decisions. A bidirectional, event-\ndriven communication
    channel between the router and the modem is \nnecessary.\n\t "

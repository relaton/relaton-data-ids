  content: "Wearable devices are among the core technologies for Internet of Things\n(IoT).
    \ Recent advances in wireless communication devices have made it\npossible to
    create a wearable network in and around the human body. Such\na network can be
    used for diverse applications such as monitoring human\nbody activities and personal
    entertainments. A typical wearable device\nruns on battery power, which is limited
    and often non-rechargeable.\nTherefore, a low energy operation environment is
    desirable. Emergency\ntraffic management is an important aspect of such a network.
    This\ndocument describes how an out-of-bound external wake up based on\non-demand
    mechanism can work to successfully transmit emergency traffic\nin a typical body-centric
    wearable network (BC-WN).\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an incremental, network-based method for\n
    \  deploying SHIM6 or HIP based identifier / locator separation, called\n   Proxying
    Approach to SHIM6 and HIP (PASH).  This mechanism requires\n   no changes to host
    stacks and, when deployed with routable Endpoint\n   IDentifiers (EID), no changes
    to existing database infrastructures.\n   The proposed protocol can be implemented
    in a relatively small number\n   of routers, and deployed independently by ISPs.
    \ At the same time, it\n   allows the network to gradually evolve towards full,
    host-based SHIM6   and/or HIP support, thereby making possible the larger architectural\n
    \  benefits that the network-based \"jack-up\" approaches provide.\n\n   This
    proposal has been on the mental roadmaps within the HIP\n   community for a number
    of years, but is properly documented only now\n   as a result of the problem statement
    effort at the Amsterdam IAB\n   Routing and Addressing Workshop (RAWS).\n\n\n\n\t "

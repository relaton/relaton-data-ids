  content: "   This document identifies one type of the denial of service attack \n
    \  which can be possible in Mobile IP6 and tries to propose a solution \n   for
    same.  \n    \n   Currently in MIP6 each Home Agent is required to maintain a
    home \n   agent list. This home agent list is generated by receiving RA \n   messages
    on the home link and the addresses learned are sent to \n   Mobile node when it
    does Home Agent discovery. On learning this list  \n   MN tries to register with
    addresses in this list one by one in order \n   of preference. Now if the home
    network is flooded with spurious RA \n   packets having high preference value
    the home agent list is populated \n   with non reachable addresses and no mobile
    node is able to register \n   from that home network \n    \n   This document
    proposes to first carry out reachability confirmation \n   for each home agent
    entry before adding to Home Agent list  \n\t "

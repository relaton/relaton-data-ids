  content: "The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has been \nchartered
    to standardize reliable multicast transport services and \nprotocol instantiations,
    which include the tree-based ACK (TRACK) \nprotocol. This document is concerned
    with defining the building \nblock for auto-configuration of the logical ACK-tree.
    According to \nthe charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained modular \ncomponent
    that is common to multiple protocols along with abstract \nAPIs that define a
    building block's access methods and their \narguments.' The TRACK BB mechanisms
    [5] will operate on the logical \nACK-tree that is configured by this TREE BB
    in the TRACK PI \nsessions. This document is made based on the guidelines for
    the RMT \nBB [2] and the recommendations for TREE BB [4].\n\t "

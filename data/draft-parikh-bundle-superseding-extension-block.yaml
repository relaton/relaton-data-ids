  content: "This document defines an optional Bundle Protocol block called the\nSuperseding
    Bundle Extension Block (SBEB) for use with the Bundle\nProtocol in the context
    of the Delay-Tolerant Networking\nArchitecture.  Applications use this block to
    call for the removal of\npreviously sent bundles that are rendered obsolete by
    more recent\nbundles.  Upon receiving a bundle with an SBEB, a node will search\nits
    bundle store (and outbound queues) for bundles that are obsoleted\nby other related
    bundles according to their source and destination\nEID, and the SBEB cookie (if
    present), and may delete some or all of\nthem.  Discarding obsolete bundles helps
    conserve storage space and\nprevents expending resources in further forwarding
    bundles that are\nno longer relevant.  The bundle protocol already uses expiration\ntimes
    to remove bundles that are no longer useful to applications.\nThe SBEB is a way
    for applications to mark bundles that a node may\ndelete prior to their expiration
    times.\n\t "

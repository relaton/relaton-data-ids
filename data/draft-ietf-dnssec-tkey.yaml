  content: "   [draft-ietf-dnsind-tsig-*.txt] provides a means of authenticating and\n
    \  securing Domain Name System (DNS) queries and responses using shared\n   secret
    keys via the TSIG resource record (RR).  However, it provides\n   no mechanism
    for setting up such keys other than manual exchange.\n   This document describes
    a TKEY RR that can be used in a number of\n   different modes to establish shared
    secret keys between a DNS\n   resolver and server.\n \n   [changes from last draft:
    add IANA considerations section, make time\n   fields module 2**32, minor edits,
    update author info, ...]\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a Transport for the Syslog Protocol, that\n
    \  uses the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  The DTLS\n   protocol
    provides authentication and privacy services for SYSLOG\n   applications.  This
    document describes how using DTLS to transport\n   SYSLOG messages makes this
    protection possible in an interoperable\n   way.\n\n   This transport is designed
    to meet the security and operational needs\n   of network administrators, operate
    in environments where a datagram\n   transport is preferred, and integrates well
    into existing public\n   keying infrastructures.\n\t "

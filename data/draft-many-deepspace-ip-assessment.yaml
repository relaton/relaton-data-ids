  content: "   Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars
    is\n   4-20 minutes) and intermittent communications, because of orbital\n   dynamics.
    \ Up to now, communications have been done on a layer-2\n   point to point basis,
    with sometimes the use of relays, therefore no\n   layer-3 networking was possible.
    \ RFC4838 reports an assessment done\n   around 25 years ago concluding that the
    IP protocol stack was not\n   suitable for deep space networking.  This result
    lead to the\n   definition of a new protocol stack based on a store-and-forward\n
    \  paradigm implemented in the Bundle Protocol(BP).  More recently,\n   space
    agencies are planning to deploy IP networks on celestial\n   bodies, such as Moon
    or Mars, ground, and vicinity.  This document\n   revisits the initial assessment
    of not using IP and provides solution\n   paths to use the IP protocol stack,
    from IP forwarding to transport\n   to applications to network management, in
    deep space communications.\n\n\t "

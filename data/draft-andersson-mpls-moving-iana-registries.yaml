  content: "   When RFC 6374 \"Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks\"\n
    \  were developed, the code points allocated by this RFC were mistakenly\n   placed
    within the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs)
    Ping Parameter registry.  This document creates\n   a new dedicated name space
    for Generic Associated Channel code points\n   and move them to a name space their
    own.\n\n\n\t "

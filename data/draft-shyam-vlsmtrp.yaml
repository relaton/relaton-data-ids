  content: "   This is a light weight routing protocol applicable inside a network\n
    \  that appears in the form of a tree and distribution of address space\n   takes
    place with the approach of VLSM. It is based on setting default\n   route inside
    VLSM tree.  With this approach, routing information of\n   the external world
    need not be passed down to the VLSM tree. Thus,\n   load inside a router gets
    reduced substantially.  This document\n   includes IP-VPN with MPLS inside VLSM
    tree by extending RSVP-TE.\n\n\t "

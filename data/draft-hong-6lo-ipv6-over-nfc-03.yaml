abstract:
- content: "<p>Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones
    and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching
    them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than 10 cm. NFC
    standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats, and are based
    on existing radio-frequency identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC
    14443 and FeliCa. The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the
    NFC Forum. The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available in mobile
    phones, laptop computers, and many other devices. This document describes how
    IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN techniques.</p>"

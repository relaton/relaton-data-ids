  content: "   Aggregation has been proposed as one possible solution to the\n   scalability
    problem of the Internet Integrated Services. The current\n   suggestions for aggregation
    are based on measurement-based admission\n   control, which allows for the omission
    of RSVP soft state in the\n   interior routers of an aggregating domain.\n \n
    \  However, measurement-based admission control has certain flaws which\n   may
    lead to over-reservations on links in the network under certain\n   conditions.
    This can result in packet losses for reserved traffic.\n   Hence, we believe that
    it will be necessary to discuss the\n   possibility of using parameter-based admission
    control with\n   aggregation.\n \n   In this document, we present a technique
    for using parameter-based\n   admission control with aggregation as a basis for
    further\n   discussions, and we evaluate possible advantages and disadvantages.\n\n\t "

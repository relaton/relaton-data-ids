  content: "   The BGP protocol is heavily used in Service Provider networks both
    \n   for Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services. For resiliency purposes, \n   redundant
    routers and BGP sessions can be deployed to reduce the \n   consequences of an
    AS Border Router or BGP session breakdown on \n   customers' or peers' traffic.
    However simply taking down or even up a \n   BGP session for maintenance purposes
    may still induce connectivity \n   losses during the BGP convergence. This is
    no more satisfactory for \n   new applications (e.g. voice over IP, on line gaming,
    VPN). \n   Therefore, a solution is required for the graceful shutdown of a (set
    \n   of) BGP session(s) in order to limit the amount of traffic loss \n   during
    a planned shutdown. This document expresses requirements for \n   such a solution.

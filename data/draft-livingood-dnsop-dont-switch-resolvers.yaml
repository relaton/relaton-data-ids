  content: In Case of DNSSEC Validation Failures, Do Not Change Resolvers

  script: Latn
  content: "   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validation by recursive DNS\n   resolvers
    has been deployed at scale.  However, domain signing tools\n   and processes are
    not yet as mature and reliable as is the case for\n   non-DNSSEC-related domain
    administration tools and processes.  This\n   sometimes results in DNSSEC validation
    failures, for which operators\n   of validating resolvers are often blamed.  When
    these failures do\n   occur, end users should not change to a non-validating DNS
    resolver,\n   as that would downgrade their security.  They should instead wait\n
    \  until the authoritative domain operator updates their DNS records to\n   resolve
    the error and that change propagates across the Internet's\n   DNS resolvers,
    the timing of which may be dependent upon the Time To\n   Live (TTL) settings
    in the old and/or erroneous DNS resource records.\n\n\t "

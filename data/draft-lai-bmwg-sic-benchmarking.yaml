  content: "   Entering the \"NewSpace\" era, satellite Internet constellations (SIC)\n
    \  are scaling up at a fast pace.  Emerging satellite networks\n   constructed
    upon SICs enable great opportunities for ubiquitous and\n   low-latency Internet
    services globally.  It should be useful for\n   satellite service providers to
    run various laboratory experiments to\n   comprehensively and systematically benchmark
    the network performance\n   of their new network techniques before launching them
    to the outer\n   space.  However, existing benchmarking methodologies for terrestrial\n
    \  networks either achieve fidelity but lack flexibility or achieve\n   flexibility
    but lack fidelity.\n\n   This draft describes our basic considerations as specifications
    to\n   guide the network performance benchmark for SICs.  A satellite\n   network
    constructed upon emerging SICs in low earth orbit has many\n   unique characteristics
    as compared to existing terrestrial networks.\n   Specifically, our considerations
    include multiple networking models\n   of emerging SICs, a data-driven benchmarking
    approach which may\n   enable testers to build a laboratory benchmark environment
    with\n   acceptable flexibility and fidelity to support various experiments,\n
    \  critical configuration parameters that might affect the SIC network\n   performance,
    and several suggested test cases for network performance\n   benchmarking.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame]\nand
    extended in [CCAMP-SRG] is considered as one of the most\nimportant criteria concerning
    the constraint-based path computation\nof optical channel routes. By applying
    the SRLG disjointness\ncriteria to the constraint-based path computation, one
    can select a\nroute taking into account both resource and logical structure\ndisjointness.
    That implies a lower probability of simultaneous\noptical channel failure.\nThis
    document describes the various physical and logical resource\ntypes considered
    in the SRLG concept. The proposed method focuses on\nthe inference of SRLG information
    between the network physical and\nlogical layers and the logical structures representing
    geographical\nlocations. The main applications of the proposed model are related\nto
    the Constraint-based Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm for\noptical channel
    route computation and the aggregation of the SRLG\ninformation flooded throughout
    traffic engineering extensions of the\nIGP routing protocols (such as OSPF and
    IS-IS).\n\t "

  content: "A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via a public key and
    associated data.  The public key is used to verify digital signatures, and the
    associated data is used to constrain the types of information for which the trust
    anchor is authoritative.  A relying party uses trust anchors to determine if a
    digitally signed object is valid by verifying a digital signature using the trust
    anchor's public key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the associated
    data for the trust anchor.  This document describes some of the problems associated
    with the lack of a standard trust anchor management mechanism and defines requirements
    for data formats and push-based protocols designed to address these problems.
    \ This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.\n\t "

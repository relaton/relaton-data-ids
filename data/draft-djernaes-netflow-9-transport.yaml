  content: "NetFlow Export Version 9 Export is defined in the internet draft\ndraft-claise-netflow-9
    [NFv9], which describes how to transport\nNetFlow over UDP [RFC768]. This document
    describes how NetFlow\nwould use SCTP [RFC2960] as a transport protocol.\nTraditionally
    NetFlow was transmitted over UDP to a physically\nclosely located collector. As
    the networks grow this is not\nnecessarily the case any longer, so issues like
    congestion\navoidance and reliability are becoming an increasing issue for\napplications
    using NetFlow. This document addresses these issues in\na simple way using the
    SCTP protocol.\n\t "

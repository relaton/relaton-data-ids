  content: "   Current password storage methods predominantly use cryptographic hash\n
    \  functions in order to avoid storing users' passwords in clear text.\n   Unfortunately,
    recent advancements in hardware design (notably GPUs)\n   allow an attacker to
    try millions or even billions of password\n   guesses per second which makes \"decryption\"
    of simple passwords\n   feasible in short amounts of time.\n\n   This document
    describes a password storage scheme that incorporates\n   public key encryption
    in order to slow down password verification.\n   Since public key algorithms are
    several orders of magnitude slower\n   than hash functions, the result makes it
    much harder for an attacker\n   to discover users' passwords from the stored,
    encrypted format.\n\n\t "

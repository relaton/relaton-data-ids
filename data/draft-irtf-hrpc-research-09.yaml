- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights\n   considerations,
    similar to the work done on the guidelines for\n   privacy considerations [RFC6973].
    \ This is achieved by providing a\n   proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the
    relation between human\n   rights and Internet protocols, an overview of the discussion
    in\n   technical and academic literature and communities, a proposal for the\n
    \  mapping of the relation between human rights and technical concepts,\n   as
    well as guidelines.\n\n   If you want to see how to apply this work to your own,
    you can\n   directly go to Section 6.  The rest of the document explains the\n
    \  background of the guidelines and how they were developed.\n\n   This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\n   published for informational
    purposes.\n\n   This document is a product of the Internet Research Task Force\n
    \  (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research\n   and
    development activities.  This documents aims to be a consensus\n   document of
    the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of\n   the Internet Research
    Task Force (IRTF).\n\n   Discussion of this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org //\n   https://www.irtf.org/mailman/listinfo/hrpc\n\n\t "

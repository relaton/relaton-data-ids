- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In order to allow the subordinate MANET to be connected to the \nexternal
    network, the MANET border router (MBR) has been defined. For \nproviding scalability
    and reliability to the subordinate MANET, \nmultiple MBRs may be deployed. One
    of the issues on the subordinate \nMANET with multiple MBRs is which network prefixes
    are to be \nadvertised by MBRs. In the case when MBRs advertise different network
    \nprefixes, if a MANET node changes its default MBR to a new one, the \nnode may
    have to transmit packets via non-optimal paths to keep using \nthe existing connection
    to the previous MBR, or change its address by \nusing the network prefix information
    from the new MBR. \nIn the former case, the MANET node may not communicate with
    the MBR \ndue to MANET partitioning. In the latter case, on-going sessions can
    \nbe terminated because of the address change. In this draft, we define \na PMIPv6
    based address autoconfiguration mechanism that enables MANET \nnodes to operate
    properly when all MBRs advertise the same network \nprefix in the subordinate
    MANET.\n\t "

  content: "   The emergency services architecture developed in the IETF Emergency\n
    \  Context Resolution with Internet Technology (ECRIT) working group\n   describes
    an architecture where location information is provided by\n   access networks
    to end points in order to determine the correct dial\n   string and information
    to route the call to a Public Safety Answering\n   Point (PSAP).  For determining
    the PSAP Uniform Resource Identifier\n   (URI) the usage of the Location-to-Service
    Translation (LoST)\n   Protocol is envisioned.\n\n   This document explores the
    architectural impact for the IETF\n   emergency services architecture for situations
    where the Internet\n   Access Provider (IAP) and/or the Internet Service Provider
    (ISP) are\n   only willing to disclose limited or no location information.\n\n
    \  This document provides a problem statement and lists requirements.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a new HTTP header, named Expect-CT, that allows\n
    \  web host operators to instruct user agents to expect valid Signed\n   Certificate
    Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these\n   hosts.  When configured
    in enforcement mode, user agents (UAs) will\n   remember that hosts expect SCTs
    and will refuse connections that do\n   not conform to the UA's Certificate Transparency
    policy.  When\n   configured in report-only mode, UAs will report the lack of
    valid\n   SCTs to a URI configured by the host, but will allow the connection.\n
    \  By turning on Expect-CT, web host operators can discover\n   misconfigurations
    in their Certificate Transparency deployments and\n   ensure that misissued certificates
    accepted by UAs are discoverable\n   in Certificate Transparency logs.\n\n\t "

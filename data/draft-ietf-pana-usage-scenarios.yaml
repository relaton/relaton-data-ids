  content: "Network access authentication is a function that is typically\nrequired
    in most scenarios.  This is accomplished in most networks\nvia protocols such
    as PPP, PPPoE, IEEE 802.1X and others.  The PANA\n(Protocol for carrying Authentication
    for Network Access) WG is\nconsidering the network access authentication function
    being\nperformed at or above the IP layer.  This document captures the\nvarious
    usage scenarios/applicability of a protocol that is used for\nnetwork access authentication
    that is at layer-3 or above and\nadditionally identifies the problem being addressed
    by the WG.\n\n\t "

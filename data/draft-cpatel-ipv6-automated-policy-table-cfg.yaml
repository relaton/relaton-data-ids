- language: en

  content: "This document proposes a method to manage the address selection\npolicy
    tables in network hosts using RA's (Router Advertisements).\nThe aim is to provide
    an easy method to network operators to control\nthe src/dest address used by the
    host in communication within, and\noutside of the site(s) in which the host resides.
    Control of the\npolicy tables allows 1) the user to control the scope in which
    a host\nmay operate, and 2) non-disruption of intra-site traffic during\nrenumbering
    caused by change in the global prefix used by the site to\nconnect to the Internet.\nA
    major impact of the last benefit would be to provide one less\nincentive to advertise
    routes to the stable network prefixes in the\nInternet.\n\n\t "

  content: "Many user applications and the transport protocols that make them\npossible
    require two-way communications.  To address this need, and\nalso for system simplicity,
    round-trip loss measurements are\nfrequently conducted in practice.  The Two-Way
    Active Measurement\nProtocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes a round-trip loss\nmeasurement
    capability for the Internet.  However, there is currently\nno metric specified
    according to the RFC 2330 framework.\n\nThis memo proposes/adds round-trip loss
    to the set of IP Performance\nMetrics (IPPM).\n\t "

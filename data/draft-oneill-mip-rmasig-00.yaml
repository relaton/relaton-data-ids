  content: "Nested MIP [NestMIP] and Concatenated MIP [ConcatMIP] provide means to
    \nsupport both localization and aggregation of MIP signalling. They achieve this
    by providing two distinct layers of MIP signalling and forwarding; a local access
    layer that provides local mobility management and local access services, and a
    remote access layer that provides remote access back to a home subnet. The local
    access layer provides a regional address from a Regional Mobility Agent (a regional
    HA) that is then used as a CCoA for the remote access layer. Inter-FA movement
    and MIP signalling at the local access layer then automatically supports the hand-off
    of potentially multiple parallel remote access sessions. Nested MIP achieves this
    through encapsulation whilst Concatenated MIP achieves it though various forms
    of CoA switching.\nThis draft describes the localised and aggregated MIP signalling
    model for managing both the Local Access and Remote Access MIP layers. This includes
    inter-FA and Inter-RMA hand-offs within and between Nesting and Concatenating
    Regional Mobility Agents. This is necessary to support incremental, heterogeneous
    deployment that is required given that Nested MIP is deployable now whilst Concatenated
    MIP requires additional and significant standards and development work.\n\n\t "

  content: "Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private \nNetwork
    (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their \nsites are connected
    via a Local Area Network (LAN).  It is often \nrequired for the Service Provider
    (SP) to give the customer redundant \nconnectivity to some sites, often called
    \"multi-homing\".  This memo \nshows how multi-homing can be offered in the context
    of LDP-based \nVPLS using BGP-AD.\n\t "

  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables\n   receiving
    asynchronous notification of events related to SIP systems.\n   This framework
    defines the procedures for creating, refreshing and\n   terminating subscriptions,
    as well as fetching and periodic polling\n   of resource state.  These procedures
    have a serious deficiency in\n   that they do not allow state to persist over
    a subscription refresh,\n   or between two consecutive polls.  Another related
    but different\n   problem relates to the relative intolerance of the framework
    to\n   interferences in networking connectivity of subscribers in long-\n   lasting
    subscriptions.  This document explains the problems in more\n   detail and discusses
    possible solutions.\n\t "

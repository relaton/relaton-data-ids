  content: "   When a service has been distributed over many locations in the\n   network,
    providing service by utilizing computing resources hosted in\n   various servers
    is required to consider supporting delay-sensitive\n   service and optimizing
    network loads.  For that reason, Computing-\n   Aware Networking (CAN) is a new
    routing approach to balance services\n   using service-specific metrics instead
    of simply dispatching the\n   service request in a static way or optimizing solely
    connectivity\n   metrics [draft-liu-can-ps-usecases].  Currently, CAN solutions
    are\n   discussed with both existing technologies (e.g., DNS, L7 Load\n   Balancer,
    etc.) and a new approach.  In this document, it describes\n   the LISP-based CAN
    approach and related standard works to meet\n   requirements.\n\n\t "

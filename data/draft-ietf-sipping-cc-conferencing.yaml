  content: "This specification defines conferencing call control features for the
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This document builds on the Conferencing Requirements
    and Framework documents to define how a tightly coupled SIP conference works.
    \ The approach is explored from the perspective of different user agent (UA) types:
    conference-unaware, conference-aware, and focus UAs.  The use of Uniform Resource
    Identifiers (URIs) in conferencing, OPTIONS for capabilities discovery, and call
    control using REFER are covered in detail with example call flow diagrams.  The
    usage of the isfocus feature tag is defined.  This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

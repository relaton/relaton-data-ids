  script: Latn
  content: "The existing PKI has a few inherent limitations like:\n \n  1. It is implicitly
    assumed that the two trading parties have ONE\n  mutually trusted third party
    that can attest ALL of each\n  party's attributes. It provides no mechanism to
    separate out the\n  fields in a certificate for attestation by different Certification\n
    \ Authorities.\n \n  2. This standard in no way gives the flexibility to expose
    only\n  certain fields of a certificate to the other party.\n\nThis memo proposes
    a model which, while working well within the\nX.509v3 framework, overcomes these
    limitations by\nbreaking up a certificate into pre-signed 'unit attestations'\nreferred
    to as 'Atomic Certificates' and packaging them in the\nX.509v3 format only at
    the time of sending the certificate to the\nother party.\n\n\t "

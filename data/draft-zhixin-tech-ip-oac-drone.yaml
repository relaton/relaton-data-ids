  content: "   This document proposes an experimental protocol, IP over Avian\n   Carriers
    using Drones (IPoAC-Drone), as an extension to the classic\n   IPoAC (RFC 1149)
    for modern low-altitude economy applications.  It\n   describes how UAVs (Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles) can be utilized as\n   network carriers to provide a store-and-forward
    data transmission\n   model.  The document covers protocol design, operational\n
    \  considerations, and potential applications, including emergency\n   communication,
    rural networking, and disaster recovery.\n\n\t "

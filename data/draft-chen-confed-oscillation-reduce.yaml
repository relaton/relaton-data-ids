  content: "This document proposes a simple revision to Confederation that allows\na
    BGP speaker in a Confederation to send a route advertisement\n(instead of a route
    withdraw) in certain cases.  The route\nadvertisement helps narrow the gap between
    Confederation and IBGP\nfull-mesh in terms of routing information. It has been
    shown that the\nproposed mechanism helps achieve stable route selection and eliminate\na
    number of persistent route oscillations involving Confederation.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A major challenge with RFC 4474-style identity assertions has been\n
    \  that SIP operates in highly mediated and interworked environments.\n   SIP
    requests may pass through gateways, policy enforcement devices or\n   other entities
    that receive SIP requests and effectively act as user\n   agents, re-initiating
    a request.  In these circumstances,\n   intermediaries may recreate the fields
    protected by the RFC4474\n   signature, making end-to end integrity impossible.
    \ This document\n   describes a mechanism for two compliant endpoints to exchange\n
    \  authentication data even in the face of intermediaries which remove\n   all
    additional call signaling meta-data or which translate from SIP\n   into protocols
    incapable of understanding identity meta-data (e.g.,\n   where one side is the
    PSTN).\n\n\t "

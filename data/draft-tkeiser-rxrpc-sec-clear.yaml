  content: "RxRPC was originally designed as the remote procedure call layer for\nAFS-3.
    \ Today there are a number of anonymous RxRPC applications\nwhich require identity
    assertions in order to ensure that the desired\npeer receives and processes a
    procedure call.  This memo defines a\nreplacement for the rxnull security class
    which provides a means for\nmutually agreeing upon who is communicating, without
    incurring\ncryptographic overhead.  It should be noted that, much like rxnull,\nthis
    security object is not suitable for use in a distributed\nenvironment due to its
    inability to provide integrity protection.\n\t "

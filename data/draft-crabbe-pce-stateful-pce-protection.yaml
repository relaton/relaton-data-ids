  content: "   Stateful PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] can apply global concurrent\n
    \  optimizations to optimize LSP placement.  In a deployment where a PCE\n   is
    used to compute all the paths, it may be beneficial for the\n   protection paths
    to also be computed by the PCE.  This document\n   defines extensions needed for
    the setup and management of MPLS-TE\n   protection paths by the PCE.\n\n\n\t "

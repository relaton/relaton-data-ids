  content: "Header Compression has proven to be essential for using RTP over\nbandwidth
    limited links. While all of these links have only a\nlimited bandwidth, some are
    additional extremely unreliable, e.g.\nwireless links. It is shown, that existing
    Header Compression\nschemes, that work well over reliable links, perform very
    bad, if\nmany errors occur.\nThis led to the development of a new robust Header
    Compression\nmechanism, that is introduced in this paper. The core idea is the\ndefinition
    of update packets, which are referenced by non-update\npackets. This reduces the
    interdependency between the packets and\nwith this the amount of discarded packets
    at the decompressor.\nThe Header Compression scheme, the used packet formats and
    the\ndecompression algorithm, are described in detail.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes LRMP, the Light-weight Reliable Multicast\n
    \  Protocol. LRMP provides a minimum set of functions for end-to-end\n   reliable
    network transport suitable for bulk data transfer to\n   multiple receivers. LRMP
    is designed to work in heterogeneous\n   network environments and support multiple
    data senders. A totally\n   distributed control scheme is used for error recovery
    so that no\n   prior configuration and no router support are required. LRMP also\n
    \  includes a selective feedback mechanism allowing to monitor the\n   quality
    of service at receivers. In LRMP, flow and congestion\n   control is performed
    based on NACK packets and congestion indication\n   from receivers. Forward error
    correction is supported as an\n   independent optional module.\n\n\t "

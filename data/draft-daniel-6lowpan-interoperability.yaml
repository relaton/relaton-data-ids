  content: "   This document specifies the gateway architecture for the\n   interoperability
    between 6LoWPAN and external IPv6 networks.  The\n   gateway does the compression
    and decompression of IPv6 packets and\n   performs the mapping between 16 bit
    short addresses and the IPv6\n   addresses for both the external IPv6 networks
    and 6LowPAN,\n   respectively.\n\t "

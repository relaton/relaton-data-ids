  content: "This document looks at a number of issues surrounding the need\n   for
    network address translation (NAT) when IPsec is used to\n   create virtual private
    networks (VPN).  This document only\n   looks at simple VPNs.  That is VPNs consisting
    of a single\n   IPsec tunnel as compared to VPNs consisting of \\021chained\\022\n
    \  and/or \\021nested\\022 IPsec tunnels and/or transports.  It proposes\n   a
    method to vastly reduce the extent that NAT is needed in a\n   VPN.\n\t "

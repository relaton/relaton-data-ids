- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines an enhancement to the Designated Forwarder (DF)\n
    \  election process in Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN)\n   environments.
    \ While traditional DF election operates at a per\n   Virtual Local Area Network
    (VLAN) or per group of VLANs (in case of\n   VLAN bundle or VLAN-aware bundle
    service) level, such granularity may\n   not be sufficient for applications requiring
    optimized or isolated\n   multicast forwarding.  This specification introduces
    a refined DF\n   election mechanism that extends existing hash-based methods to\n
    \  operate at a more granular level specifically at the tuple of\n   Ethernet
    Segment Identifier (ESI), VLAN, and multicast flow.  This\n   approach enables
    improved traffic distribution, enhanced load\n   balancing, and greater deployment
    flexibility for multicast delivery\n   in EVPN based networks.  The proposed method
    is designed to remain\n   compatible with existing DF election procedures while
    offering\n   targeted improvements for multicast scenarios.\n\n\t "

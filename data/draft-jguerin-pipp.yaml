  script: Latn
  content: "   The Pay It Proper Protocol (PIPP) is an application-level network\n
    \  protocol for inter-process communication that defines a universal\n   Turing
    machine.  PIPP uses the concept of a sub stream to the\n   traditional network
    stream allowing instructions and data to be\n   streamed on a single tape.  All
    processes on a sub stream aware\n   network are programmable against instruction
    sets allowing for more\n   expressive languages and compilers to be developed.
    \ PIPP is designed\n   to be the universal bootstrapping protocol and instruction
    format for\n   the Internet until more advanced protocols, compilers and formats
    are\n   developed.  This RFC defines sub streaming and the PIPP protocol.  A\n
    \  proof of concept has been implemented, and a sample instruction\n   format
    is given.\n\n\t "

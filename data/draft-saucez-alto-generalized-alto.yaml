  script: Latn
  content: "The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem is being\ndiscussed
    within the IETF and more globally by the research community\nand some enterprises.
    \ In this memo, we argue that it is important to\nconceive general-purpose mechanisms
    to solve this problem.  By\ngeneral-purpose we say not only application independent
    but also\nlayer independent mechanism.  The generality can be obtained because\nthe
    underlying problem is the same regardless the application or the\nlayer.\n\t "

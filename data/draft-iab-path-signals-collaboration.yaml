  content: "   This document discusses principles for designing mechanisms that use\n
    \  or provide path signals, and calls for standards action in specific\n   valuable
    cases.  RFC 8558 describes path signals as messages to or\n   from on-path elements,
    and points out that visible information will\n   be used whether it is intended
    as a signal or not.  The principles in\n   this document are intended as guidance
    for the design of explicit\n   path signals, which are encouraged to be authenticated
    and include a\n   minimal set of parties to minimize information sharing.  These\n
    \  principles can be achieved through mechanisms like encryption of\n   information
    and establishing trust relationships between entities on\n   a path.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes how to achieve further slicing or traffic engineering\n
    \  interoperability between vendors without the use of SRH.\n\n   Slicing or traffic
    engineering information is encapsulated as part of the SRv6 SID.\n   Use of IP
    longest prefix match approach to identify the further slicing via sub-\n   slice
    identifier.\n\n   The traffic engineering from one end to another end is seen
    as segment by segment\n   approach. This approach could solve the scalability
    of traffic engineering tunnels\n   required in a huge network, which order of
    N^2 has be considered.\n\n\t "

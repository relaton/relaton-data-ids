  content: "   The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP based\n
    \  access networks.  It carries EAP over UDP which permits ISPs to use\n   multiple
    authentication methods.  However, in roaming environments IP\n   clients might
    change of gateways and new EAP authentication from\n   scratch may occur.  This
    can considerably degrade performance.  To\n   solve this problem, the PANA WG
    is currently working on a solution\n   based on context transfer between PANA
    Authentication Agents.  The\n   aim of this document is to analyze how this proposal
    works in a WLAN\n   environment considering various deployment scenarios.\n\t "

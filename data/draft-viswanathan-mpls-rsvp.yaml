  content: "This memo describes a mechanism for establishing a switched path with\n
    \  guaranteed Quality of Service for RSVP [1] flows in a MultiProtocol\n   Label
    Switching (MPLS) environment.  It proposes an extension to the\n   RSVP protocol
    that allows the establishment of a sequence of label\n   switched hops along the
    hop-by-hop routed path by enabling adjacent\n   nodes to exchange MPLS labels
    [11].  The labels may correspond to\n   information that identifies a layer 2
    virtual connection; for\n   example, the VPI/VCI value in the case of an ATM-based\n
    \  infrastructure.\n\t "

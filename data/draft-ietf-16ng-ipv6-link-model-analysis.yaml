  content: "This document provides different IPv6 link models that are suitable for
    IEEE 802.16 based networks and provides analysis of various considerations for
    each link model and the applicability of each link model under different deployment
    scenarios.  This document is the result of a design team (DT) that was formed
    to analyze the IPv6 link models for IEEE 802.16 based networks.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   DOTS client signal using original signal communication channel can\n
    \  expect service degradation and even service disruption as any other\n   service
    over Internet but in more severe conditions because the\n   signal may have to
    be transmitted over congested paths due to the\n   denial-of-service attack.\n\n
    \  This document specifies a fall-back asynchronous mechanism using an\n   intermediate
    agent to store DOTS signal information during a limited\n   period of time.  This
    mechanism allows a DOTS server to request a\n   signal information stored by a
    DOTS client when no heartbeat is\n   received from the DOTS client.  This intermediate
    agent called DOTS\n   Signal Repository have to be connected to the DOTS client
    and server\n   independently.  The repository must be located and/or reached through\n
    \  one or multiple network paths, preferably as most as possible\n   disjoint
    from regular signal channel, in order to increase its\n   reachability.  The document
    introduces a set of support protocols to\n   build the asynchronous communication
    between the DOTS cient, server\n   and the repository.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>DomainKeys Identified Mail v2 (DKIM2) permits a person, role, or organization
    that owns a signing domain to document that it has handled an email message by
    associating their domain with the message. This is achieved by providing a hash
    value that has been calculated on the current contents of the message and then
    applying a cryptographic signature that covers the hash values and other details
    about the transmission of the message. Verification is performed by querying an
    entry within the signing domain's DNS space to retrieve an appropriate public
    key. As a message is transferred from author to recipient systems that alter the
    body or header fields will provide details of their changes and calculate new
    hash values. Further signatures will be added to provide a validatable "chain".
    This permits validators to identify the nature of changes made by intermediaries
    and apply a reputation to the systems that made changed. DKIM2 also allows recipients
    to detect when messages have been unexpectedly "replayed" and can also ensure
    that delivery status notifications are only sent to entities that were involved
    in the transmission of a message.</p>

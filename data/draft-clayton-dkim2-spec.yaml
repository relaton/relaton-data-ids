  content: "   DomainKeys Identified Mail v2 (DKIM2) permits a person, role, or\n
    \  organization that owns a signing domain to document that it has\n   handled
    an email message by associating their domain with the\n   message.  This is achieved
    by providing a hash value that has been\n   calculated on the current contents
    of the message and then applying a\n   cryptographic signature that covers the
    hash values and other details\n   about the transmission of the message.  Verification
    is performed by\n   querying an entry within the signing domain's DNS space to
    retrieve\n   an appropriate public key.  As a message is transferred from author\n
    \  to recipient systems that alter the body or header fields will\n   provide
    details of their changes and calculate new hash values.\n   Further signatures
    will be added to provide a validatable \"chain\".\n   This permits validators
    to identify the nature of changes made by\n   intermediaries and apply a reputation
    to the systems that made\n   changed.  DKIM2 also allows recipients to detect
    when messages have\n   been unexpectedly \"replayed\" and will ensure that Delivery
    Status\n   Notifications are only sent to entities that were involved in the\n
    \  transmission of a message.\n\n\t "

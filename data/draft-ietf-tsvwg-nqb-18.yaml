  content: "   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non-\n
    \  Queue-Building Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The NQB PHB provides a\n   shallow-buffered,
    best-effort service as a complement to a Default\n   deep-buffered best-effort
    service for Internet services.  The purpose\n   of this NQB PHB is to provide
    a separate queue that enables smooth\n   (i.e. non-bursty), low-data-rate, application-limited
    traffic flows,\n   which would ordinarily share a queue with bursty and capacity-seeking\n
    \  traffic, to avoid the latency, latency variation and loss caused by\n   such
    traffic.  This PHB is implemented without prioritization and can\n   be implemented
    without rate policing, making it suitable for\n   environments where the use of
    these features is restricted.  The NQB\n   PHB has been developed primarily for
    use by access network segments,\n   where queuing delays and queuing loss caused
    by Queue-Building\n   protocols are manifested, but its use is not limited to
    such\n   segments.  In particular, applications to cable broadband links, Wi-\n
    \  Fi links, and mobile network radio and core segments are discussed.\n   This
    document recommends a specific Differentiated Services Code\n   Point (DSCP) to
    identify Non-Queue-Building flows.\n\n   [NOTE (to be removed by RFC-Editor):
    This document references an ISE\n   submission draft (I-D.briscoe-docsis-q-protection)
    that is approved\n   for publication as an RFC.  This draft should be held for
    publication\n   until the queue protection RFC can be referenced.]\n\n\t "

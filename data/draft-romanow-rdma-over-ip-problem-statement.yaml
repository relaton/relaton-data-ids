  content: "This draft addresses an IP-based solution to the problem of high\nsystem
    costs due to network I/O copying in end-hosts at high\nspeeds.  The problem is
    due to the high cost of memory bandwidth,\nand it can be substantially improved
    using 'copy avoidance.'  The\nhigh overhead has prevented TCP/IP from being used
    as an\ninterconnection network.\n\t "

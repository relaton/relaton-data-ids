  content: "This document presents a security design for RPL: IPv6 Routing\n   Protocol
    for Low Power and Lossy networks.  The effort builds upon\n   previous work on
    routing security and adapts the security assessments\n   to the issues specific
    to RPL.  With the threat model, the security\n   objectives and required services
    are identified.  These assessments\n   then provide the basis of the security
    recommendations for\n   incorporation into RPL.\n\n\t "

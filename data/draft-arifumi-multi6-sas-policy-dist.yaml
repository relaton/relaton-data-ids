  content: "   This document describes a method for the distribution of source\n   address
    selection policy from ISPs to gateway routers for consumers\n   and from the gateways
    to end nodes.  This method is particularly\n   effective when a consumer site
    has multiple address blocks.  Every\n   end node is guided by the policy in selecting
    an appropriate source\n   address for each destination address and every gateway
    is guided by\n   the policy in forwarding packets to appropriate next-hop ISPs.
    \ This\n   makes it possible for an end node to set a connection up without\n
    \  being concerned about failures of transfer due to ingress filtering\n   by
    the ISPs, for ISP operators to manage consumers' behavior and\n   networking policy,
    and for consumers to be provided with networks\n   that are almost automatically
    robust and reliable.\n\t "

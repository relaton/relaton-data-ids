- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   It is widely recognized that it has become very difficult to\n   introduce
    new transport protocols on the Internet.  On reason to this\n   is that there
    are no agreed-upon way for a source end host to find\n   out whether there is
    support for a particular transport protocol\n   along the network path from itself
    to a destination end host or not.\n   This document describes a Happy Eyeballs
    framework that generalizes\n   previously proposed Happy Eyeballs mechanisms to
    include a transport\n   protocol, the configuration of this transport protocol,
    as well as a\n   transport address, i.e., to include complete transport solutions.\n
    \  The described Happy Eyeballs framework is not only useful in the\n   design
    and implementation of mechanisms that are to determine the\n   support of particular
    transport solutions, but also for the design of\n   mechanisms that are to select
    the transport solution, which,\n   according to some criteria, is the most appropriate
    one to use.\n\n\t "

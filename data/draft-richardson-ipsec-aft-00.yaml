abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "A number of proposed protocols describe mechanisms whereby end to end
    authentication or privacy may be negotiated: most notable is the IPSEC working
    group where these issues are dealt with in a general way. Some relating working
    groups make use of the IPSEC (and related IPv6 facilities) facilities to provide
    authentication services (mobileip), while other groups (notably SNMPv2, RSVP,
    OSPF, BGP, AFT and CAT) provide their own facilities.                                                      This
    documents describes some of the common considerations for all of these protocols
    when there exists security gateway(s) (aka 'firewalls') between the end nodes
    that are negotiating security.                       This document does not enter
    into the debate about node security versus network security. It is assumed that
    the need for firewall like facilities will continue to exist for sometime. Whether
    or not IPSEC and/or IPv6 security services make firewalls obsolete or more common
    will remain a heated question for sometime.\n\t "

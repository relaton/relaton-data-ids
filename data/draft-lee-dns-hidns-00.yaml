abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Formally, the Domain Name System (DNS) has the capability to resolve\n
    \  any registered name to its associated data.  However, current\n   heterogeneous
    identifiers (such as DOI, Handle, Ecode, etc.) rely on\n   isolated and incompatible
    resolution systems, leading to fragmented\n   client implementations and failing
    to fully leverage the existing\n   Internet infrastructure.  This specification
    defines an operational\n   practice that achieves DNS-based heterogeneous identifier
    resolution\n   by mapping identifier values to dedicated DNS namespaces under
    the\n   authority of their respective identifier systems.  This mapping\n   follows
    standardized rules compatible with the Internationalized\n   Domain Names in Applications
    (IDNA) framework, allowing identifiers\n   to be converted into domain names that
    can be resolved through\n   standard DNS queries (for A, AAAA, or CNAME records).
    \ This approach\n   establishes a unified semantic scope for identifier resolution,\n
    \  providing clients with a single, consistent access interface.  Its\n   primary
    advantage lies in integrating diverse identifier systems into\n   the robust,
    scalable, and globally deployed DNS infrastructure,\n   thereby simplifying client
    development and improving overall\n   resolution efficiency.\n\n\t "

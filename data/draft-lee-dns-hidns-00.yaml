abstract:
- content: "<p>Formally, the Domain Name System (DNS) has the capability to resolve
    any registered name to its associated data. However, current heterogeneous identifiers
    (such as DOI, Handle, Ecode, etc.) rely on isolated and incompatible resolution
    systems, leading to fragmented client implementations and failing to fully leverage
    the existing Internet infrastructure. This specification defines an operational
    practice that achieves DNS-based heterogeneous identifier resolution by mapping
    identifier values to dedicated DNS namespaces under the authority of their respective
    identifier systems. This mapping follows standardized rules compatible with the
    Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) framework, allowing identifiers
    to be converted into domain names that can be resolved through standard DNS queries
    (for A, AAAA, or CNAME records). This approach establishes a unified semantic
    scope for identifier resolution, providing clients with a single, consistent access
    interface. Its primary advantage lies in integrating diverse identifier systems
    into the robust, scalable, and globally deployed DNS infrastructure, thereby simplifying
    client development and improving overall resolution efficiency.</p>"

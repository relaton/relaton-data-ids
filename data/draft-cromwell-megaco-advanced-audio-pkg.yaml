  content: "This document is a proposal to add a new event/signal package to the\nMegaco
    protocol to control an ARF (Audio Resource Function) which may\nreside on a Media
    Gateway or specialized Audio Server.\nThis event package provides support for
    the standard IVR operations\nof PlayAnnouncement, PlayCollect, and PlayRecord.
    \ It supports direct\nreferences to simple audio as well as indirect references
    to simple\nand complex audio. It provides audio variables, control of audio\ninterruptibility,
    digit buffer control, special key sequences, and\nsupport for reprompting during
    data collection.   It also provides an\narbitrary number of user defined qualifiers
    to be used in resolving\ncomplex audio structures.  For example, the user could
    define qualif-\niers for any or all of the following: language, accent, audio
    file\nformat, gender, speaker, or customer.\n\t "

  content: "   For routing protocol troubleshooting, different approaches exibit\n
    \  merits w.r.t. different situations.  They can be generally divided\n   into
    two categories, the distributive way and the centralized way.  A\n   very commonly
    used distributive approach is to log in possiblly all\n   related devices one
    by one to check massive data via CLI.  Such\n   approach provides very detailed
    device information, however it\n   requires operators with high NOC (Network Operation
    Center)\n   experience and suffers from low troubleshooting efficiency and high\n
    \  cost.  The centralized approach is realized by collecting data from\n   devices
    via approaches, like the streaming Telemetry or BMP(BGP\n   Monitoring Protocol)
    RFC7854 [RFC7854], for the centralized server to\n   analyze all gathered data.
    \ Such approach allows a comprehensive view\n   fo the whole network and facilitates
    automated troubleshooting, but\n   is limited by the data collection boundary
    set by different\n   management domains, as well as high network bandwidth and
    CPU\n   computation costs.\n\n   This document proposes a semi-distributive and
    semi-centralized\n   approach for fast routing protocol troubleshooting, localizing
    the\n   target device and possibly the root cause, more precisely.  It\n   defines
    a new protocol, called the PAP (Protocol assisted Protocol),\n   for devices to
    exchange protocol related information between each\n   other in both active and
    on-demand manners.  It allow devices to\n   request specific information from
    other devices and receive replies\n   to the requested data.  It also allows actively
    transmission of\n   information without request to inform other devices to better
    react\n   w.r.t. network issues.\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment\nwithin
    individual domains, typically supporting voice and video\ncommunications.  Though
    it was designed from the outset to support\ninter-domain federation over the public
    Internet, such federation has\nnot materialized.  The primary reasons for this
    are the complexities\nof inter-domain phone number routing and concerns over security.\nThis
    document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements, and\nthen describes
    a new model and technique for inter-domain federation\nwith SIP, called Verification
    Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR).\nViPR addresses the problems that have prevented
    inter-domain\nfederation over the Internet.  It provides fully distributed inter-\ndomain
    routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phone\nnumbers to domains,
    a new technique for automated VoIP anti-spam, and\nprivacy of number ownership,
    all while preserving the trapezoidal\nmodel of SIP.\n\nLegal\n\nThis documents
    and the information contained therein are provided on\nan \"AS IS\" basis and

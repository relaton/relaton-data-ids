  content: "   Routing and addressing are inexorably tied, and the scalability of\n
    \  the routing system is wholly dependent on the abstraction and\n   allocation
    of the address space.  The addressing architecture for the\n   Internet was set
    forth in [RFC1518], [RFC4632], and [RFC4291].  These\n   describe how address
    aggregation can be performed at the ISP and\n   local level.\n\n   Address allocation
    and assignment procedures by the Regional Internet\n   Registries (RIRs) have
    created large address blocks.  This creates an\n   opportunity for further aggregation
    above the ISP level without any\n   change to existing allocations.\n\n   This
    document discusses issues regarding address aggregation above\n   the ISP level,
    for continents or regions, thereby providing\n   additional address space aggregation
    and efficiency in the routing\n   system.  Small changes to address allocation
    policies can help to\n   ensure futher aggregations and improvements in routing
    efficiency.\n   Some of these concepts were discussed as part of the Routing and\n
    \  Addressing meetings [RFC1380] and extended further here.\n\n   This document
    is not advocating geographical assignment below the\n   continental level.  That
    has been thoroughly discussed previously.\n\n\t "

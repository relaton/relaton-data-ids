  content: "   Multi-protocol Label Switching - Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a\n
    \  profile of the MPLS protocol that is used in packet switched\n   transport
    networks and operated in a similar manner to other\n   existing transport technologies
    (e.g., OTN), as described in\n   RFC5921. This document specifies YANG models
    for MPLS-TP, which have\n   not been covered by existing models so far. The gap
    analysis with\n   current relevant traffic-engineering (TE) and MPLS models is
    also\n   included.\n\n\n\t "

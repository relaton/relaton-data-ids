  content: "This document proposes a family of Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs) \nbased on
    Dynamic Packet State (DPS) in the context of the \ndifferentiated service architecture.
    With these PHBs, distributed\nalgorithms can be devised to implement services
    with flexibility,\nutilization, and assurance levels similar to those that can
    be \nprovided with per-flow mechanisms.\nWith Dynamic Packet State, each packet
    carries in its header, in\naddition to the PHB codepoint, some PHB-specific state.
    The state\nis initialized by the ingress node. Interior nodes process each\nincoming
    packet based on the state carried in the packet's \nheader, updating both its
    internal state and the state in the \npacket's header before forwarding it to
    the next hop. By using \nDPS to coordinate actions of edge and interior nodes
    along the \npath traversed by a flow, distributed algorithms can be designed\nto
    approximate the behavior of a broad class of 'stateful' \nnetworks using networks
    in which interior nodes do not maintain \nper-flow state. We give examples of
    services that can be implemented by\nPHBs based on DPS. We also discuss several
    possible solutions for \nencoding Dynamic Packet State that have the minimum incompatibility
    with IPv4.\n\n\t "

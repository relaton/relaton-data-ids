  content: "This memo enumerates requirements to realize full-mesh multiparty \nconferencing
    using baseline Session Initiation Protocol. Primary \nrequirement is to advertise
    conference members’ addresses to new \nparticipants by concatenating multiple
    SDP session descriptions \ntogether. This particular requirement can solve several
    well-known \nproblems, including disjoint meshes and race conditions, that are
    \nlingering in full-mesh conferencing for a while now. \n\t "

  content: "This document presents extensions to Version 1 of the Resource Reservation
    Setup Protocol (RSVP).  These extensions ameliorate RSVP support of Large Scale
    Multicast Applications (LSMA) and Virtual Private Networks (VPN).  With these
    types of applications, several hosts at any particular site are participating
    in a session. Efficient RSVP use requires aggregation of their addresses into
    a single entry for classification purposes.  The extensions allow such aggregation
    of state in a simple manner that requires no changes to the base RSVP specification.\n\t "

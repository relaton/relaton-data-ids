  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)  \nfor
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\nIn particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-\nbased management of CableHome
    compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home\nrouters.  Specifically, this MIB defines
    managed objects for both a\nconnection speed tool and an ICMP 'ping' tool between
    the Gateway and \ndevices on the LAN.\nThis memo specifies a MIB module in a manner
    that is compliant to the\nSNMP SMIv2.  The set of objects is consistent with the
    SNMP\nframework and existing SNMP standards.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Multicast Virtual Private Network (VPN) extensions
    and procedures of designated forwarder election performed between ingress PEs,
    which is different from the one described in [RFC9026] in which the upstream designated
    fowarder determined by using the "Standby PE Community" carried in the C-Multicast
    routes. Based on the DF election, the failure detcetion point discovery mechanism
    between DF and standby DF is extended in MVPN procedures to achieve fast failover
    by using BFD session to track the status of detection point. To realize a stable
    "warm root standby", this document obsolete the P-Tunnel status determining procedure
    for downstream PEs in regular MVPN by introducing an anycast RPF checking mechanism
    in dataplane as an instead.</p>

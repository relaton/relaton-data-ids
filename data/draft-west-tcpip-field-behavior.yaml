  content: "This draft describes TCP/IP field behavior in the context of header \ncompression.
    \nHeader compression is possible thanks to the fact that most header \nfields
    do not vary randomly from packet to packet. Many of the \nfields exhibit static
    behavior or change in a more or less \npredictable way. When designing a header
    compression scheme, it is \nof fundamental importance to understand the behavior
    of the fields \nin detail.\n\t "

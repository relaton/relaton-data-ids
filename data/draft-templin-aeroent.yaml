  content: "   Enterprise networks provide a secured data communications\n   infrastructure
    built for the purpose of information sharing and\n   increased productivity for
    end users within the organization.\n   Enterprise networks are often organized
    as private Internets unto\n   themselves that connect to the global Internet either
    not at all or\n   via firewalls, proxies, and/or other network securing devices.
    \ This\n   document discusses an AERO enterprise network profile that outlines\n
    \  new and more flexible methods for connecting, tracking and managing\n   mobile
    organizational assets.\n\n\t "

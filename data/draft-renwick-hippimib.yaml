  content: "This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
    Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
    In particular, it defines objects for managing HIPPI objects.  These objects are
    intended to be used in conjunction with the interface mib to fully monitor a HIPPI
    interface.                                    This memo is a modification of an
    original document by Jeff Miller, Network Systems Corporation, December 18, 1992.\n\t "

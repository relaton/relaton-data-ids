  content: "This draft describes the use of RSVP [RFC2205] with applications\nthat
    do not have resource requirements that are readily quantifiable\nper the standard
    Intserv token-bucket model (qualitative\napplications). We introduce the 'qualitative'
    service-type. This\nservice-type can be used in conjunction with RSVP signaling
    to\nmanage the allocation of network resources to traffic originating\nfrom qualitative
    applications. This mode of RSVP usage is\nparticularly applicable to networks
    that combine differentiated\nservice (diff-serv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP signaling
    [intdiff].\n\t "

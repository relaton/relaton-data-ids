  content: "   Some mail systems have been observed to use authentication schemes\n
    \  the domain name in the From: header as a security key, in combination\n   with
    DKIM, an approach works poorly in connection with forwarders\n   that edit messages.
    \ This document describes a profile of DKIM\n   intended to improve interoperation
    of DKIM with such schemes.\n\n\t "

  content: "The DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) working group is\nspecifying
    standardized interfaces for accessing in-network storage\nfrom applications to
    store, retrieve and manage data.  The main\nobjective is to provide a framework
    that is useful to P2P\napplications, without excluding other, possibly related
    applications\nthat can benefit from accessing in-network storage.  This memo\npresents
    Internet TV as a specific application scenario where access\nto in-netork storage
    would be required and lists a set of concrete\nrequirements that should be considered
    for the DECADE architecture\nand protocol specifications.\n\t "

  content: "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has been\nextended
    with a Leasequery capability that allows a requestor to\nrequest information about
    DHCPv4 bindings.  That mechanism is limited\nto queries for individual bindings.
    \ In some situations individual\nbinding queries may not be efficient, or even
    possible.  This\ndocument expands on the DHCPv4 Leasequery protocol to allow for
    bulk\ntransfer of DHCPv4 address binding data via TCP.\n\t "

  content: "This memo examines practical problems in the use of the ICANN generic\ntop-level
    domains, in particular that they fail to provide a stable\nnamespace that is required
    by some protocols.  The practical problems\nare traced to underlying problems
    in domain name allocation policy in\nthose domains.  Possible solutions to the
    problem are discussed,\nincluding the possibility of a new top-level domain to
    be managed in\naccordance with IANA assigned-numbers principles.\n\t "

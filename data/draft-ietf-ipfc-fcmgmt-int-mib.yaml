  content: "The goal of this document is to fill in missing pieces necessary\nto enable
    an enterprise class storage network. One of the more\nimportant features of an
    enterprise class storage network is\nmanagement; this document gives a framework
    MIB that will provide\nan integrated management environment for the enterprise
    customer.\nAn enterprise class storage network is comprised of elements\n(i.e.,
    hubs, switches, converters, gateways, and HBAs) that are\ndeveloped by many different
    vendors. The large number of vendors\nthat can exist in a storage network makes
    mangement a very hard\nand complicated problem. The main goal of this document's
    MIB is\nto enable interoperability among the various vendors involved in\nthe
    Fibre Channel marketplace.\n\t "

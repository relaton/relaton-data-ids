  content: " IPv6 transition is becoming an important research topic recently.  In\n
    \  traditional architecture, transition mechanisms are closely connected\n   with
    application, protocol stack, and network equipments.  This makes\n   the transition
    process very complicated, and increases the difficulty\n   of network management.
    \ In this document, we present a new network\n   architecture called Univer6.
    \ It uses IPv6 as a unified middle\n   layer,thus can adapt to various kinds of
    applications and network\n   equipments.  Univer6 will help provide a smooth transition
    towards\n   IPv6, simplify network management process, and accelerate the\n   development
    of IPv6.\n\n\t "

  content: "Users that need to connect to their enterprise network from an\nuntrusted
    network require secure connectivity and mobility.\nEnterprise users are increasingly
    using mobile nodes.  A user may\nneed to connect to the enterprise network from
    anywhere, and in a\nnumber of scenarios, from untrusted networks.  There are existing\nspecifications
    developed by the Mobile IPv4 working group that\ndescribe solutions for enterprise
    secure connectivity and mobility.\nThis document proposes optimizations to those
    solutions to reduce the\ntunneling overhead and allow for a number of new access
    modes.\n\t "

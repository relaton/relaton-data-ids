  content: "\n   Tunnel Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement to the Softwire feature.\n
    \  Defining a dynamic tunnel endpoint map allows you to be able to\n   dynamically
    determine a Tunnel Broker peer; however, only the\n   receiving client has this
    ability.  This document frets out the\n   problem scope as well as the motivation
    for specifying such a feature\n   within the Softwire protocol.\n\n\t "

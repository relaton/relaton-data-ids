  content: "In this document, we identify requirements for supporting the \ntraffic
    engineering of IP networks.  Requirements for traffic \nmeasurement in service
    provider environments are presented and \njustified, and related issues are discussed.
    \nHighlights of requirements are: \n1. To aid network dimensioning, mechanisms
    to collect node-pair-\nbased traffic data are required to facilitate the derivation
    of per-\nservice-class traffic matrix statistics.  \n2. For service assurance,
    the use of higher-order statistics is \nrequired. \n3. To preserve representative
    traffic detail at manageable sample \nvolumes, packet-sampled measurements are
    required. \n4. To manage large volumes of measured data, use of bulk transfer
    \nand filtering/aggregation mechanisms are required.\n\t "

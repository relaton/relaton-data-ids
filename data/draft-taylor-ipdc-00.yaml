  script: Latn
  content: "   The protocol described in this document provides the basis for the
    IP\n   Device  Control  (IPDC)  family of protocols.  The IPDC protocols are\n
    \  proposed as a  protocol  suite,  components  of  which  can  be  used\n   individually
    \  or  together  to  perform  connection  control,  media\n   control, and signaling
    transport for environments where  the  service\n   control logic is separated
    from the network access server. Please see\n   the references section for other
    IPDC documents.\n \n   According to the framework provided by Cuervo et  al  [1],
    \ the  IPDC\n   protocol  suite operates between the Media Gateway Controller
    and the\n   Media Gateway.  In terms of previous contributions to the experts
    \ of\n   Questions  13-14/16,  the corresponding entities are the Call Control\n
    \  and Media Control portions of the H.323 Gateway.   The  operation  of\n   IPDC
    in the service of H.323 is clarified in a companion contribution\n   entitled
    'IPDC Architectural Framework' [3].\n\n\t "

  content: "Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) as definied by [1] is a high security cryptographic
    software application for MSDOS, Unix, VAX/VMS, MacOS and other operating systems.
    \                                                  There is a need to store public
    PGPkeys in the X.500 [2,3] Directory as a means to ease the publication of public
    keys, and thereby the use of PGP as a cryptographic system.                                                 This
    document builds on the experimentation to date and defines four new attribute
    types and an auxiliary object class to allow PGP keys to be included in X.500
    Directory entries in a standard way.                     It is intended that the
    schema elements defined in this document will be progressed according to the process
    defined by the Internet X.500 Schema Working Group [4].\n\t "

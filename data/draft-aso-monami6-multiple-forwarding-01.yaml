  content: "This document considers a mobile terminal with multiple interfaces\nwhich
    uses Mobile IPv6[1].  With multiple interfaces, the mobile\nterminal may use them
    simultaneously for communication with a peer\ndevice.  Hence enabling the mobile
    terminal to achieve fault\ntolerance, load balancing and so on.  This document
    deals with the\nmobile terminal with multiple interfaces, so it is possible that
    each\nkind/type of interface may have its own characteristics or\ndifferences.\n\nIn
    particular, we take a closer look at the path between mobile\nterminal and its
    home agent.  In the case when the mobile terminal\nhas multiple interfaces, there
    exists several paths to the home\nagent.  A general approach would be to first
    take a look at effective\nuse of the multiple interfaces from a pure Mobile IPv6
    perspective.\nAs a matter of course, RFC3775 is used as the basic reference with\nwhich
    we consider the multiple interfaced mobile terminal operating\nin a Mobile IPv6
    environment.\n\t "

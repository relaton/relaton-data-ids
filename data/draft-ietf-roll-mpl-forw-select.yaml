  content: "   This document describes a Forwarder Selection (MPLFS) protocol for\n
    \  the Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and lossy Networks (MPL) to\n   reduce
    the density of forwarders such that the number of forwarded\n   messages is reduced.\n\n
    \  The protocol uses Trickle to distribute link-local information about\n   the
    identity of the neighbours of the nodes that have MPL-enabled\n   interfaces.
    \ In the end-state all nodes are connected to a minimum\n   number, N_DUPLICATE,
    of forwarders, where N_DUPLICATE is application\n   dependent, and there is a
    path between any two forwarders.\n\n\t "

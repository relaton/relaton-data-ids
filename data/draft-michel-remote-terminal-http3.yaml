  content: "   The secure shell (SSH) traditionally offers its secure services over\n
    \  an insecure network using the TCP transport protocol.  This document\n   defines
    mechanisms to access remote terminals by running the SSH\n   Connection protocol
    over HTTP/3 using Extended CONNECT.  Remote\n   terminals over HTTP/3 enables
    additional benefits such as the\n   scalability offered by HTTP multiplexing,
    relying on TLS for secure\n   channel establishment leveraging X.509 certificates,
    HTTP\n   Authentication schemes for client and server authentication, UDP port\n
    \  forwarding and stronger resilience against packet injection attacks\n   and
    middlebox interference.\n\n\t "

  content: "   [I-D.practices] lists operator practices related to securing\n   networks.
    \ This document lists filtering capabilities needed to\n   support those practices.\n\n
    \  Capabilities are defined without reference to specific technologies.\n   This
    is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that\n   implement the
    capability.  Each capability cites the practices it\n   supports.  Current implementations
    that support the capability are\n   cited.  Special considerations are discussed
    as appropriate listing\n   operational and resource constraints, limitations of
    current\n   implementations, tradeoffs, etc.\n\t "

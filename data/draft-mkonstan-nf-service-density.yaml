  content: "   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) system designers and operators\n
    \  continuously grapple with the problem of qualifying performance of\n   network
    services realised with software Network Functions (NF)\n   running on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf
    (COTS) servers.  One of the main\n   challenges is getting repeatable and portable
    benchmarking results\n   and using them to derive deterministic operating range
    that is\n   production deployment worthy.\n\n   This document specifies benchmarking
    methodology for NFV services\n   that aims to address this problem space.  It
    defines a way for\n   measuring performance of multiple NFV service instances,
    each\n   composed of multiple software NFs, and running them at a varied\n   service
    \"packing\" density on a single server.\n\n   The aim is to discover deterministic
    usage range of NFV system.  In\n   addition specified methodology can be used
    to compare and contrast\n   different NFV virtualization technologies.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document discussed issues and requirements for a profile of the \nIMAP
    4, message submission, and notification protocols for use by \ntelephone user
    interfaces delivering the traditional voice mail user \nexperience.  Experience
    with IMAP 4 and voice mail systems has shown \nquite a few limitations that may
    be addressed by protocol extensions and \nstandardized conventions between clients
    and servers.\n\t "

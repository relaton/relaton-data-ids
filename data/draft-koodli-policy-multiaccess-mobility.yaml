  content: "   The mobile nodes are increasingly capable of simultaneous multi-radio\n
    \  connectivity.  This allows them to be attached to the Internet\n   through
    multiple access technologies at the same time.  With such\n   multi-access, the
    mobile node (MN) can make use of the best-available\n   access technology for
    a particular application at any given time.\n   And, the network may be able to
    balance the flow of traffic across\n   the available access technologies.  The
    Mobile IPv6 flow binding work\n   provides a mechanism for the MN to signal the
    Home Agent to balance\n   the flows based on the MN'e needs.  This document specifies
    a simple\n   protocol for a mobile IP gateway (such as a Mobile IP Home Agent
    or a\n   Proxy Mobile IP Local Mobility Anchor) to signal the MN of gateway's\n
    \  policy for traffic treatment across access technologies.  Based on\n   the
    response and the prevailing network conditions, the gateway then\n   balances
    the traffic.\n\n\t "

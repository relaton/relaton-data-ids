  content: "Several RFCs define all of the standards having to do with the format,
    transfer and management of E-mail and messages.  So many are out there that it
    is often difficult to find out where a specific item is.  This memo is an attempt
    to give the reader a general overview of the material and to show where to look
    for particular information on mail and messaging standards.\n\t "

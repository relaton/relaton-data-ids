  content: "In developing a solution for CDN Internetworking it is necessary to\ndefine
    and accommodate requirements for Authentication,\nAuthorization, and Accounting.
    \ Since the Authentication,\nAuthorization, and Accounting (AAA) working group
    is already focused\non defining these requirements, this document attempts to
    leverage\nthat work.  It contains the requirements that would have to be\nsupported
    by a AAA service to formulate a solution for CDN peering.\n\n\t "

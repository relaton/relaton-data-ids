abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure is its\naddressing
    plan.  With its new address architecture and allocation\npolicies, the introduction
    of IPv6 into a network means that network\ndesigners and operators need to reconsider
    their existing approaches\nto network addressing.  Lack of guideliness on handling
    this aspect\nof network design could slow down the integration of IPv6.  This\ndraft
    aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant to\nplanning the
    addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments.  The draft also\nprovides IPv6 addressing
    case studies for both an enterprise and an\nISP network.  In this first version
    of the draft we aim to provoke\ndiscussion on this important topic; more detailed
    case study texts\nwill follow.\n\t "

  content: "This memo defines a new suboption of the DHCP relay agent information\noption
    that allows the DHCP relay to specify flags for the forwarded\npacket.  One flag
    is defined to indicate whether the DHCP relay\nreceived the packet via a unicast
    or broadcast packet.  This\ninformation may be used by the DHCP server to better
    serve clients\nbased on whether their request was originally broadcast or unicast.\n\t "

  content: "In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), as also in IEEE Bridged \nNetworks,
    the switches simply flood multicast traffic on all ports in \nthe LAN by default.
    Multicast Snooping can be used to avoid the \nunnecessary flooding as defined
    in [MAGMA-SNOOP] and [PIM-SNOOP]. \n    \nWhen the number of Pseudo Wires (PWs)
    and refresh messages increases \ndramatically, it is desirable to reduce the messages
    exchanged between \nVPLS PE routers to improve scalability. This document describes
    the \nprocedures and recommendations for using LDP for distributing Multicast
    state information between VPLS PE routers.  \n\n\t "

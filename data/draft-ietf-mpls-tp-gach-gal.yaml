  content: "This document generalizes the applicability of the pseudowire (PW) Associated
    Channel Header (ACH), enabling the realization of a control channel associated
    to MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and MPLS Sections in addition to MPLS pseudowires.
    \ In order to identify the presence of this Associated Channel Header in the label
    stack, this document also assigns one of the reserved MPLS label values to the
    Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL), to be used as a label based exception
    mechanism.\n\t "

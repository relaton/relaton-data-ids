  content: "Routing protocols that have been designed to run within a single\nadministrative
    domain (\"IGPs\") generally do so by assigning a metric\nto each link, and then
    choosing as the installed path between two\nnodes the path for which the total
    distance (sum of the metric of\neach link along the path) is minimized.  BGP,
    designed to provide\nrouting over a large number of independent administrative
    domains\n(\"autonomous systems\"), does not make its path selection decisions\nthrough
    the use of a metric.  It is generally recognized that any\nattempt to do so would
    incur significant scalability problems, as\nwell as inter-administration coordination
    problems.  However, there\nare deployments in which a single administration runs
    several\ncontiguous BGP networks.  In such cases, it can be desirable, within\nthat
    single administrative domain, for BGP to select paths based on a\nmetric, just
    as an IGP would do.  The purpose of this document is to\nprovide a specification
    for doing so.\n\t "

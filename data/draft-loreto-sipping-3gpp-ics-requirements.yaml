  content: "The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is developing the\ncapability
    to support different communication services on IP\nMultimedia Subsystem (IMS)
    as a SIP infrastructure, such as push-to-\ntalk over cellular (PoC), Multimedia
    Telephony or IMS messaging.  As\nthere are different services and is not safe
    to rely on the expressed\nmedia as a means to identify the requested communication
    service\nbecause the media may be used in different communication services,\nthen
    there is the need to have an unambiguous way of identifying\ncommunication services
    and applications utilizing the logic of\ncommunication services as explicitly
    as possible.  In this document,\nwe express the requirements identified by 3GPP
    to support the\nidentification of communication services and applications on a\nSession
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) infrastructure and IMS applications\nusing them.\n\t "

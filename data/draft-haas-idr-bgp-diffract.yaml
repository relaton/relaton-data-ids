  content: "   \"BGP Routes with Color\" have become a topic of interest in the IDR\n
    \  Working Group.  The authors of the various proposals have many things\n   in
    mind to solve with them, how a color might be used, and the\n   operational model
    for their solution.  In general, the solutions\n   share some core properties:
    Routes for an IP endpoint, that have a\n   domain-wide semantic element to differentiate
    forwarding (often\n   called a color), and appropriate state to enable that differentiated\n
    \  forwarding.\n\n   Examples of the technologies enabling differentiated forwarding\n
    \  include MPLS and Segment Routing.\n\n   This document examines two of the current
    proposals - BGP Color-Aware\n   Routing, and BGP Classful Transport - and proposes
    mechanisms to\n   permit them to interoperate.\n\n\t "

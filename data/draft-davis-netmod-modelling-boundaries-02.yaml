  content: "   Current modelling techniques appear to have boundaries that make\n
    \  representation of some concepts in modern problems, such as intent\n   and
    capability, challenging.  The concepts all have in common the\n   need to represent
    uncertainty and vagueness.  The challenge results\n   from the rigidity of boundary
    representation, including the\n   absoluteness of instance value and the process
    of classification\n   itself, provided by current techniques.\n\n   When describing
    solutions, a softer approach seems necessary where\n   the emphasis is on the
    focus on a particular thing from a particular\n   perspective.  Intelligent control
    (use of AI/ML etc.) could take\n   advantage of partial compatibilities etc. if
    a softer representation\n   was achieved.\n\n   The solution representation appears
    to require\n\n   *  Expression of range, preference and focus as a fundamental
    part of\n\t "

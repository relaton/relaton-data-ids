  content: "   Confidential Computing is the protection of data in use by performing\n
    \  computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment.\n   Especially
    in virtualization environments, confidential computing\n   could protect data
    and applications from access or tampering by\n   hypervisor or other privileged
    users.  In Computing-Aware network,\n   computing resource is an essential element
    to provide computing\n   services for network users' applications.  Introducing
    confidential\n   computing in Computing-Aware network could mitigate the distrust
    of\n   computing resource efficiently.  This document provides the\n   architecture
    of confidential computing in Computing-Aware network\n   management plane to provide
    confidentiality and integrity for\n   applications.\n\n\t "

  content: "   [RFC4778] lists operator practices related to securing networks.\n
    \  This document lists filtering and rate limiting capabilities needed\n   to
    support those practices.  Capabilities are limited to filtering\n   and rate limiting
    packets as they enter or leave the device.  Route\n   filters and service specific
    filters (e.g.  SNMP, telnet) are not\n   addressed.\n\n   Capabilities are defined
    without reference to specific technologies.\n   This is done to leave room for
    deployment of new technologies that\n   implement the capability.  Each capability
    cites the practices it\n   supports.  Current implementations that support the
    capability are\n   cited.  Special considerations are discussed as appropriate
    listing\n   operational and resource constraints, limitations of current\n   implementations,
    trade-offs, etc.\n\n\t "

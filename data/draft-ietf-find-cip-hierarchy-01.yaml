abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This work explores what, in the parlance of the current CIP draft, is
    called an index type -- specifically, a new kind of index that merges indexing
    of  hierarchically named attribute-value entities (such as in LDAP and RWHOIS)
    and ones without distinguished names (such as in WHOIS++). It is based on a previous
    version of the CIP specification, but that was just a convenient syntactical jumping
    off point. It is intended to be orthogonal to the FIND working group task of  defining
    a framing syntax and functionality for a common indexing data wrapping protocol,
    and that the concepts and protocol elements in this draft should be able to be
    expressed in a manner consistent with the new CIP framework at the appropriate
    time.\n\t "

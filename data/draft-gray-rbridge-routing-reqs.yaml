  content: "   RBridges provide the ability to have an entire campus, with multiple
    \n   physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows \n   for
    zero configuration of switches within a campus, optimal pair-wise \n   routing,
    safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and \n   the ability to
    cut down on ARP/ND traffic. The design supports VLANs,\n   allows forwarding tables
    to be based on RBridge destinations (rather \n   than endnode destinations, allowing
    internal forwarding tables to be \n   smaller than in conventional bridge systems)
    and re-uses existing \n   routing protocols (for - at least - distribution of
    reachability of\n   destinations and shortest path computation within a campus).
    \n\n   In order to accomplish this, the design may impose requirements for\n   extensions
    to existing routing protocols necessary to accomplish the\n   distribution and
    computation processes, as well as specific limits on\n   interactions between
    bridge, R-Bridge and Router instances.\n\t "

  content: "   Kerberos is widely used for authentication within organisations.  It\n
    \  is not, however, commonly used for authentication between domains or\n   realms
    (\"cross-realm operation\").  Abfab is a new architecture, based\n   on the AAA
    framework, that provides a mechanism for federating\n   authentication between
    realms.\n\n   AAA protocols are already widely used for federating authentication\n
    \  for network access scenarios today.  It has been proposed that Abfab\n   could
    be used to provide a mechanism yielding cross-realm\n   functionality for Kerberos.
    \ This document discusses two alternative\n   models with the aim of informing
    and facilitating discussion.\n\n\t "

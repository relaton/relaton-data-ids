  content: "   RFC 6790 defined the Entropy Label Capability Attribute (ELC); RFC\n
    \  7447 deprecated that attribute.  This specification, dubbed \"Entropy\n   Label
    Capability Attribute version 2\" (ELCv2), was intended to be\n   offered for standardization,
    to replace the ELC as a way to signal\n   that a BGP protocol speaker is capable
    of processing entropy labels.\n\n   Although ultimately a different specification
    was chosen for that\n   purpose, at least one implementation of ELCv2 was shipped
    by Juniper\n   Networks and is currently in use in service provider networks.
    \ This\n   document is published in order to document what was implemented.\n\n\t "

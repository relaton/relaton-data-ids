  content: "   This document describes the Service Orchestration Protocol (SOP)\n
    \  message flows for some important service orchestration scenarios. The\n   flows
    contain complete packet information including both SOP and\n   Service Description
    Framework (SDF) payloads. The message flows in\n   this document are by no means
    exhaustive, but they carry sufficient\n   information using which other flows
    can be easily constructed. The\n   deployment scenarios for services are varied,
    and it is not possible\n   to cover every possible scenario. Nevertheless, those
    flows will\n   follow closely the information given in this document.\n\n\t "

  content: "This is a 'de facto IMPP charter' to accompany the IMPP submissions to\nthe
    IESG. Such an arrangement is not ordinarily part of the IETF\nprocess, but appears
    to be the most effective means of providing\nnecessary context to the IESG as
    it considers the IMPP documents. The\nfirst part of this document describes the
    circumstances that have led\nto this unusual de facto charter.  The second part
    describes the IMPP\ncharter as it has been understood by the current chairs.\n\n\t "

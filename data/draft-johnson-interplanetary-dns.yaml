  content: "   As human activity continues to spread beyond the Earth, so must the\n
    \  communications systems which support that activity continue to expand\n   in
    scope.  One such case, Internet naming, presents particular\n   challenges when
    considering a multi-planet civilization.  Proper\n   operation of terrestrial
    DNS services and clients require constant,\n   reasonably low latency connectivity
    to operate properly.  These\n   conditions are distinctly not present when considering
    interplanetary\n   links; high latency and frequent disruption due to space weather\n
    \  events and general link availability prevail.  To overcome these\n   challenges
    in space networking, a delay and distruption tolerant\n   (DTN) suite of protocols
    has been developed based on a store and\n   forward mechanism, Bundle Protocol(BP).
    \ This DTN network, which\n   optimizes to ensure bundle delivery, does not allow
    for end to end\n   encapsulation of IP packets beyond terrestrial boundaries,
    as the\n   latency still creates issues completing network transactions, even
    in\n   the unlikely event of continuous link availability.\n\n\t "

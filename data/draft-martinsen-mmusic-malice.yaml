  content: "   It can be useful for applications to provide flow metadata\n   information
    to on-path devices to influence flow treatment in the\n   network.  Provided that
    the network is able to provide useful\n   feedback, this can also influence path
    selection if an application\n   have multiple flow paths to choose from.\n\n   This
    draft describes how this can be achieved by adding metadata to\n   the STUN packets
    sent during the ICE connectivity checks or a\n   slightly modified version of
    the keep-alive mechanism.  Devices on\n   the media path can use the metadata
    information to prioritize the\n   flow, perform traffic engineering, or provide
    network analytics and\n   notifications as requested by the endpoints.  On-path
    devices can\n   append or modify the existing metadata information in the STUN/ICE\n
    \  messages to enable feedback to other on-path devices or the\n   applications
    in both ends of the media session.\n\n   This document describes a framework mechanism
    for how such metadata\n   can be transported by STUN when ICE is in use and it
    covers the\n   endpoint and on path device processing.  The functionality described\n
    \  here is referred to as MALICE.\n\n\n\t "

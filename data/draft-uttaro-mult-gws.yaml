  content: "This document presents an application of the BGP community\nattribute
    in simplifying the implementation and configuration\nof routing policies between
    two or more VPN service providers.\nIt is assumed that RFC2547 has been implemented
    to provide the\nVPN service although this is not a requirement of this application\nIt
    shows how use of the community attribute along with the setting\nof a BGP metric
    can be used by customers to select the best gateway\nbetween one or more VPN service
    providers. This technique simplifies\nconfiguration and management at the provider
    level, and gives the\ncustomer the ability to control its own routing policy with
    respect\nto the selection of gateways between service providers. \n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental protocol named the Available
    Session Recovery Protocol (ASRP). The protocol is designed to optimize high-availability
    network cluster architectures, providing a superior high-availability solution
    for clusters offering stateful network services such as load balancing and Network
    Address Translation (NAT [RFC4787]). ASRP defines the procedures for session backup
    and recovery, as well as the message formats used during these interactions, enabling
    efficient and streamlined session state management. In contrast to traditional
    high-availability techniques that back up session state within the cluster itself,
    the core innovation of ASRP lies in its distributed backup of state information
    to the client or server side. This approach offers multiple advantages: it significantly
    enhances the cluster's elastic scaling capabilities; supports rapid recovery from
    single-point or even multi-point failures; reduces resource redundancy by eliminating
    centralized backup nodes; and substantially simplifies the implementation complexity
    of the cluster. The ASRP protocol provides exceptional elastic scalability for
    network clusters, facilitating the implementation and deployment of large-scale
    elastic network clusters.</p>"

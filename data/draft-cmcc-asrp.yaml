abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental protocol named the Available
    Session Recovery Protocol (ASRP). The protocol aims to optimize high-availability
    network cluster architectures, providing a superior cluster high-availability
    solution for stateful network services such as load balancing and Network Address
    Translation (NAT). ASRP defines the procedures for session backup and recovery,
    along with the message formats used in interactions, enabling efficient and streamlined
    session state management. Unlike traditional high-availability technologies that
    back up session states within the cluster, the core innovation of ASRP lies in
    distributing state information to clients or servers. This approach offers multiple
    advantages, significantly enhancing the cluster's elastic scaling capability;
    supporting rapid recovery from single-point or even multi-point failures; reducing
    resource redundancy by eliminating centralized backup nodes; and substantially
    simplifying cluster implementation complexity. The ASRP protocol provides network
    clusters with ultimate elastic scalability, facilitating the implementation and
    deployment of large- scale elastic network clusters.</p>"

  content: "   Network access servers are increasingly capable of providing user and\n
    \  device location information to AAA servers. This enables the AAA\n   server
    to make additional authorization decisions based on the\n   location of the user
    or access device. The home or visited network\n   may also use the location information
    for other purposes (e.g.,\n   acting as a location server). This document provides
    guidelines for\n   the encoding and transport of location information using the
    RADIUS\n   protocol which are compliant with the Geopriv requirements for\n   security
    and privacy.\n\t "

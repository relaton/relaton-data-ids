  content: "   As the Internet has grown, many services with high availability\n   requirements
    have emerged.  The requirements of these services have\n   increased the demands
    on the reliability of the infrastructure on\n   which those services rely.\n\n\n
    \  Many techniques have been employed to increase the availability of\n   services
    deployed on the Internet.  This document presents\n   operational experience of
    wide-scale service distribution using\n   anycast, and proposes a series of recommendations
    for others using\n   this approach.\n\t "

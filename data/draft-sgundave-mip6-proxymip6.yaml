  content: "   Host based IPv6 mobility is specified in Mobile IPv6 base\n   specification
    [RFC3775].  In that model, the mobile node is\n   responsible for doing the signaling
    to its home agent to enable\n   session continuity as it moves between subnets.
    \ The design principle\n   in the case of host-based mobility relies on the mobile
    node being in\n   control of the mobility management.  Network based mobility
    allows IP\n   session continuity for a mobile node without its involvement in\n
    \  mobility management.  This specification describes a protocol\n   solution
    for network based mobility management that relies on Mobile\n   IPv6 signaling
    and reuse of home agent functionality.  A proxy\n   mobility agent in the network
    which manages the mobility for a mobile\n   node is the reason for referring to
    this protocol as Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6.\n\n\t "

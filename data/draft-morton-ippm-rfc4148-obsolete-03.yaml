  content: "This memo reclassifies RFC 4148, \"IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics
    Registry\", as Obsolete, and withdraws the IANA IPPM Metrics Registry itself from
    use because it is obsolete.  The current registry structure has been found to
    be insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM metrics.  Despite apparent
    efforts to find current or even future users, no one responded to the call for
    interest in the RFC 4148 registry during the second half of 2010.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

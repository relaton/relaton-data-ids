  content: "   There are requirements for the support of networks ccomprising LSRs
    \n   with different data plane switching layers controlled by a single \n   Generalized
    Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane \n   instance, referred to
    as GMPLS Multi-Layer Networks/Multi-Region \n   Networks (MLN/MRN). This document
    defines extensions to GMPLS routing \n   and signaling protocols so as to support
    the operation of GMPLS \n   Multi-Layer/Multi-Region Networks. \n\n\t "

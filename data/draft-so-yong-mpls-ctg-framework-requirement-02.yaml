abstract:
- content: "<p>This document states a traffic distribution problem in today's IP/MPLS
    network when multiple links are configured between two routers. The document presents
    motivation, a framework and requirements. It defines a composite link as a group
    of parallel links that can be considered as a single traffic engineering link
    or as an IP link, and used for MPLS. The document primarily focuses on MPLS traffic
    controlled through control plane protocols, the advertisement of composite link
    parameter in routing protocols, and the use of composite links in the RSVP-TE
    and LDP signaling protocols. Interactions with the data and management plane are
    also addressed. Applicability can be between a single pair of MPLS- capable nodes,
    a sequence of MPLS-capable nodes, or a multi-layer network connecting MPLS-capable
    nodes.</p>"

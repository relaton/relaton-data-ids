  content: "   As multiple organizations interconnect their networks through peering\n
    \  agreements, it is desirable to preserve the services enabled by a\n   LISP
    overlay over such interconnection of independent networks.  This\n   specification
    documents the requirements imposed by the deployment\n   scenario in which multiple
    organizations federate their backbones\n   with the objective of running a LISP
    overlay to enable services such\n   as mobility or VPNs.  The requirements for
    policies, enforcement and\n   authoritative control of network assets are captured
    from the\n   perspective of the operator.\n\n\n\t "

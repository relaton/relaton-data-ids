abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies ASL (Authenticated Secure Layer), a cryptographic
    protocol for establishing an authenticated and encrypted communication session
    based on a novel arithmetic primitive called phi-ns-x (also known as ns-mod).
    ASL provides a complete handshake and data transport layer without reliance on
    traditional algorithms like RSA, Diffie-Hellman, AES or SHA. Instead, it builds
    on the Phi-Ns cryptosystem, which defines a structured quadratic relation between
    primes and achieves security through non-linear modular arithmetic and combinatorial
    complexity. ASL includes an initial authentication and key exchange mechanism
    where a server public key (composed only of specific allowed elements such as
    a prime modulus and state parameters) is used by a client to establish shared
    secrets. The protocol uses a stateful encryption transform (phi-ns-x) for data,
    with each message round incorporating a public state value that changes unpredictably.
    Shared secret parameters control this state evolution, preventing man-in-the-middle
    and injection attacks by ensuring that only parties with knowledge of the secrets
    can produce valid ciphertexts.</p>"

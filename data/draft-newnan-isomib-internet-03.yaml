abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document provides heuristic procedures that translate managed object
    specifications from ISO/CCITT Guidelines for Definition of Managed Object (GDMO)
    templates to Internet MIB macros.  Currently, some market segments demand SNMP
    for customer network management, while others require the ISO/CCITT Common Management
    Information Protocol (CMIP).  The approach defined in this document accommodates
    both, protecting investment already made in management information specifications
    and minimizing cost to implement a second protocol where the market requires.
    \ This translation is designed to: lose as little functionality as possible in
    translation; minimize need for human involvement during translation; minimize
    the cost of dual protocol and proxy-based implementations; and support generic
    network models which span many computer platforms and network elements.  This
    document is intended to encourage standardization of such an approach and promote
    consistent usage of MIB definitions, independent of protocol.\n\t "

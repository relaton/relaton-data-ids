  content: "In the core of a high capacity network, service differentiation is\n   still
    needed to support applications' utilization of the network.\n   Applications with
    similar traffic characteristics and performance\n   requirements are mapped into
    different diffserv service classes based\n   on end-to-end behavior requirements
    of the applications.  However,\n   some network segments may be configured in
    such a way that a single\n   forwarding treatment satisfy the traffic characteristics
    and\n   performance requirements of two or more service classes.  For such\n   cases,
    it may be desirable to aggregate two or more service classes\n   into a forwarding
    treatment.  This document provides guidelines for\n   aggregation of service classes
    into forwarding treatments.\n\t "

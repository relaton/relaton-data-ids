abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies how to run hybrid key exchange with ECDHE and
    Scloud+ in Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3 (TLS 1.3) to mitigate
    quantum threats. Scloud+ is an unstructured lattice based KEM with post-quantum
    security. This draft follows the post- quantum hybrid key exchange framework specified
    by [TLS.Hybrid], by concatenating the public keys and ciphertexts of ECDHE and
    Scloud+. [EDNOTE:... ]</p>"

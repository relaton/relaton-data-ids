abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the design of the native cyberspace map which is
    stable and flexible to describe cyberspace. Although we have accepted the cyberspace
    as a parallel new world, we even have not defined its basic coordinate system,
    which means cyberspace have no its basic space dimension till now. The objective
    of this draft is to illustrate the basic design methodology of the native coordinate
    system of cyberspace, and show how to design cyberspace map on this basis.</p>"

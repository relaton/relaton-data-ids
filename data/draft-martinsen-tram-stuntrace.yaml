  content: "   After a UDP protocol such as RTP determines a network path is\n   experiencing
    problems, a traceroute is often useful to determine\n   which router or which
    link is contributing to the problem.  However,\n   operating system traceroute
    commands follow a different path than the\n   actual UDP flow which complicates
    troubleshooting.  A superior method\n   is shown which is absolutely path-congruent
    with the UDP protocol\n   itself, works on IPv4 and IPv6, and does not require
    administrative\n   privileges on most operating systems.\n\n\t "

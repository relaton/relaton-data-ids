  content: "Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to ensure
    reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion along
    a network path).  While many mechanisms have been designed to detect loss, ultimately,
    protocols can only count on the passage of time without delivery confirmation
    to declare a packet \"lost\".  Each implementation of a time-based loss detection
    mechanism represents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore,
    no implementation suits all situations.  This document provides high-level requirements
    for time-based loss detectors appropriate for general use in unicast communication
    across the Internet.  Within the requirements, implementations have latitude to
    define particulars that best address each situation.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a new type of long-range, low-rate radio\n   technologies
    and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks\n   based on CoAP.  The
    emerging Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWA)\n   present a particular set of constraints,
    which places them at the\n   intersection of infrastructure networks, ultra-dense
    networks, delay-\n   tolerant networks and low-power and lossy networks.  The
    main\n   objectives of LPWA signaling is to minimize the number of exchanged\n
    \  messages, minimize the size of each message in a secure and\n   extensible
    manner, all with keeping the fundamental principle of\n   technology-independence
    (L2-independence).  This document describes\n   the use of the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) as the main\n   signaling protocol for LPWA, over which minimal
    messages are\n   exchanged allowing the full operation of the network, such as\n
    \  authentication, authorization, and management.  The use of CoAP\n   signaling
    provides a generic mechanism that can be applied to\n   different LPWA technologies.\n\n\t "

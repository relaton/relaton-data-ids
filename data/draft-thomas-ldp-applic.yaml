  content: "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for forwarding\npackets
    that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets,\ncalled labels, to determine
    packet nexthops ([MPLS-FRAMEWORK],\n[MPLS-ARCH]).  A fundamental concept in MPLS
    is that two Label\nSwitching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels
    used\nto forward traffic between and through them.  This common\nunderstanding
    is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a\nlabel distribution protocol,
    by which one LSR informs another of\nlabel bindings it has made.  This document
    describes the\napplicability of a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label\nDistribution
    Protocol) [LDP].\n\n\t "

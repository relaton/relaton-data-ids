abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "With operating systems appearing in more and more devices, as well\nas
    computers appearing in more and more aspects of everyday life,\ncommunication
    between networked devices is increasingly important.\nThe communication mechanism
    between these devices must be able to\nnot only support the office LAN environment,
    but must also scale to\nlarger WANS and the internet.\n\nThis draft describes
    a method by which a host may automatically give\nitself a link-local IPv4 address,
    so that it will be able to use IP\napplications in the absence of an IP address
    management mechanism,\nsuch as DHCP.  This mechanism is in use today by a few
    operating\nsystems, and additional information on those implementations is also\nprovided.\n\t "

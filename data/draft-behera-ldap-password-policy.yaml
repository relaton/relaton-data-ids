  content: "   Password policy as described in this document is a set of rules that\n
    \  controls how passwords are used and administered in Lightweight\n   Directory
    Access Protocol (LDAP) based directories.  In order to\n   improve the security
    of LDAP directories and make it difficult for\n   password cracking programs to
    break into directories, it is desirable\n   to enforce a set of rules on password
    usage.  These rules are made to\n   ensure that users change their passwords periodically,
    passwords meet\n   construction requirements, the re-use of old password is restricted,\n
    \  and to deter password guessing attacks.\n\n\t "

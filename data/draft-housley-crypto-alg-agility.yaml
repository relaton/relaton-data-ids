  content: "   Many IETF protocols may use of cryptographic algorithms to provide\n
    \  confidentiality, integrity, or non-repudiation.  Communicating peers\n   must
    support the same cryptographic algorithm or algorithms for these\n   mechanisms
    to work properly.  This memo provides guidelines for\n   ensuring that such a
    protocol has the ability to migrate from one\n   algorithm to another over time.\n\n\t "

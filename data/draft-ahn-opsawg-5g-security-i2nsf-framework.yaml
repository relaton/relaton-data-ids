  content: "   This document presents an integrated framework for automated security\n
    \  management in 5G edge networks using the Interface to Network\n   Security
    Functions (I2NSF) architecture.  The proposed system\n   leverages Intent-Based
    Networking (IBN) to allow users or\n   administrators to declare high-level security
    intents, which are then\n   translated into enforceable network and application
    policies.\n   Network-level policies are delivered to 5G core components via the\n
    \  Network Exposure Function (NEF), while application-level policies are\n   enforced
    directly at user equipment through distributed IBN\n   Controllers.  This architecture
    supports adaptive, context-aware, and\n   distributed policy enforcement, enabling
    real-time response to\n   dynamic edge conditions and user mobility scenarios
    such as\n   handovers.  By integrating closed-loop monitoring and analytics, the\n
    \  system ensures consistent and autonomous security across\n   heterogeneous
    5G environments.\n\n\t "

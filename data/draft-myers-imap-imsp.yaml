  content: "The Internet Message Support Protocol (IMSP) is designed to support the
    provision of mail in a medium to large scale operation.  It is intended to be
    used as a companion to the IMAP4 protocol [IMAP4], providing services which are
    either outside the scope of mail access or which pertain to environments which
    must run more than one IMAP4 server in the same mail domain.  The services that
    IMSP provides are extended mailbox management, configuration options, and address
    books.\n\t "

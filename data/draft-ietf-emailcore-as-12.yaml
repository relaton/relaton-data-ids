  content: "   Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet applications that is\n
    \  still in very active use.  While the basic protocols and formats for\n   mail
    transport and message formats have evolved slowly over the\n   years, events and
    thinking in more recent years have supplemented\n   those core protocols with
    additional features and suggestions for\n   their use.  This Applicability Statement
    describes the relationship\n   among many of those protocols and provides guidance
    and makes\n   recommendations for the use of features of the core protocols.\n\nOpen
    Issues\n\n   *  #40 - Recommended SMTP Extensions (https://github.com/ietf-wg-\n
    \     emailcore/emailcore/issues/40): Is the new proposed text regarding\n      DSNs
    in Section 2.4 satisfactory?\n\n   *  #78 - Advice against using URL %-encoding
    on non-ASCII email\n      addresses (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/\n
    \     issues/78): Is the new proposed text in Section 4.2 satisfactory?\n\n   *

    Trace Header Fields by MUAs (https://github.com/\n      ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/84):

    mail agents should do/not do with Received header\n      fields (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/85):\n
    \     Is the proposed new text in Section 3.2.2 satisfactory?\n\n   *  #92 - CNAME
    handling in \"5.1.  Locating the Target Host\"\n      (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/92):
    Per\n      IETF 120, Klensin to propose text.\n\n   *  #93 - \"7.3.  VRFY, EXPN,

    \     Per IETF 120, Alexey to propose text or close issue.\n\n   *  #94 - Use
    of Quoted Strings (https://github.com/ietf-wg-\n      emailcore/emailcore/issues/94):
    John Levine suggests we not bother\n      with text regarding quoted strings in
    email address local-parts.\n      Is the proposed new text in Section 3.1 satisfactory?
    \ Do we want\n      another/better Received header example?\n\n\t "

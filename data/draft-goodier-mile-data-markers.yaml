  content: "   This document provides extensions to Managed Incident Lightweight\n
    \  Exchange (MILE).  MILE describes a subset of Incident Object\n   Description
    Exchange Format (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070.  The Data\n   Markers extension is
    aimed at exchanging data tags or markers that\n   label categories of information
    that have significance in the\n   exchange of incident information.  These data
    marker extension is\n   aimed at exchanging data tags or markers that label information\n
    \  exchanged during incident handling.  Data markers include sensitivity\n   and
    data handling requirements that can prevent possible criminal\n   errors in mismarking
    data.  Both network and information security\n   incidents typically result in
    the loss of service, data, and\n   resources both human and system.  Existing
    extensions to the IODEF-\n   Document Class for Reporting Phishing [RFC 5901]
    have already been\n   introduced for network security incidents.  Data markers
    introduce\n   extensions for information security incidents so that network\n
    \  providers and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) are\n   equipped
    and ready to assist in communicating and tracing security\n   incidents with tools
    and procedures in place before the occurrence of\n   an attack.  Data Markers
    also support Real-time Inter-network Defense\n   (RID) [RFC 6045] that outlines
    a proactive inter-network\n   communication method to facilitate sharing incident
    handling data\n   while integrating existing detection, tracing, source identification,\n
    \  and mitigation mechanisms for a complete incident handling solution.\n   Combining
    these capabilities in a communication system provides a way\n   to achieve higher
    security levels on networks.  Policy guidelines for\n   handling incidents are
    recommended and can be agreed upon by a\n   consortium using the security recommendations
    and considerations.\n\n\t "

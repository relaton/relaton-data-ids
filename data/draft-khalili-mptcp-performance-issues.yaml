  content: "   We show, by measurements over a testbed and by mathematical analysis,\n
    \  that the current MPTCP suffers from two problems: (P1) Upgrading some\n   TCP
    users to MPTCP can reduce the throughput of others without any\n   benefit to
    the upgraded users; and (P2) MPTCP users can be\n   excessively aggressive towards
    TCP users. We attribute these problems\n   to the \"Linked Increases\" Algorithm
    (LIA) of MPTCP [4], and more\n   specifically, to an excessive amount of traffic
    transmitted over\n   congested paths. Our results show that these problems are
    important\n   and can be mitigated. We believe that the design of the congestion\n
    \  control of MPTCP should be improved.\n\n\t "

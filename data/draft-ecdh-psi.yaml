  content: "   This document describes Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Private Set\n
    \  Intersection (ECDH-PSI).  It instantiates the classical Meadows\n   match-making
    protocol with standard elliptic curves and hash-to-curve\n   methods.  In ECDH-PSI,
    data items are encoded to points on an\n   elliptic curve, and masked by the private
    keys of both parties.\n   After collecting the mutually masked datasets from both
    parties, a\n   participant computes their intersection and outputs the corresponding\n
    \  original data items as result.\n\n\t "

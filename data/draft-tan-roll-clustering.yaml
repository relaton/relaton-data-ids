  content: "       The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
    is\n       one of the emerging routing standards for multi-hop Wireless Sensor\n
    \      Networks (WSNs). RPL is based on the construction of a Destination-\n       Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG), which offers a loop-free\n       topology to route
    data packets. But due to the tree topology, the\n       upper nodes in tree topology
    are easy to run out of energy. Moreover,\n       the hop count and ETX are the
    only route metrics for which standards\n       related to their usage in RPL are
    published. Due to the seriously\n       resource-constrained character, we take
    nodes' residual energy into\n       account. Here we present an RPL-based clustering
    scheme and detailed\n       description of Objective Function.\n\n\t "

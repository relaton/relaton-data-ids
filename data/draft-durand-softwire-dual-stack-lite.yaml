  content: "The common thinking for more than 10 years has been that the\ntransition
    to IPv6 will be based on the dual stack model and that\nmost things would be converted
    this way before we ran out of IPv4.\n\nIt has not happened.  The IANA free pool
    of IPv4 addresses will be\ndepleted soon, well before any significant IPv6 deployment
    will have\noccurred.\nThis document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces
    the dual-\nstack lite technology aimed at better aligning the costs and benefits\nof
    deploying IPv6.  Dual-stack lite will provide the necessary bridge\nbetween the
    two protocols, offering an evolution path of the Internet\npost IANA IPv4 depletion.\n\t "

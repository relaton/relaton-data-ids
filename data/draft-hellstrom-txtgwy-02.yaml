  script: Latn
  content: "IP networks can support real-time text communication.  SIP-based\nreal-
    time text is called Text-over-IP or ToIP.  PSTN networks\nsupport real-time text
    using textphones (or TTYs).  When real-time\ntext is supported by different networks,
    gateways are needed to\nprovide interoperability.  Real-time text capable gateways
    may also\nsupport real-time voice.\n\nThis specification describes procedures
    for interworking between ToIP\nand PSTN textphones using a real-time text capable
    gateway (RTT\ngateway).  It also describes ways to route calls to RTT gateways
    for\nseveral call scenarios.\n\nProcedures that support the phased introduction
    of RTT gateways and\nprocedures that support the invocation of text channels at
    any time\nduring the call are included.  Interworking of PSTN textphones that\ndo
    not support simultaneity of voice and text with IP User Agents\nthat support simultaneous
    voice and text is also described.\n\t "

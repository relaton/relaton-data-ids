  content: "According to the end to end argument, NAT function can completely and\ncorrectly
    be implemented only with the knowledge and help of end\nhosts.  By making NAT
    visible to the end hosts of NAT clients and let\nthe hosts help NAT gateways,
    NAT actually becomes correct, complete,\nand end to end transparent.  End to end
    NAT is upper compatible to\nlegacy NAT while enabling various transport protocols
    (ICMP, SCTP,\nIPSEC), DNS reverse look up, Multicast and Mobile IP.\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT) Workshop took\n
    \  place on December 4th and 5th of 2013.  The focus of the workshop was\n   on
    models to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols, with\n   particular emphasis
    at the waist of the hourglass.  This report\n   summarizes contributions and discussions.
    \ As the topics were wide\n   ranging, there is no single set of recommendations
    for IETF\n   participants to pursue at this time.  Instead, in the classic sense\n
    \  of early research, we note areas that deserve further exploration.\n\n\t "

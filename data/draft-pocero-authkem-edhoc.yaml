- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies extensions to the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman\n
    \  over COSE (EDHOC) protocol to provide resistance against quantum\n   computer
    adversaries by incorporating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)\n   mechanisms for
    both key exchange and authentication.  It defines a\n   Key Encapsulation Mechanism
    (KEM)-based authentication method to\n   enable signature-free post-quantum authentication
    when PQC KEMs, such\n   as NIST-standardized ML-KEM, are used.  The document further\n
    \  describes scenarios where both parties employ KEM-based\n   authentication,
    as well as cases where authentication methods are\n   combined, with one party
    using KEM-based authentication and the other\n   relying on a PQC signature scheme.\n\n\t "

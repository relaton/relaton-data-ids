  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo proposes a mechanism called \"guaranteed Latency Based\n
    \  Forwarding\" (gLBF) as part of DetNet for hop-by-hop packet forwarding\n   with
    per-hop deterministically bounded latency and minimal jitter.\n\n   gLBF is intended
    to be useful across a wide range of networks and\n   applications with need for
    high-precision deterministic networking\n   services, including in-car networks
    or networks used for industrial\n   automation across on factory floors, all the
    way to ++100Gbps\n   country-wide networks.\n\n   Contrary to other mechanisms,
    gLBF does not require network wide\n   clock synchronization, nor does it need
    to maintain per-flow state at\n   network nodes, avoiding drawbacks of other known
    methods while\n   leveraging their advantages.\n\n   Specifically, gLBF uses the
    queuing model and calculus of Urgency\n   Based Scheduling (UBS, [UBS]), which
    is used by TSN Asynchronous\n   Traffic Shaping [TSN-ATS]. gLBF is intended to
    be a plug-in\n   replacement for TSN-ATN or as a parallel mechanism beside TSN-ATS\n
    \  because it allows to keeping the same controller-plane design which\n   is
    selecting paths for TSN-ATS, sizing TSN-ATS queues, calculating\n   latencies
    and admitting flows to calculated paths for calculated\n   latencies.\n\n   In
    addition to reducing the jitter compared to TSN-ATS by additional\n   buffering
    (dampening) in the network, gLBF also eliminates the need\n   for per-flow, per-hop
    state maintenance required by TSN-ATS.  This\n   avoids the need to signal per-flow
    state to every hop from the\n   controller-plane and associated scaling problems.
    \ It also reduces\n   implementation cost for high-speed networking hardware due
    to the\n   avoidance of additional high-speed speed read/write memory access to\n
    \  retrieve, process and update per-flow state variables for a large\n   number
    of flows.\n\n\t "

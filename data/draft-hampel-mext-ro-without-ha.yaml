- language: en

  content: "This document describes extensions to Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), which \npermit
    hosts to conduct route optimization (RO) without home agent.\nThese extensions
    add robustness and flexibility to MIPv6 since \nmobility can be supported when
    the home agent becomes temporarily\nunavailable or when home-agent support is
    not desirable. These \nextensions are compliant with all peer-to-peer signaling
    \nsolutions that are currently supported for RO.\n\t "

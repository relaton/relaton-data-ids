- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes the specification of Xcast6 (Explicit Multi-\n
    \  unicast (Xcast) for IPv6), a new multicast scheme with complementary\n   scaling
    properties: Xcast supports a very large number of small\n   multicast sessions.
    \ Xcast achieves this by explicitly encoding the\n   list of destinations in the
    data packets, instead of using a\n   multicast group address.  The difference
    from the experimental\n   specification which is described in [5058] is that this
    version\n   eliminates Hop-by-Hop header which sometimes suffers hardware router.\n\t "

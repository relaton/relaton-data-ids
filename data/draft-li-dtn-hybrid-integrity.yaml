  content: "   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is designed for a severe\n
    \  environment where communication quality is not guaranteed. It works\n   as
    an overlay network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) and some\n   convergence
    layer protocols like Licklider Transmission Protocol\n   (LTP). However, there
    is no mechanism in both BP and LTP Protocol to\n   ensure integrity of a packet
    with the granularity of bit. Since the\n   integrity is crucial for packet transmission
    and necessary metadata\n   consumes extra costs, there should be a strategy to
    decide which\n   packets and how the packets are required to conduct integrity\n
    \  assurance based on network resources and user requirements. Hence, in\n   this
    document, a hybrid integrity assurance strategy is proposed to\n   ensure the
    different levels of integrity of bundles based on the\n   status of network resources
    and the need of users.\n\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6\nand
    IPsec/IKE and shows how the two protocols can interwork.  An\nextension of the
    PF_KEY framework is proposed which allows smooth and\nsolid operation of IPsec/IKE
    in a Mobile IPv6 environment.\n\nThis document is heavily based on a previous
    draft [MIGRATE] written\nby Shinta Sugimoto, Masahide Nakamura and Francis Dupont.
    \ It simply\nreuses the MIGRATE mechanism defined in the expired document, removes\na
    companion extension (SADB_X_EXT_PACKET) based on implementation\nfeedback (complexity,
    limitations, ...) and fills the gap by very\nsimple changes to MIGRATE mechanism.
    \ This results in a more simple\nand consistent mechanism, which also proved to
    be easier to\nimplement.  This document is expected to serve as a continuation
    of\n[MIGRATE] work.  For that reason, the name of the extension has been\nkept.\n\nPF_KEY
    MIGRATE message serves as a carrier for updated information\nfor both the in-kernel
    IPsec structures (Security Policy Database /\nSecurity Association Database) and
    those maintained by the key\nmanagers.  This includes in-kernel Security Policy
    / Security\nAssociation endpoints, key manager maintained equivalents, and\naddresses
    used by IKE_SA (current and to be negotiated).  The\nextension is helpful for
    assuring smooth interworking between Mobile\nIPv6 and IPsec/IKE for the bootstrapping
    of mobile nodes and their\nmovements.\n\t "

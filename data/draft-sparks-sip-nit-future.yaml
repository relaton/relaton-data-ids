  content: "   This draft explores several possible remedies for a set of issues\n
    \  that have been identified with the Session Initiation Protocol's non-\n   INVITE
    transaction.  These proposed solutions are in rough form and\n   have not yet
    accumulated working group consensus.  They range from\n   minor extensions to
    protocol behavior to fundamentally changing the\n   non-INVITE transaction model.\n\t "

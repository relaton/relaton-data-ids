  content: "This memo describes a mechanism that can be seen as an  extension  to\n
    \  the  IPv6  Neighbor  Discovery.  It  allows  a node to solicit and be\n   advertized
    an  IPv6  address  corresponding  to  a  given  link-layer\n   address.  Because
    \ the known parameter is the link layer address, the\n   mechanism is called  Inverse
    \ Neighbor  Discovery.   It  specifically\n   applies  to  Frame  Relay  nodes
    that may have a Data Link Connection\n   Identifier  (DLCI),  the  Frame  Relay
    \ equivalent  of  a  link-layer\n   address,  associated  with  an  established
    Permanent Virtual Circuit\n   (PVC), but do not know the IPv6 address of the node
    at the other  end\n   of  the  circuit.   It  may also apply to other networks
    with similar\n   behavior.\n\t "

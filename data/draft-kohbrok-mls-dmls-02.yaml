abstract:
- content: "<p>Messaging Layer Security (MLS) provides strong end-to-end security
    guarantees for group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise
    Security (PCS). MLS requires a Delivery Service (DS) component to facilitate agreement
    between group members on the order of Commit messages. In decentralized settings
    without an authoritative entity to enforce ordering, group members will likely
    have to retain key material so they can process commits out-of-order. Retaining
    key material, however, significantly reduces the FS of the protocol. This draft
    specifies Decentralized MLS (DMLS), based on the the Fork-Resilient Continuous
    Group Key Agreement protocol FREEK proposed by Alwen et al. [FRCGKA]. In essence,
    DMLS extends MLS such that key material can be retained to process Commits out-of-
    order with recuded impact to FS, thus allowing safer deployment in decentralized
    environments.</p>"

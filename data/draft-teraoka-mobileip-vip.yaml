  content: "This memo describes Virtual Internet Protocol version 2 (VIPv2), a protocol
    for mobility support in IPv4.  The basic concept of VIP is separation of identifiers
    and addresses.  TCP/UDP uses the identifier. The identifier is mapped to an address,
    and then the packet is routed in accordance with the address.  End nodes as well
    as intermediate routers can have authentic mapping information for routing optimization
    and fault tolerance.\n\t "

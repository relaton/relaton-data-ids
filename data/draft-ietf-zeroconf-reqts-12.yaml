abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Many common TCP/IP protocols such as DHCP [RFC2131], DNS\n[RFC1034][RFC1035],
    MADCAP [RFC2730], and LDAP [RFC2251] must be\nconfigured and maintained by an
    administrative staff.  This is\nunacceptable for emerging networks such as home
    networks, automobile\nnetworks, airplane networks, or ad hoc networks at conferences,\nemergency
    relief stations, and many others.  Such networks may be\nnothing more than two
    isolated laptop PCs connected via a wireless\nLAN.  For all these networks, an
    administrative staff will not exist\nand the users of these networks neither have
    the time nor inclination\nto learn network administration skills.  Instead, these
    networks need\nprotocols that require zero user configuration and administration.\nThis
    document is part of an effort to define such zero configuration\n(zeroconf) protocols.\nBefore
    embarking on defining zeroconf protocols, protocol\nrequirements are needed.  This
    document states the zeroconf protocol\nrequirements for four protocol areas; they
    are: IP interface\nconfiguration, translation between host name and IP address,
    IP\nmulticast address allocation, and service discovery.  This document\ndoes
    not define specific protocols, just requirements.   The\nrequirements for these
    four areas result from examining everyday use\nor scenarios of these protocols.\n\t "

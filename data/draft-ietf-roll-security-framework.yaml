  content: "   This document presents a security framework for routing over low\n
    \  power and lossy networks (LLN).  The development builds upon previous\n   work
    on routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues and\n   constraints
    specific to low power and lossy networks.  A systematic\n   approach is used in
    defining and evaluating the security threats and\n   identifying applicable countermeasures.
    \ These assessments provide\n   the basis of the security recommendations for
    incorporation into low\n   power, lossy network routing protocols.  As an illustration,
    this\n   framework is applied to IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy\n
    \  Networks (RPL).\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   When TCP receives packets that lie outside of the receive window, the\n
    \  corresponding packets are dropped and either an ACK, RST or no\n   response
    is generated due to the out-of-window packet, with no\n   further processing of
    the packet.  Most of the time, this works just\n   fine and TCP remains stable,
    especially when a TCP connection has\n   unidirectional data flow.  However, there
    are three scenarios in\n   which packets that are outside of the receive window
    should still\n   have their ACK field processed, or else a packet war will take
    place.\n   The aforementioned issues have affected a number of popular TCP\n   implementations,
    typically leading to connection failures, system\n   crashes, or other undesirable
    behaviors.  This document describes the\n   three scenarios in which the aforementioned
    issues might arise, and\n   formally updates RFC 793 such that these potential
    problems are\n   mitigated.\n\n\t "

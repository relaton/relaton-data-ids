  content: "   This document specifies a BGP Flow Specification extension that\n   conveys
    per-route feedback binding for a FlowSpec route using the BGP\n   Extended Community
    attribute.  The proposed mechanism introduces a\n   single Feedback Action, encoded
    as a Generic Transitive Extended\n   Community, which enables downstream routers
    to report telemetry\n   information or operational events associated with a FlowSpec
    rule.\n   The Feedback Action carries parameters including a Feedback\n   Identifier
    (FID), a window exponent (WINC) that defines the periodic\n   aggregation interval,
    an event flag, and a scope selector to control\n   where feedback is generated.
    \ These parameters are attached to the\n   FlowSpec route and are propagated across
    AS boundaries unchanged.\n   This document focuses on the signaling aspect; a
    companion document\n   may define how feedback information is exported as part
    of a network\n   telemetry framework (e.g., leveraging the BGP Monitoring Protocol\n
    \  (BMP)) or equivalent mechanisms to report periodic and event-driven\n   feedback
    keyed by the FID.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a BGP Flow Specification extension that conveys
    per-route feedback binding for a FlowSpec route using the BGP Extended Community
    attribute. The proposed mechanism introduces a single Feedback Action, encoded
    as a Generic Transitive Extended Community, which enables downstream routers to
    report telemetry information or operational events associated with a FlowSpec
    rule. The Feedback Action carries parameters including a Feedback Identifier (FID),
    a window exponent (WINC) that defines the periodic aggregation interval, an event
    flag, and a scope selector to control where feedback is generated. These parameters
    are attached to the FlowSpec route and are propagated across AS boundaries unchanged.
    This document focuses on the signaling aspect; a companion document may define
    how feedback information is exported as part of a network telemetry framework
    (e.g., leveraging the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)) or equivalent mechanisms
    to report periodic and event-driven feedback keyed by the FID.</p>"

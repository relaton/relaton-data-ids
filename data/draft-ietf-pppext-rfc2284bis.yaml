  content: "This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an\nauthentication
    framework which supports multiple authentication\nmechanisms. EAP typically runs
    directly over the link layer without\nrequiring IP, but is reliant on lower layer
    ordering guarantees as in\nPPP and IEEE 802. EAP does provide its own support
    for duplicate\nelimination and retransmission.  Fragmentation is not supported
    within\nEAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  While EAP\nwas
    originally developed for use with PPP, it is also now in use with\nIEEE 802.\n\nThis
    document obsoletes RFC 2284.\n\n\t "

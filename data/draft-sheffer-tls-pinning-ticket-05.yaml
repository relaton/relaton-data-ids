  content: "   Misissued public-key certificates can prevent TLS clients from\n   appropriately
    authenticating the TLS server.  Several alternatives\n   have been proposed to
    detect this situation and prevent a client from\n   establishing a TLS session
    with a TLS end point authenticated with an\n   illegitimate public-key certificate,
    but none is currently in wide\n   use.\n\n   This document proposes to extend
    TLS with opaque pinning tickets as a\n   way to pin the server's identity.  During
    an initial TLS session, the\n   server provides an original encrypted pinning
    ticket.  In subsequent\n   TLS session establishment, upon receipt of the pinning
    ticket, the\n   server proves its ability to decrypt the pinning ticket and thus
    the\n   ownership if the pinning protection key.  The client can now safely\n
    \  conclude that the TLS session is established with the same TLS server\n   as
    the original TLS session.  One of the important properties of this\n   proposal
    is that no manual management actions are required.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes new Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) groups for
    use in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2)
    protocols in addition to previously defined groups.  Specifically, the new curve
    groups are based on modular arithmetic rather than binary arithmetic.  These new
    groups are defined to align IKE and IKEv2 with other ECC implementations and standards,
    particularly NIST standards.  In addition, the curves defined here can provide
    more efficient implementation than previously defined ECC groups.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

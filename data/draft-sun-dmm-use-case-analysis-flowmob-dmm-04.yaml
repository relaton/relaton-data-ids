  content: "   Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) allows network traffic to\n   distribute
    among multiple mobility anchors which have mobility\n   functions to solve the
    existing problems in current centralized\n   mobility protocols. There are many
    DMM approaches extending\n   network-based mobility protocols (e.g. Proxy Mobile
    IPv6).\n\n   In Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), they allow a mobile node to\n   connect
    to PMIPv6 domain through different physical interfaces. In\n   this reason, flow
    mobility that enables movement between physical\n   interfaces of mobile node
    is proposed.\n\n   In this document, we present some use cases to support flow
    mobility\n   in DMM domain and analyze some problems. These use cases are based\n
    \  on scenarios of flow mobility in PMIPv6. In these scenarios, a\n   multi-interface
    mobile node connects to different distributed\n   mobility access points and move
    specific flows from one interface to\n   another. These use cases have common
    issues which will be analyzed\n   in detail.\n\n\t "

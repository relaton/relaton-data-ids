  content: "This draft describes an extension to Integrated IS-IS, which can be \nused
    to pass additional information among routers within an IS-IS \ndomain that can
    aid in policy administration.  This extension is \nroughly similar in operation
    to the BGP communities attribute; in that \nit provides a mechanism to associate
    a routed prefix with some \nadministrative group, such that an administrator may
    define a routing \npolicy for that group.\n\t "

  content: "   TRILL fault management [RFC7455] specifies the messages and\n   operations
    for OAM in TRILL network. The sender collects the replies\n   for the OAM-relevant
    request it sent and uses the replies as the\n   indication of the network faults.
    In certain circumstances the sender\n   needs to collect multiple replies to isolate
    the fault, e.g.\n   repetitively sending Path Trace Messages (PTM) with increasing
    value\n   of hop count and collecting the replies on them to figure out the\n
    \  fault point of certain path.\n\n   With the increasing deployment of Software
    Defined Network (SDN), a\n   centralized management server can be used to help
    with fault\n   management. The server then is responsible to collect OAM messages\n
    \  and analyze them to either isolate the network fault or compile\n   overall
    OAM information. It naturally uses SDN structure to alleviate\n   the effort of
    the requester node and provide a centralized solution\n   to produce the operation
    and management feedback of the network.\n\n   This document specifies the extensions
    of TRILL OAM message and the\n   operations about the network nodes and the centralized
    management\n   server to trace and collect OAM relevant messages for further\n
    \  analysis.\n\n\n\t "

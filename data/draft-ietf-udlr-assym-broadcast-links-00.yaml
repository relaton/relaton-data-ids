  content: "   Satellite hops, the region between a basestation and a set of mobile\n
    \  nodes, and a number of other similar scenarios represent a challenge\n   to
    providing IP connectivity at various levels due to the 1-many\n   broadcast nature
    of the link. The UDLR group has addressed these\n   problems in some limited situations.
    The general case, where\n   multiple, possibly partially intersecting set of such
    hops are part\n   of a general set of Internet Paths (or need to be considered
    in the\n   route computation that will buld such paths) is complex. This note
    is\n   an attempt to outline a framework for the general case. We include\n   certain
    recent approaches to managing connectivity that also include\n   quality of service,
    multiple alternate paths, and traffic engineering\n   considerations.\n \n   In
    this version of this note, we are discussing techniques for\n   connectivity,
    so mechanisms and techniques described are applicable\n   to routers. We would
    need a seperate (and hopefully much simpler) set\n   of mechanisms to incorporate
    hosts that exist on a unidirectional\n   link or path that includes such links.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines SQM (Signaling for QoS Measurement), an \narchitecture
    for QoS measurements of IP flows along their paths. The \ngoal of this architecture
    is to configure on demand several probes, \nand to collect and coordinate the
    results in a multi domain \nenvironment, in order to determine in real time the
    QoS experienced \nby a flow on several nodes of its path. A new signaling is used
    to \ninstall metering and reporting states in network nodes. A \ncoordination
    of works related to NSIS, PSAMP and IPFIX could achieve \nthe SQM specification.

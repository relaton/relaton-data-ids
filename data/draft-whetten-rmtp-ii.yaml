  content: "The Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol II, RMTP-II, is a reliable\n
    \  multicast protocol, designed to reliably and efficiently send data\n   from
    a few senders to large groups of simultaneous recipients.  It is\n   designed
    primarily for use over controlled network topologies.  It\n   works over both
    symmetric networks, as well as over asymmetrical\n   network topologies such as
    those provided by satellite, cable modem\n   or Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber
    Line (ADSL) carriers. Before\n   sending, each sender must connect with a trusted
    Top Node, to receive\n   permission and control parameters for its data stream.
    \ The top node\n   provides network managers with a single point of control for
    the\n   senders, allowing them to monitor and control the traffic being sent.\n\t "

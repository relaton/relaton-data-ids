  content: "Mobile IPv6 [1] uses IPsec [2] to protect signaling between the\n   mobile
    node and the home agent [3]. This document defines how IPsec\n   could be used
    between the mobile node and correspondent nodes,\n   including home address option
    validation (aka. triangular routing),\n   protection of mobility signaling for
    routing optimization and\n   suitable configurations.\n\t "

  content: "   The OVAL community has spent more than ten years developing and\n   employing
    the OVAL Language.  During this time, the community has\n   made a number of design
    decisions and learned a number of lessons\n   that should be leveraged as the
    next-generation endpoint posture\n   assessment standards are formulated.  There
    are also a number of\n   places where portions of the OVAL Language align with
    the SACM\n   Information Model and could serve as a starting point for related\n
    \  work.  Another output of the work executed under the OVAL project is\n   a
    number of lessons that are applicable to the SACM work.  These\n   lessons include
    a clear separation of data collection and evaluation;\n   a call to focus on ensuring
    both primary source vendors and third\n   party security experts feel invited
    to the discussion and are\n   empowered to leverage their unique domain knowledge;
    and to strive\n   for simplicity and flexibility, where possible.  In addition,
    the\n   OVAL community has a set of clear recommendations with respect to\n   which
    parts of OVAL should be used by SACM as a means to make best\n   use of the efforts
    of those that have worked on and supported OVAL\n   over the past ten years.  Those
    recommendations are:\n\n   o  Use the OVAL System Characteristics Model to inform
    the\n      development of a data model for representing endpoint posture\n      attributes.\n\n
    \  o  Use the OVAL Definitions Model to inform the development of data\n      models
    for representing evaluation and collection guidance.\n\n   o  Do not use the OVAL
    Results Model to inform the development of a\n      data model for representing
    evaluation results.\n\n   Lastly, this document will discuss the OVAL submission,
    how it is\n   expected to be used, and how it aligns with the SACM Vulnerability\n
    \  Assessment Scenario.\n\n\t "

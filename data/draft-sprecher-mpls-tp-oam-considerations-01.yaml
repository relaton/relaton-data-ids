  content: "   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS technology\n
    \  for use in transport network deployments. That is, MPLS-TP is a set\n   of
    functions and features selected from the wider MPLS toolset and\n   applied in
    a consistent way to meet the needs and requirements of\n   operators of packet
    transport networks.\n\n   During the process of development of the profile, additions
    to the\n   MPLS toolset have been made to ensure that the tools available met\n
    \  the requirements. These additions were motivated by MPLS-TP, but form\n   part
    of the wider MPLS toolset such that any of them could be used in\n   any MPLS
    deployment.\n\n   One major set of additions provides enhanced support for Operations,\n
    \  Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). This enables fault management\n   and
    performance monitoring to the level needed in a transport\n   network. Many solutions
    and protocol extensions have been proposed to\n   address these OAM requirements,
    and this document sets out the\n   reasons for selecting a single, coherent set
    of solutions for\n   standardization.\n\n\t "

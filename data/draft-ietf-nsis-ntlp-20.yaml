  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies protocol stacks for the routing and transport
    of per-flow signalling messages along the path taken by that flow through the
    network.  The design uses existing transport and security protocols under a common
    messaging layer, the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST), which provides
    a common service for diverse signalling applications.  GIST does not handle signalling
    application state itself, but manages its own internal state and the configuration
    of the underlying transport and security protocols to enable the transfer of messages
    in both directions along the flow path.  The combination of GIST and the lower
    layer transport and security protocols provides a solution for the base protocol
    component of the \"Next Steps in Signalling\" (NSIS) framework.  This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

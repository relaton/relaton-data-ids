  content: "This document specifies method for verifying the connection of an \n   MPLS
    Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Label Switched Path (LSP) for \n   management purpose.
    The proposed extension is based on MPLS \n   Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM). The goal is to \n   verify that an MPLS-TP is properly setup in both control
    and data \n   planes, as well as to record the identities of all the LSRs along
    the \n   path of MPLS-TP LSP. \n\n\n\t "

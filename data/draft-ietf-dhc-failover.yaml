  content: "DHCP [RFC 2131] allows for multiple servers to be operating on a\nsingle
    network.  Some sites are interested in running multiple\nservers in such a way
    so as to provide redundancy in case of server\nfailure.  In order for this to
    work reliably, the cooperating primary\nand secondary servers must maintain a
    consistent database of the\nlease information.  This implies that servers will
    need to coordinate\nany and all lease activity so that this information is synchronized\nin
    case of failover.\nThis document defines a protocol to provide such synchronization\nbetween
    two servers.  One server is designated the 'primary' server,\nthe other is the
    'secondary' server.  This document also describes a\nway to integrate the failover
    protocol with the DHCP load balancing\napproach.\n\t "

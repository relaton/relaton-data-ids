  content: "   The TLS protocol is widely deployed and used over the Internet. \n
    \  Client and server nodes compute a set of keys called the keys-block, \n   according
    to a pseudo random function (PRF). This draft proposes a \n   keying infrastructure
    based on the TLS protocol. It suggests \n   defining an additional Key Distribution
    Function (KDF) in order to \n   deliver a set of cryptographic keys. In a peer
    to peer mode keys are \n   directly produced as inputs of the KDF functions. For
    centralized \n   architectures they are delivered through containers, secured
    with \n   keys derived from the KDF function. \n\t "

  content: "Recently, IETF has started to examine policy as a tool for managing \nand
    controlling the provision of QoS guaranteed services. In a \nmulti-domain environment,
    each domain will define its own policies and \nmanage the services according to
    its own policies. So it is natural \nthat the policy in one domain is different
    from the policy in another \ndomain. \nTherefore, this document focuses on the
    policy setup required for \nsupporting inter-domain QoS provisioning and accounting
    and describes \nthe policy exchange required between the domains. For supporting
    the \npolicy exchanges, this document describes two protocols, namely 'Policy
    \nAdvertisement Protocol (PAP)' and 'Policy Negotiation and Notification \nProtocol
    (PNP)'. PAP is used by a domain to advertise its service \npolicies to other domains.
    PNP is used by a domain to request another \ndomain to provide a QoS guaranteed
    service and for the requested domain \nto notify the requesting domain of the
    policies governing the charges \nfor the services. This allows dynamic negotiation
    for the service \ncharges based on the offered QoS.\n\t "

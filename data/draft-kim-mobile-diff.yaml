  content: "   This document provides a method to be able to support mobility\n   service
    in the Differentiate Service Architecture[1]. For this\n   service we used Mobile
    IP[2] as mobility scheme. So we define new\n   functions and operations and we
    modify the header formats already\n   defined in Mobile IP[2] suggested in IETF
    support under IPv4 and\n   IPv6.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document attempts to define the goals and benefits of\n   multihoming
    for fixed and mobile nodes (hosts and routers), i.e. from\n   a node point of
    view, as investigated in the Monami6 WG, and not from\n   a site point of view
    as investigated in the Shim6 WG.  Those goals\n   and benefits are illustrated
    with a set of scenarios.  This document\n   is generic in the sense that the benefits
    of node multihoming can be\n   shared by both fixed end nodes and mobile end nodes.
    \ It is intended\n   to satisfy the first item as specified on the Monami6 charter
    and as\n   such, working group approval as a working group document will be\n
    \  sought.\n\t "

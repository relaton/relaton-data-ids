  content: "   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol has been\n
    \  standardized in RFC7285 to ease better-than-random overlay connection\n   management.
    \ Due to various reasons, optimization capabilities of\n   ALTO servers are limited
    by the fact that it may not be possible for\n   an ALTO server to compute costs
    for source/destination pairs\n   correctly if a source and/or a destination is
    outside the\n   administrative domain it belongs to.  In other words, an ALTO
    server\n   may be generally unable to optimize the traffic with only locally\n
    \  available topology information.\n\n   Therefore, it is proposed that operators
    of distinct administrative\n   domains may agree on topology- and policy-related
    information\n   exchange through a standardized inter-ALTO communication framework.\n
    \  This document provides a rationale for design, standardization, and\n   implementation
    of the inter-ALTO communication framework.\n\n\t "

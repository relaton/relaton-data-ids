  content: "   The Internet Integrated Services (IIS) architecture[2] has a\n   fundamental
    scaling problem in that per flow state is maintained at\n   all routers and end-systems
    supporting a flow.  This paper examines\n   the use of aggregation as a technique
    to reduce the amount of state\n   needed to provide IIS.  In our approach, routers
    at the edge of a\n   region doing aggregation keep detailed IIS state, while in
    the\n   interior of this region, routers keep a greatly reduced amount of\n   state.
    \ Packets will be tagged at the edge with scheduling\n   information that will
    be used in place of the detailed IIS state.\n   The aggregation scheme described
    will allow large scale deployment of\n   IIS without overloading routers with
    state and associated processing.\n\n\t "

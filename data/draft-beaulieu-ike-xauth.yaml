abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "[IKE] allows a device to set up a secure session by using a\nbidirectional
    authentication method using either pre-shared keys or\ndigital certificates.  However
    [IKE] does not provide a method to\nleverage legacy authentication methods which
    are widely deployed\ntoday.\nThis document describes a method for using existing
    unidirectional\nauthentication mechanisms such as RADIUS, SecurID, and OTP within\nIPSec's
    ISAKMP protocol.  The purpose of this draft is not to\nreplace or enhance the
    existing authentication mechanisms described\nin [IKE], but rather to allow them
    to be extended using legacy\nauthentication mechanisms.\n\t "

  content: "   Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant\n
    \  variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless\n   channel
    conditions, interference, or the end-user's movement.  These\n   variations in
    capacity take place in the order of hundreds of\n   milliseconds and is much too
    fast for end-to-end congestion signaling\n   by itself to convey the changes for
    an application to adapt.  Media\n   applications on the other hand demand both
    high throughput and low\n   latency, and are able to dynamically adjust the size
    and quality of a\n   stream to match available network bandwidth.  However, catering
    to\n   such media flows over a radio link where the capacity changes rapidly\n
    \  requires the buffers and QoS in general to be managed carefully.\n   This draft
    proposes additional information about the media\n   transported in each packet
    to manage the buffers and optimize the\n   scheduling of radio resources.  The
    set of information proposed here\n   includes importance of the packet, burst
    length and time budget to be\n   conveyed by the media application in a new UDP
    option.  The metadata\n   in the UDP option is used to provide the wireless network
    the\n   flexibility to prioritize packets that are essential when the radio\n
    \  capacity is temporarily low, defer packets that can tolerate some\n   additional
    delay, or even drop packets selectively in more extreme\n   conditions.\n\n   This
    draft defines media metadata, a new UDP option to carry this\n   metadata and
    the operational aspects for using it between a UDP\n   source and a on-path wireless
    entity.\n\n\t "

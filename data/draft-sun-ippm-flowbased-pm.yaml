  content: "   The performance measurements of service flow are becoming significant\n
    \  important for administrators monitoring the fitness of the network.\n   This
    memo defines an end-to-end flow-based performance measurement\n   method, which
    is achieved by generating synthetic measurement\n   packets, injecting them to
    the network and analyzing the statistics\n   carried in the measurement packets.This
    measurement method can\n   measure flow characteristics such as delay, ipdv (IP
    Packet Delay\n   Variation) and packet loss.\n\n\t "

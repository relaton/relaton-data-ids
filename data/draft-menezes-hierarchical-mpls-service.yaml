- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a network service model for service \nproviders
    to deliver economical layer 2 VPN services using \nhierarchical MPLS.  The service
    model builds on top of 2547 and \nBGP/MPLS and extends to building L2VPN services
    between customer \nsites with a scalable peering model.  \nIt reduces the cost
    of services for downstream providers by using a \ndistance-insensitive IP Network
    Service Provider (NSP) as a WAN \npartner to connect distant regions.  It simplifies
    downstream \nprovider’s operation and improves the scalability of a traditional
    \nstandard overlay model by allowing the downstream provider to peer \nwith the
    upstream provider for both Internet transit and L2VPN \nservices.\n\t "

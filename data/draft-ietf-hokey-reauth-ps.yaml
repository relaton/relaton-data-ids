  content: "This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) re-authentication
    problem statement.  The current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) keying
    framework is not designed to support re-authentication and handovers without re-executing
    an EAP method.  This often causes unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless
    environments.  This document details the problem and defines design goals for
    a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handover.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

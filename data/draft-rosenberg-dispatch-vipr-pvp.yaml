  content: "One of the main challenges in inter-domain federation of Session\nInitiation
    Protocol (SIP) calls is that many domains continue to\nutilize phone numbers,
    and not email-style SIP URI.  Consequently, a\nmechanism is needed that enables
    secure mappings from phone numbers\nto domains.  The main technical challenge
    in doing this securely is\nto verify that the domain in question truly is the
    \"owner\" of the\nphone number.  This specification defines the PSTN Validation\nProtocol
    (PVP), which can be used by a domain to verify this\nownership by means of a forward
    routability check in the PSTN.\n\nLegal\n\nThis documents and the information

  content: "   This document analyzes various algorithm proposals for building port\n
    \  sets.  These algorithms are used to encode the range of ports in an\n   IPv6
    address and prefix in the context of stateless solutions.  The\n   ultimate goal
    of this analysis is to converge on one or a set of\n   algorithms to be used by
    all stateless solutions.\n\n   This is a companion document to\n   [I-D.boucadair-softwire-stateless-rfc6052-update].\n\n\t "

  content: "The 6LoWPAN and ROLL WGs are laying the groundwork to make the\nWireless
    Embedded Internet a reality, but what application protocols\nwill we use?  Request-response
    protocols like HTTP are a poor fit to\na communication model with battery-operated,
    mostly sleeping nodes.\nIn addition, the usual data formats (both headers and
    body) are\nperceived to be too chatty for the 50-60 byte payloads possible in\nLoWPANs
    and to require too much code for the 8-bit and 16-bit\nprocessors dominating the
    Internet of Things.  Still, it would be a\nmistake to start a new silo of application
    protocols that do not\nbenefit from existing application area Internet experience.\n\nThis
    document provides a problem statement for possible work on of\napplication protocols
    in 6LoWPAN networks or, more generally, in low-\npower, lossy networks, as well
    as some considerations for required\nrelated work.\n\t "

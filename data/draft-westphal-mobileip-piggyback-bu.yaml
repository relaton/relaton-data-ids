  content: "This document presents some simple analytical results with respect to\nthe
    performance improvement brought by piggybacking binding updates\n(BUs).  We see
    that the improvement in term of bandwidth is not\nsignificant unless the mobile
    terminal sending BUs moves very fast.\nWe also see on the other hand that the
    improvement in term of jitter\nis quite significant in most situations.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "RSVP signaling may be used to enhance the manageability of\napplication
    traffic's QoS in a differentiated service (diff-serv)\nnetwork [intdiff]. In this
    model, certain network elements within or\nat the edges of the diff-serv network
    may use RSVP messages to\neffect admission control or to apply QoS policy. One
    mechanism by\nwhich network elements may apply QoS policy is by causing a DCLASS\nobject
    to be returned to a sending host in an RSVP RESV message. The\nDCLASS object indicates
    the diff-serv DSCP that the sender should\ninclude when submitting packets on
    the admitted flow, to the diff-\nserv network. This draft describes the usage
    and format of the\nDCLASS object.\n\t "

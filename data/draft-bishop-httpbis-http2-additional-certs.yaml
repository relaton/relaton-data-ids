  script: Latn
  content: "   TLS provides fundamental mutual authentication services for HTTP,\n
    \  supporting up to one server certificate and up to one client\n   certificate
    associated to the session to prove client and server\n   identities as necessary.
    \ This draft provides mechanisms for\n   providing additional such certificates
    at the HTTP layer when these\n   constraints are not sufficient.\n\n   Many HTTP
    servers host content from several origins.  HTTP/2\n   [RFC7540] permits clients
    to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a\n   server provided that the secondary
    origin is also in the certificate\n   provided during the TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]
    handshake.\n\n   In many cases, servers will wish to maintain separate certificates\n
    \  for different origins but still desire the benefits of a shared HTTP\n   connection.
    \ Similarly, servers may require clients to present\n   authentication, but have
    different requirements based on the content\n   the client is attempting to access.\n\n
    \  This document describes how TLS exported authenticators\n   [I-D.ietf-tls-exported-authenticator]
    can be used to provide proof of\n   ownership of additional certificates to the
    HTTP layer to support\n   both scenarios.\n\n\t "

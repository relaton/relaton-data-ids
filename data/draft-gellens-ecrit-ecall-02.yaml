  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n   mechanisms
    to support the next generation of the Pan European in-\n   vehicle emergency call
    service defined under the eSafety initiative\n   of the European Commission (generally
    referred to as \"eCall\"). eCall\n   is a standardized and mandated system for
    a special form of emergency\n   calls placed by vehicles.  eCall deployment is
    required by 2015 in\n   European Union member states, and eCall is also being
    deployed in\n   other regions.  eCall provides an integrated voice path and a\n
    \  standardized set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and\n   location
    data.  An eCall is recognized and handled as a specialized\n   form of emergency
    call and is routed to a specialized eCall-capable\n   Public Safety Answering
    Point (PSAP) capable of processing the\n   vehicle data and trained in handling
    emergency calls from vehicles.\n   Currently, eCall functions over circuit-switched
    cellular telephony;\n   work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, sometimes called
    packet-\n   switched eCall or PS-eCall) is now in process, and this document\n
    \  assists in that work by describing how to support eCall within the\n   IP-based
    emergency services infrastructure.\n\n   This document also registers a MIME Content
    Type and an Emergency\n   Call Additional Data Block for the eCall vehicle data.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document argues for and describes alternatives that shift\n   specific
    language conventions used by RFC Authors and RFC Editors to\n   avoid oppressive
    terminology in the technical documentation of the\n   RFC series.  Specifically,
    this document details two sets of terms\n   that are normalised on the technical
    level but oppressive on a\n   societal level.  First, arguments are presented
    for why any\n   oppressive terms should be avoided by the IETF/IRTF.  Second,
    problem\n   statements for both sets of terms are presented and alternatives are\n
    \  proposed.  There is a third section on additional considerations and\n   general
    action points to address the RFC series, past and future.\n   Lastly, a summary
    of recommendations is presented.\n\t "

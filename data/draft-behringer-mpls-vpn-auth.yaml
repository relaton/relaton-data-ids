  content: "Configuration errors on Provider Edge (PE) routers in Layer-3 VPN \nnetworks
    based on [RFC2547] can lead to security breaches of the \nconnected VPNs. For
    example, the PE router could be mistakenly \nconfigured such that a connected
    Customer Edge (CE) router belongs to \nan incorrect VPN. Here we propose a scheme
    that verifies local and \nremote routing information received by the PE router
    before it \ninstalls new VPN routes into the Virtual Routing & Forwarding \nInstance
    (VRF). The proposed changes affect only the PE routers.\n\t "

  content: "   The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc
    \   \n   networks provides shortest routes in terms of number of hops using \n
    \  Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.  In order to support multiple-\n   metric
    routing criteria, a quality of service (QoS) extension can \n   be added to OLSR
    functioning.  No additional control traffic is \n\n   generated (only augmented
    HELLO and TC messages).  QOLSR protocol\n   uses standard multipoint relays (MPRs)
    to ensure that the overhead\n   is as low as possible for forwarding control traffic.
    \ Local QoS \n   metrics information on links are used to calculate quality of
    service\n   MPRs (QMPRS) and then flooded in the network by TC messages to \n
    \  calculate routing tables.  QOLSR can find optimal paths on the known \n   partial
    topology having the same performances that those \n   on the whole network.  These
    paths contain only QMPRs as intermediate\n   nodes between a source destination
    pair. \n\n   This memo describes the QOLSR protocol, which is an enhancement of
    \n   OLSR to support multiple-metric QoS routing.\n\n\t "

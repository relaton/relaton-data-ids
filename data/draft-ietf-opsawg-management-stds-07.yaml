  content: "This document gives an overview of the IETF network management standards
    and summarizes existing and ongoing development of IETF Standards Track network
    management protocols and data models.  The document refers to other overview documents,
    where they exist and classifies the standards for easy orientation.  The purpose
    of this document is, on the one hand, to help system developers and users to select
    appropriate standard management protocols and data models to address relevant
    management needs.  On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview
    and guideline by other Standard Development Organizations or bodies planning to
    use IETF management technologies and data models.  This document does not cover
    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) technologies on the data-path,
    e.g., OAM of tunnels, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) OAM, and pseudowire as
    well as the corresponding management models.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

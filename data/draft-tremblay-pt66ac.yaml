  content: "This document describes a method to extend IPv6 prefix translation\n[NAT66]
    to statelessly translate between IPv6 prefixes of differing\nlengths.  This technique,
    called PT66 addressing bit compression\n(PT66-AC), provides a way to map a shorter
    prefix (such as the fixed\n[6to4] prefix) to a longer global unicast prefix, while
    avoiding\nstateful translation.  The difference between the prefix lengths is\ncompensated
    for by removing an unused string of subnetting bits, as\nspecified, from the addresses
    within the shorter prefix.\n\t "

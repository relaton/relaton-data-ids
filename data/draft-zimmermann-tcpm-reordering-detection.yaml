  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies an algorithm for the detection and\n   quantification
    of packet reordering for TCP.  In the absence of\n   explicit congestion notification
    from the network, TCP uses only\n   packet loss as an indication of congestion.
    \ One of the signals TCP\n   uses to determine loss is the arrival of three duplicate\n
    \  acknowledgments.  However, this heuristic is not always correct,\n   notably
    in the case when paths reorder packets.  This results in\n   degraded performance.\n\n
    \  The algorithm for the detection and quantification of reordering in\n   this
    document uses information gathered from the TCP Timestamps\n   Option, the TCP
    SACK Option and its DSACK extension.  When a\n   reordering event is detected,
    the algorithm calculates a reordering\n   extent by determining the number of
    segments the reordered segment\n   was late with respect to its position in the
    sequence number space.\n   Additionally, the algorithm computes a second reordering
    extent that\n   is relative to the amount of outstanding data and thus provides
    a\n   better estimation of the reordering delay when other sender state\n   changes.\n\n\t "

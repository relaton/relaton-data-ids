  content: "The recipient of the REFER method [1] creates an implicit \nsubscription
    to the 'refer' event. This subscription causes the REFER \nrecipient to send NOTIFY
    messages to the sender informing him of the \nprogress of the REFER. This memo
    provides for the requirements and \none potential mechanism to suppress the creation
    of this implicit \nsubscription, via an option tag - 'norefersub'. This gives
    the agent \nsending the REFER control over the creation of the subscription, \nwhile
    being backwards compatible with [1]. \n    \n\t "

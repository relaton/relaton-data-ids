  content: "This document describes a protocol for ''globally-distributed\ntroubleshooting''
    (GDT).  GDT automates, where possible, the process of\nproblem reporting and referral
    between customers and Internet Service\nProviders (ISPs), as well as between ISPs.
    \ GDT also provides an\nautomatic mechanism for periodic status reports, and allows
    an ISP to\nmake information (such as expected time to repair) on a current problem\nreadily
    accessible to those directly affected by it, without requiring\nhuman intervention.\n\t "

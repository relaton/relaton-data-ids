  content: "   This memo presents a summary of marking methods for performance\n   measurements,
    and discusses the tradeoffs among them.  These marking\n   methods enable to measure
    various performance metrics such as packet\n   loss and delay, and require a low
    overhead in the header of data\n   packets, as low as one or two bits per packet,
    or in some cases even\n   zero bits per packet.  The target audience of this document
    is\n   network protocol designers; this document is intended to help\n   protocol
    designers choose the best marking method(s) based on the\n   protocol's constraints
    and requirements.\n\n\t "

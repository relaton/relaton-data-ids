  content: "When an IP address is shared among several subscribers, it is\nimpossible
    to determine which subscriber has initiated that TCP\nconnection.  This memo describes
    a technique to share the identity of\na subscriber that initiated a TCP connection
    with the TCP server..\nThe proposed method avoids altering the application-level
    payload and\nworks well with SSL-protected connections.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a binary encoding format for an arcband, \n   which
    is compatible with the binary encoding defined by 3GPP \n   [3GPP23.032], and
    which is widely used in today's cellular networks. \n   This encoding can additionally
    be used by a number of other \n   protocols, which demand a bandwidth efficient
    encoding of location \n   information, eg link layers like IEEE 802.11. \n\n\t "

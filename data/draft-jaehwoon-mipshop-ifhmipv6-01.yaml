  content: "   The mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) enables a mobile node (MN) to maintain\n   its
    connectivity with a correspondent node (CN) while changing \n   its point of attachment.
    Since, in MIPv6, packets sent from \n   a CN to an MN during handover can be lost,
    several mechanisms \n   such as FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 have been proposed to reduce
    the \n   number of lost packets. However, such mechanisms still suffer \n   from
    the performance degradation due to not only packet losses \n   but also out-of-sequence
    packets. In this draft, we propose \n   I-FHMIPv6 which integrates FMIPv6 and
    HMIPv6 efficiently. \n   I-FHMIPv6 uses the Flush message and can minimize packet
    losses.\n\n\t "

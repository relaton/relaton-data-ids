  content: "   For Mobile IPv6 service, the mobile node first connects to an Access\n
    \  Router and obtain an IPv6 address to use it as a Care-of-Address.  In\n   many
    networks, the Access Router sends Router Advertisement to the\n   mobile node
    to convey various information.  If the Access Router has\n   the knowledge of
    the mobile nodes home info such as home agent\n   address, the Access Router can
    convey that info to the mobile node\n   along with the Router Advertisement.  This
    document proposes a method\n   that will allow the Access Router to include home
    info of the mobile\n   node in the Router Advertisement message.\n\t "

  content: "   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model\n
    \  in which communications may be subject to long delays and/or\n   intermittent
    connectivity.  DTN nodes include timestamps in the\n   bundles of data they send
    so that correspondents can identify the\n   bundles and determine the length of
    time they have been in the\n   system.  However, there is currently no specified
    strategy for\n   synchronizing the clocks between DTN nodes.  This document therefore\n
    \  presents a problem statement for time synchronization in DTNs.\n\n\t "

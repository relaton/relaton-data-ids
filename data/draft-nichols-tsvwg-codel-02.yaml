  content: "   The \"persistently full buffer\" problem has been discussed in the
    IETF\n   community since the early 80's [RFC896].  The IRTF's End-to-End\n   Working
    Group called for the deployment of active queue management\n   (AQM) to solve
    the problem in 1998 [RFC2309].  Despite the awareness,\n   the problem gotten
    worse as by Moore's Law growth in memory density\n   fueled an exponential increase
    in buffer pool size.  Efforts to\n   deploy AQM have been frustrated by difficult
    configuration and\n   negative impact on network utilization.  The full buffer
    problem,\n   recently christened \"bufferbloat\"[TSVBB2011, BB2011] has become\n
    \  increasingly important throughout the Internet but particularly at\n   the
    consumer edge.\n\n   To address bufferbloat, this document describes a general
    framework\n   for controlling excessived delay in networks called Controlled Delay\n
    \  (CoDel) designed to work in modern networking environments as a part\n   of
    the solution to bufferbloat [CODEL2012].  CoDel consists of an\n   estimator,
    a setpoint, and a control loop and can be deployed in the\n   Internet without
    configuration.  CoDel comprises some major technical\n   innovations and has been
    made available as open source so that the\n   framework can be applied by the
    community to a range of problems.  It\n   has been implemented in Linux (and available
    in the Linux\n   distribution) and deployed in some networks at the consumer edge.
    \ In\n   addition, the framework has been successfully applied in other ways.\n\n
    \  Note: Code Components extracted from this document must include the\n   license
    as included with the code in Section 5.\n\n\t "

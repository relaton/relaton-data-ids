  content: "   Conventional Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) impose several\n
    \  challenges on factory floors as their numbers and size on the factory\n   floors/plants
    continues to grow.  Virtualized PLCs can help overcome\n   many of those concerns.
    \ They can improve the automation in Industry\n   control networks by simplifying
    communication between higher-level\n   applications and low-level factory floor
    machine operations.  Virtual\n   PLCs provide an opportunity to integrate a diverse
    set of non-\n   internet protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and IP connections
    to\n   improve coordination between applications and field devices.  Besides\n
    \  automation, virtual PLCs also enhance programmability in industry\n   process
    control systems by abstracting control functions from I/O\n   modules.  However,
    to achieve desired outcome and benefits, both\n   operational and application
    networks should evolve.\n\n   This document introduces virtual PLC concept, describes
    the details\n   and benefits of virtualized PLCs, then focuses on the problem\n
    \  statement and requirements.\n\n\t "

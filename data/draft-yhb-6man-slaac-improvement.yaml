  content: "   IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration described by RFC4862 only
    \n   supports 64-bit prefixes. This approach can't be deployed in the \n   sites
    with prefixes longer than 64. We have no right to require that \n   the sites
    MUST use 64-bit prefixes. This document tries to implement\n   stateless address
    autoconfiguration with prefixes longer than 64.\n\n\t "

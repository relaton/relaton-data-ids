  script: Latn
  content: "   Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across\n   multiple
    domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLS\n   networks presents
    a problem because no single point of path\n   computation is aware of all of the
    links and resources in each\n   domain. A solution may be achieved using the Path
    Computation\n   Element (PCE) architecture.\n\n   Where the sequence of domains
    is known a priori, various techniques\n   can be employed to derive an optimum
    path. If the domains are\n   simply-connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection
    are\n   also known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique can be used.\n   Where
    there are multiple connections between domains and there is\n   no preference
    for the choice of points of interconnection, the\n   Backward Recursive Path Computation
    Procedure (BRPC) can be used to\n   derive an optimal path.\n\n   This document
    examines techniques to establish the optimum path when\n   the sequence of domains
    is not known in advance. The document\n   shows how the PCE architecture can be
    extended to allow the optimum\n   sequence of domains to be selected, and the
    optimum end-to-end path\n   to be derived through the use of a hierarchical relationship
    between\n   domains.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Rotating public identifiers is encouraged as best practice as a means\n
    \  of protecting endpoint privacy.  For example, regular MAC address\n   randomization
    helps mitigate device tracking across time and space.\n   Other protocols beyond
    those in the link layer also have public\n   identifiers or parameters that should
    rotate over time, in unison\n   with coupled protocol identifiers, and perhaps
    with application level\n   identifiers.  This document surveys such privacy-related
    identifiers\n   exposed by common Internet protocols at various layers in a network\n
    \  stack.  It provides advice for rotating linked identifiers such that\n   privacy
    violations do not occur from rotating one identifier while\n   neglecting to rotate
    coupled identifiers.\n\n\t "

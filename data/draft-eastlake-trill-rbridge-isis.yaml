  content: "RBridges implement the TRILL protocol, which in turn makes use of an\n
    \  extended version of the IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate\n   System)
    routing protocol to determine topology and frame forwarding\n   and for the distribution
    and synchronization of data. RBridges\n   provide optimal pair-wise forwarding
    with zero configuration, safe\n   forwarding even during periods of temporary
    loops, and multipathing\n   for both unicast and multicast traffic. Rbridges also
    support VLANs.\n   This document specifies some details of IS-IS PDUs used in
    TRILL.\n\t "

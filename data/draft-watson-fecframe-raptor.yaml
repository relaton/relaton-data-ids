  content: "This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction\n(FEC)
    Schemes for the Raptor code and its application to reliable\ndelivery of media
    streams in the context of FEC Framework.  The\nRaptor code is a systematic code,
    where a number of repair symbols\nare generated from a set of source symbols and
    sent in one or more\nrepair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent
    to the\nreceiver(s) within a source flow.  The Raptor code offers a close to\noptimal
    protection against arbitrary packet losses at a low\ncomputational complexity.
    \ Two FEC Schemes are defined, one for\nprotection of arbitrary packet flows and
    another for protection of a\nsingle flow that already contains a sequence number.
    \ Repair data may\nbe sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g.  UDP) or using
    RTP.\nAn RTP Payload Type is defined for this latter case.\n\t "

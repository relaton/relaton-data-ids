  content: "   This document describes the Scalable Streaming Raster Graphics (SSRG)\n
    \  specification for the modern Web. An unfortunate truth of the modern\n   internet
    is that digital equity has been secondary to the expansion\n   of broadband in
    the most developed areas of the world.  This in turn\n   makes it much harder
    for developing nations to gain a competitive\n   foothold in the digital market
    due to lackluster download speeds\n   limiting access to content-rich applications
    and educational\n   resources.\n\n   The SSRG specification, dubbed \"Surge\"
    by its creator, intends to\n   bridge \"The Digital Divide\" using techniques
    of classical quadtree\n   image compression and Laplacian image pyramids to create
    a more\n   scalable and equitable browsing experience for low-bandwidth users\n
    \  while still providing standard features such as perceptually lossless\n   image
    quality at competitive compression rates.  The format\n   efficiently encodes
    a multi-resolution version of the stored image\n   that can be streamed sequentially
    in order of increasing pixel\n   resolution using conventional mechanisms of the
    HTTP protocol.\n\n   The specification comes in three main parts:\n\n\t "

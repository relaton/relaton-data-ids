  content: "   This document describes an Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP)\n
    \  conformant with an Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA).  The\n   AMP
    provides monitoring and configuration services between managing\n   devices (Managers)
    and managed devices (Agents), some of which may\n   operate on the far side of
    high-delay or high-disruption links.  The\n   AMP minimizes the number of transmitted
    bytes, operates without\n   sessions or (concurrent) two-way links, and functions
    autonomously\n   when there is no timely contact with a network operator.  The
    AMP\n   accomplishes this without requiring mobile code and generally reduces\n
    \  the processor, memory, and storage requirements of implementing\n   Managers
    and Agents.\n\n\t "

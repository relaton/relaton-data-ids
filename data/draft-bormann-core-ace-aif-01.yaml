  content: "   Constrained Devices as they are used in the \"Internet of Things\"
    need\n   security.  One important element of this security is that devices in\n
    \  the Internet of Things need to be able to decide which operations\n   requested
    of them should be considered authorized, need to ascertain\n   that the authorization
    to request the operation does apply to the\n   actual requester, and need to ascertain
    that other devices they place\n   requests on are the ones they intended.\n\n
    \  On the ACE mailing list, an activity to create specifications for\n   such
    authenticated authorization for constrained devices is\n   contemplated.\n\n   One
    potential work item is an Authorization Information Format (AIF).\n\n   This document
    provides a strawman for such a format that should\n   enable further discussion
    of the objectives for its development.\n\n\t "

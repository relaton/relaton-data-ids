  content: "   The Observe Option allows a CoAP client to observe changes in the\n
    \  state of resources and obtain a current representation of the last\n   resource
    state.  To be an observer of an origin server's resources,\n   the client is required
    to register its interest with the server.  A\n   successful registration will
    make the client added into the server's\n   observation list, while a failed one
    MAY drive the client to re-\n   register.\n\n   However, repeated and frequent
    re-registrations cannot guarantee the\n   client to eventually become an observer
    of the target server.  In the\n   case that the server is unable or unwilling
    to accept an observer,\n   the time-intensive re-registrations will just bring
    redundant\n   messages in the constrained network and considerable energy\n   consumption
    on both the client and the server.\n\n   This memo defines a new CoAP option,
    State, for providing stateful\n   observation on the resources of CoAP servers.
    \ By observing the state\n   of the server in terms of the Observe Option, a client
    can explicitly\n   learn when the server will not actively reject an observation\n
    \  registration, and then can wisely performs the re-registration.  This\n   avoids
    the potential registration flooding that causes considerable\n   network overhead
    and energy consumption on the constrained nodes.\n\n\t "

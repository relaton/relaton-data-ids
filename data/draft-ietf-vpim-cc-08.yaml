  content: "This document describes the use of a mechanism for identifying body parts
    that a sender deems critical in a multi-part Internet mail message.  The mechanism
    described is a parameter to Content-Disposition, as described by RFC 3204.  By
    knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content gateway can
    intelligently handle multi-part messages when providing gateway services to systems
    of lesser capability.  Critical content can help a content gateway to decide what
    parts to forward.  It can indicate how hard a gateway should try to deliver a
    body part.  It can help the gateway to pick body parts that are safe to silently
    delete when a system of lesser capability receives a message.  In addition, critical
    content can help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the receiving
    system.  Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do some processing
    on a body part, critical content allows the sender to mark body parts that the
    receiver must process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

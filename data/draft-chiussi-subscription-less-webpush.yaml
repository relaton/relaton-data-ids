  content: "   Subscription is a integral part of the current Web Push service.\n
    \  However, the current explicit subscription requirement makes it\n   difficult
    to use web push in a number of use cases where there may be\n   a need to reach
    User Agents that are not subscribed to the Web Push\n   service. In addition,
    the current Web Push subscription model does\n   not provide a mechanism to achieve
    coordination and control among\n   subscriptions associated to different applications.
    This document\n   describes a framework for making subscription more flexible
    and solve\n   these issues.\n\n\t "

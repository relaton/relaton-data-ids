    virtual private networks (VPNs).  For IP based VPNs to provide\n   a service comparable
    to private line networks it has to provide\n   a number of features including
    closed user groups, security and\n   performance guarantees.  This document focuses
    primarily on the issue\n   of performance, and provide a QoS framework which is
    applicable to\n   various VPN solution that have been proposed.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the high-level interface of a polynomial\n
    \  commitment scheme (PCS), a cryptographic primitive used in\n   constructing
    generic zk-SNARKs.  A PCS allows a prover to commit to a\n   polynomial, and later
    attest to its correct evaluation at a given\n   point.  Test vectors and reference
    implementations for popular\n   instantiations are provided in Appendix A.\n\n\t "

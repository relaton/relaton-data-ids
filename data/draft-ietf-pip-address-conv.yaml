  content: "Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP version
    4.  Pip is a general purpose internet protocol, designed to handle all forseeable
    internet protocol requirements.  This specification is one of a number of documents
    that specify the operation of Pip.  This specification describes the conventions
    for using the various Pip addresses--the hierarchical unicast address, the class-D
    style multicast address, the CBT multicast address, and the nearcast address.
    \ This specification does not describe how Pip addresses are assigned.\n\t "

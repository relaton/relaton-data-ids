  content: "   The target of the DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) system\n
    \  is to provide an open and standard in-network storage system for\n   applications,
    primarily P2P (peer-to-peer) applications, to store,\n   retrieve and manage their
    data.  This draft enumerates and explains\n   requirements, not only for storage
    and retrieval, but also for data\n   management, access control and resource control,
    that should be\n   considered during the design and implementation of a DECADE-\n
    \  compatible system.  These are requirements on the entire system; some\n   of
    the requirements may eventually be implemented by an existing\n   protocol with/without
    some extensions (e.g., a protocol used to read\n   and write data from the storage
    system).  The requirements in this\n   document are intended to ensure that a
    DECADE-compatible system\n   architecture includes all of the desired functionality
    for intended\n   applications.\n\n\n\t "

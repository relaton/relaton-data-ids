  content: "Tunneling IPv6 packets over the IPv4 Internet played a major role in\nthe
    early stages of IPv6 deployment. This was useful because in the\nearly days the
    routers in the internet did not support IPv6.\nNowadays, tunneling is used to
    get across legacy equipment and ISPs\nthat do not support IPv6. Many different
    tunneling mechanisms have\nbeen invented. This document describes the drivers
    for IPv6\ntunneling, the general architectures of existing mechanisms, and a\nset
    of desirable properties against which subsequent analysis of the\nmechanisms may
    be made.   The document is aimed at small end sites\nthat may typically utilise
    tunneling methods in an early IPv6\ndeployment.\n\t "

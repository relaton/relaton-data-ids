  content: "   This document is a follow-up of a University thesis which aims to\n
    \  measure the evolution over time of IPv6 traffic and to analyze the\n   geographical
    distribution of IPv6 nodes.  The first measurements were\n   done during the Summer
    2009 using a specific-purpose program which\n   connects to the BitTorrent peer-to-peer
    network and this document\n   adds measurements done with the same program but
    in October 2011 and\n   February 2012.\n\n   The study was made in Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) networks because they are\n   responsible for a big part of Internet traffic
    and because their\n   structure and functioning permit a rapid discovery of a
    large number\n   of nodes from all over the world.  In addition, the P2P users
    are\n   more likely to be interested by IPv6 as IPv6 does not have the same\n
    \  NAT problems as IPv4.\n\n\t "

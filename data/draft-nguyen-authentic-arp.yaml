  content: "   This document describes additions to Address Resolution Protocol that\n
    \  will allow a host to authentically resolve the hardware address from\n   the
    protocol address of given host.  Using authentication data based\n   on X.509
    digital signatures to evaluate the authenticity of ARP\n   packets, hosts can
    prevent ARP spoofing efficiently.\n\t "

  content: "In Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN), Bundle Agents form an\noverlay
    network that forwards DTN bundles between their source and\ndestination applications.
    \ This document describes a mechanism that\nBundle Agents can use to discover
    when they are in contact with one\nanother and optionally provide information
    on the additional\nproperties of current or future contacts, such as duration
    and\ncapabilities.  This information can be used to trigger bundle\nforwarding
    or make future bundle scheduling decisions.\n\t "

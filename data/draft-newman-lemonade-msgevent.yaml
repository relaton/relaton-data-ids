  content: "   One of the missing features in the existing Internet mail and\n   messaging
    standards is a facility for server-to-server and server-to-\n   client event notifications
    related to message store events.  As the\n   scope of Internet mail expands to
    support more diverse media (such as\n   voice mail), devices (such as cell phones)
    and to provide rich\n   interactions with other services (such as web portals
    and legal\n   compliance systems), the need for an interoperable notification\n
    \  system increases.  This document attempts to enumerate the types of\n   events
    which interest real-world consumers of such a system.\n\t "

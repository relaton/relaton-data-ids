  content: "   The Secure Internet Indirection Infrastructure (Secure-i3) is a\n   proposal
    for a flexible and secure overlay network that, if\n   universally deployed, would
    effectively block a number of\n   denial-of-service problems in the Internet.
    \ The Host Identity\n   Protocol (HIP), on the other hand, is a proposal for deploying\n
    \  opportunistic, IPsec based end-to-end security, allowing any hosts to\n   communicate
    in a secure way through the Internet.  In this paper, we\n   explore various possibilities
    for combining ideas from Secure-i3 and\n   HIP, thereby producing an architecture
    that is more efficient and\n   secure than Secure-i3 and more flexible and denial-of-service\n
    \  resistant than HIP.\n\t "

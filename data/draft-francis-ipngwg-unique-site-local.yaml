  content: "For many or most sites, site-local addresses are used for packets \nbetween
    nodes within the site.  The fact that site-local addresses \nare not globally
    unique makes their usage and administration more \ndifficult than they would be
    if there were globally unique (or \nnearly globally unique).  For instance, before
    two sites can be \nmerged, one of them has to be renumbered.  The meaning of site-local
    \naddresses becomes ambiguous when they are taken out of the immediate \ncontext
    of the IPv6 layer, for instance when they are conveyed in \nemail or stored in
    text files.\n\t "

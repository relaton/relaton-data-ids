  content: "   This memo specifies a security protocol based on public key matrix\n
    \  for Internet of Things.  All public keys MUST be generated by only\n   one
    public key seed and the corresponding private key MUST be secret\n   information
    for adversary.  Each node can indirectly authenticate the\n   identity of other
    nodes without digital signature.  This protocol is\n   REQUESTED Public/Private
    Key Pre-distribution service, Initial\n   Session Key Establishment service, Session
    Key Update service and\n   Data Encryption Service.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "As one result of the analysis activities in the NSIS group it was \nrealized
    that mobility and the ability to change the flow identifier \ncauses problems
    with existing QoS reservations. To be able to \nassociate a signaling message
    with existing state an identifier \nother than the flow identifier had to be used.
    Such an abstraction \nis achieved with the session identifier which allows identification
    \nof established state independently of the flow characteristics.  \n    \n \n\t "

  content: "The cause of the typically glacial response from popular Internet World
    Wide Web servers is seldom lack of network bandwidth or any deficits in the client's
    equipment. The reason for the abysmal performance is that the accessed server
    is spending an inordinate amount of time managing two problems; an unnecessarily
    large number of transport connections and the transmission of masses of redundant
    data without optimization. This work addresses both problems.                                                   This
    document presents an introduction to the concepts and architecture of network
    traffic consolidation. It is not intended to describe a complete protocol with
    every ancillary feature but rather to focus on performance driven core ideas that
    could become a part of emerging commercially featured protocols.\n\t "

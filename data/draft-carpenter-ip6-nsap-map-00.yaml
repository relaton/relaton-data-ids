- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document recommends that network implementors who have planned or
    deployed an OSI NSAP addressing plan, and who wish to deploy or transition to
    IP6, should redesign a native IP6 addressing plan to meet their needs. However,
    in the event that network implementors prefer to keep their OSI addressing plan
    intact, this document defines a mapping of OSI NSAP addresses into IP6 addresses.
    \ This mapping is restricted by the 16 byte size of IP6 addresses.  This document
    also defines a mapping of IP6 addresses within the OSI address format, should
    this be required for any reason.\n\t "

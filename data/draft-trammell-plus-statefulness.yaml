  content: "   This document describes a simple state machine for stateful network\n
    \  devices on a path between two endpoints to associate state with\n   traffic
    traversing them on a per-flow basis, as well as abstract\n   signaling mechanisms
    for driving the state machine.  This state\n   machine is intended to replace
    the de-facto use of the TCP state\n   machine or incomplete forms thereof by stateful
    network devices in a\n   transport-independent way, while still allowing for fast
    state\n   timeout of non-established or undesirable flows.\n\n\t "

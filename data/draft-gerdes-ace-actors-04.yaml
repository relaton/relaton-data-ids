  script: Latn
  content: "   Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of\n
    \  processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.
    \ Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily
    applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and\n   authorization solution is
    needed to ensure the security of these\n   devices.\n\n   Due to the limitations
    of the constrained nodes it is especially\n   important to develop a light-weight
    security solution which is\n   adjusted to the relevant security objectives of
    each participating\n   party in this environment.  Necessary security measures
    must be\n   identified and applied where needed.\n\n   This document gives an
    overview of the necessary terminology and\n   introduces the actors in an architecture
    as guidance for the\n   development of authentication and authorization solutions
    for\n   constrained environments.  The actors represent the relationships\n   between
    the logical functional entities involved.\n\n   We also present a problem description
    for authentication and\n   authorization in constrained-node networks, i.e. networks
    where some\n   devices have severe constraints on memory, processing, power and\n
    \  communication bandwidth.\n\n\t "

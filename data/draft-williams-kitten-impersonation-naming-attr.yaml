  content: "   This document describes a method for impersonation of one principal\n
    \  by another.  Relying parties are expected to apply policy to decide\n   which
    impersonation attempts they accept.  Trusted third parties may\n   provide assistance
    in evaluating policy.  The proposed system fails\n   safe: applications that do
    not support it see their peers as the\n   impersonators, not the impersonated
    principals.\n\n\t "

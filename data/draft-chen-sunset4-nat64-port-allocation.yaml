  content: "   This document enumerates methods of port assignment in Carrier Grade\n
    \  NATs (CGNs), focused particularly on NAT64 environments.  A\n   theoretical
    framework of different NAT port allocation methods is\n   described.  The memo
    is intended to clarify and focus the port\n   allocation discussion and propose
    an integrated view of the\n   considerations for selection of the port allocation
    mechanism in a\n   given deployment.\n\n\t "

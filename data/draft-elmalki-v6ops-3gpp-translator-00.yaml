  content: "There have been discussions on the v6ops mailing list and at IETF \nmeetings
    regarding the suitability of translators (e.g. NAT-PT) as \nmechanisms for IPv4
    to IPv6 transition. It has often been stated that \nNAT-PT is not a mechanism
    to be recommended in general to solve the \nIPv6-IPv4 transition problem and some
    modifications to NAT-PT have \nbeen proposed. However there have also been discussions
    regarding \nspecial scenarios where some form of translators could be deployed
    if \ntheir use is documented appropriately. The aim of this draft is to \ndocument
    the rationale for using translators in 3GPP networks, in \nparticular for IPv6-only
    IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and to \ndescribe possible solutions to the problem
    and the interactions with \nSIP.\n\t "

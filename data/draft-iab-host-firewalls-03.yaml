  content: "   In today's Internet, the need for firewalls is generally accepted in\n
    \  the industry and indeed firewalls are widely deployed in practice.\n   Unlike
    traditional firewalls that protect network links, host\n   firewalls run in end
    user systems.  Often the result is that software\n   may be running and potentially
    consuming resources, but then\n   communication is blocked by a host firewall.
    \ It's taken for granted\n   that this end state is either desirable or the best
    that can be\n   achieved in practice, rather than (for example) an end state where\n
    \  the relevant software is not running or is running in a way that\n   would
    not result in unwanted communication.  In this document, we\n   explore the issues
    behind these assumptions and provide suggestions\n   on improving the architecture
    going forward.\n\n\t "

  content: "RFC 3588 allows a Diameter redirect agent to specify one or more\nindividual
    hosts to which a Diameter message may be redirected by an\nupstream Diameter node.
    \ However, in some circumstances an operator\nmay wish to redirect messages to
    an alternate domain without\nspecifying individual hosts.  This document specifies
    the means by\nwhich this can be achieved.\n\t "

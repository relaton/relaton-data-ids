  content: "In networks supporting IPv6, the Internet Control Message Protocol version
    6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of functions, and a correspondingly
    large number of message types and options. ICMPv6 is essential to the functioning
    of IPv6, but there are a number of security risks associated with uncontrolled
    forwarding of ICMPv6 messages. Filtering strategies designed for the corresponding
    protocol, ICMP, in IPv4 networks are not directly applicable, because these strategies
    are intended to accommodate a useful auxiliary protocol that may not be required
    for correct functioning.\n\n This document provides some recommendations for ICMPv6
    firewall filter configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6 messages that
    are needed to maintain the functioning of the network but drop messages that are
    potential security risks. This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "In commercial deployments Mobile IPv6 can be a service offered by a\nMobility
    Services Provider (MSP).  In this case all protocol\noperations may need to be
    explicitly authorized and traced, requiring\nthe interaction between Mobile IPv6
    and the AAA infrastructure.\nIntegrating the AAA infrastructure offers also a
    solution component\nfor Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in integrated and split scenarios.\n\nThis
    document describes various scenarios where a AAA interface for\nMobile IPv6 is
    actually required.  Additionally, it lists design\ngoals and requirements for
    such an interface.\n\t "

  content: "   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of\n
    \  object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use\n   by
    that working group.  This document describes the range of\n   identifiers that
    were assigned in that donated range, transfers\n   control of that range to IANA,
    and establishes IANA allocation\n   policies for any future assignments within
    that range.\n\n\t "

  content: "   H-VPLS is an architecture that follows hub-and-spoke connectivity \n
    \  model among VPLS aware devices and is proposed in [VPLS-LDP] for    \n   creating
    scalable VPLS implementations. To protect from failure of \n   the spoke PW or
    the failure of host PE-rs, MTU-s may be dual homed \n   to two PE-rs devices for
    a VPLS instance through primary spoke PW \n   and secondary(standby) spoke PW.
    The respective PE-rs devices(s) are \n   unaware of the primary or secondary status
    of spoke PWs. So\n   Broadcast, Unlearned unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic
    received \n   from full mesh core by a PE-rs is replicated to MTU-s over secondary
    \n   spoke PW to get dropped at MTU-s. In such scenerios it may be \n   desirable
    to block the standby spoke PW at PE-rs end with minimal \n   compromise on traffic
    disruption when MTU-s performs a switchover to \n   secondary spoke PW. This document
    proposes an extension to PW status\n   TLV defined in [RFC 4447] to signal Standby
    or Active state of PW by\n   MTU-s to PE-rs in a scalable manner. \n\n\t "

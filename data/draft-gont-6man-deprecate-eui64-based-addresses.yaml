  content: "   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for IPv6 typically\n   results
    in hosts configuring one or more stable addresses composed of\n   a network prefix
    advertised by a local router, and an Interface\n   Identifier that typically embeds
    a hardware address (e.g., an IEEE\n   LAN MAC address).  The security and privacy
    implications of embedding\n   hardware addresses in the Interface Identifier have
    been known and\n   understood for some time now, and some popular IPv6 implementations\n
    \  have already deviated from such scheme to mitigate these issues.\n   This document
    deprecates the use of hardware addresses in IPv6\n   Interface Identifiers, and
    recommends the use of an alternative\n   scheme ([I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses])
    for the generation\n   of IPv6 stable addresses.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The proliferating convolution of Internet and society increases the\n
    \  impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals.  Because of this,\n   the
    design and development of the architecture of the Internet also\n   has a growing
    impact on society.  This has led to an broad\n   recognition that human rights
    [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in\n   the development and management of the
    Internet [HRC2012] [UNGA2013]\n   [NETmundial].  It has also been argued that
    the Internet should be\n   strengthened as a human rights enabling environment
    [Brown].\n\n   This document provides a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the\n
    \  relation between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of\n   the
    discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,\n   a proposal
    for the mapping of the relation between human rights and\n   technical concepts,
    and a proposal for guidelines for human rights\n   considerations, similar to
    the work done on the guidelines for\n   privacy considerations [RFC6973].\n\n

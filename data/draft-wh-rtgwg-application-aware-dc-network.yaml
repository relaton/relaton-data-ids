  content: "   The deployment of large-scale AI services within data centers\n   introduces
    significant challenges to established technologies,\n   including load balancing
    and congestion control.  Additionally, the\n   adoption of cutting-edge network
    technologies, such as in-network\n   computing, is on the rise within AI-centric
    data centers.  These\n   advanced network-assisted application acceleration technologies\n
    \  necessitate the flexible exchange of cross-layer interaction\n   information
    between end-hosts and network nodes.\n\n   The Application-aware Data Center Network
    (APDN) leverages the\n   Application-aware Networking (APN) framework for application
    side to\n   furnish the data center network with detailed application-aware\n
    \  information.  This approach facilitates the rapid advancement of\n   network-application
    co-design technologies.  This document delves\n   into the use cases of APDNs
    and outlines the associated requirements,\n   setting the stage for enhanced performance
    and efficiency in data\n   center operations tailored to the demands of AI services.\n\n\t "

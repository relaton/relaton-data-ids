  content: "   BGP speakers learn their next hop addresse for NLRI in [RFC4271] in\n
    \  the NEXT_HOP field and in [RFC4760] in the \"Network Address of Next\n   Hop\"
    field.  Under certain circumstances, it might be desirable for a\n   BGP speaker
    to know both the next hops and the next-next hops of NLRI\n   to make optimal
    forwarding decisions.  One such example is global\n   load balancing (GLB) in
    a Clos network.\n\n   [I-D.ietf-idr-entropy-label] defines the \"Next Hop Dependent\n
    \  Capabilities Attribute\" (NHC) which allows a BGP speaker to signal\n   the
    forwarding capabilities associated with a given next hop.\n\n   This document
    defines a new NHC capability, the Next-next Hop Nodes\n   (NNHN) capability, which
    can be used to advertise the next-next hop\n   nodes associated with a given next
    hop.\n\n\t "

  content: "A BGP route associates an address prefix with a set of autonomous\nsystems
    (AS) that identify the interdomain path the prefix has\ntraversed in the form
    of BGP announcements.  This set is represented\nas the AS_PATH attribute in BGP
    and starts with the AS that\noriginated the prefix.  To help reduce well-known
    threats against BGP\nincluding prefix mis-announcing and monkey-in-the-middle
    attacks, one\nof the security requirements is the ability to validate the\norigination
    AS of BGP routes.  More specifically, one needs to\nvalidate that the AS number
    claiming to originate an address prefix\n(as derived from the AS_PATH attribute
    of the BGP route) is in fact\nauthorized by the prefix holder to do so.  This
    document describes a\nsimple validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.\n\t "

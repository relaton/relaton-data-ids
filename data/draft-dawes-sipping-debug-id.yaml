  content: "Networks that use SIP to start and stop sessions between their users\nwill
    frequently be upgraded with software and hardware changes.\nUsers will similarly
    frequently change their client software and the\nway they use the network.  In
    order to allow troubleshooting and\nregression testing, it is useful to provide
    debugging as part of the\nnetwork fabric.  This draft describes a SIP private
    header that\ntriggers logging of SIP signalling and identifies logs at mulitiple\nSIP
    entities as belonging to a single end-to-end session.\n\t "

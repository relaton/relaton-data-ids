  content: "   This document defines a Three Color Marker (TCM), which can be used\n
    \  as component in a Diffserv traffic conditioner [RFC2475, RFC2474].\n   The
    TCM meters a traffic stream and marks its packets according to\n   three traffic
    parameters, Committed Information Rate (CIR), Committed\n   Burst Size (CBS),
    and Excess Burst Size (EBS), to be either green,\n   yellow, or red.  The TCM
    is useful, for example, in policing a\n   service, where green, yellow, and red
    packets are forwarded with\n   increasing discard probability.\n\n\t "

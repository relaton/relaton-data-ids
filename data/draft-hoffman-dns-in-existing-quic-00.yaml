  content: "   Intermediaries such as governments and ISPs spoof DNS responses, and\n
    \  block DNS requests to particular recursive resolvers, for a variety\n   of
    reasons.  They spoof by capturing traffic on port 53, or by\n   redirecting port
    853 traffic in the hopes that the client is using\n   opportunistic encryption.
    \ They block if they know the address of a\n   resolver that they don't like,
    such as public resolvers that give\n   honest answers.\n\n   This document describes
    how to run DNS service over existing QUIC\n   connections, such as those being
    used for HTTP for basic web service.\n   This design prevents intermediaries from
    spoofing DNS responses, and\n   makes it impossible for intermediaries to block
    the use of those\n   recursive resolvers without blocking the desired HTTP connections.\n
    \  It also prevents intermediaries or passive observers from seeing the\n   DNS
    traffic.  This design is meant for communication between a DNS\n   stub resolver
    and a DNS recursive resolver.\n\n\t "

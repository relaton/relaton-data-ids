  content: "This document describes Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP) \nused
    for realizing and managing Overlay Multicast, as also known as \nApplication Layer
    Multicast. Overlay Multicast is a data delivery \nscheme for multicast applications,
    in which one or more \nintermediate relay agents are employed for relaying application
    \ndata from a sender to many receivers along a pre-configured or \nautomatically
    configured tree hierarchy. For standardization of \nOverlay Multicast, it needs
    to separate the data plane (for packet \nrelaying) and the control plane (for
    tree configuration and session \nmonitoring). We describe a control protocol for
    Overlay Multicast, \nnamed Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP). In OMCP,
    a \nspecial-purpose entity, called Session Manager, is used to manage \nand control
    the tree configuration and session monitoring. OMCP is \ndesigned to ensure that
    the multicast applications and services can \nbe provided over current Internet
    environments in which IP \nmulticast has not completely been deployed. \n\t "

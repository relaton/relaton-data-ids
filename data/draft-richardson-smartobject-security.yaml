  content: "   This is a position paper for the pre-IETF83 Workshop on Smart Object\n
    \  Security.  The author contends that layer-2 security solutions are\n   not
    only in-adequate, but may in fact be harmful when deployed into\n   smart object
    systems.  While layer-2 security services may be\n   valuable, they must be channel
    bound up to the layer-7 application\n   layer.\n\n\t "

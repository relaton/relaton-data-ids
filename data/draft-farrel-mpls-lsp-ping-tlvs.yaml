  content: "Techniques for detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) data\nplane
    failures are described in RFC 4379 and include the definition\nof a control protocol
    for testing and verifying Label Switched Path\n(LSP) connectivity that is known
    as LSP Ping. The protocol consists\nof a set of messages each of which contains
    data encoded as TLVs.\n\nThe LSP Ping protocol is being extended for several related
    uses.\nEach extension gives rise to the definition of new TLVs to be carried\non
    the existing protocol messages.\n\nThe LSP Ping specification makes it mandatory
    that all TLVs are\nunderstood by each participating Label Switching Router (LSR)
    that\nreceives an LSP Ping message. This makes future extensibility hard\nwithout
    upgrading all LSRs in the network.\nThis document defines ranges in the TLV codepoint
    space so that TLVs\nmay be associated with different processing rules within an
    LSR if\nthe TLV is unknown. This will make extensibility more simple.\n\t "

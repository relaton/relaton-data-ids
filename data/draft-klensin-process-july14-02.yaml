abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The IETF has designed process changes over the last ten years in one of
    two ways: announcement by the IESG, sometimes based on informal agreements with
    limited community involvement and awareness, and formal use of the same mechanism
    used for protocol specification. The first mechanism has often proven to be too
    lightweight, the second too heavyweight.\n\n This document specifies a middle-ground
    approach to the system of making changes to IETF process, one that relies heavily
    on a \"propose and carry out an experiment, evaluate the experiment, and then
    establish permanent procedures based on operational experience\" model rather
    than those previously attempted. This document specifies an Internet Best Current
    Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.\n\t "

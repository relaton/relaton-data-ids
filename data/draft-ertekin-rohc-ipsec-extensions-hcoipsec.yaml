  content: "Integrating RoHC with IPsec (RoHCoIPsec) offers the combined benefits\n
    \  of IP security services and efficient bandwidth utilization.  Before\n   this
    can be realized, however, several extensions to the Security\n   Policy Database
    (SPD), the Security Association Database (SAD), and\n   the IPsec process are
    required.  This document describes the IPsec\n   extensions required to support
    RoHCoIPsec.\n\t "

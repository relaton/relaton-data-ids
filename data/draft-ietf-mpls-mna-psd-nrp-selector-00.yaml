  content: "   A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network\n   resources
    and associated policies on each of a connected set of links\n   in the underlay
    network.  An NRP could be used as the underlay to\n   support one or a group of
    enhanced VPN services.  Multiple NRPs can\n   be created by network operator to
    meet the diverse requirements of\n   different enhanced VPN services.  In packet
    forwarding, some fields\n   in the data packet needs to be used as the NRP Selector
    to identify\n   the NRP the packet belongs to, so that the NRP-specific processing\n
    \  can be executed on the packet.\n\n   This document proposes a mechanism to
    carry the NRP Selector ID and\n   related information in MPLS packets.  The procedure
    for processing\n   the NRP Selector ID and related information is also specified.\n\n\t "

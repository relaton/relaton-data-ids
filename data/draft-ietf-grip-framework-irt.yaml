  content: "   The purpose of this document is to express the general Internet\n   community's
    expectations of Computer Security Incident Response\n   Teams (CSIRTs). It is
    not possible to define a set of requirements\n   that would be appropriate for
    all teams, but it is possible and\n   helpful to list and describe the general
    set of topics and issues\n   which are of concern and interest to constituent
    communities.\n\n   CSIRT constituents have a legitimate need and right to fully\n
    \  understand the policies and procedures of 'their' Computer Security\n   Incident
    Response Team.  One way to support this understanding is to\n   supply detailed
    information which users may consider, in the form of\n   a formal template completed
    by the CSIRT.  An outline of such a\n   template and a filled in example are provided.\n\t "

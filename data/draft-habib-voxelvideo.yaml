  content: "   This document proposes the VoxelVideo format, a file structure\n   designed
    specifically for the efficient handling, playback, and\n   livestreaming of 3D
    voxel-based videos.  The format is intended for\n   applications in gaming, virtual
    reality, live sports, and interactive\n   media, providing a robust framework
    for managing complex 3D data with\n   spatial precision and color fidelity.  This
    document describes the\n   current JSON-based version and outlines future plans
    to adopt a more\n   efficent, compressed format.\n\n\t "

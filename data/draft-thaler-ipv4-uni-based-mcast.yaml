  content: "This specification defines an extension to the multicast\naddressing architecture
    of the IP Version 4 protocol.  The\nextension presented in this document allows
    for unicast-prefix-\nbased allocation of multicast addresses.  By delegating multicast\naddresses
    at the same time as unicast prefixes, network operators\nwill be able to identify
    their multicast addresses without needing\nto run an inter-domain allocation protocol.\n\t "

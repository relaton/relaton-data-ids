  content: "   This document proposes an alternative 6rd deployment model to that
    of\n   RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to\n   IPv6
    networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd\n   requires
    support by a device (the 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which\n   must also be
    assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model\n   described in this document
    initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an\n   operator-owned gateway collocated with
    the operator's IPv4 network\n   edge, rather than from customer equipment.  The
    advantages of this\n   approach is that it requires no modification to customer
    equipment\n   and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The\n
    \  latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth\n   environment.\n\n\t "

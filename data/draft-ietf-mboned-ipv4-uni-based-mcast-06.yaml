  content: "This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing architecture
    of the IP Version 4 protocol.  The extension presented in this document allows
    for unicast-prefix-based assignment of multicast addresses.  By delegating multicast
    addresses at the same time as unicast prefixes, network operators will be able
    to identify their multicast addresses without needing to run an inter-domain allocation
    protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

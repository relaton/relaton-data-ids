  content: "   This document introduces the Glass to Glass Internet Ecosystem\n   (GGIE).
    \ GGIE's purpose is to improve how the Internet is used create\n   and consume
    video, both amateur and professional, reflecting that the\n   line between amateur
    and professional video technology is\n   increasingly blurred.  Glass to Glass
    refers to the entire video\n   ecosystem, from the camera lens to the viewing
    screen.  As the name\n   implies, GGIE's scope is the entire video ecosystem from
    capture,\n   through the steps of editing, packaging, distributed and searching,\n
    \  and finally viewing.  GGIE is not a complete end to end architecture\n   or
    solution, it provides foundational elements that can serve as\n   building blocks
    for new Internet video innovation.\n\n   This is a companion effort to the GGIE
    W3C Taskforce in the W3C Web\n   and TV Interest Group.\n\n   This document is
    being discussed on the ggie@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t "

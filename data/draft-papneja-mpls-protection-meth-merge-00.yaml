  content: "This draft provides the methodology for benchmarking MPLS Protection \nmechanisms
    especially the failover time of local protection (MPLS Fast \nReroute as defined
    in RFC-4090). The failover to a backup tunnel could \nhappen at the headend of
    the primary tunnel or a midpoint and the backup \ncould offer link or node protection.
    It becomes vital to benchmark the \nfailover time for all the cases and combinations.
    The failover time \ncould also greatly differ based on the design and implementation
    and by \nfactors like the number of prefixes carried by the tunnel, the routing
    \nprotocols that installed these prefixes (IGP, BGP...), the number of \nprimary
    tunnels affected by the event that caused the failover, number \nof primary tunnels
    the backup protects and type of failure, the physical \nmedia  type  on  which
    \ the  failover  occurs  etc.  All  the  required \nbenchmarking criteria and
    benchmarking topology required for measuring \nfailover time of local protection
    is described Conventions used in this \ndocument \n\t "

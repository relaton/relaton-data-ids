  content: "This document describes a new OAM protocol - TraceFlow that captures \ninformation
    pertaining to a traffic flow along the path that the flow \ntakes through the
    network. TraceFlow is ECMP and link-aggregation \n \n \n aware and captures the
    information about constituent members through \nwhich the traffic flow passes.
    TraceFlow gathers information that is \nrelevant to the flow such as interface
    address, interface statistics, \neffect of network policies on the flow and so
    on. \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described

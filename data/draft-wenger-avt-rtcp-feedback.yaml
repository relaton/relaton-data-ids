  content: "Real-time media streams are not resilient against packet losses. RTP\n[1]
    provides all the necessary mechanisms to restore ordering and\ntiming to properly
    reproduce a media stream at the recipient.  RTP\nalso provides continuous feedback
    about the overall reception quality\nfrom all receivers -- thereby allowing the
    sender(s) in the mid-term\n(in the order of several seconds to minutes) to adapt
    their coding\nscheme and transmission behavior to the observed network QoS.\nHowever,
    except for a few payload specific mechanisms [2], RTP makes\nno provision for
    timely feedback that would allow a sender to repair\nthe media stream immediately:
    through retransmissions, retro-active\nFEC, or media-specific mechanisms such
    as reference picture\nselection.\n\t "

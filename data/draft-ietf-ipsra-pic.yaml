  content: "This document presents a Pre-IKE Credential (PIC) provisioning protocol.\nPIC
    is a method to bootstrap IPsec authentication via an 'Authentication\nServer'
    (AS) and user authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS. PIC\nhappens before IKE
    (the Internet Key Exchange protocol).  The client\nmachine communicates with the
    AS using a key exchange protocol where\nonly the server is authenticated, and
    the derived keys are used to\nprotect the user authentication.  Once the user
    is authenticated, the\nclient machine obtains credentials from the AS that can
    be later used to\nauthenticate the client in a standard IKE exchange, with no
    user\nintervention. The proposed key exchange is based on ISAKMP (the Internet\nSecurity
    Association and Key Management Protocol), similar to a\nsimplified IKE exchange.
    Arbitrary user authentication is supported via\nthe use of EAP (the PPP Extensible
    Authentication Protocol).\n\t "

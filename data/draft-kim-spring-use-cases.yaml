  content: "   In the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture, an SDN\n   controller
    establishes flow paths.  An SDN controller provides global\n   optimization of
    paths by controlling all managed switches.  However,\n   long flow setup time
    and failure recovery problems arise due to\n   control overhead of an SDN controller.
    \ Segment routing provides\n   source routing function by designating an explicit
    path.  SDN and\n   segment routing can be combined to provide both global optimization\n
    \  and better performance.  In this document, we illustrate SDN segment\n   routing
    use cases of flow setup, failure recovery, Content\n   Distribution Network(CDN),
    and dual homing.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a Certificate Management protocol using CMS\n(CMC).
    \ This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the\nInternet PKI community:\n1.
    The need for an interface to public key certification products\nand    services
    based on [CMS] and [PKCS10], and\n2. The need in [SMIMEV3] for a certificate enrollment
    protocol for\nDSA-signed certificates with Diffie-Hellman public keys.\n\n   A
    small number of additional services are defined to supplement the\n   core certificate
    request service.\n\t "

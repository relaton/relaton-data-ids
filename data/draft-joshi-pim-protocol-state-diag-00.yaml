  script: Latn
  content: "Multicast networks are being deployed in large numbers.  It becomes\n
    \  very important that, proper mechanisms are in place for\n   troubleshooting
    error conditions and diagnosing other failure\n   situations.  Since multicasting
    has little support from IP in this\n   matter (since ICMP does not support multicasting
    and broadcasting) it behooves that, multicast routing protocols, embed these features
    in\n   themselves.\n\n   There are various debugging tools available to debug
    Multicast\n   connectivity [ssmping][3] and to trace multicast routes [mtrace][4]\n
    \  but there is none to diagnose, troubleshoot routing protocol states.\n   Since
    PIM protocol family is probably the most widely used multicast\n   routing protocol,
    this draft suggests an extension to PIM protocol to\n   diagnose and troubleshoot
    various PIM states in PIM routers.\n\t "

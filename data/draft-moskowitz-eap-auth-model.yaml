  content: "There is considerable confusion surrounding authentication styles\nand
    the nature of the resulting trust.  This paper is an attempt to\ndevelop categories
    of authentication methods and present examples of\neach.  In so doing, it develops
    an Authentication Functional\nLayering Model.  It will look at the components
    of authentication,\nthe flows, channels, algorithms, and entities.  The taxonomy\npresented
    here is new; it has been created to facilitate discussion\nand understanding.
    \ Only two-party authentications are presented\nhere.\n\n\t "

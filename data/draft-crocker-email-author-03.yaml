  content: "   Internet mail defines the From: header field to indicate the author\n
    \  of the message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who\n   initially
    handled the message, on the author's behalf.  The Sender:\n   field is optional,
    if it has the same information as the From: field.\n   This was not a problem,
    until development of stringent protections on\n   use of the From: field.  It
    has prompted Mediators, such as mailing\n   lists, to modify the From: field,
    to circumvent mail rejection caused\n   by those protections.  In effect, the
    From: field has become\n   dominated by its role as a handling identifier.\n\n
    \  The current specification augments the altered use of the From:\n   field,
    by specifying the Author: field, which ensures identification\n   of the original
    author of the message and is not subject to\n   modification by Mediators.  This
    version is published as an\n   Experiment, to assess community interest, functional
    efficacy, and\n   technical adequacy.\n\n\t "

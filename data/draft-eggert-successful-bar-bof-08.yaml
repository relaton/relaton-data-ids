  content: "   New work is typically brought to the IETF by a group of interested\n
    \  individuals.  IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to\n   hold
    informal get-togethers to discuss and develop their ideas.  Such\n   side meetings,
    which are not reflected in the IETF meeting agenda and\n   have no official status,
    are often half-jokingly referred to as \"bar\n   BOF\" sessions, to acknowledge
    that some of them may eventually lead\n   to a proposal for an official IETF BOF
    (\"birds of a feather\" session)\n   on a given topic.\n\n   During recent IETF
    meetings, many such \"bar BOF\" get-togethers have\n   been organized and moderated
    in ways that made them increasingly\n   indistinguishable from official IETF BOFs
    or sometimes even IETF\n   working group meetings.\n\n   This document argues
    that this recent trend is not helpful in\n   reaching the ultimate goal of many
    of these get-togethers, i.e., to\n   efficiently discuss and develop ideas for
    new IETF work.  It\n   encourages the organizers to consider the benefits of holding
    them in\n   much less formal settings, and to also consider alternative means
    to\n   develop their ideas.  This document also recommends that the\n   community
    abandon the term \"bar BOF\" and instead use other terms such\n   \"side meeting\",
    in order to stress the unofficial nature of these\n   get-togethers.\n\n\t "

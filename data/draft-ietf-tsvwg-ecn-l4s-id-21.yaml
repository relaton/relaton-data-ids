  content: "   This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network\n
    \  service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (L4S).\n   L4S
    uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP\n   layer that
    is similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach,\n   except as specified
    within.  L4S uses 'scalable' congestion control,\n   which induces much more frequent
    control signals from the network and\n   it responds to them with much more fine-grained
    adjustments, so that\n   very low (typically sub-millisecond on average) and consistently
    low\n   queuing delay becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising\n
    \  link utilization.  Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can\n   have
    high bandwidth and very low delay at the same time, even during\n   periods of
    high traffic load.\n\n   The L4S identifier defined in this document distinguishes
    L4S from\n   'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic.  It gives an incremental\n
    \  migration path so that suitably modified network bottlenecks can\n   distinguish
    and isolate existing traffic that still follows the\n   Classic behaviour, to
    prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and\n   low loss of L4S traffic.  This
    specification defines the rules that\n   L4S transports and network elements need
    to follow with the intention\n   that L4S flows neither harm each other's performance
    nor that of\n   Classic traffic.  Examples of new active queue management (AQM)\n
    \  marking algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like\n   or
    real-time) are specified separately.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Many applications that desire to use SCTP have requested the ability\n
    \  to \"reset\" a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is to start\n   the
    numbering sequence of the stream back at 'zero' with a\n   corresponding notification
    to the upper layer that this act as been\n   performed.  The applications that
    have requested this feature\n   normally desire it so that they can \"re-use\"
    streams for different\n   purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number
    for the\n   application to track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature,\n
    \  a new use on an old stream would result in message numbers larger\n   than
    expected without a protocol mechanism to \"start the streams back\n   at zero\".
    \ This documents presents also a method for resetting the\n   transport sequence
    numbers and all stream sequence numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

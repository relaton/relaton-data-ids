  content: "   Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6 [1] minimizes the amount of service\n
    \  disruption when performing layer-3 handovers. This draft extends the\n   Fast
    Handover protocol with a simultaneous bindings function to\n   minimize packet
    loss at the MN. Traffic for the MN is therefore\n   bicast or n-cast for a short
    period to its current location and to\n   one or more locations where the MN is
    expected to move to shortly.\n   This removes the timing ambiguity regarding when
    to start sending\n   traffic for the MN to its new point of attachment following
    a Fast\n   Handover and allows the decoupling of layer-2 and layer-3 handovers.\n
    \  It also saves the MN periods of service disruption in the case of\n   ping-pong
    movement.\n\t "

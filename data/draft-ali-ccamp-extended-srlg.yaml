  content: "     SRLGs play a key role in routing resiliency and capacity planning
    of\n     multi-domain and multi-layer networks. Notion of SRLG are used to select
    a\n     backup path that is disjoint from the primary path, to ensure disjointness\n
    \    of circuits and to avoid catastrophic partitioning outages.\n\n     In the
    current specifications, SRLG is identified as a 32 bit number that\n     is unique
    within an IGP domain [RFC4202]. There are many limitations to\n     this approach
    of encoding SRLGs, especially in a multi-layer network. This\n     draft outlines
    these limitations and suggests components of extended SRLG\n     encoding scheme
    to address them.\n\n     \n\t "

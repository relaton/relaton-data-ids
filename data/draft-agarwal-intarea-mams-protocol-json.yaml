  content: "   Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple\n   communication
    networks based on different technology implementations\n   and network architectures
    like WiFi, LTE, DSL.  In such multi-\n   connectivity scenario, it is desirable
    to combine multiple access\n   networks or select the best one to improve quality
    of experience for\n   a user and improve overall network utilization and efficiency.
    \ This\n   document presents the control plane message definitions and their\n
    \  presentations in JSON, for control plane procedures for configuring\n   the
    user plane in a multi access management services (MAMS) framework\n   that can
    be used to flexibly select the combination of uplink and\n   downlink access and
    core network paths, and user plane treatment for\n   improving network efficiency
    and enhanced application quality of\n   experience.\n\n\t "

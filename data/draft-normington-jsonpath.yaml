  content: "   JSONPath defines a string syntax for identifying values within a\n
    \  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document.\n\nNote\n\n   *This document is
    a work in progress and has not yet been published\n   as an Internet Draft* (which
    needs to be fixed soon).\n\nContributing\n\n   This document picks up the popular
    JSONPath specification dated\n   2007-02-21 and provides a normative definition
    for it.  In its\n   current state, it is a strawman document showing what needs
    to be\n   covered.\n\n   Comments and issues can be directed at the github repository
    _insert\n   repo here_ as well as (for the time when the more permanent home is\n
    \  being decided) at the dispatch@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   RADIUS crypto-agility was first mandated as future work by RFC 6421.\n
    \  The outcome of that work was the publication of RADIUS over TLS (RFC\n   6614)
    and RADIUS over DTLS (RFC 7360) as experimental documents.\n   Those transport
    protocols have been in wide-spread use for many years\n   in a wide range of networks.
    \ They have proven their utility as\n   replacements for the previous UDP (RFC
    2865) and TCP (RFC 6613)\n   transports.  With that knowledge, the continued use
    of insecure\n   transports for RADIUS has serious and negative implications for\n
    \  privacy and security.\n\n   The publication of the \"BlastRADIUS\" exploit
    has also shown that\n   RADIUS security needs to be updated.  It is no longer
    acceptable for\n   RADIUS to rely on MD5 for security.  It is no longer acceptable
    to\n   send device or location information in clear text across the wider\n   Internet.
    \ This document therefore deprecates many insecure practices\n   in RADIUS, and
    mandates support for secure TLS-based transport\n   layers.  Related security
    issues with RADIUS are discussed, and\n   recommendations are made for practices
    which increase both security\n   and privacy.\n\n\t "

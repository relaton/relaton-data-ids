abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the SlimWire Protocol (SWP) Core: a slim binary
    framing (record) layer and envelope format for interoperable agent/tool messaging
    with profile-based extensibility and a machine- verifiable conformance model.
    SWP Core provides a transport- independent message boundary definition (u32_be
    length prefix), a mandatory-to-implement envelope encoding (E1) based on unsigned
    LEB128 uvarints and length-delimited byte strings with a TLV extension block,
    and profile dispatch by numeric profile identifiers. Profiles define application
    semantics (e.g., tool invocation mapping and agent task lifecycle) and are carried
    opaquely by Core. This document also specifies conformance classes and golden
    vector artefacts executed by a spec-vector runner, and defines a security binding
    (S1) requiring an authenticated confidential channel (e.g., TLS 1.3).</p>"

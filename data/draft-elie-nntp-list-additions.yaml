  content: "This document defines a set of enhancements to the Network News Transfer
    Protocol (NNTP) that allow a client to request extended information from NNTP
    servers regarding server status, policy, and other aspects of local configuration.
    These enhancements are made as new keywords to the existing LIST capability described
    in RFC 3977.\n\n This memo updates and formalizes the LIST DISTRIBUTIONS and LIST
    SUBSCRIPTIONS commands defined in RFC 2980. It also adds the LIST COUNTS, LIST
    MODERATORS, and LIST MOTD commands, and specifies additional values returned by
    the existing LIST ACTIVE command for the status of a newsgroup. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

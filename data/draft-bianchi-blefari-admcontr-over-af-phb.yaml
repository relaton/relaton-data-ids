  content: "This memo shows that an AF PHB class, as defined in RFC 2597, is\ncapable
    of supporting explicit per flow admission control. Admission\ncontrol is obtained
    by a suitable use of two out of the three drop\nprecedence levels. Level 1 is
    dedicated to conforming accepted\ntraffic, i.e. traffic that has passed admission
    control test and\nconforms to edge-policing functions. Level 2 is used as an implicit\nsignaling
    pipe and acts as the core network support for the\nadmission control procedure.\n\n\t "

  content: "To enable seamless IP-layer handover of a mobile node (MN) from one access
    router (AR) to another, the MN is required to discover the identities and capabilities
    of candidate ARs (CARs) for handover prior to the initiation of the handover.
    \ The act of discovery of CARs has two aspects: identifying the IP addresses of
    the CARs and finding their capabilities.  This process is called \"candidate access
    router discovery\" (CARD).  At the time of IP-layer handover, the CAR, whose capabilities
    are a good match to the preferences of the MN, is chosen as the target AR for
    handover.  The protocol described in this document allows a mobile node to perform
    CARD.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

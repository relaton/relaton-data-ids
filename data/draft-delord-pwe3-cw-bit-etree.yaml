- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The extension described in this document allows a pair of PEs\n   connected
    via an Ethernet Pseudowire (PW) to signal via the use of\n   the Control Word
    (CW) whether the Ethernet frame encapsulated is\n   coming from a Root AC or a
    Leaf AC. This allows a PE receiving this\n   frame to decide whether it can be
    forwarded to a Leaf AC or not.\n   Such forward or drop decision is an additional
    filtering action\n   after the MAC-based forwarding decision. This applies to
    both P2P PW\n   and P2MP PW.\n\n\t "

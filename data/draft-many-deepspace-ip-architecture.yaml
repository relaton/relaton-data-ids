  content: "   Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars
    is\n   4-20 minutes) and intermittent communications, because of orbital\n   dynamics.
    \ The IP protocol stack used on Internet is based on\n   assumptions of shorter
    delays and mostly uninterrupted\n   communications.  This document describes the
    architecture of the IP\n   protocol stack tailored for its use in deep space.
    \ It involves\n   buffering IP packets in IP forwarders facing intermittent links,\n
    \  signaling buffer storage near capacity, adjusting transport protocols\n   configuration
    and application protocols timers.  This architecture\n   applies to Moon, Mars
    or in general interplanetary networking.\n\n\t "

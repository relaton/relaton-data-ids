  content: "   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol is a critical\n   component
    in the Internet to exchange routing information between\n   network domains.  Due
    to this central nature, it is an accepted best\n   practice to ensure basic security
    properties for BGP and BGP speaking\n   routers.  While these general principles
    are outlined in BCP194, it\n   does not provide a list of technical and implementation
    options for\n   securing BGP.\n\n   This document lists available options for
    securing BGP, serving as a\n   contemporary, non-exhaustive, repository of options
    and methods.  The\n   document explicitly does not make value statements on the
    efficacy of\n   individual techniques, not does it mandate or prescribe the use
    of\n   specific technique or implementations.\n\n   Operators are advised to carefully
    consider whether the listed\n   methods are applicable for their use-case to ensure
    best current\n   practices are followed in terms of which security properties
    need to\n   be ensured when operating BGP speakers.  Furthermore, the listed\n
    \  options in this document may change over time, and should not be used\n   as
    a timeless ground-truth of applicable or sufficient methods.\n\n\t "

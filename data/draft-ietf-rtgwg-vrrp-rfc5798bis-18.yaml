  content: "   This document defines version 3 of the Virtual Router Redundancy\n
    \  Protocol (VRRP) for IPv4 and IPv6.  It obsoletes RFC 5798 which\n   previously
    specified VRRP (version 3).  RFC 5798 obsoleted RFC 3768\n   which specified VRRP
    (version 2) for IPv4.  VRRP specifies an\n   election protocol that dynamically
    assigns responsibility for a\n   Virtual Router to one of the VRRP Routers on
    a LAN.  The VRRP Router\n   controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated
    with a Virtual\n   Router is called the Active Router, and it forwards packets
    routed to\n   these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Active Routers are configured with\n
    \  virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and Backup Routers infer the address\n   family
    of the virtual addresses being advertised based on the IP\n   protocol version.
    \ Within a VRRP Router, the Virtual Routers in each\n   of the IPv4 and IPv6 address
    families are independent of one another\n   and always treated as separate Virtual
    Router instances.  The\n   election process provides dynamic failover in the forwarding\n
    \  responsibility should the Active Router become unavailable.  For\n   IPv4,
    the advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher-availability\n   default path
    without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or\n   router discovery protocols
    on every end-host.  For IPv6, the\n   advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6
    is a quicker switchover to\n   Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard
    IPv6 Neighbor\n   Discovery mechanisms.\n\n\t "

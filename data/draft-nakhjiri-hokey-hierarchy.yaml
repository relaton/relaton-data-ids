  content: "   Problems related to AAA-based key management for facilitating\n   optimized
    secure handovers and re-authentications have been described\n   in several problem
    statements ([I-D.nakhjiri-aaa-hokey-ps],\n   [I-D.ohba-hokey-3party-keydist-ps]
    and [I-D.ietf-hokey-reauth-ps]).\n   This document provides description of an
    EAP initiated key hierarchy\n   as part of the solution for those problems.  Additionally
    a modified\n   version of the 3-party key distribution orocess\n   ([I-D.ohba-hokey-3party-keydist-ps])
    is proposed to provide a binding\n   between the generated/distributed keys and
    the parties using the\n   keys.  A new EAP method called EAP handover and re-authentication\n
    \  (EAP_HR) is also described to significantly reduce handover keying\n   and
    re-authentication latency.  AAA attributes and EAP type data\n   extensions are
    also covered.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses, with\n
    \  the URLs and request URLs that produced them, to transmit or store\n   them
    together.  They can include multiple top-level resources with\n   one identified
    as the default by a primaryUrl metadata, provide\n   random access to their component
    exchanges, and efficiently store\n   8-bit resources.\n\n\t "

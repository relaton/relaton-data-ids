  content: "   BFD mechanism [BFD] was original designed to detect failures in \n
    \  communication with a forwarding plane next hop. BFD operates on top \n   of
    any data protocol being forwarded between two systems. \n    \n   This document
    describes how to use the BFD mechanism for exchanging \n   OAM Notifications (e.g.
    AC and PWs Notifications) between OAM \n   domains, for P2P PWs (Single Hop PW,
    or Multiple Hop PW). This \n   proposal is presented as an alternative to the
    LDP Status Mechanism \n   described in [PW-CNTL]. \n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   With the development of network technologies, more and more\n   applications
    need to have a central control point for the network\n   elements in one administrative
    domain, such central control point is\n   a central control network element (CCNE).
    \ CCNE controls the network\n   elements in its administrative domain, the type
    of CCNE can be RR\n   Router, PCE Server, or a federation of RR Router and PCE
    Server, etc.\n   CCNE is developed from the traditional network element, which
    plus\n   some I2RS interfaces, can provide both traditional network services\n
    \  and I2RS services.\n\n   This document describes requirement and use cases
    for which I2RS can\n   be used for CCNE device.  The use cases described in this
    document\n   encompass: Control IP Network by RR Router, Control MPLS TE Network\n
    \  by PCE Server.  The goal is to inform the community's understanding\n   of
    where the I2RS CCNE extensions fit within the overall I2RS\n   architecture.  It
    is intended to provide a basis for the solutions\n   draft describing the set
    of interfaces for the CCNE device.\n\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic\n
    \  Optimization protocol [RFC7285].  The current ALTO Cost Services\n   allow
    applications to obtain cost values on an end-to-end path\n   defined by its source
    and destination.  The present extension\n   provides abstracted information on
    particular network parts or\n   elements traversed by a path between its source
    and destination.\n   Examples of such abstracted parts are networks, data centers
    or\n   links.  This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted\n
    \  by particular network parts they traverse or by their properties.\n   Applications
    having the choice among several connection paths may use\n   this information
    to select paths accordingly and improve their\n   performance.  In particular,
    they may infer that several paths share\n   common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks
    by avoiding such paths.\n   This document introduces a new cost type called Path
    Vector.  A Path\n   Vector is an array of entities that each identifies an abstracted\n
    \  representation of a network part and that are called Abstract Network\n   Element
    (ANE).  Each ANE is defined by a set of properties.  ANE\n   properties are conveyed
    by an ALTO information resource called\n   \"Property Map\", that can be packed
    together with the Path Vectors in\n   a multipart response.  They can also be
    obtained via a separate ALTO\n   request to a Property Map. An ALTO Property Map
    is an extension to\n   the ALTO protocol, that is specified in another document
    entitled\n   \"Unified Properties for the ALTO Protocol\"\n   [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].\n\n\t "

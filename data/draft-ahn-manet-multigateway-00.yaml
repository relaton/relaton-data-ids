  content: "   In MANET, nodes wishing to communicate with nodes in the wired\n   Internet,
    the global Internet connectivity is required and this\n   functionality can be
    achieved with the help of the Internet gateway\n   (IGW). For the support of reliability
    and flexibility, multiple IGWs\n   can be provisioned for a MANET. In this case,
    load-balancing becomes\n   one of the important issues since the network performance
    such as \n   the network throughput can be improved if the load of the IGW is\n
    \  well-balanced. In this draft, we categorize the load-balancing\n   mechanisms
    for the IPv6-based MANET with multiple IGWs and define\n   a new load-balancing
    metric computed from the hop distance and\n   the number of routing table entries.\n\t "

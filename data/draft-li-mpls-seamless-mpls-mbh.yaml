  content: "   Seamless MPLS architecture is proposed to integrate access and\n   aggregation/core
    networks into a single MPLS domain.  Through the\n   separation of the service
    and transport plane Seamless MPLS can\n   provide end to end service independent
    transport.  But when the\n   mobile backhaul network is integrated as the access/aggregation\n
    \  network with the core network based on Seamless MPLS architecture, it\n   will
    proposes new challenges other than the existing solutions for\n   Seamless MPLS.
    \ This document introduces the framework of Seamless\n   MPLS to integrate the
    mobile backhaul network and the core network.\n   The possible challenges of Seamless
    MPLS for mobile backhaul networks\n   are identified and new requirements are
    defined accordingly.\n\n\n\t "

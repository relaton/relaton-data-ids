  content: "   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes features to add\n
    \  functionality by extending the protocol.  It does not, however,\n   describe
    how those extensions are managed.  This document describes a\n   procedure for
    the registration and management of extensions to EPP\n   and it specifies a format
    for an IANA registry to record those\n   extensions.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This specification extends Message Layer Security (MLS) credentials\n
    \  framework with a new credential type, \"UserInfoVC\", based on the\n   OpenID
    Connect UserInfo Verifiable Credential type\n   \"UserInfoCredential\".  A UserInfo
    Verifiable Credential encapsulates\n   the UserInfo claims from the OpenID provider
    as a Verifiable\n   Credential that can be presented to a third-party Verifier.
    \ These\n   credentials can be easily provisioned to MLS clients using the OpenID\n
    \  Connect login flows, augmented with type \"UserInfoCredential\".  The\n   credential
    itself is an object associating identity attributes to the\n   signature public
    key that the client will use in MLS, signed by the\n   OpenID Provider.  In situations
    where the OpenID Provider is distinct\n   from the MLS Delivery Service, these
    credentials provide end-to-end\n   secure identity assurance.\n\n\t "

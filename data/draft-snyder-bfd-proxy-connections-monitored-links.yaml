  content: "   This document describes a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)\n
    \  proxy mechanism to allow intermediate networking equipment (ex:\n   Satellite
    HUB/Modem) to intercept BFD packets and to generate BFD\n   packets to relay the
    health of connection monitored links.\n\n   Note that this is an informational
    document that does not propose any\n   changes to the BFD protocol.\n\n\n\t "

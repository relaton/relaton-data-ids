  content: "The MEGACO/H.GCP draft protocol has several structures that are not com-\npletely
    defined, viz, how properties are described and grouped, the tem-\nplate concept,
    the package concept, etc.  There is also an extended\ndebate on the encoding of
    the protocol, and particularly, the encoding\nof the command parameters.  This
    contribution proposes a unified\napproach to all of these issues.  This Internet
    Draft was rushed to meet\nthe Oslo deadline. As such, it was not thoroughly reviewed,
    especially\nto see that this ID conformed to its referenced fundamental ideas
    on\ncapabilities.\n\n\n\t "

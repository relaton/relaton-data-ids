abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Cryptographically generated addresses (CGAs) provide a means of\ngenerating
    an IP address that is tied to a public key of a node.\nUsing this means, the address
    ownership of the node can be verified\nby using the public key of the node to
    decrypt data signed by the\nnode using its private key.  In AAA-based systems,
    there is currently\nno means of performing such absolute address ownership checks,
    since\naddress authorization is traditionally outside the scope of AAA.\nHowever,
    in some key generation protocols, it may be critical to\nperform address ownership
    verification or authorization before the\ngenerated key can be used.  When such
    key generation protocols are\nAAA-based, there is no known method of address authorization
    to allow\nthis operation.\n\nThis draft provides a means of IPv6 address generation
    using a shared\nsecret so that the IP address of a node can be verified by the
    entity\nwith which the node shares the secret.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft captures the authors' opinions and is intended to serve
    as\n   input to the discussion for the solution in the DNA WG.  It presents\n
    \  a few assumptions for DNA solution.  The draft proposes the solution\n   to
    be based on 1) link identity, 2) RS/RA exchange formed so that a\n   host can
    determine whether it has moved from a single RA, and 3)\n   Quick delivery of
    an RA.  The draft sketches what rough shape DNA\n   solution could take, including
    the necessary interaction with\n   Duplicate Address Detection and the Multicast
    Listener Discovery\n   protocol.  It also enumerate a few tasks to be worked on
    and issues\n   to be resolved for efficient DNA solution.\n\t "

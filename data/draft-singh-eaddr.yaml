  content: "ENUM uses NAPTR DNS Resource Records (RRs) to map an E.164 telephone\nnumber
    to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of other ways of\ncontacting (for example,
    by email) a specific resource. This memo\nproposes an ENUM-like service called
    EADDR where an email address,\ninstead of a telephone number, is used as the key
    to fetch other\ncontact URIs. At human level, EADDR seems more useful than ENUM\nbecause
    it is easier to remember an email address than a telephone\nnumber as the key.
    At machine level, both services are equally\nuseful.\n\t "

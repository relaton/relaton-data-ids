  content: "   Nested NATs or multi-layer NATs are already widely deployed.  They\n
    \  are characterized by two or more NAT devices in the path of packets\n   from
    the subscriber to the Internet.  Moreover, NAT devices current\n   deployed are
    PCP unaware and It is assumed that NAT aware PCP devices\n   will take a long
    time to be rolled out.  Therefore in order to lower\n   the adoption barrier of
    PCP and make it work for current deployed\n   networks, this document proposes
    a few mechanisms for PCP-enabled\n   applications to work through NATs with varying
    levels of PCP protocol\n   support.\n\n\n\t "

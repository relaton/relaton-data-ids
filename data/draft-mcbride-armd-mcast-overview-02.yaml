  content: "   There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts
    of\n   hosts in the data center.  These issues include the prevalent use of\n
    \  IP Multicast within the Data Center.  Its important to understand how\n   IP
    Multicast is being deployed in the Data Center to be able to\n   understand the
    surrounding issues with doing so.  This document\n   provides a quick survey of
    uses of multicast in the data center and\n   should serve as an aid to further
    discussion of issues related to\n   large amounts of multicast in the data center.\n\n\t "

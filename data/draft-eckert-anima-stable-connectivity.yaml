  content: "   OAM (Operations, Administration and Management) processes for data\n
    \  networks are often subject to the problem of circular dependencies\n   when
    relying on network connectivity of the network to be managed for\n   the OAM operations
    itself.  Provisioning during device/network bring\n   up tends to be far less
    easy to automate than service provisioning\n   later on, changes in core network
    functions impacting reachability\n   can not be automated either because of ongoing
    connectivity\n   requirements for the OAM equipment itself, and widely used OAM\n
    \  protocols are not secure enough to be carried across the network\n   without
    security concerns.\n\n   This document describes how to integrate OAM processes
    with the\n   autonomic control plane (ACP) in Autonomic Networks (AN). to provide\n
    \  stable and secure connectivity for those OAM processes.\n\n\t "

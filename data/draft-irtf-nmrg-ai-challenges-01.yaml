  content: "   This document is intended to introduce the challenges to overcome\n
    \  when Network Management (NM) problems may require to couple with\n   Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) solutions.  On the one hand, there are\n   many difficult problems
    in NM that to this date have no good\n   solutions, or where any solutions come
    with significant limitations\n   and constraints.  Artificial Intelligence may
    help produce novel\n   solutions to those problems.  On the other hand, for several
    reasons\n   (computational costs of AI solutions, privacy of data), distribution\n
    \  of AI tasks became primordial.  It is thus also expected that network\n   are
    operated efficiently to support those tasks.\n\n   To identify the right set of
    challenges, the document defines a\n   method based on the evolution and nature
    of NM problems.  This will\n   be done in parallel with advances and the nature
    of existing\n   solutions in AI in order to highlight where AI and NM have been\n
    \  already coupled together or could benefit from a higher integration.\n   So,
    the method aims at evaluating the gap between NM problems and AI\n   solutions.
    \ Challenges are derived accordingly, assuming solving\n   these challenges will
    help to reduce the gap between NM and AI.\n\n\t "

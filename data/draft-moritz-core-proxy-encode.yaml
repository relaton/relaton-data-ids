  content: "   The scope of this document is to propose a new option to be used in\n
    \  conjunction with the CoAP proxy mechanisms.  Several content types\n   can
    be converted stateless into each other.  The conversion may\n   result in much
    more efficient representation of the resource.  But\n   currently no mechanism
    exists to indicate the proxy to perform the\n   compression.\n\n\t "

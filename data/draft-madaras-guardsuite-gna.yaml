abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the GuardNet Authorization Protocol (GNA),
    a pre-execution authorization framework for high-risk digital and physical actions.
    GNA defines an enforcement model in which sensitive operations (for example, payments,
    administrative changes, OT/ICS commands, and AI-initiated actions) are intercepted
    before execution, evaluated against policy and context, routed to one or more
    authenticated approvers, and executed only after a valid authorization token is
    issued. GNA provides non-repudiable authorization receipts and is designed to
    integrate with existing identity providers and logging systems without requiring
    architectural changes. The protocol provides stronger authorization guarantees
    using digital signatures and contextual decisioning and is intended as a complement
    to, not a replacement for, existing authentication and monitoring systems.</p>"

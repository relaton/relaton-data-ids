  content: "   This draft introduces use cases related to network AI agents in 6G,\n
    \  with a focus on the interaction workflows of network AI agents in two\n   distinct
    scenarios: connectivity services and third-party application\n   services.  These
    use cases primarily draw upon 6G-related scenarios\n   outlined in the 3GPP technical
    report [TR22.870].  Furthermore, the\n   document elaborates on the integration
    of network AI agents within\n   the 6G framework and discusses corresponding network
    requirements.\n\n\t "

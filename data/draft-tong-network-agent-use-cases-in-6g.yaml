abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces use cases related to network AI agents in 6G,
    with a focus on the interaction workflows of network AI agents in two distinct
    scenarios: connectivity services and third-party application services. These use
    cases primarily draw upon 6G-related scenarios outlined in the 3GPP technical
    report [TR22.870]. Furthermore, the document elaborates on the integration of
    network AI agents within the 6G framework and discusses corresponding network
    requirements.</p>"

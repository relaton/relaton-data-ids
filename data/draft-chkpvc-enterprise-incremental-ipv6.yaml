  content: "   Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages of\n
    \  preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The\n   administrators
    face different challenges than operators of Internet\n   access providers, and
    have reasons for different priorities.  The\n   overall problem for many administrators
    will be to offer Internet-\n   facing services over IPv6, while continuing to
    support IPv4, and\n   while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.
    \ The\n   overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only\n   environment
    to a dual stack network environment and potentially an\n   IPv6-only operating
    mode.  This document helps provide a framework\n   for enterprise network architects
    or administrators who may be faced\n   with many of these challenges as they consider
    their IPv6 support\n   strategies.\n\n\t "

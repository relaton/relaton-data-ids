  content: "   Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become increasingly\n
    \  popular in recent years due to their impressive performance in\n   various
    natural language processing tasks.  These models are built by\n   training deep
    neural networks on massive amounts of text data, often\n   consisting of billions
    or even trillions of parameters.  However, the\n   training process for these
    models can be extremely resource-\n   intensive, requiring the deployment of thousands
    or even tens of\n   thousands of GPUs in a single AI training cluster.  Therefore,
    three-\n   stage or even five-stage CLOS networks are commonly adopted for AI\n
    \  networks.  The non-blocking nature of the network become increasingly\n   critical
    for large-scale AI models.  Therefore, adaptive routing is\n   necessary to dynamically
    load balance traffic to the same destination\n   over multiple ECMP paths, based
    on network capacity and even\n   congestion information along those paths.\n\n\n\t "

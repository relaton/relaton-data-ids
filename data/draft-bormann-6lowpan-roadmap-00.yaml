  content: "6LoWPAN is defined in RFC 4944 in conjunction with a number of\nspecifications
    that are currently nearing completion.  The entirety\nof these specifications
    may be hard to understand, pose specific\nimplementation problems, or be simply
    inconsistent.\n\nThe present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents
    as\nwell as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in\ncombination.
    \ In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even\ncorrections to the
    specifications referenced.\n\nThis guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress,
    i.e. a long-\nlived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information becomes\navailable
    and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed.\nSimilar to the ROHC implementation
    guide, RFC 4815, it might be\npublished as an RFC at some future time later in
    the acceptance curve\nof the specifications.\n\nThis document does not describe
    a new protocol or attempts to set a\nnew standard of any kind -- it mostly describes
    good practice in\nusing the existing specifications, but it may also document
    emerging\nconsensus where a correction needs to be made.\n\nThe current version
    -00 of this document is just an initial draft\nthat is intended to spark the collection
    of relevant information.\n\t "

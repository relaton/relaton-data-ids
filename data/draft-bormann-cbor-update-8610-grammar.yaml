- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   At the time of writing, the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)\n
    \  is defined by RFC 8610 and RFC 9165.  The latter has used the\n   extension
    point provided in RFC 8610, the _control operator_.\n\n   As CDDL is being used
    in larger projects, the need for corrections\n   and additional features has become
    known that cannot be easily mapped\n   into this single extension point.  Hence,
    there is a need for\n   evolution of the base CDDL specification itself.\n\n   The
    present document updates errata and makes other small fixes for\n   the ABNF grammar
    defined for CDDL in RFC 8610.\n\n\n   // Previous versions of the changes in this
    document were part of\n   // draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-2-draft and previously draft-bormann-cbor-\n
    \  // cddl-freezer.  This submission extracts out those grammar changes\n   //
    that are ready for WG adoption and publication.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The rapid proliferation of deep learning models has led to growing\n
    \  demands for low-latency and high-throughput inference across\n   heterogeneous
    environments.  While edge devices often host data\n   sources, their limited compute
    and network resources restrict\n   efficient model inference.  Cloud servers provide
    abundant capacity\n   but suffer from transmission delays and bottlenecks.  Emerging\n
    \  programmable in-network devices (e.g., switches, FPGAs, SmartNICs)\n   offer
    a unique opportunity to accelerate inference by processing\n   tasks directly
    along data paths.\n\n   This document introduces an architecture for _Distributed\n
    \  Collaborative Inference Acceleration_. It proposes mechanisms to\n   split,
    offload, and coordinate inference workloads across edge\n   devices, in-network
    resources, and cloud servers, enabling reduced\n   response time and improved
    utilization.\n\n\t "

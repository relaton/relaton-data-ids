  content: "   This document proposes Confirmation with Human in the Loop (HITL)\n
    \  Exchange of Quotations (CHEQ).  CHEQ allows humans to confirm\n   decisions
    and actions proposed by AI Agents prior to those decisions\n   being acted upon.
    \ It also allows humans to provide information\n   required for tool invocation,
    without disclosing that information to\n   the AI agent, protecting their privacy.
    \ CHEQ aims to guarantee that\n   AI Agent hallucinations cannot result in unwanted
    actions by the\n   human on whose behalf they are made.  CHEQ can be integrated
    into\n   protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the Agent-to-\n   Agent
    (A2A) protocols.  It makes use of a signed object which can be\n   carried in
    those protocols.\n\n\t "

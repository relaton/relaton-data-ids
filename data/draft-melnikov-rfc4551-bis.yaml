  content: "   Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes
    to\n   a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working on\n
    \  behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared\n   mailboxes.
    \ These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state\n   changes for messages
    within the mailbox.  They must be able to\n   guarantee that only one client can
    change message state (e.g.,\n   message flags) at any time.  An example of such
    an application is use\n   of an IMAP mailbox as a message queue with multiple
    dequeueing\n   clients.\n\n   The Conditional Store facility provides a protected
    update mechanism\n   for message state information that can detect and resolve
    conflicts\n   between multiple writing mail clients.\n\n   The Conditional Store
    facility also allows a client to quickly\n   resynchronize mailbox flag changes.\n\n
    \  This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501).\n\n\t "

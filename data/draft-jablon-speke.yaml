abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes SPEKE, B-SPEKE, and SRP-4, three methods for\npassword-based
    key agreement and authentication.  In the same class\nof techniques as SRP-3 [RFC
    2945], these methods provide a zero-\nknowledge proof of a password and authenticate
    session keys over an\nunprotected channel, with minimal dependency on infrastructure
    and\nproper user behavior.  These methods are compatible with IEEE 1363\nand ANSI
    X9 standards, and are closely aligned with RFC 2945 from an\napplication perspective.
    \ They use different techniques than earlier\npatented alternatives, and provide
    an expanded set of choices for\nconvenient and secure personal authentication
    over the Internet.\n\t "

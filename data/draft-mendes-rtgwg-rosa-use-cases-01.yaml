abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The proliferation of virtualization, microservices, and serverless\n
    \  architectures has made the deployment of services possible in more\n   than
    one network location, alongside long practised replication\n   within single network
    locations, such as within a CDN datacentre.\n   This necessitates the potential
    need to coordinate the steering of\n   (client-initiated) traffic towards different
    services and their\n   deployed instances across the network.\n\n   The term 'service-based
    routing' (SBR) captures the set of mechanisms\n   for said traffic steering, positioned
    as an anycast problem, in that\n   it requires the selection of one of the possibly
    many choices for\n   service execution at the very start of a service transaction,\n
    \  followed by the transfer of packets to that chosen service endpoint.\n\n   This
    document provides typical scenarios for service-based routing,\n   particularly
    for which a more dynamic and efficient (in terms of both\n   latency and signalling
    overhead) selection of suitable service\n   execution endpoints would not exhibit
    the overheads and thus latency\n   penalties experienced with existing explicit
    discovery methods.\n   Related drafts introduce the design for an in-band service
    discovery\n   method instead, named Routing on Service Addresses (ROSA), based
    on\n   the insights from the use case and problem discussion in this draft.\n\n\t "

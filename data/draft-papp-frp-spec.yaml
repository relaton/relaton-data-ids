  content: "Firewalls are used to get controlled and secure connection between\nnetworks,
    e.g. a company's internal network and the Internet. \nPreferably the firewall
    is the only link between the networks to be\nable to guarantee a certain level
    of security. The firewall is a \ncritical node in the network and if it would
    fail the result is \nlost connection between the networks.\n\nTo ensure reliability
    and connectivity we add redundancy, i.e. a\nnumber of parallel firewalls are installed
    which will act as backups\nfor each other.\n\n\t "

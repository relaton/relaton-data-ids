  content: "We describe distributed interactive simulation (DIS) scenarios from the
    vantage point of hardware and software vendors who would need to address the network
    implications and requirements to enable large scale networked multiplayer virtual
    worlds. This document is meant to migrate the knowledge of the traditional Department
    of Defense (DoD) modeling and simulation community into tangible design metrics
    for the commercial networking community [2]. [Note: The term 'DIS' is used here
    generically to describe the type of simulations used to implement these scenarios.
    It does not imply the use of IEEE 1278.1 protocols[1], frequently referred to
    as DIS protocols.]\n\t "

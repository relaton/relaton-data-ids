  content: "Since the introduction of X.400(84), there has been work ongoing for defining
    mappings between MHS and RFC-822.  The most recent work in this area is RFC-1327
    [3], which focuses primarily on translation of envelope and headers.  This document
    is complimentary to RFC-1327 as it focuses on translation of the message body.

  script: Latn
  content: "The ability to sustain continuous growth of the Internet is affected both
    by the ability of the Internet routing system to scale, and by the availability
    of IP addresses that are unique within the Internet.  We argue that scalable routing
    and efficient address space utilization should not be treated as two separate
    problems, but as two inter-related facets of a single problem - how to scale the
    Internet.                           Unfortunately, scalable routing and efficient
    address space utilization do not come for free: they sometimes require renumbering
    of existing hosts to new addresses or otherwise undersirable address allocations.
    We propose to use financial incentives rather than just the existing methods of
    persuasion and coercion to motivate IP address assignment that is efficient both
    with respect to its suitability for aggregation (via hierarchical routing), and
    with respect to the address space utilization. We argue that where tradeoffs must
    be made between conflicting goals, use of financial incentives will permit local
    decisions that take into account local differences, thus leading to better choices
    than could be made by any centralized administrative body.\n\t "

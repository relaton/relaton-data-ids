  content: "   RBridges are devices that implement the IETF TRILL (Transparent\n   Interconnection
    of Lots of Links, RFC 6325) protocol. The Link Layer\n   Discovery Protocol (LLDP,
    IEEE Std 802.1AB) is a one-way,\n   unacknowledged protocol for the announcement
    of a station's\n   capabilities to its peers.  The set of peers that receive these\n
    \  frames and the scoping of the frame is primarily determined by the\n   destination
    MAC address of the LLDP frame.  This document specifies a\n   Nearest-RBridge
    MAC address and other details of TRILL support of\n   LLDP. It updates RFC 6325.\n\n\n\t "

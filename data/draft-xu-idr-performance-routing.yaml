  content: "   The current BGP specification doesn't use network performance metrics\n
    \  (e.g., network latency) in the route selection decision process.\n   This document
    describes a performance-based BGP routing mechanism in\n   which network latency
    metric is taken as one of the route selection\n   criteria.  This routing mechanism
    is useful for those server\n   providers with global reach to deliver low-latency
    network\n   connectivity services to their customers.\n\n\t "

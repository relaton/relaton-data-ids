abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft analyzes the behaviors that residential end users and home\n
    \  network owners (e.g., parents of young children) might experience\n   when
    operating systems and clients support [I-D.ietf-add-ddr] and/or\n   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr]
    for discovery of encrypted DNS services and the CE\n   router of the home network
    offers itself as the Do53 resolver.  This\n   use case is explicitly mentioned
    in [I-D.ietf-add-requirements]\n   Section 3.2 and has several requirements related
    to it.  This draft\n   has two goals: determine if the analysis it provides is
    accurate and,\n   if it is accurate, determine if the behavior is acceptable to
    the WG\n   or if there should be changes to either of the discovery mechanisms.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Fast Notification for Traffic Engineering and Load Balancing (FaNTEL)\n
    \  enables real-time dissemination of network events such as link\n   failure,
    congestion, or load imbalance.  However, unbounded flooding\n   of FaNTEL messages
    can lead to control plane overload and state\n   explosion.\n\n   This document
    defines a scoping mechanism for FaNTEL based on IGP\n   area boundaries.  It formally
    specifies the concept of a FaNTEL Area,\n   the structure of scoped notification
    messages, and the precise\n   forwarding behavior within and across areas.  The
    mechanism leverages\n   existing IGP topological partitions (e.g., OSPF areas,
    IS-IS levels)\n   to contain message propagation, ensuring rapid local response
    while\n   preventing unnecessary global churn.  This document focuses\n   exclusively
    on the propagation model and provides normative rules for\n   implementation.\n\n\t "

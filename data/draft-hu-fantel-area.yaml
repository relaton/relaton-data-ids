abstract:
- content: "<p>Fast Notification for Traffic Engineering and Load Balancing (FaNTEL)
    enables real-time dissemination of network events such as link failure, congestion,
    or load imbalance. However, unbounded flooding of FaNTEL messages can lead to
    control plane overload and state explosion. This document defines a scoping mechanism
    for FaNTEL based on IGP area boundaries. It formally specifies the concept of
    a FaNTEL Area, the structure of scoped notification messages, and the precise
    forwarding behavior within and across areas. The mechanism leverages existing
    IGP topological partitions (e.g., OSPF areas, IS-IS levels) to contain message
    propagation, ensuring rapid local response while preventing unnecessary global
    churn. This document focuses exclusively on the propagation model and provides
    normative rules for implementation.</p>"

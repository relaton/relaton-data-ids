  content: "   This document provides a problem statement for the Trust Anchor\n   Management
    Birds of a Feather (BOF).  A trust anchor represents an\n   authoritative entity
    via a public key and associated data.  The\n   public key is used to verify digital
    signatures and the associated\n   data is used to constrain the types of information
    for which the\n   trust anchor is authoritative.  Relying parties use trust anchors
    to\n   determine if digitally signed objects are valid by verifying digital\n
    \  signatures using the trust anchor's public key and by enforcing the\n   constraints
    expressed in the associated data.  This document\n   describes some of the problems
    associated with the lack of a standard\n   trust anchor management mechanism as
    well as problems that must be\n   addressed by such a mechanism.\n\n\t "

    \  Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) that will address issues\n   encountered

    issues are happenned when there are\n   frequent notification messages have been
    transmitted periodically.\n   Depending on raised issues, the extension for XMPP
    pubsub protocol\n   could be considered to optimize network quality.\n\n\t "

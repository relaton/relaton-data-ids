  script: Latn
  content: "   Data-intensive analytics is entering the era of multi-domain,\n   geographically-distributed,
    collaborative computing, where different\n   organizations contribute various
    resources to collaboratively\n   collect, share and analyze extremely large amounts
    of data.  Examples\n   of this paradigm include the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
    and A\n   Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) experiments of the Large Hadron\n   Collider
    (LHC) program.  Massive datasets continue to be acquired,\n   simulated, processed
    and analyzed by globally distributed science\n   networks in these collaborations,
    and the volume of this data is\n   growing exponentially.  Applications that manage
    and analyze such\n   massive data volumes can benefit substantially from the information\n
    \  about networking, computing and storage resources from each member\n   sites,
    and more directly from network-resident services that optimize\n   and load balance
    resource usage among multiple data transfer and\n   analytic requests, and achieve
    a better utilization of multi-\n   resources in clusters.  Hence this new paradigm
    calls for a framework\n   to manage a large set of distributively owned heterogeneous\n
    \  resources, with the fundamental objective of efficient resource\n   utilization,
    following the autonomy and privacy of resource owners.\n\n   The Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol can\n   provide via extensions the network
    information about different\n   clusters/sites, to both users and proactive network
    management\n   services where applicable, with the goal of improving both\n   application
    performance and network resource utilization.  However,\n   it has been verified
    in both science networks and commercial data\n   center networks that network
    resource in many cases is not the\n   bottleneck preventing the efficiency of
    large dataset transfer and\n   data-intensive analytics.  To achieve a greater
    overall efficiency of\n   the science programs' workflows information about different\n
    \  resources, such as computing, storage and networking, should be\n   provided
    to data intensive applications simultaneously.\n\n   In this document, we propose
    that it is feasible to use existing ALTO\n   services to provides not only network
    information, but also\n   information about computation and storage resources
    in data analytics\n   networks.  We introduce a uniform resource orchestration
    framework\n   (Unicorn), which achieves an efficient multi-resource allocation
    to\n   support low-latency dataset transfer and data intensive analytics for\n
    \  collaborative computing.  Unicorn provides simple APIs for users to\n   submit
    and manage dataset transfer and analytic requests and to\n   monitor the status
    of each request, along with fine-grained local and\n   global network and site
    state information in real-time.  It collects\n   cluster information from multiple
    ALTO services utilizing topology\n   extensions and leverages emerging SDN control
    capabilities to\n   orchestrate the resource allocation for dataset transfers
    and\n   analytic tasks, leading to improved transfer and analytic latency as\n
    \  well as more efficient utilization of multi-resources in clusters/\n   sites.\n\n\t "

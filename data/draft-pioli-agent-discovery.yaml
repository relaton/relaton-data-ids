abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Agent Registration and Discovery Protocol
    (ARDP), a lightweight protocol for registering, discovering, and reaching autonomous
    software agents in distributed and federated environments. ARDP provides stable
    agent identities, dynamic endpoint resolution, capability advertisement (including
    protocol selection among MCP, A2A, HTTP, and gRPC), minimal presence signaling,
    and a security-first discovery control plane. ARDP is transport-agnostic and complementary
    to existing agent interaction protocols.</p>"

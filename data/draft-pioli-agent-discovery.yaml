  content: "   This document specifies the Agent Registration and Discovery Protocol\n
    \  (ARDP), a lightweight protocol for registering, discovering, and\n   reaching
    autonomous software agents in distributed and federated\n   environments.  ARDP
    provides stable agent identities, dynamic\n   endpoint resolution, capability
    advertisement (including protocol\n   selection among MCP, A2A, HTTP, and gRPC),
    minimal presence\n   signaling, and a security-first discovery control plane.
    \ ARDP is\n   transport-agnostic and complementary to existing agent interaction\n
    \  protocols.\n\n\t "

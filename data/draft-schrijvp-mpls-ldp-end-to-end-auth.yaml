  content: "The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), as currently defined, makes\nuse
    of the TCP MD5 Signature option to protect (authentication and\nintegrity) the
    LDP traffic between two adjacent LSRs. This document\nspecifies extensions to
    LDP to enable end-to-end authentication\nbetween non-adjacent LSR's (ie not directly
    connected via a TCP\nconnection) that are setting up an LSP. Two mechanisms are
    defined\nthat also provide integrity protection of the information carried\nwithin
    LDP messages and protect against the malicious replay of LDP\nmessages. Both proposed
    mechanisms require ordered control LDP and\ncan also be applied to CR-LDP.\n\n\n\t "

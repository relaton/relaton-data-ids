  content: "   EVPN is designed to provide a better VPLS service than [RFC4761] and\n
    \  [RFC4762], and EVPN indeed introduced many new features which\n   couldn't
    be achieved in those old VPLS implementions.  But EVPN\n   didn't inherit all
    features of old VPLS, and a few issues arises for\n   EVPN only.\n\n   Some of
    these issues can be imputed to the MP2P nature of EVPN\n   labels.  The PW label
    in old VPLS is a label for P2P VC, so it\n   contains more context than a identifier
    in dataplane for it's VSI\n   instance.But the EVPN label just identifies it's
    VSI instnace and it\n   can't stand for the ingress PE in dataplane.  So the following
    issues\n   arises with MPLS EVPN service:\n\n   *  MPLS EVPN statistics can't
    be done per ingress PE.\n\n   *  MPLS EVPN can't support hub/spoke use case which
    the spoke PE can\n\t "

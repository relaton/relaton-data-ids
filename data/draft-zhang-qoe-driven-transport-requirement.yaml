  content: "   This document specifies requirements for a QoE-driven transport\n   system,
    which enables network stack to adjust its transport strategy\n   according to
    the QoE intent expressed by applications.  The\n   Application Layer MUST provide
    a structured QoE Intent Signal\n   detailing performance objectives to the transport
    layer.  A QoE\n   Mapping Engine is required to translate this intent into adaptive\n
    \  transport strategies.  The Transport Protocol Stack SHOULD\n   continuously
    feed a Transport Feedback Signal on current performance\n   and network status
    back to the Application Layer, thereby closing the\n   control loop essential
    for continuous QoE optimization.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements for a QoE-driven transport system,
    which enables network stack to adjust its transport strategy according to the
    QoE intent expressed by applications. The Application Layer MUST provide a structured
    QoE Intent Signal detailing performance objectives to the transport layer. A QoE
    Mapping Engine is required to translate this intent into adaptive transport strategies.
    The Transport Protocol Stack SHOULD continuously feed a Transport Feedback Signal
    on current performance and network status back to the Application Layer, thereby
    closing the control loop essential for continuous QoE optimization.</p>"

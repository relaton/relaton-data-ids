  content: "This document describes the method detecting a dead Internet Key Exchange
    (IKE) peer that is presently in use by a number of vendors.  The method, called
    Dead Peer Detection (DPD) uses IPSec traffic patterns to minimize the number of
    IKE messages that are needed to confirm liveness.  DPD, like other keepalive mechanisms,
    is needed to determine when to perform IKE peer failover, and to reclaim lost
    resources.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote industrial process control &amp; operations improve automation,
    resource efficiency, safety and better overall control from the software-defined
    application logic. So far, industrial/process automation connectivity is mostly
    localized. In order to use cloud- based connectivity, not only deterministic networks
    are needed but an interface between the endpoints and the DetNet is required to
    be clearly described. This document describes an interface to deterministic networks
    from the view of end-points to support process control and operations.</p>"

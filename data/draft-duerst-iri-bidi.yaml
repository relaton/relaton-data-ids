  content: "This memo describes how to deal with Internet identifiers containing\ncharacters
    from scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew, which use right-to-\nleft or bidirectional
    writing. The solution proposed addresses three\ndifferent contexts: The purely
    graphical representation of such\nidentifiers, e.g. on paper, the embedding of
    such identifiers into\nrunning text with established rules for bidirectionality,
    and the\nprocessing and resolution of such identifiers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A Location-to-Service Translation protocol (LoST) Server is used to
    \n   resolve or map a given location with an appropriate Public Safety \n   Answering
    Point (PSAP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for that \n   location.  This query
    is conceivably performed on two occasions: \n   prior to making an emergency call,
    and during an emergency call.  \n   This document specifies a new Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) \n   header, returned in a SIP Registration transaction, indicating
    to a \n   SIP user agent the appropriate LoST Server's URI to send this query
    \n   to.\n\t "

  content: "   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access\n
    \  (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n   captive
    portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do\n   until the customer
    has authenticated.\n\n   This document describes a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 option and
    a Router\n   Advertisement (RA) option to inform clients that they are behind
    some\n   sort of captive-portal enforcement device, and that they will need to\n
    \  authenticate to get Internet access.  It is not a full solution to\n   address
    all of the issues that clients may have with captive portals;\n   it is designed
    to be one component of a standardized approach for\n   hosts to interact with
    such portals.  While this document defines how\n   the network operator may convey
    the captive portal API endpoint to\n   hosts, the specific methods of authenticating
    to, and interacting\n   with the captive portal are out of scope of this document.\n\n
    \  This document replaces RFC 7710.  RFC 7710 used DHCP code point 160.\n   Due
    to a conflict, this document specifies 114.\n\n   [ This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/capport-wg/7710bis.  The most recent version
    of\n   the document, open issues, etc should all be available here.  The\n   authors
    (gratefully) accept pull requests.  Text in square brackets\n   will be removed
    before publication. ]\n\n\t "

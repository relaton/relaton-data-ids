  content: "   Internationalized eMail Address (IMA) includes two parts, the local\n
    \  part and the domain part.  The way email addresses are used by\n   protocols
    are different from the way domain names are used.  The most\n   critical difference
    is that emails are delivered through a chain of\n   peering clients and servers
    while domain names are resolved by name\n   servers by looking up their own tables.
    \ In addition to this, email\n   transport protocols SMTP and ESMTP provide a
    negotiation mechanism\n   through which clients can make decisions for further
    processing.  So\n   IMA is different from the internationalized domain name (IDN).
    \ IMA\n   can be solved by exploiting the negotiation mechanism while IDN can\n
    \  not use the negotiation mechanism.  So IMA should be solved in the\n   mail
    transport-level using the negotiation mechanism, which is an\n   architecturally
    desirable approach.  This document specifies the use\n   of SMTP extension for
    IMA delivery.  It also mentions the backward\n   compatible mechanism for downgrade
    procedure, as specified in an\n   associated specification.  The protocol proposed
    here is MTA-level\n   solution which is feasible, architecturally more elegant,
    and not as\n   difficult to deploy in relevant communities.\n\t "

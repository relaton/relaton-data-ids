  content: "   Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building\n
    \  control systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect\n   with
    each other, forming low-power and lossy networks (LLNs).  The\n   CoAP/6LoWPAN
    standards are emerging as the de-facto protocols in this\n   area for resource-constrained
    devices.  Both multicast and security\n   are key needs in these networks.  This
    draft presents a method for\n   securing multicast communication in LLNs based
    on the DTLS which is\n   already present in CoAP devices.  This draft deals with
    the\n   adaptation of the DTLS record layer to protect multicast group\n   communication,
    assuming that all member devices already have a group\n   key in their own possession.
    \ The DTLS record layer implementation is\n   used to encrypt a multicast message
    and to provide message\n   authentication using the group key before sending the
    message via IP\n   multicast to the group.\n\n\n\t "

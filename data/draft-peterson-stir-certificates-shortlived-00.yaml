  content: "   When certificates are used as credentials to attest the assignment
    of\n   ownership of telephone numbers, some mechanism is required to provide\n
    \  certificate freshness.  This document specifies short-lived\n   certificates
    as a means of guaranteeing certificate freshness, in\n   particular relying on
    the Automated Certificate Management\n   Environment (ACME) to allow signers to
    acquire certifcates as needed.\n\n\t "

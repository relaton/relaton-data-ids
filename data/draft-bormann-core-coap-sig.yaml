  content: "   draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls defines how to transport CoAP messages\n
    \  on reliable transports such as TCP, TLS, or WebSockets.\n\n   All these underlying
    protocols have ways to set up connection\n   properties and manage the connection.
    \ In many cases, these ways\n   cannot be used very well for managing CoAP's use
    of the connection.\n\n   Signaling messages are a way to signal information that
    is about the\n   connection.  They form a third basic kind of messages in CoAP,
    beyond\n   requests and responses.  Message class 7 is used for signaling\n   messages.\n\n
    \  Signaling messages are only relevant for the connection they appear\n   in.
    \ The present draft assumes reliable, sequence-preserving\n   connections.  It
    is for further study whether signaling messages are\n   needed or useful for DTLS
    connections.\n\n   The present draft, when adopted, would resolve CoRE tickets
    #400\n   (message sizes), #388 (by providing a foundation for a mechanism for\n
    \  version negotiation, once that is needed), #390 (connection close\n   reason),
    #391 (server name indication), #394 (ping/pong).\n\n\t "

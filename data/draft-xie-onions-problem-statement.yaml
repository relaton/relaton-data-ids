abstract:
- content: "<p>Exposure of network and service abstractions to external systems via
    YANG-based APIs has become an important means for operators to enhance their competitiveness.
    Despite the availability of numerous YANG data models, operators continue to face
    significant challenges in operationalizing these APIs in a consistent, scalable,
    and interoperable manner. Based on a typical use case, this document describes
    the problem space associated with operationalizing YANG- based service APIs, drawing
    on operator experience, IAB workshop findings to motivate requirements for improving
    API predictability and operational effectiveness through the upcoming ONIONS WG.
    In addition, it intends to gather operational needs and motivations for network
    and service abstractions to inform YANG data model refresh work.</p>"

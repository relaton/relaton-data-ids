  content: "   The IETF has developed solutions that promote a healthy IPv4 and IPv6\n
    \  co-existence.  The happy eyeballs algorithm for instance, provides\n   recommendations
    to application developers to help prevent bad user\n   experience in situations
    where IPv6 connectivity is broken.  This\n   document describes a metric used
    to measure the effects of the happy\n   eyeballs algorithm.  The insights uncovered
    by analysing the data\n   from multiple locations is discussed.\n\n\t "

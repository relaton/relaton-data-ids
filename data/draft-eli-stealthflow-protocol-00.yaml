abstract:
- content: "<p>The StealthFlow Protocol (SFP) is a low-observability, stateless pre-authentication
    and transport armor mechanism designed to precede existing TLS or QUIC sessions.
    SFP aims to reduce handshake fingerprinting, limit asymmetric denial-of-service
    amplification, and minimize early plaintext metadata exposure, while preserving
    compatibility with the existing PKI and TLS ecosystems. SFP does not replace TLS
    or QUIC. Instead, it provides an optional single-round pre-filtering and authentication
    layer that enables servers to reject illegitimate traffic with minimal computational
    cost and minimal network observability. This document supersedes the prior informal
    specification known as draft-eli-z-protocol-00.</p>"

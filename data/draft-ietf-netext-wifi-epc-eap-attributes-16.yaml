  content: "With Wi-Fi emerging as a crucial access network for mobile service providers,
    it has become important to provide functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks
    in Wi-Fi access networks as well. Such functions include Access Point Name (APN)
    Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections, and seamless mobility
    between Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks.\n\n The EAP Authentication and Key Agreement
    (EAP-AKA), and EAP-AKA', protocol is required for mobile devices to access the
    mobile Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via Wi-Fi networks. This document defines a few
    new EAP attributes to enable the above-mentioned functions in such networks. The
    attributes are exchanged between a client (such as a Mobile Node (MN)) and its
    network counterpart (such as an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
    (AAA) server) in the service provider's infrastructure.\n\t "

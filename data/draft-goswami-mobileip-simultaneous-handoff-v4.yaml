- language: en

  content: "This document describes a way to perform simultaneous Mobile-IPv4 handoff
    \ and 802.11 Access Point Association/Reassociation. Mobile-IPv4 Registration
    messages are carried as Information Elements in 802.11 frames. This way Mobile-IPv4
    can perform handoff at the same time as 802.11 handoffs. The Foreign Agent can
    be a part of the Access Point or may serve a number of Access Points. The implications
    to existing mobility entities such as Access Point, Mobile Node, and Foreign Agent
    are disccussed. Also pointed out are potential issues with 802.1x and the emerging
    802.11i standards.\n\t "

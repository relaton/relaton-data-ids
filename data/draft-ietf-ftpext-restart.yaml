  content: "This memo describes changes to FTP [1], which were proposed by Rick Adams
    in May of 1989, to allow the RESTART mechanism to be used with STREAM mode transfers.
    \ Along with this, two new optional commands are added, MODIFICATION TIME (MDTM)
    and SIZE OF FILE (SIZE).  All these changes have been implemented, and are in
    use today in many production FTP implementations.\n\t "

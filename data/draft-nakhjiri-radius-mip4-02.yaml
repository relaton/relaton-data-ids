  script: Latn
  content: "   Mobile IPv4 specifies mechanisms that need assistance from a AAA \n
    \  server and a AAA infrastructure. Examples of such mechanisms are  \n   those
    providing key management and authentication services during a \n   registration
    process of the mobile node with MN-AAA authentication \n   extension. Although
    Diameter Mobile IP application is being specified \n   to support the needs of
    Mobile IPv4 from the point of view of the AAA \n   infrastructure, such support
    does not exist within RADIUS framework. \n   This document defines the RADIUS
    attributes that provide support for \n   Mobile IPv4 operation. \n\t "

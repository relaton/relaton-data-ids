  content: "   Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) and its corresponding\n   protocol
    extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do\n   stateful control of
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\n   Engineering Label Switched Paths
    (TE LSP).  One application that\n   stateful PCE can realize is data traffic reoptimization
    among the\n   LSPs.  Data traffic traversed in a LSP can be switched to another\n
    \  PCE-initiated LSP.  Moreover, data traffic can be balanced to\n   multiple
    PCE-initiated LSPs and may also be policed based on a\n   signaling bandwidth
    of a PCE-Initiated LSP using stateful PCE.\n\n   This document specifies the extensions
    to Path Computation Element\n   Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to do
    switchover, balancing\n   and policing of data traffic with PCE-initiated LSPs.
    \ This document\n   also specifies the extensions, usage and handling of stateful
    PCEP\n   messages and the expected behavior of PCC as the RSVP-TE headend.\n\n\t "

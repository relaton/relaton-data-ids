  content: "   In CDNI deployment, URL signing mechanism should continue to\n   function
    for content access restriction. Previous CDNI documents\n   have described the
    basic of URL signing. However, in some cases that\n   the key cannot be distributed
    from the Authoritative CDN to the\n   Delivering CDN, the URL validation requirement
    cannot be fulfilled.\n   This document gives some supplementary description concerning
    URL\n   signing and validation mechanism in case of DNS based Request\n   Routing,
    and as a result, a compliment for authorization object in\n   metadata interface
    is presented.\n\n\n\t "

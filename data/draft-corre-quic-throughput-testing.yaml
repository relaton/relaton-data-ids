  content: "   This document adapts the [RFC6349] Framework for TCP Throughput\n   Testing
    to the [RFC9000] QUIC protocol.  The adapted framework\n   describes a practical
    methodology for measuring end-to-end QUIC\n   Throughput in a managed IP network.
    \ The goal of the methodology is\n   to provide a better indication in regard
    to user experience.  In this\n   framework, QUIC, UDP, and IP parameters are specified
    to optimize\n   QUIC Throughput.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Many Internet protocols and services rely on credentials which use\n
    \  asymmetric keys.  Many of these are hierarchic structures having\n   certification
    authorities (CAs) that act as trust anchors (TAs).\n   There is little general
    guidance on procedures for how these trust\n   anchors can be distributed or otherwise
    published with prudence.  To\n   quote a well known security expert, \"It's a
    matter of oral tradition\n   in security circles.\"  This document attempts to
    capture some of that\n   lore.\n\n\t "

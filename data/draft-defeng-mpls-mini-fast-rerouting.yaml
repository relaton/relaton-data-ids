  content: "This document analyzes the weakness of current fast rerouting \nmechanisms
    in IP network[1] and MPLS enabled network [2]describes a \nsimple fast rerouting
    mechanism for IP/MPLS network, and with these \npoints in mind, proposes the simple
    fast reroute mechanisms based on \nthe intrinsic characteristics of IP network
    and MPLS network, and \nillustrates the principles of these mechanisms in node
    protection and \nlink/path protection.\n\t "

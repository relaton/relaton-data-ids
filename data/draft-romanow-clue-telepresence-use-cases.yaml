  content: "   Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create the sense of really\n
    \  being present.  A number of techniques for handling audio and video\n   streams
    are used to create this experience.  When these techniques\n   are not similar,
    interoperability between different systems is\n   difficult at best, and often
    not possible.  Conveying information\n   about the relationships between multiple
    streams of media would allow\n   senders and receivers to make choices to allow
    telepresence systems\n   to interwork.  This memo describes the most typical and
    important use\n   cases for sending multiple streams in a telepresence conference.\n\n\t "

  content: "The ASCII-text file format of Request for Comments (RFC) documents\nwas
    devised decades ago when the authoring tools were line editors\nlike vi and text
    processors like nroff. The format still has great\nutility because it meets the
    constraints of many kinds of printing\nand display equipment, but it is difficult
    to produce with some of\ntoday's desktop publishing tools. This paper describes
    the RFC text\nfile format and discusses its fine points; this should be useful
    to\nauthors of RFCs and Internet Drafts regardless of their tools. This\npaper
    also describes the UGLI method, a hybrid method for producing\nRFCs by using modern
    software for composition and editing and using\nolder software, applied in 'cookbook'
    fashion, to finish the job. The\nmethod is described in terms of Microsoft Word
    on an Apple Macintosh\nbut is easily adaptable for other word processors on other
    platforms.\n\n\n\t "

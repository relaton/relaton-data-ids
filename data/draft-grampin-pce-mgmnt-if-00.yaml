  content: "  The Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture provide a framework
    \n  to support the Constraint-Based Routing (CBR) functionality for \n  traffic
    engineering systems in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) \n  and Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.  \n  The model define the PCC
    and PCE entities at the Control Plane, which \n  communicate using a Request/Reply
    protocol. \n  The PCE architecture enable network operators a tight control of
    the \n  resource assignment by means of the administrative constraints that \n
    \ are included in the Traffic Enginnering Database (TED), and used in \n  the
    path computation process. Moreover, appropriate objective \n  funtions assist
    operators in the fulfillment of the overall network \n  objectives. \n   \n  This
    document present a system architecture for the PCE, namely \n  Routing and Management
    Agent (RMA), with  a standard management \n  interface, which permit established
    management frameworks to rely on \n  the PCE for the CBR functionality and inject
    network-wide policies \n  into the PCE path computation process. Some reliability
    issues of the \n  PCE Architecture are addressed in the document. \n\t "

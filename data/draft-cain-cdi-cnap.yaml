  content: "The Content Network Advertisement Protocol (CNAP) is a protocol \nIntended
    to facilitate the interconnection of Content Networks \n(CN). CNAP is a simple
    CN-to-CN information exchange protocol \nthat advertises both content and area
    advertisements. These two \ntypes of advertisements are described in [3,6] and
    are intended \nto be used by content network request routing systems [9]. The
    \nexchange of these advertisements between CNs is intended to \nfacilitate inter-CN
    request-routing decisions.\n\t "

  content: "   Currently BGP protocol can carry reachability information for\n   multiple
    Address Families (AFI) and Subsequence Address Families\n   (SAFI) using the Multiprotocol
    Extension[RFC2858], but it is limited\n   to grouping of information based on
    the AFI/SAFI hierarchy.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism to group and
    exchange prefix\n   information based on properties other than just the AFI/\n
    \  SAFI[RFC2858].  The mechanism is flexible and backwards compatible\n   with
    the current methods for exchanging prefixes and hence does not\n   require any
    changes to the the protocol formats.  It introduces a new\n   capability that
    allows two BGP speakers negotiate during the BGP OPEN\n   phase in order to define
    what each AFI/SAFI means.\n\n   In other words, the concept of a 'context' is
    defined and each such\n   'context' can be mapped to an AFI/SAFI.  The context
    to AFI/SAFI\n   mapping is only relevant to the BGP peers of the BGP session and\n
    \  hence offers great flexibility in how 2 BGP speakers can choose to\n   group
    and exchange prefix information.\n\n\t "

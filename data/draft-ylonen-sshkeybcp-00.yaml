  content: "   This document presents current recommended practice for configuring,\n
    \  managing, auditing, and associated policies around automated access\n   to
    information systems, with particular emphasis on SSH user keys as\n   authentication
    and authorization tokens but also looking into other\n   automated access mechanisms,
    such as Kerberos.\n\n   Starting with a review of authentication methods that
    can be\n   configured for automated access, the document describes the risks\n
    \  involved when the management of automated access and SSH keys is\n   neglected.
    \ It scopes the extent of the problem in particular\n   organizations, provides
    a detailed roadmap for bringing automated\n   access and SSH keys under control,
    and presents recommendations on\n   continuous monitoring and ongoing management
    of automated access in\n   information systems.\n\n   Various remedial actions
    are presented and mapped to the problems\n   they address and residual risks in
    the event the recommendations are\n   not implemented.\n\n   Guidance is also
    provided on how to organize management of automated\n   access with the objective
    of reducing the system administration\n   burden and organization operational
    cost, and on tools for automating\n   the process.\n\n\t "

  content: "The RTCWeb working group in the IETF is tasked with developing \nstandards
    that will ensure interoperability between web browsers \nestablishing rich communications
    sessions. This working group is \ntasked with delivering the specifications necessary
    to establish \nreal-time transport sessions between browsers (e.g. those based
    on \nreal-time protocol, i.e. RTP). Moreover, the group is also tasked \nwith
    providing a means for application data streaming between \nbrowsers (i.e. opaque
    data streaming). Much like RTP \nsynchronization sources (SSRC's) can be temporally
    synchronized, \nthere are use cases that require opaque data stream synchronization
    \nwith the real-time communications stream between browsers in an \nRTCWeb session.
    This document provides some options for temporally \nassociating an opaque data
    stream with a voice/video stream as part \nof RTCWeb communications. \n\t "

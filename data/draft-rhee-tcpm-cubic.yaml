  content: "CUBIC is an extension to the current TCP standards.  The protocol\ndiffers
    from the current TCP standards only in the congestion window\nadjustment function
    in the sender side.  In particular, it uses a\ncubic function instead of a linear
    window increase of the current TCP\nstandards to improve scalability and stability
    under fast and long\ndistance networks.  BIC-TCP, a predecessor of CUBIC, has
    been a\ndefault TCP adopted by Linux since year 2005 and has already been\ndeployed
    globally and in use for several years by the Internet\ncommunity at large.  CUBIC
    is using a similar window growth function\nas BIC-TCP and is designed to be less
    aggressive and fairer to TCP in\nbandwidth usage than BIC-TCP while maintaining
    the strengths of BIC-\nTCP such as stability, window scalability and RTT fairness.
    \ Through\nextensive testing in various Internet scenarios, we believe that\nCUBIC
    is safe for deployment and testing in the global Internet.  The\nintent of this
    document is to provide the protocol specification of\nCUBIC for a third party
    implementation and solicit the community\nfeedback through experimentation on
    the performance of CUBIC.  We\nexpect this document to be eventually published
    as an experimental\nRFC.\n\t "

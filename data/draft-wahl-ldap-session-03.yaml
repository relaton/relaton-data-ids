  script: Latn
  content: "   Many network devices, application servers, and middleware components\n
    \  of a enterprise software infrastructure generate some form of session\n   tracking
    identifiers, which are useful when analyzing activity and\n   accounting logs
    to group activity relating to a particular session.\n   This document discusses
    how Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n   version 3 (LDAP) clients can include
    session tracking identifiers\n   with their LDAP requests.  This information is
    provided through\n   controls in the requests the clients send to LDAP servers.
    \ The LDAP\n   server receiving these controls can include the session tracking\n
    \  identifiers in the log messages it writes, enabling LDAP requests in\n   the
    LDAP server's logs to be correlated with activity in logs of\n   other components
    in the infrastructure.  The control also enables\n   session tracking information
    to be generated by LDAP servers and\n   returned to clients and other servers.
    \ Three formats of session\n   tracking identifiers are defined in this document.\n\n\t "

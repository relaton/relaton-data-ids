  content: "   This document provides a profile for the Transmission Control\n   Protocol
    (TCP) over Constrained-Node Networks (CNNs).  The\n   overarching goal is to offer
    simple measures to allow for lightweight\n   TCP implementation and suitable operation
    in such environments.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces an additional single bit signal to enhance\n
    \  the spin bit [I-D.trammell-ippm-spin] performance in presence of\n   network
    impairments and application limited flow.  In addition, it\n   defines two new
    explicit per-flow transport-layer signals for hybrid\n   measurement of connection
    loss rate.  The former is a spin-bit\n   dependent signal and uses a single bit.
    \ The latter is a standalone\n   solution based on a two bits loss signal and
    on alternate marking RFC\n   8321 [RFC8321].\n\n\n\t "

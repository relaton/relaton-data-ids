  content: "   STUN, or Session Traversal Utilities for NAT, is a protocol used to\n
    \  assist other protocols traverse Network Address Translators or NATs.\n   STUN,
    and STUN extensions such as TURN, or Traversal Using Relays\n   around NAT, and
    ICE, Interactive Communications Establishment, have\n   been around for many years
    but with WebRTC, Web Real-Time\n   Communications, STUN and related extensions
    are about to see major\n   deployments and implementation due to these protocols
    being\n   implemented in browsers.  This specification defines an ORIGIN\n   attribute
    for STUN that can be used in similar ways to the HTTP\n   header field of the
    same name.  WebRTC browsers utilizing STUN and\n   TURN would include this attribute
    which would provide servers with\n   additional information about the STUN and
    TURN requests they receive.\n   This specification defines the usage of the STUN
    ORIGIN attribute for\n   web and SIP contexts.\n\n\t "

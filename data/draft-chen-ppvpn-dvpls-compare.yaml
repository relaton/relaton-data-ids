  content: "The scope of this draft is regarding the VPLS solutions - it \ndescribes
    commonalities and differences among different VPLS \nsolutions in terms of distributed
    and non-distributed access \ntopologies. The metrics used for comparison are derived
    from [L2VPN-\nMETRICS] and [L2VPN-FRMK]. \nThe current VPLS solutions that are
    taken in consideration are: GVPLS \n[GVPLS], DTLS [DTLS], and VPLS/HVPLS [VPLS-MPLS].
    This list of \nsolutions is not exhaustive; other solutions may be taken into
    \naccount in future versions of this draft.\n\t "

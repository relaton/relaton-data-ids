  content: "SAM is a generic and simple mechanism for packets having addresses in\na
    family IPvX to traverse routing domains where this address family\nis not directly
    routed.\nSAM topological scenarios are those of Mesh Softwire, i.e. with point\nto
    multipoint tunnels between border nodes of interior routing\ndomains.  In the
    mesh-softwire context, SAM differs from RFC 5565 in\nthat SAM uses no protocol
    between border nodes of the domain, and in\nthat customer border nodes don't need
    to maintain states for all\nother border nodes.  (RFC 5565 is based on an Exterior
    Border-Gateway\nProtocol e-BGP between border nodes, with dynamic routing tables
    to\nbe maintained in all of them).  SAM's address mappings are stateless,\nbased
    on only a few domain parameters.  SAM is thus suitable to small\nto medium enterprises,
    and small to medium ISPs, that cannot afford\ne-BGP in all their border nodes.
    \ All combinations of IPv4 and IPv6,\nglobal or private, are supported.  Also,
    to mitigate consequences of\nthe IPv4 address shortage, SAM supports port-extended
    IPv4 addresses\n(A+P).\n\t "

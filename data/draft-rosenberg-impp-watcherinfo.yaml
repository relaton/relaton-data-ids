  content: "Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to)\npresence
    information about a user. There is fairly complex state\nassociated with this
    subscription, and this state is dynamic. As a\nresult, it is possible, and indeed
    useful, to subscribe to the\nwatcher information for a particular subscriber.
    In order to enable\nthis, a format is needed to describe the state of watchers.
    This\nspecification describes an XML document format for such state.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "               We propose a mechanism Proof of Consent that allows an
    \n               email recipient to provide verifiable proof of ‘opt-in’ \n               consent
    to receive email. Proof of Consent may be used \n               to automatically
    whitelist email from mailing lists and \n               email forwarded from another
    email server. \n                \n               Proof of Consent is designed
    to require minimal state \n               maintenance by both the email sender
    and the recipient \n               and to be deployable with minimal impact on
    existing \n               email infrastructure. \n\t "

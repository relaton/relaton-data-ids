abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Considering that 6LoWPAN packets can be as large as 2K bytes and that\n
    \  an 802.15.4 frame with security will carry in the order of 80 bytes\n   of
    effective payload, a packet might end up fragmented into as many\n   as 25 fragments
    at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.  If a single one of those\n   fragments is lost in
    transmission, all fragments must be resent,\n   further contributing to the congestion
    that might have caused the\n   initial packet loss.  This draft introduces a simple
    protocol to\n   recover individual fragments between 6LoWPAN endpoints.\n\n\t "

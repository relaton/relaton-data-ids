  content: "The ITU-T has defined an architecture and requirements for operating an
    Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).\n\n The Generalized Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suite is designed to provide a control plane
    for a range of network technologies including optical networks such as time division
    multiplexing (TDM) networks including SONET/SDH and Optical Transport Networks
    (OTNs), and lambda switching optical networks.\n\n The requirements for GMPLS
    routing to satisfy the requirements of ASON routing, and an evaluation of existing
    GMPLS routing protocols are provided in other documents. This document defines
    extensions to the OSPFv2 Link State Routing Protocol to meet the requirements
    for routing in an ASON.\n\n Note that this work is scoped to the requirements
    and evaluation expressed in RFC 4258 and RFC 4652 and the ITU-T Recommendations
    current when those documents were written. Future extensions of revisions of this
    work may be necessary if the ITU-T Recommendations are revised or if new requirements
    are introduced into a revision of RFC 4258. This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

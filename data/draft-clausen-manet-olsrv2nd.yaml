  content: "This document describes the neighborhood discovery protocol for the\nOptimized
    Link State Routing Protocol version 2.  The protocol\nprovides each node with
    local topology up to two hops distance,\ndescribing a node's 1-hop neighbors and
    symmetric 2-hop neighbors.\nThis is achieved through periodic message exchange.
    \ The neighborhood\ndiscovery protocol may be used by other MANET protocols which
    need\nneighborhood information.\n\nThe protocol imposes minimum requirements to
    the network by not\nrequiring sequenced or reliable transmission of control traffic.\n\n\t "

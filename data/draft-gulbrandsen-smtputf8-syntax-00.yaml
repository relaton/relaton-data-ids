  content: "   This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible\n
    \  enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while\n   avoiding
    confusing or risky elements.\n\n   This is one of a pair of documents: This is
    simple to implement,\n   contains only globally viable rules and is intended to
    be usable for\n   software such an MTA.  Its companion defines has more complex
    rules,\n   takes regional usage into account and aims to allow only addresses\n
    \  that are readable and cut-and-pastable to some audience.\n\n\t "

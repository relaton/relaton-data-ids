  content: "This memo defines an extension to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer\nProtocol)
    service whereby messages are sent with a priority to\nachieve a certain order
    in which the messages are transferred by an\nMTA (Message Transfer Agent).  This
    priority or precedence order is\nused instead of the first-come-first-serve rule.
    \ This extension is\nnot to be confused with \"Importance of a Message\" which
    is widely\ndeployed using an email header such as Importance or even Priority
    or\nPrecedence with common values of HIGH, NORMAL and LOW.  Importance of\na Message
    does not affect the priority of the transport itself in any\nway.  Nevertheless,
    there may be policy defined relations between\npriorities and importance indicators.\n\nThis
    extension uses the term priority in the meaning of expedited\ntreatment of a message
    by the server according to its priority.\n\t "

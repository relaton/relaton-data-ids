  content: "   This document restates the requirements on DNSSEC signing and\n   validation
    and makes small adjustments order to allow for more\n   flexible handling of configurations
    that advertise multiple Secure\n   Entry Points (SEP) with different signing algorithms
    via their DS\n   record or trust anchor set.  The adjusted rules allow both for
    multi-\n   signer operation and for transfer of signed DNS zones between\n   providers,
    without requiring that each provider uses the same signing\n   algorithm.  In
    addition, the proposal enables pre-publication of a\n   trust anchor in preparation
    for an algorithm rollover, such as of the\n   root zone.\n\n   This document updates
    RFCs 4035, 6840, and 8624.\n\n\t "

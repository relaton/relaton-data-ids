  content: "RELOAD [1] defines an overlay framework for providing peer-to-peer\nconnectivity
    and storage/retreival primitives for applications.\nApplications or usages are
    expected to reside on top of such an\noverlay.  In general, this is a good design
    that allows multiple\napplications to use the same overlay framework.  In such
    a design,\nhowever, there are some decisions to be made in terms of what is an\noverlay
    function and what must be defined by a usage.  These\ndecisions should generally
    be based on whether the particular\nfunction is expecting an operation or guarantee
    from the overlay\nnodes in general or from a particular usage only.  This type
    of\nseparation is especially crucial to avoid needing flag days for\nupgrading
    nodes in order to accommodate a newer usage version for\nperforming the overlay
    operation.\n\t "

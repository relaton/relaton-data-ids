  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework\nsupporting
    multiple types of authentication methods.\n\nThe EAP Re-authentication Protocol
    (ERP) specifies extensions to EAP\nand the EAP keying hierarchy to support an
    EAP method-independent\nprotocol for efficient re-authentication between the peer
    and an EAP\nre-authentication server through any authenticator.\n\nAuthenticated
    Anticipatory Keying (AAK) is a method by which\ncryptographic keying material
    may be established prior to handover\nupon one or more candidate attachment points
    (CAPs), AAK uses the AAA\ninfrastructure for key transport.\n\nThis document specifies
    the extensions necessary to enable AAK\nsupport in ERP.\n\nStatus of This Memo\n\nThis

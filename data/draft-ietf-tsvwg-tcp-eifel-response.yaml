  content: "Based on an appropriate detection algorithm, the Eifel response algorithm
    provides a way for a TCP sender to respond to a detected spurious timeout.  It
    adapts the retransmission timer to avoid further spurious timeouts and (depending
    on the detection algorithm) can avoid the often unnecessary go-back-N retransmits
    that would otherwise be sent.  In addition, the Eifel response algorithm restores
    the congestion control state in such a way that packet bursts are avoided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

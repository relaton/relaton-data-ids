  content: "EAP-TTLS is an EAP type that utilizes TLS to establish a secure \nconnection
    between a client and server, through which additional \ninformation may be exchanged.
    The initial TLS handshake may mutually \nauthenticate client and server; or it
    may perform a one-way \nauthentication, in which only the server is authenticated
    to the \nclient. The secure connection established by the initial handshake \nmay
    then be used to allow the server to authenticate the client \nusing existing,
    widely-deployed authentication infrastructures such \nas RADIUS. The authentication
    of the client may itself be EAP, or it \nmay be another authentication protocol
    such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP or \nMS-CHAP-V2. \n\nThus, EAP-TTLS allows legacy password-based
    authentication protocols \nto be used against existing authentication databases,
    while \nprotecting the security of these legacy protocols against \neavesdropping,
    man-in-the-middle and other cryptographic attacks. \n\nEAP-TTLS also allows client
    and server to exchange other information \nin addition to authentication-related
    information. \n\nThis document describes EAP-TTLSv1; that is, version 1 of the
    EAP-\nTTLS protocol. It represents a significant enhancement to the \noriginal
    version 0 of the protocol. EAP-TTLSv1 utilizes an extended \nversion of TLS, called
    TLS/IA (TLS/InnerApplication) as its \nunderlying protocol [TLS/IA]. \n\t "

  content: "   The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4 (BGP-4) finite state machine\n
    \  (FSM) is defined in RFC 4271.  Over the years, various extensions to\n   BGP
    have been authored that update the protocol's FSM.  Some elements\n   of the FSM
    are enumerated.  Those elements are referred to across BGP\n   extensions in their
    respective state machine changes, and may also be\n   used for management purposes
    in things such as YANG (RFC 7950).\n\n   To provide consistent naming and enumeration
    of these FSM elements,\n   this document requests IANA to create and maintain
    registries for\n   elements in the BGP FSM.\n\n\t "

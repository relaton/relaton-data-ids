  content: "Multicast has become increasingly important with the emergence of\nnetwork-based
    applications such as IP telephony and video\nconferencing. The Internet community
    has done a significant amount\nof work on IP multicast over the last decade [1-10]
    and as a\nresult, there are a number of multicast applications that are used\ntoday
    on the Mbone, the multicast-capable virtual network that is\nlayered on top of
    (portions of) the Internet [10]. However, while\ntoday's multicast schemes are
    scaleable in the sense that they can\nsupport very large multicast groups, there
    are scalability issues\nwhen a network needs to support a very large number of
    distinct\nmulticast groups. This document describes a new scheme for\nmulticast
    that complements the existing schemes. Whereas the\nexisting schemes can support
    a limited number of very large\nmulticast groups, the scheme described here can
    support a very\nlarge number of small multicast groups.\n\t "

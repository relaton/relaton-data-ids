  content: "   Issuers of Digital Credentials enable dynamic state or status checks\n
    \  through the use of dereferenceable identifiers, that resolve to\n   resources
    providing herd privacy.  Privacy in such systems is\n   determined not just from
    the size of the herd, and the cryptographic\n   structure encoding it, but also
    from the observability of access to\n   shared state.  This document describes
    a privacy preserving state\n   management system for digital credentials based
    on Oblivious HTTP\n   that addresses both data model and protocol risks associated
    with\n   digital credentials with dynamic state.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memo is a serious parody to RFC 1620: 'Internet Architecture Extensions
    for Shared Media' and, rather than trying to modify the Internet architecture,
    discusses an alternative approach to modify the architecture of the currently
    shared media.  The Internet architecture assumes that each network is labeled
    with a single IP network number.  This assumption is not violated for shared media,
    including 'large public data networks' (LPDNs).  Moreover, if LPDNs are properly
    rearchitected, the currently observed inefficiency with LPDN that it is impossible
    to prevent multiple host-router and router-router hops through the shared medium
    is not a problem at all.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion control is an essential element in ensuring fair bandwidth
    usage and preventing congestion collapse for traffic sharing the Internet. For
    interactive real-time media traffic such as video conferencing, design of congestion
    control solution also needs to account for many other factors such as the requirement
    for low latency packet delivery and interactions with live video encoder. This
    document describes a common framework with the core functional building blocks
    for a real-time media congestion solutions.</p>"

  content: "This document defines lightweight secure neighbor discovery for low-\npower
    and lossy networks.  The nodes generate a Cryptographically\nGenerated Address
    using an Elliptic Curve Cryptography public key,\nregister the Cryptographically
    Generated Address with a default\nrouter and periodically refresh the registration.
    \ Modifications to\n6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are described for secure
    neighbor\ndiscovery for low-power and lossy networks.  Cryptographically\ngenerated
    address and digital signature are calculated using elliptic\ncurve cryptography
    public key of the node.\n\t "

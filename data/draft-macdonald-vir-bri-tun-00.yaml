  content: "This document specifies an approach to provide extended LAN and VLAN\nservices
    across IP routed networks.  This is done by adding a virtual\nbridge identifier
    to packets destined to the remote location and then\nencapsulating this new packet
    in IP.  This packet is then source \nrouted across the IP network to a Virtual
    Bridge Tunnel terminating\nrouter where the header is stripped off and the virtual
    bridge\nidentifier is used to forward the original packet out the \ncorresponding
    tunnel interface.\nWithin the IP network the packets are treated like any other
    IP packets\nand as such identical mechanisms such as security and quality of \nservice
    can be applied.\n\n\t "

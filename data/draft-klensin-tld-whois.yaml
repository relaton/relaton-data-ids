  content: "This document proposes a company name to URL mapping service based on
    the oldest and least complex of Internet directory protocols, whois, in order
    to explore whether an extremely simple and widely-deployed protocol can succeed
    where more complex and powerful options have failed or been excessively delayed.
    \ This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.  It does
    not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Discussion and suggestions for
    improvement are requested.\n\t "

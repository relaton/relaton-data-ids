abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a new X.509 certificate extension, Post-\n
    \  Quantum or Composite Hosting Continuity (PQCHC), which enables a\n   certificate
    subject to signal a intent to continue serving PQC or\n   composite certificates
    for a defined continuity period after\n   certificate expiration.  This extension
    helps relying parties detect\n   downgrade and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks
    during transition\n   phases, where a cryptographically relevant quantum computer
    (CRQC)\n   would make traditional certificates insecure.\n\n\t "

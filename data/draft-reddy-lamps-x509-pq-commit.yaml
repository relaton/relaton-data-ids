abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new X.509 certificate extension, Post- Quantum
    or Composite Hosting Continuity (PQCHC), which enables a certificate subject to
    signal a intent to continue serving PQC or composite certificates for a defined
    continuity period after certificate expiration. This extension helps relying parties
    detect downgrade and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks during transition phases,
    where a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) would make traditional
    certificates insecure.</p>"

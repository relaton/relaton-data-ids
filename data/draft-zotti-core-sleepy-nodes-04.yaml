  content: "   Control networks rely on application protocols like CoAP to enable\n
    \  RESTful communications in constrained environments.  Many of these\n   networks
    make use of \"Sleepy Nodes\": battery powered devices that\n   switch off their
    (radio) interface during most of the time to\n   conserve battery energy.  As
    a result of this, Sleepy Nodes cannot be\n   reached most of the time.  This fact
    prevents using normal\n   communication patterns as specified in the CoRE group,
    since the\n   server-model is not applicable to these devices.  This document\n
    \  discusses and specifies an architecture to support Sleepy Nodes such\n   as
    battery-powered sensors in mesh networks with the goal of\n   proposing a standardisation
    solution for Sleepy Node proxies.\n\n\t "

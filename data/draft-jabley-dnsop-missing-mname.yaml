  content: "   The Start of Authority Resource Record in the Domain Name System\n
    \  includes various parameters related to the handling of data in DNS\n   zones.
    \ These parameters are variously used by authority-only\n   servers, caching resolvers
    and DNS clients to guide them in the way\n   that data contained within particular
    zones should be used.\n\n   One particular field in the SOA RR is known as MNAME,
    which is used\n   to specify the \"Primary Master\" server for a zone.  This is
    the\n   server to which clients use Dynamic Update to send DNS UPDATE\n   messages.
    \ Many zones do not support the Dynamic Update, and any such\n   DNS UPDATE messages
    which are received provide no usual purpose.  For\n   such zones it may be preferable
    not to receive updates from clients\n   at all.\n\n   This document proposes a
    convention by which a zone operator can\n   signal to clients that a particular
    zone does not support Dynamic\n   Update.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a model of Security Capabilities.  Security\n
    \  Capabilities are intended to describe the potentiality that Network\n   Security
    Functions (NSFs) have for security policy enforcement\n   purposes.  Therefore,
    Security Capabilities are represented as\n   abstract functionalities that a NSF
    owns in terms of enforcement\n   actions, conditions that can apply in order to
    determine to which\n   packet or traffic enforce the actions, and other mechanisms
    that NSF\n   use to determine the actions to enforce.  The proposed capability\n
    \  model defines without ambiguities the operations a function can do in\n   term
    of security policy enforcement.\n\n\t "

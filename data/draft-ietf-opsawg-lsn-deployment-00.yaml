- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address\n
    \  Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier\n   Grade
    NAT (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT).  CGN is a concept\n   also described
    in [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements] and describes\n   the model as a dual layer
    translation model.  Although operators may\n   wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically
    overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near\n   term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6
    deployment alone.  This\n   document provides a practical integration model which
    allows CGN to\n   be integrated into the network meeting the connectivity needs
    of the\n   customer while being mindful of not disrupting existing services and\n
    \  meeting the technical challenges that CGN brings.  The model includes\n   the
    use of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs defined in [RFC4364] as a tool to achieve\n   this goal.
    \ This document does not intend to defend the merits of\n   CGN.\n\n\t "

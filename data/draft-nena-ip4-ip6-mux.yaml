  content: "While the wide use of IPv4 \"private\" addresses [RFC1918] lead to a\ngreat
    flexibilty degree of uninterconnected networks and use of IPv6\noffer a huge address
    space; no \"nice\" mechanism exist to hide overlap\nof existing IPv4 \"private\"
    networks if and when the sum of used\naddress spaces is greater than the IPv4
    \"private\" address space.\nThis document specifies how to walk around the matter
    without any\ncoordination, renumbering or IPv6 adoption by overlapping networks\nowners.\n\t "

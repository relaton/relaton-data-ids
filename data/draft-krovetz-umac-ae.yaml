  content: "   This document specifies UMAC-AE, a shared-key algorithm that\n   simultaneously
    encrypts data using a block cipher in counter mode\n   while also authenticating
    the data with UMAC.  At its peak rate,\n   using AES as the block cipher, UMAC-AE
    encrypts and authenticates\n   data at a cost of about 10% more than simple encryption.
    \ UMAC is\n   unencumbered by intellectual property claims and can be used freely.\n
    \  Pairing UMAC with a license-free block cipher, such as AES, provides\n   fast
    and license-free authenticated encryption.\n\t "

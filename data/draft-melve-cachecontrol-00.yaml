  script: Latn
  content: "User agents such as caches and web indexers, which act on behalf of\n
    \  more than one user are often given access to documents which are\n   restricted
    by IP address or domain. These agents then republish this\n   information to users
    outside the allowed block, as there is currently\n   no means of marking these
    objects with their access restrictions.\n \n   This document details an extension
    to the Cache-control header in\n   HTTP/1.1 [HTTP/1.1] to add information about
    IP or domain based\n   access restrictions.  It also stresses that Cache-control
    should\n   apply to all User-agents which work on behalf on a number of users,\n
    \  and not just to caches.\n\t "

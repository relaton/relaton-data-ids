abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF network slice service aims to meet the connectivity demands of
    a network slice customer with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service
    Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay network. A Network Resource Partition
    is a set of network resources that are allocated from the underlay network to
    carry a specific set of network traffic and meet the required SLOs and SLEs. One
    or multiple IETF network slice services can be mapped to one network resource
    partition. With the demand for IETF network slice services increases, scalability
    would become an important factor for the large scale deployment of IETF network
    slices. Although the scalability of IETF network slices can be improved by mapping
    a group of IETF network slices to one network resource partition, there are concerns
    about the scalability of network resource partitions. This document describes
    the scalability considerations about network resource partition in the network
    control plane and data plane, and some optimization mechanisms are proposed.</p>"

  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching
    (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document\n   specifies procedures
    for using UDP path for sending and processing\n   in-band probe query and response
    messages for Performance\n   Measurement.  The procedure uses the RFC 6374 defined
    mechanisms for\n   Delay and Loss performance measurement.  The procedure specified
    is\n   applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes for both links and\n   end-to-end
    measurement for SR Policies.  This document also defines\n   mechanisms for handling
    Equal Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) for SR\n   Policies.  In addition, this document
    defines Return Path Segment\n   List TLV for two-way performance measurement and
    Block Number TLV for\n   loss measurement.\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC2960 [SXM00] \n   specifications
    utilize the possible multiple paths between the \n   sender and receiver for retransmission
    of lost data chunks and as a \n   backup for the primary path, in case of primary
    path failure. \n   Other than that, all the data chunks are being sent on the
    primary \n   path chosen by the SCTP user during the association initiation. \n
    \  This memo describes an extension to SCTP that allows endpoints to \n   use
    the multiple available paths for simultaneous data transmission. \n   The extension
    maintains SCTP congestion control on each path, so as \n   to ensure fair integration
    with other traffic in the network. \n\t "

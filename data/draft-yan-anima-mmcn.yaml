- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Based on different requirements, multiple mobility management\n   protocols
    have been developed.  Different protocols have different\n   functional requirements
    on the network element or the host and then a\n   scheme should be used in order
    to support the negotiation and\n   selection of adopted mobility management protocol
    when a host\n   accesses to a new network.  In this draft, this issue is analyzed.\n\n\t "

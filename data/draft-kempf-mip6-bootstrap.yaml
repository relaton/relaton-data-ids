  content: "\n   This document discusses the creation of a security association\n
    \  between a mobile node and a home agent that is previously unknown to\n   it.
    \ This problem is called the bootstrapping problem.  The document\n   discusses
    several different usage scenarios, as well as related\n   issues involving informing
    the mobile node of changes in the home\n   network topology and mobility management
    service.  Limitations of the\n   base Mobile IPv6 protocol in dealing with the
    scenarios are outlined.\n\t "

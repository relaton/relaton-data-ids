  content: "It is becoming clear that next generation telephony networks will be\n
    \  built on top of IP-based networks, as opposed to the traditional\n   voice
    technology.  There are several reasons for this, among them\n   lower cost and
    greater flexibility.\n \n   While there are several Voice on IP (VoIP) solutions,
    the H.323 [2]\n   standard from the ITU seems to be a major player.  Other solutions\n
    \  will probably resemble H.323, even if they do not comply with the\n   standard.
    \ This memo proposes an Application Interface to permit\n   H.323 devices to open
    'pinholes' in an otherwise opaque firewall, to\n   permit the traffic necessary
    for H.323 through, and nothing else.\n \n   Since other VoIP solutions resemble
    H.323, at least approximately,\n   the same Application Interface may well be
    useful for them.\n \n   In particular, Real-Time Protocol (RTP), defined in RFC1889
    [3], is\n   likely to be the underlying voice transport for any VoIP solution.\n\t "

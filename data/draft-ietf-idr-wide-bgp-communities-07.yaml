abstract:
- content: "<p>Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP relations, in
    communicating various routing policies between peers. It is also a very common
    best practice among operators to propagate various additional information about
    routes intra-domain. The most common tool used today to attach various information
    about routes is through the use of BGP communities. This document defines a new
    encoding which will enhance and simplify what can be accomplished today with the
    use of BGP communities. The most important addition this specification makes over
    currently defined BGP communities is the ability to specify, carry as well as
    use for execution an operator's defined set of parameters. It also provides an
    extensible platform for any new community encoding needs in the future.</p>"

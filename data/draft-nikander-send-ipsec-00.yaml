  content: "The Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) Working Group has produced an\nInternet
    Draft that proposes to use an IPsec AH header that carries\nboth a public key
    and a signature.  However, based on the recent\ndiscussion at the mailing lists
    it seems that such a usage of AH is\nconsidered inappropriate at least by some
    members of the IPSEC WG.\nIn this draft we introduce an alternative method, where
    a separate\nextension header is used to carry the public key, and the AH header\nonly
    contains a signature.\n\t "

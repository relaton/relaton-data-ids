  content: Mobility management for Dual stack mobile nodes  A Problem Statement

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft discusses the issues associated with mobility management \nfor
    dual stack mobile nodes. Currently, two mobility management \nprotocols are defined
    for IPv4 and IPv6. Deploying both in a dual \nstack mobile node introduces a number
    of inefficiencies. Deployment \nand operational issues motivate the use of a single
    mobility \nmanagement protocol. This draft discusses such motivations. The draft
    \nalso hints on how current MIPv4 and MIPv6 could be extended so that \nthey can
    support mobility management for a dual stack node.\n\t "

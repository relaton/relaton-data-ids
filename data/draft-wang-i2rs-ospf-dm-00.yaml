  content: "   OSPF (OSPFv2 and OSPFv3) is widely deployed link-state protocol in\n
    \  routing networks.  During the past decades, it has been operated and\n   maintained
    through typical CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.  With the expansion\n   and complication
    of modern networks, the necessity for rapid and\n   dynamic control has been increased.
    \ The I2RS is a standard-based\n   interface which provides a programmatic way
    to achieve this goal.\n\n   This document specifies an OSPF yang data model for
    the I2RS\n   interface to OSPF.  This model is based on the the I2RS OSPF\n   informational
    model (draft-ietf-wu-ospf-info-model-00) which\n   satisfies the requirements
    suggested by the I2RS use case\n   requirements for the IGPs.  This yang data
    model can be used by I2RS\n   client-agent protocol to program OSPF routing entities.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a binding from the iCalendar\nTransport-independent
    Interoperability Protocol [ITIP] to a real-time\ntransport. Calendaring entries
    defined by the iCalendar Object Model\n[ICAL] are composed using constructs from
    [RFC-2045], [RFC-2046],\n[RFC-2047], [RFC-2048] and [RFC-2049].\n \nThis document
    is based on the calendaring and scheduling model defined\nby [ICMS].\n \nThis
    document is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF)
    Calendaring and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group.\nMore information about the
    IETF CALSCH working group activities can be\nfound on the IMC website at http://www.imc.org,
    the IETF website at\nhttp://www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html. Refer
    to the\nreferences within this document for further information on how to\naccess
    these various documents.\n \nDistribution of this document is unlimited. Comments
    and suggestions\nfor improvement should be sent to the authors.\n\t "

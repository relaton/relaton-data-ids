abstract:
- language: en

  content: "   Internet Protocol security mechanisms, such as IP Security (IPsec)\n
    \  [IPSEC], provides various security services for IP traffic.  However,\n   the
    benefits offered by IPsec may come at the cost of increased\n   overhead.  This
    document identifies a methodology for integrating\n   header compression (HC)
    over IPsec (HCoIPsec).  HCoIPsec proposes to\n   reduce the amount of packet overhead
    associated with the transmission\n   of traffic over tunnel mode security associations.\n\t "

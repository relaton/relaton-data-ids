  content: "   This document presents a framework for Software Defined Networks\n
    \  (SDN).  The purpose of the framework is to provide\n   an overall picture of
    the problem space of SDN and to describe the\n   relationships among the various
    components necessary to manipulate\n   the components that comprise SDNs.  SDN
    requires the specification\n   of several key components including an \"orchestrator\"
    and various\n   \"plug-ins\" between the orchestrator function and network resources.\n
    \  In addition to this, an orchestrator will require interconnection\n   with
    standard policy bases, as well as other orchestrators in\n   distributed environments
    or insofar as to support high-availability\n   and fault-tolerance capabilities.
    To this end, several interfaces\n   and mechanisms to address issues such as enabling
    the orchestrator\n   to manipulate and interact with the control planes of devices
    such\n   as routers and switches, as well as a discourse between different\n   orchestrators
    will be described.  The intent of this document is\n   to outline what each interface
    needs to accomplish, and to describe\n   how these interfaces and mechanisms fit
    together, while leaving\n   their detailed specification to other documents.\n\n\n\t "

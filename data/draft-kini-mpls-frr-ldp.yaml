  content: "   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is widely deployed to signal Label\n
    \  Switched Paths (LSPs) due to its simple operational model.  Since LDP\n   establishes
    LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is\n   gated by the interior
    gateway protocol's (IGP's) re-convergence.\n   Though some mechanisms exist to
    do Fast Re-route (FRR) of LDP LSPs,\n   they suffer from significant complexity
    or lack of full coverage or\n   both.  This document describes a method to perform
    FRR of LDP LSPs\n   that retains the simple operational model of LDP.  The goal
    is to\n   provide 100% coverage for all failure scenarios including Shared Risk\n
    \  Link Group (SRLG) failure with recovery characteristics similar to\n   the
    methods in Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering\n   FRR (RSVP-TE-FRR).\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft describes an example use of the RESTful CoAP protocol for\n
    \  building automation and control (BAC) applications such as HVAC and\n   lighting.
    \ A few basic design assumptions are stated first, then URI\n   structure is utilized
    to define group as well as unicast scope for\n   RESTful operations.\n\n   This
    proposal supports the view that 1) service discovery is\n   complementary to resource
    discovery and facilitates control network\n   scaling, and 2) building control
    is likely to move in steps toward\n   all-IP control networks based on the legacy
    efforts provided by DALI,\n   LON, BACnet, ZigBee, and other standards.\n\n   The
    authority portion of the URI is used to identify a device (group)\n   and the
    resulting DNS name is bound to a unicast (multicast) address.\n   Group addressing
    has consequence for the naming convention of the\n   resources of a device.  Naming
    of URI is building or organization\n   dependent, must be flexible, and SHOULD
    conform to some local\n   convention.  Naming of resources MUST be standardised
    preferrable by\n   a building control related organisation.\n\n   It is shown
    that DNS-based service discovery can be used to locate\n   URIs on the scale necessary
    in large commercial BAC deployments.  The\n   relation of DNS-SD and a Resource
    Directory is discussed.  Finally, a\n   method is proposed for mapping URIs onto
    legacy BAC resources, e.g.,\n   to discover application-layer gateways, proxies,
    and their dependent\n   services.\n\n\t "

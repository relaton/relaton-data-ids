  content: "The Kerberos protocol does not allow ticket extensions.  This make it\nharder
    to deploy features like referrals and PKCROSS.\n\nSince the Kerberos protocol
    did not specified extensibility for the\nTicket structure and the current implementations
    are aware of the\ncontents of tickets, the extension protocol cannot simply extend
    the\nTicket ASN.1 structure.  Instead, the extension data needs to be\nhidden
    inside the ticket.\n\nThis protocol defines two methods to add extend the tickets.
    \ The\nfirst method requires updated clients and is more in line with the\nfuture
    development of Kerberos.  The second way does not require\nupdate client.  To
    take advantage of this protocol the server (KDC or\napplication server) need to
    update a well.  The two methods are\nequivalent and there is a 1-1 mapping between
    them.\n\t "

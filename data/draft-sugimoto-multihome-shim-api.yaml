abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a socket API for the multihoming shim layer.\n
    \  The API aims to enable interactions between the applications and the\n   multihoming
    shim layer for advanced locator management and also for\n   accessing to information
    about failure detection and path\n   exploration.\n\n   This document is based
    on an assumption that a multhomed host is\n   equipped with a 'shim' layer which
    essentially maintains mappings\n   between identifiers and locators at the IP
    layer.  SHIM6 and HIP are\n   examples of this shim layer.  Hence, the API can
    be commonly used by\n   SHIM6 and HIP.\n\n\n\n\t "

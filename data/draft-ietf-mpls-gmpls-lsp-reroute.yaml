  content: "This document describes how Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) PathErr
    messages may be used to trigger rerouting of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) point-to-point Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) without first removing LSP state or resources.  Such LSP rerouting
    may be desirable in a number of cases, including, for example, soft-preemption
    and graceful shutdown.  This document describes the usage of existing Standards
    Track mechanisms to support LSP rerouting.  In this case, it relies on mechanisms
    already defined as part of RSVP-TE and simply describes a sequence of actions
    to be executed.  While existing protocol definitions can be used to support reroute
    applications, this document also defines a new reroute-specific error code to
    allow for the future definition of reroute-application-specific error values.

  content: "   The requirements of SDN controllers including fundamental technical\n
    \  requirements, requirements of the SDN controller architecture and the\n   requirements
    of the SDN controller functionality are provided.  All\n   these requirements
    raised are focused on the scalability,\n   reliability, programmability, intercommunity,
    security and the\n   network management of the SDN controller.Based on the requirements,\n
    \  we have realized the SDN controller based on Opendaylight foused on\n   cloud
    datacenter.Due to realization, the interface between other\n   devices besides
    the ovs is not included up to now, while in the\n   actual design, some connections
    between controller and the forwarding\n   devices such as SDN gateway, firewall,
    and NAT are added into the\n   requirement of controller.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has\n
    \  been recently standardized as the de facto solution for routing in\n   the
    context of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. RPL,\n   along with
    other standards, has provided a baseline framework for IoT\n   that has helped
    advance communications in the world of embedded\n   resource-constrained networks.
    However, RPL still suffers from issues\n   that may limit its efficiency such
    as the absence of an efficient\n   load-balancing primitive.  To address this
    problem, a novel load-\n   balancing scheme is introduced that ensures a fair
    distribution of\n   traffic among nodes while minimizing overhead\n\n\n\n\n\t "

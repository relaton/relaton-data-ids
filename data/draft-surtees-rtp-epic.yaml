  content: "This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/UDP/IP using the\nEfficient
    Protocol Independent Compression (EPIC) [2] scheme.\nThe RObust Header Compression
    [1] scheme is designed to compress\npacket headers over error prone channels.
    \ It is built around an\nextensible core framework that can be tailored to compress
    new\nprotocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.\nThis profile gives behaviours
    similar to (a subset of) the\nfunctionality of [1] and is useful to show how EPIC
    would work on a\nprotocol stack about which much is already known.\n\t "

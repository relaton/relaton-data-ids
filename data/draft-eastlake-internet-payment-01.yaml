  script: Latn
  content: "The Internet is becoming an increasingly commercial arena in which information
    is being bought and sold and payments are rendered for services and data delivered
    within the Internet and for goods and services to be delivered outside of the
    Internet.  Thus far, the protocols and format used for such payments have been
    ad hoc and proprietary.            This draft proposes a uniform application level
    syntax to support commerce in applications level data and services Proposed specifications
    are given for how this syntax fits into and enables commerce in the data and services
    rendered by the World Wide Web, FTP, Telnet, SMTP, and DNS protocols.\n\t "

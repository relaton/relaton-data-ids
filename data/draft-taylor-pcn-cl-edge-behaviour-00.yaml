abstract:
- content: "<p>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality
    of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN
    architecture is described in ID.PCNArch. This memo is one of a series describing
    possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN domain. The behaviour described here
    is that for three-state measurement-based load control, known informally as CL.
    The requirement for three encoding states means that CL is for experimental use
    only pending further standards action.</p>"

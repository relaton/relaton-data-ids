  content: "   Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) authenticates and authorizes\n   organizations
    and individuals making and/or receiving telephone\n   calls.  This eliminates
    trust gaps that malicious parties exploit.\n   Like related technolgies such as
    SHAKEN, RCD, and BCID, VVP can bind\n   cryptographic evidence to a SIP INVITE,
    and verify this evidence\n   downstream.  VVP can also let evidence flow the other
    way, proving\n   things about the callee.  VVP builds from different technical
    and\n   governance assumptions than alternatives, and uses stronger, richer\n
    \  evidence.  This allows VVP to cross jurisdictional boundaries easily\n   and
    robustly.  It also makes VVP simpler, more decentralized, cheaper\n   to deploy
    and maintain, more private, more scalable, and higher\n   assurance.  Because
    it is easier to adopt, VVP can plug gaps or build\n   bridges between other approaches,
    functioning as glue in hybrid\n   ecosystems.  For example, it may justify an
    A attestation in SHAKEN,\n   or an RCD passport for branded calling, when a call
    originates\n   outside SHAKEN or RCD ecosystems.  VVP also works well as a\n   standalone
    mechanism, independent of other solutions.  An extra\n   benefit is that VVP enables
    two-way evidence sharing with verifiable\n   text and chat (e.g., RCS and vCon),
    as well as with other industry\n   verticals that need verifiability in non-telco
    contexts.\n\n\t "

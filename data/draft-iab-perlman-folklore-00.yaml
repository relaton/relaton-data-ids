  content: "   This document is intended to set the tone as an IETF collaboration
    to\n   collect various tricks and ''gotchas'' in protocol design. It is not\n
    \  intended to declare the ''right'' and ''wrong'' ways of doing things, but\n
    \  rather ''this practice has the following advantages and\n   disadvantages'',
    or ''here are several ways of solving the following\n   problem'', with technical
    explanation of the pros and cons of the\n   various approaches.\n \n   Discussion
    will take place on the mailing list\n   folklore@external.cisco.com. To join,
    send a message to folklore-\n   request@external.cisco.com.\n\n\t "

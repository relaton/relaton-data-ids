  content: "   This document proposes an extended Objective Function(OF)that\n   balances
    the number of child nodes of the parent nodes to avoid the\n   overloading problem
    and ensure node lifetime maximization in the IPv6\n   Routing Protocol for Low-Power
    and Lossy Networks (RPL). The standard\n   OFs are used to build a Destination
    Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph\n   (DODAG) where the bottleneck nodes may suffer
    from unbalanced traffic\n   load. As a result, a part of the network may be disconnected
    as the\n   energy of the overloaded preferred parent node will drain much faster\n
    \  than other candidate parents. Thus, a new RPL metric has been\n   introduced
    to balance the traffic load over the network. Finally, the\n   potential extra
    overhead has been mitigated using a new utilization\n   technique.\n\n\n\t "

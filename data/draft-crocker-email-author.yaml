- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Internet mail defines the From: header field to indicate the author of
    the message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who initially handled
    the message on the author's behalf. The Sender: field is optional if it has the
    same information as the From: field. This was not a problem until development
    of stringent protections on use of the From: field. It has prompted Mediators,
    such as mailing lists, to modify the From: field to circumvent mail rejection
    caused by those protections. In effect, the From: field has become dominated by
    its role as a handling identifier.\n\n The current specification augments the
    altered use of the From: field by specifying the Author: field, which ensures
    identification of the original author of the message and is not subject to modification
    by Mediators. This document is published as an Experimental RFC to assess community
    interest, functional efficacy, and technical adequacy.\n\t "

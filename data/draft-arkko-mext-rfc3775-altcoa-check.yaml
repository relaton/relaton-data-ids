  content: "This document revises the RFC 3775 rules on how Alternate Care-of\nAddress
    option is processed.  Alternate Care-of Address option is\nused to carry the current
    care-of address inside a Mobility Header\nmessage.  This is used in addition to
    the source address in the\npacket in order to ensure that the care-of address
    is protected by\nIPsec ESP, the security mechanism that protects Mobility Header\nmessages.
    \ Unfortunately, RFC 3775 did not require verification that\nthe source address
    and care-of address are the same.  This document\nadds that requirement.\n\t "

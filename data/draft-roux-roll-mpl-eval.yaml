  content: "   This draft presents simulation work and first results related to MPL\n
    \  performance evaluation.  The simulation makes it possible to evaluate\n   MPL
    performances in the context of a large network.  The simulated\n   network introduces
    500 nodes.  The general principles of the\n   simulator are described.  Then reference
    settings are introduced, and\n   evaluation indicators are proposed.  Finally
    preliminary results are\n   presented under the form of a few tables, that show
    the proposed\n   indicator values depending on some specific parameter which is
    used\n   as a variable argument.  Among various results, the advantage of\n   using
    reactive mode for MPL is shown in terms of the capability to\n   maintain loss
    free diffusion in harsh radio conditions.\n\n\t "

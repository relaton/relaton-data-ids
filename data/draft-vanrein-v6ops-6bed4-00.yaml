- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Given the limited resources available to a lot of embedded systems,\n
    \  dual-stack solutions are not always feasible for such hosts.  A\n   mechanism
    that supports a direct transition from IPv4-only to\n   IPv6-only may prove beneficial
    in getting the smallest hosts to make\n   a transition to IPv6 at a much earlier
    stage than would otherwise be\n   possible.  This calls for tunnels, but no current
    tunnel technique\n   appears to be optimal for embedded systems.\n\n   This specification
    details an IPv6 tunneling technique over UDP and\n   IPv4.  The technique is specifically
    designed to benefit embedded\n   systems, and to work without end user configuration.
    \ The working\n   principle for obtaining a routable IPv6 address is through stateless\n
    \  autoconfiguration from an anycast tunnel service.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The ALTO New Transport [draft-ietf-alto-new-transport] introduces\n
    \  ALTO transport information structures (TIS) at an ALTO server.  The\n   introduction
    of ALTO TIS allows at least two types of efficient\n   transport using HTTP: (1)
    HTTP/2/3 independent client long poll\n   allowed by non-blocking, newer HTTP,
    and (2) HTTP/2 specific server\n   push.  This document defines HTTP/2 specific
    server-push ALTO\n   transport based on ALTO TIS.\n\n\n\t "

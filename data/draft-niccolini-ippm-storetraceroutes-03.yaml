  content: "This memo describes a standard way to store traceroute measurements\nand
    related metrics.  To better address the traceroute measurements\nstoring issue,
    the authors first of all give a definition of the\ntraceroute tool, describe the
    tool itself as well as its parameters\nand the default values on the most common
    operating systems and the\noutput results that can be stored.  Afterwards, the
    common\ninformation model with the base elements of the traceroute\nmeasurement
    storing is defined dividing the information elements in\ntwo semantically separated
    groups (configuration elements and results\nones).  Moreover an additional element
    is defined to relate\nconfiguration elements and results ones by means of a common
    unique\nidentifier.  On the basis of the information model a data model is\nthen
    proposed in order to actually store the traceroute measurements.\nFinally considerations
    on how to extract relevant metrics related to\ntraceroute measurements are given.\n\t "

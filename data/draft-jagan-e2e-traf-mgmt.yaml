  content: "This document addresses the end-to-end traffic management issues in\n
    \  IP/ATM internetworks. In the internetwork environment, the ATM\n   control
    mechanisms (e.g., Available Bit Rate (ABR) and UBR with Early\n   Packet Discard
    (EPD)) are applicable to the ATM subnetwork, while the\n   TCP flow control extends
    from end to end. We investigated the end to\n   end performance in terms of TCP
    throughput and file transfer delay in\n   cases using ABR and UBR in the ATM subnetwork.
    In this document, we\n   also discuss the issue of trade-off between the buffer
    requirements\n   at the ATM edge device (e.g., Ethernet-ATM switch, ATM router\n
    \  interface) versus ATM switches inside the ATM network.\n \n   Our simulation
    results show that in certain scenarios (e.g., with\n   limited edge device buffer
    memory) UBR with EPD may perform\n   comparably to ABR or even outperform ABR.
    We show that it is not\n   sufficient to have a lossless ATM subnetwork from the
    end-to-end\n   performance point of view. The results illustrate the necessity
    for\n   an edge device congestion handling mechanism that can couple the ABR\n
    \  and TCP feedback control loops.  We present an algorithm that makes\n   use
    of the ABR feedback information and edge device congestion state\n   to make packet
    dropping decisions at the edge of the ATM network.\n   Using the algorithm at
    the edge device, the end-to-end performance in\n   throughput and delay are improved
    while using ABR as the ATM\n   subnetwork technology and with small buffers in
    the edge device.\n\t "

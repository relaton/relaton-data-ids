  content: "   With the increase number of protocols and applications that rely on\n
    \  digital certificates to authenticate either the communication channel\n   (TLS)
    or the data itself (PKIX), the need for providing an efficient\n   revocation
    system is paramount.  Although the Online Certificate\n   Status Protocol (OCSP)
    allows for efficient lookup of the revocation\n   status of a certificate, the
    distribution of this information via\n   HTTP (or very rarely) HTTPS is not particularly
    efficient for high\n   volume websites without incurring in high distribution
    costs (e.g.,\n   CDN).\n\n   In particular, this specification defines a new set
    of messages\n   (i.e., OCSPv2 Request and OCSPv2 Response) that address the\n
    \  inefficiencies of OCSPv1 by (a) providing range-based responses to\n   optimize
    (reduce) the number of pre-computed responses required by a\n   CA, and (b) allowing
    the inclusion of other (certificate chain)\n   responses in the same response
    for round-trip and caching\n   optimization.\n\n   The deployment of OCSPv2 to
    validate the status of a certificate is\n   meant to lower the costs of providing
    revocation services and\n   increase the efficiency of the service, thus allowing
    for short-lived\n   responses (i.e., hours instead of days).\n\n\t "

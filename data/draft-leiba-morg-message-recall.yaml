  content: "End users occasionally send email messages that they later want to\nrecall,
    perhaps because they sent incorrect information, or had\nsecond thoughts about
    what they said in the message.  Proprietary\nemail systems often provide such
    a recall function.  This document\nspecifies a standard mechanism for providing
    it with Internet email.\n\nNote\n\nA revised version of this draft document will
    be submitted to the RFC\neditor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.
    \ Discussion\nand suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent
    to\nmorg@ietf.org.\n\t "

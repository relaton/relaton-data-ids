  content: "   When multiple links in a network have the same metric, they can\n   serve
    as ECMP equivalent links for load balancing during forwarding.\n   However, slight
    fluctuations in metric values can prevent the\n   formation of ECMP equivalent
    links, leading to the idle state of\n   suboptimal links and thus wasting bandwidth
    resources.\n\n   This document proposes a method for normalizing metrics, allowing\n
    \  the slight fluctuations across multiple links to be adjusted so that\n   the
    resulting calculated metrics become identical. This enables the\n   formation
    of ECMP equivalent links, facilitating load distribution\n   during forwarding.\n\n\t "

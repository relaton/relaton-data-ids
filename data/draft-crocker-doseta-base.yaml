  content: "   DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism that\n
    \  enables easy development of security-related services, such as for\n   authentication
    or encryption.  It uses self-certifying keys based on\n   domain names.  The domain
    name owner can be any actor involved in the\n   handling of the data, such as
    the author's organization, a server\n   operator or one of their agents.  The
    DOSETA Library provides a\n   collection of common capabilities, including canonicalization,\n
    \  parameter tagging and key retrieval.  The DOSETA Signing Template\n   creates
    common framework for a signature of data that are in a\n   \"header/content\"
    form.  Defining the meaning of a signature is the\n   responsibility of the service
    that incorporates DOSETA.  Data\n   security is enforced through the use of cryptographic
    algorithms.\n\n\t "

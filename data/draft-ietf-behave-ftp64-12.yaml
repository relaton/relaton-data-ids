  content: "The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) has a very long history, and despite
    the fact that today other options exist to perform file transfers, FTP is still
    in common use. As such, in situations where some client computers only have IPv6
    connectivity while many servers are still IPv4-only and IPv6-to-IPv4 translators
    are used to bridge that gap, it is important that FTP is made to work through
    these translators to the best possible extent.\n\n FTP has an active and a passive
    mode, both as original commands that are IPv4-specific and as extended, IP version
    agnostic commands. The only FTP mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4
    translator is extended passive. However, many existing FTP servers do not support
    this mode, and some clients do not ask for it. This document specifies a middlebox
    that may solve this mismatch. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

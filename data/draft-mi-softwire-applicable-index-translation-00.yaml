abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Softwire working group is currently discussing both encapsulation\n
    \  and translation based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions in order to be\n   able
    to provide IPv4 connectivity to customers in an IPv6-Only\n   environment.\n\n
    \  The purpose of this document is to describe the basic issues and key\n   elements
    of the IPv4/IPv6 translation, and presents its applicability\n   index that would
    help the operators decide on the development scheme\n   for their IPv6 transition.It
    could lead to significant operational\n   benefits and potential savings for the
    operators.\n\n\t "

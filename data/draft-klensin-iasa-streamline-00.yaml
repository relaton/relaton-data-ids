- language: en

  content: "There have been many opportunities to examine the functioning of the\nIETF
    Administrative Support Activity (IASA) since its creation in\n2005 and the subsequent
    addition of the IETF Trust to its scope.\nSuggestions to do so have generally
    not progressed, in part because\nof constraints imposed by the IETF Trust.  Those
    constraints have now\nexpired.  The IASA has often fallen short of the expectations
    about\nopenness and transparency called for in BCP 101, with members of the\nIAOC
    and IETF Trust claiming excessive workload as a major cause of\nthat problem.
    \ This document proposes to change the workload\nrequirements.\n\t "

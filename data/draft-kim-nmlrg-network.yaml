  content: "   This document describes agent reinforcement learning (RL) in a\n   distributed
    environment to transfer or share information for\n   autonomous shortest path-planning
    over a communication network.  The\n   centralized node, which is the main node
    to manage agent workflow in\n   hybrid peer-to-peer environment, provides a cumulative
    reward for\n   each action that a given agent takes with respect to an optimal
    path\n   based on a to-be-learned policy over the learning process.  A reward\n
    \  from the centralized node is reflected when an agent explores to\n   reach
    its destination for autonomous shortest path-planning in\n   distributed nodes.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A darknet is a set of routable but unused IP addresses whose\n   monitoring
    is an effective way of detecting malicious activities on\n   the Internet.  We
    have developed an alert system - called DAEDALUS -\n   based-on a large-scale
    distributed darknet that consists of several\n   organizations that mutually observe
    the malicious packets transmitted\n   from the inside of the organizations.  This
    draft shares the schema\n   of an alert of the DAEDALUS to exchange incident information
    among\n   organizations.\n\n\t "

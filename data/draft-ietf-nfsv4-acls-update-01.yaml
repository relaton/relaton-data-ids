  content: "   This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the\n
    \  description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc881bis\n   respecification
    effort for NFSv4.1.  It describes the structure and\n   function of NFSv4 Access
    Control Lists within NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1.\n   These minor versions define ACLs
    using an ACL model based on Windows\n   ACLs.\n\n   Support for other ACL models
    such as draft POSIX ACLs remains an\n   option that could be taken advantage of
    in later minor versions such\n   as NFSv4.2.\n\n   This document describes the
    structure of these Windows-derived NFSv4\n   ACLs and their role in the NFSv4
    security architecture.  While the\n   focus of this document is on the role of
    these ACLs in providing a\n   more flexible approach to file access authorization
    than is made\n   available by the POSIX-derived authorization-related attributes,
    the\n   potential provision of other security-related functionality is\n   covered
    as well.\n\n   Because of the failure of previous specifications to provide a\n
    \  satisfactory description of the authorization semantics of NFSv4\n   ACLs,
    this document takes a different approach to many matters while\n   maintaining
    compatibility with implementations od previous\n   specifications, which dealt
    with the need for support for UNIX-\n   oriented clients and server by leaving
    many important matters\n   unspecified.\n\n   [Consensus Needed (Items #117a,
    #119a)]: In this document, the\n   relationship among the multiple ACL models
    for which potential\n   support was mentioned has changed.  A core set of functionality,\n
    \  shared in large part with that derived from a subset of the\n   functionality
    provided by the now-withdrawn draft-POSIX ACLs is\n   presented as the conceptual
    base of the feature set.  Additional sets\n   of features used to provide the
    functionality needed by clients\n   expecting Windows semantics as part of the
    NFSv4 ACL model are\n   considered as OPTIONAL extensions to that core.  In addition
    it is\n   made clear that support for the draft POSIX ACL model is not yet\n   present
    in NFSv4.1, but that a subset of that functionality is\n   available.\n\n   When
    the resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it\n   will supersede
    the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics\n   appearing in existing minor
    version specification documents for\n   NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby updating
    RFC7530 and RFC8881.\n\n\t "

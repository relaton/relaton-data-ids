- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The use of the SIP protocol for controlling Networked Appliances (NA)\nhas
    been proposed in several recent IETF drafts including [1] and\n[2]. The issue
    of controlling access to NAs from a remote device\nis paramount, especially in
    the context of NAs in the home. This\ndraft investigates the issue of where the
    access rules must be stored\nand executed to control access to an NA. The use
    of proxy gateways\nwithin the home domain and their resultant impact on communication\npathways
    between the remote device and the NAs have been studied.\n\t "

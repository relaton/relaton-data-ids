  content: "This memo describes a new IKE authentication method ([HC98]) which\nprovides
    for mutual authentication when one side is using a legacy-\nbased secret-key authentication
    technique such as RADIUS, SecurID, or\nOTP and the other side is using public-key
    authentication, with\noptional digital certificates.\nThe generic protocol described
    herein is an open-ended IKE phase 1\nexchange ([HC98]).  The result of this exchange
    is a mutually\nauthenticated IKE security association ([HC98]).  The keys that
    are\nderived from this SA are also authenticated and thereby convey this\nstate
    to any SA's created from it for any other security service,\nsuch as IPsec [Pip98].\n\n\t "

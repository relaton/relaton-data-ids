  content: "For the resource constrained devices and networks of 6LowApp it is\nessential
    that the payload of messages are compact.  The use of XML\nto represent data in
    web applications has become almost universal.\nThe interoperability of 6LowApp
    with these applications will require\nthat XML can also be carried over the embedded
    web.  This document\nintroduces and compares techniques for encoding or compressing
    XML\nfor use with 6LowApp including EXI, BXML and Fast Infoset.  The\nperformance
    and requirements for using these encodings are analyzed\nin the scope of 6LowApp.
    \ It is shown that these standard encodings\ncan represent XML in a compact form,
    with reasonable overhead, and\nrequire only Internet media type and content transfer
    encoding\nindication from the application protocol.\n\t "

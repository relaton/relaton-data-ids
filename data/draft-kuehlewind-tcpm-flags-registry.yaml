abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC2780 specifies the registration policy for reserved TCP header\n
    \  flags as Standards Action.  RFC3168 created an IANA registry for\n   these
    header flags and registered bit 8 (CWR) and 9 (ECE).  This\n   draft changes the
    registration policy of the registration to IETF\n   Review as usually new TCP
    mechanisms that could use the remaining\n   reserved flags will be first specified
    as experimental.  Not noting\n   any of those experiments in the registry would
    undermine the purpose\n   of having a registry.  However, care must be taken,
    as only a few\n   reserved flags are left and if a new (experimental) mechanism
    sees\n   deployment in the Internet, the flag cannot be unassigned anymore or\n
    \  used for something else.\n\n\t "

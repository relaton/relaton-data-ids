  content: "   This document describes EAP-SKL, an Extensible Authentication\n   Protocol
    (EAP) method which provides mutual authentication and key\n   derivation based
    on a pre-shared secret.  EAP-SKL relies on the\n   cryptographic protocol SKEME
    (Secure Key Exchange MEchanism\n   protocol), and hence may benefit from its simplicity
    and the provable\n   security.  EAP-SKL complies with the mandatory requirements
    for an\n   EAP method which is intented for deployment in Wireless LAN\n   environments.\n\t "

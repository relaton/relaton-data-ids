  script: Latn
  content: "   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), allows the creation of\n
    \  VPNs between routing locators (RLOCs).  As LISP encapsulated packets\n   are
    generally expected to traverse publically routed spaces, it is\n   desirable to
    encrypt the payloads of these packets, to protect them\n   from pervasive surveillance
    attacks.  This document describes a\n   methodology to encrypt LISP encapsulated
    packets, as they traverse\n   between RLOCs.\n\n   For a full description of LISP,
    please consult [RFC6830].\n\n\t "

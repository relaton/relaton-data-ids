  content: "       This draft proposes a Hierarchical Mobility Management (HMM) in\n
    \      Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) networks. The Internet is\n       divided
    into a number of mapping domains (MDs). An Agent Tunnel\n       Router (ATR) as
    an agent of each MD manages the Mobile Node's EID-to-\n       RLOC mapping. For
    the movement within the MD, the ATR keeps the EID-\n       to-RLOC mapping invariable,
    so it avoids the mapping update in the\n       mapping system and the Tunnel Router
    (TR) of each correspondent node.\n       For the handover between different MDs,
    to support fast update and\n       handover, a united mapping table is proposed
    in the ATR.\n\n    \n\t "

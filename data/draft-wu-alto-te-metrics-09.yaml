abstract:
- content: <p>Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO). It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the Endpoint Cost Service.
    Future extensions to ALTO may also use Cost Metric. Different applications may
    benefit from different Cost Metrics. For example, a Resource Consumer may prefer
    Resource Providers that have low delay to the Resource Consumer. However the base
    ALTO protocol [ALTO] has documented only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic
    "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]). In this document,
    we proposes a set of Cost Metrics, derived and aggregated from routing protocols
    with different granularity and scope, such as BGP-LS,OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, or from
    end to end traffic management tool. We currently document 11 new Performance Metric
    to measure network delay, jitter, packet loss, hop count, and bandwidth. The metrics
    documented in this document provide a relatively comprehensive set of Cost Metrics
    for ALTO and allow applications to determine "where" to connect based on end to
    end network performance criteria. Additional Cost Metrics such as financial cost
    metrics may be documented in other documents.</p>

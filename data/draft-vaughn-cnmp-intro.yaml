  content: "   The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the first\n
    \  version of the Condensed Network Management Protocol (CNMP)\n   Framework.
    This Framework follows the Internet-Standard Management\n   Framework (SNMPv3),
    but CNMP provides a more efficient encoding of\n   data by using Octet Encoding
    Rules (OER) coupled with a more compact\n   set of message structures, including
    a set of \"dynamic objects\",\n   which are defined at runtime, as originally
    used by the Simple\n   Transportation Management Protocol (STMP).\n\n   The document
    is intended to provide an option to using SNMPv3 and is\n   not intended to replace
    SNMPv3.  SNMPv3 will continue to offer the\n   advantage of providing a conceptually
    simple protocol, whereas CNMP\n   allows more compact messaging in high volume
    and bandwidth\n   constrained environments.\n\n\t "

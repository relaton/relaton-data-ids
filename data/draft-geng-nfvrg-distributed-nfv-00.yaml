  content: "   This document introduces the distributed NFV (D-NFV) concept based
    on\n   potential implementation in scattered locations including customer\n   edge
    devices and transport network equipments.  The motivation of\n   pushing NFV entities
    from conventional centralized infrastructures to\n   distributed promises is discussed,
    which are driven by the\n   requirements of high flexibility, low end-to-end latency
    and faster\n   time-to-market in future network.  To better understand the D-NFV\n
    \  concept, examples of D-NFV implementation is introduced.  Potential\n   use
    cases are also described as references for readers.  Gaps have\n   also been recognized
    in the documents in terms of the investigation\n   of appropriate virtualization
    technologies used in the D-NFV and\n   corresponding management and orchestration
    challenges.\n\n\t "

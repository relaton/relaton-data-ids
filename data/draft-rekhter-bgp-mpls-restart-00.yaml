  script: Latn
  content: "[1] describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize the\nnegative
    effects on routing caused by BGP restart. This document\nextends this mechanism
    to also minimize the negative effects on MPLS\nforwarding when BGP is used to
    carry MPLS labels [2]. The mechanism\ndescribed in this document is agnostic with
    respect to the types of\nthe addresses carried in the BGP NLRI. As such it works
    in\nconjunction with any of the address famililies that could be carried\nin BGP
    (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, etc...)\n\n\t "

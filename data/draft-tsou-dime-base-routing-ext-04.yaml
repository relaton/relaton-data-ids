abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two(2) extensions to the current diameter routing
    scheme. The first extension describes an explicit routing mechanism that MAY be
    employed by Diameter nodes to allow specific stateful Diameter proxies to remain
    in the path of all messages exchanges constituting a Diameter session. The second
    extension describes a realm based redirection scheme as an alternative to host
    based redirection described in [RFC3588].</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "   Operational efficiency in incident management on telecom and computer\n
    \  networks requires correlating and interpreting large volumes of\n   heterogeneous
    technical information.  Knowledge graphs can provide a\n   unified view of complex
    systems through shared vocabularies.  YANG\n   data models enable describing network
    configurations and automating\n   their deployment.  However, both approaches
    face challenges in\n   vocabulary alignment and adoption, hindering knowledge
    capitalization\n   and sharing on network designs and best practices.  To address
    this,\n   the concept of a meta-knowledge graph is introduced to leverage\n   existing
    network infrastructure descriptions in YANG format and\n   enable abstract reasoning
    on network behaviors.  An experiment is\n   proposed to assess the potential of
    the meta-knowledge graph in\n   improving network quality and designs.\n\n\t "

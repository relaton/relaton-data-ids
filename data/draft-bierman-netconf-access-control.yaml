- language: en

  content: "The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with\nthe
    NETCONF protocol requires a structured and secure operating\nenvironment, which
    promotes human usability and multi-vendor\ninteroperability.  There is a need
    for standard mechanisms to\nrestrict NETCONF protocol access for particular users
    to a pre-\nconfigured subset of all available NETCONF operations and content.\nThis
    document discusses requirements for a suitable access control\nmodel, and provides
    one solution which meets these requirements.\n\t "

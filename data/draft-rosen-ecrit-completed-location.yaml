  content: "This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows a\nrequest
    to specify that a PIDF be returned in the response if the\nlocation was valid,
    but there were some missing elements.  For\nexample, an civic location that did
    not include a postal code, but\nwas otherwise a complete, and unambiguous location,
    would receive a\ncomplete PIDF in the response that included the postal code.\n\t "

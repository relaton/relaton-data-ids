  content: "P4P is a framework that enables Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and\nnetwork
    application software distributors to work jointly and\ncooperatively to optimize
    application communications.  The goals of\nthis cooperation are to reduce network
    resource consumption and to\naccelerate network applications.  In this document,
    we specify how\nP4P allows ISPs to provide network guidance to applications, allowing\nclients
    to exchange data more effectively.  The applications we focus\non are those that
    can have a choice in connection patterns, in\nparticular peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.\n\t "

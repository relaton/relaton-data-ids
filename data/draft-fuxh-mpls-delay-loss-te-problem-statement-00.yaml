  content: "   Deployment and usage of cloud based applications and services that
    use\n   an underlying MPLS network are expanding and an increasing number of\n
    \  applications are extremely sensitive to delay and packet loss.\n   Furthermore,
    in cloud computing an additional decision problem arises of\n   simultaneously
    choosing the data center to host applications along with\n   MPLS network connectivity
    such that the overall performance of the\n   application is met. Existing mechanisms
    exist to measure and monitor\n   MPLS path performance parameters for packet loss
    and delay, but only\n   after the path has been setup. These cloud-based and performance\n
    \  sensitive applications would benefit from measurement of MPLS network\n   and
    potential path information that would be provided for use in the\n   computation
    and selection of LSPs.\n\n   This document provides a statement of problems faced
    by these cloud\n   based and performance sensitive applications and describes
    requirements\n   to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of the MPLS
    network and\n   allow new performance parameters to be reported and used in the\n
    \  computation of MPLS services in support of these cloud based and\n   performance
    sensitive applications.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies Hello extensions to Transport Layer Security\n(TLS).
    \ One extension is used for carrying application data which is\nsuitable for delayed
    integrity protection and does not require\nprivacy protection.  Another extension
    is used to negotiate an early\nstart to the application data protocol in the case
    of initial TLS\nconnections (i.e., which do not resume sessions).\n\nWe describe
    how to use these extensions to reduce the number of round\ntrips needed for application-layer
    authentication, by piggy-backing\nSimple Authentication (SASL) mechanism negotiation
    on the first leg\nof a TLS handshake and the first round of SASL authentication\nmessages
    on the second leg of the same TLS handshake.  Through SASL\nwe get support for
    Generic Security Services (GSS-API) mechanisms.\nChannel binding is used from
    SASL authentication to the TLS channel.\nThis results in a two round-trip optimization
    for applications that\nuse SASL on top of TLS.\n\nWe also provide generic framing
    for SASL authentication messages\nwhich, combined with the use of these extensions,
    will be referred to\nas \"TLS/SA\".  These extensions can also be used to optimize\napplication
    protocols separately from SASL.\n\t "

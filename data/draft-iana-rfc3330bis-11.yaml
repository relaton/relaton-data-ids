  content: "This document obsoletes RFC 3330.  It describes the global and other specialized
    IPv4 address blocks that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    (IANA).  It does not address IPv4 address space assigned to operators and users
    through the Regional Internet Registries, nor does it address IPv4 address space
    assigned directly by IANA prior to the creation of the Regional Internet Registries.
    \ It also does not address allocations or assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous
    system numbers.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.\n\t "

  content: "   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) operates at the IP layer and\n   delivers
    services which provide extremely low data loss rates and\n   bounded latency within
    a network domain.  DetNet can be seen as a\n   specialized branch of Traffic Engineering.
    \ There is a requirement to\n   use DetNet to provide Quality of Service (QoS)
    in large-scale\n   networks.  TE can be a valuable tool to help scale DetNet.\n\n
    \  This document provides a framework for traffic engineering to achieve\n   DetNet
    QoS in enhanced DetNet.  It provides references to DetNet\n   control plane and
    data plane enhancements that can be used to deliver\n   DetNet traffic engineering.\n\n\t "

    quality of service of inelastic flows.  It does this by marking\npackets when
    traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a\nthreshold below the physical
    link rate.  This document specifies an\nextension to the two-state PCN baseline
    encoding that enables three\nencoding states to be carried in the IP header without
    using more\nthan one Diffserv codepoint.  It presupposes a standards action has\nremoved

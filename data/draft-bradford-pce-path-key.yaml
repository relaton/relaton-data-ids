  content: "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) \n   Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation \n   Elements (PCEs).
    Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such \n   as Autonomous Systems (ASs),
    the path may be computed by multiple \n   PCEs that cooperate, with each responsible
    for computing a segment \n   of the path. However, in some cases (e.g. when ASs
    are \n   administered by separate Service Providers), it would break \n   confidentiality
    rules for a PCE to supply a path segment to a PCE \n   in another domain, thus
    disclosing internal topology information. \n   This issue may be circumvented
    by returning a loose hop and by \n   invoking a new path computation from the
    domain boundary LSR \n   during TE LSP setup as the LSP enters the second domain,
    but this \n   technique has several issues including the problem of maintaining
    \n   path diversity. \n    \n   This document defines a mechanism to hide the
    contents of a \n   segment of a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS).
    The \n   CPS may be replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCE \n
    \  Communication Protocol (PCEP) and signaled within in a Resource \n   Reservation
    Protocol (RSVP) explicit route object.\n\t "

  content: "This memo suggests a 'KidCode' naming convention to be used to inform
    web browsing programs when the material being made available on the web is of
    a nature that might be unsuitable for children.  Some aspects of the convention
    are also applicable to browsing by FTP, to news reading, and to other protocols
    as well.    Two separate conventions are specified.  One convention is to be used
    for fixed URL's, where the permanent URL is itself used to specify the nature
    of the child-oriented restrictions.  Another convention is to be used when the
    server site desires to use a simpler or pre-existing URL, with restrictions enforced
    using a naming convention in conjunction with the standard web forms mechanism.
    \      A web site or server is said to be KidCode-compliant when it conforms to
    one of the KidCode naming conventions for all material that might be considered
    inappropriate for children.   A web client or browser is said to be KidCode-compliant
    when it blocks access to URL's that are labelled as inappropriate using the KidCode
    naming conventions, or when it offers an easy optional mechanism permitting adults
    to block children's access in that manner.\n\t "

  content: "   The EDIINT AS1, AS2 and AS3 message formats do not currently contain\n
    \  any neutral provisions for transporting and exchanging trading\n   partner
    profiles or digital certificates. EDIINT Certificate Exchange\n   Messaging provides
    the format and means to effectively exchange\n   certificates for use within trading
    partner relationships. The\n   messaging consists of two types of messages, Request
    and Response,\n   which allow trading partners to communicate certificates, their\n
    \  intended usage and their acceptance through XML. Certificates can be\n   specified
    for use in digital signatures, data encryption or SSL/TLS\n   over HTTP (HTTPS).\n\n\t "

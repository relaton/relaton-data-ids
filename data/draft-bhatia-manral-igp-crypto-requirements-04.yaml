  content: "The interior gateway routing protocols Open Shortest Path First \n   version
    2 (OSPFv2) [RFC2328], Intermediate System to Intermediate \n   System (IS-IS)
    [ISO] [RFC1195] and Routing Information Protocol (RIP) \n   [RFC2453] currently
    define Clear Text and Message Digest 5 (MD5) \n   [RFC1321] algorithms for authenticating
    their protocol packets. There \n   have recently been documents adding support
    of the Secure Hash \n   Algorithm (SHA) family of hash functions for authenticating
    routing \n   protocol packets for RIP [RFC4822], IS-IS [ISIS-HMAC] and OSPF [OSPF-\n
    \  HMAC]. \n    \n   To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations,
    it is \n   imperative that we specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms
    \n   thereby ensuring that there is at least one algorithm that all \n   implementations
    will have available.   \n    \n   This document defines the current set of mandatory-to-implement
    \n   algorithms to be used for the cryptographic authentication of these \n   routing
    protocols as well as specifying the algorithms that should be \n   implemented
    because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future \n   time.\n\t "

  content: "Real-time applications like VoIP in mobile networks need smooth\nhandovers
    in order to minimize or eliminate packet loss as a mobile\nnode (MN) transitions
    between network links.  This document defines\na buffering mechanism for IPv6
    by which an MN can request that the\nrouter on its current subnet buffers packets
    on its behalf while the\nMN completes registration procedures with the router
    of a new subnet.\nOnce the registration is complete and the MN has a valid care-of\naddress
    in the new network, the buffered packets can be forwarded\nfrom the previous router,
    thus reducing the possibility of packet\nloss during the transition.\n\n\t "

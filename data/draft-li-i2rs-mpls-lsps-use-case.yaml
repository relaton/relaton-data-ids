  content: "   The Label-switched paths (LSPs) play fundument role in MPLS domain.\n
    \  Traditionally Label-switched paths (LSPs) are established by the\n   network
    operator via CLI, SNMP or NETCONF for a variety of purposes,\n   such as to create
    network-based IP virtual private networks or to\n   route traffic along specified
    paths through the network.  Interface\n   to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic
    interfaces provides an\n   alternate way to create and maintain the LSPs.This
    document describes\n   requirement and use case for which I2RS can be used for
    LSPs\n   management.\n\n\n\t "

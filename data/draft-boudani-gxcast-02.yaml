  content: "Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale better\nwith
    the number of multicast groups than traditional multicast does.\nThese proposals
    are known as small group multicast (SGM) or explicit\nmulticast (Xcast). Explicit
    multicast protocols, such as the Xcast \nprotocol, encode the list of group members
    in the Xcast header of \nevery packet. If the number of members in a group increases,
    routers\nmay need to fragment an Xcast packet. Fragmented packets may not be \nidentified
    as Xcast packets by routers. In this paper, we show that \nthe Xcast protocol
    does not support the IP fragmentation and we show\nalso that avoiding fragmentation
    induces hard-coded limits inside the\nprotocol itself in terms of group size.
    First, we describe the Xcast\nprotocol, the Xcast+ protocol (which is an extension
    of Xcast) and we\ncompare these two protocols with traditional multicast protocols.We\npropose
    then a generalized version of the Xcast protocol, called\nGXcast, intended to
    permit the Xcast packets fragmentation and to\nsupport the increasing in the number
    of members in a multicast\ngroup.\n\t "

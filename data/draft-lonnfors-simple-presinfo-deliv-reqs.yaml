  content: "A Presence service implemented using SIMPLE has some constraints for \ndelivering
    presence information to devices with low data processing \ncapabilities, small
    display, and limited battery power. Other \nlimitations can be caused by the interface
    between the terminal and \nthe network, i.e. over radio links with high latency
    and low \nbandwidth. This memo presents requirements for a solution that aids
    \nin reducing the impacts of those constrains and increasing \nefficiency. \n\t "

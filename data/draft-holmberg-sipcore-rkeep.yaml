  content: "   This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n
    \  Via header field parameter, \"rkeep\".  The \"rkeep\" parameter allows a\n
    \  SIP entity to indicate willingness to receive keep-alives from its\n   adjacent
    downstream SIP entity, the adjacent downstream SIP entity to\n   indicate willingness
    to send keep-alives, and for SIP entities\n   willing to send keep-alives to inform
    the receiver about the keep-\n   alive interval.\n\n\t "

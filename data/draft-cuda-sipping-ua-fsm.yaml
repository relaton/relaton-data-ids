  script: Latn
  content: "   This document provides a formal description of the interactions\n   between
    two SIP User Agents establishing a multimedia session,\n   describing the negotiation
    of the two parties as an exchange of\n   signals between two instances of networks
    of Finite State Machines\n   (FSMs).\n\n   The goal is to provide a common reference
    model for both SIP\n   extensions and User Agent implementations: two flows that
    can be\n   implemented by using the external interface of the FSMs are\n   guaranteed
    not to conflict to each other.  On the other hand a\n   reference model for User
    Agents is expected to improve\n   interoperability between different implementations
    and help\n   implementors to model their software in a way that makes SIP\n   extensions
    conforming to this document easier to implement.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation
    in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled by Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS). MPLS and GMPLS networks may be
    constructed from layered client/server networks. It is advantageous for overall
    network efficiency to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network
    layers. PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements. Generic requirements
    for a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs
    are presented in RFC 4657, "Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol
    Generic Requirements". Generic requirements for a PCE discovery protocol are presented
    in RFC 4674, "Requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery". This
    document complements the generic requirements and presents detailed sets of PCC-PCE
    communication protocol requirements and PCE discovery protocol requirements for
    inter-layer traffic engineering. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>

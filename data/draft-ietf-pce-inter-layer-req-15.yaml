  script: Latn
  content: "The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation
    in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled by Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).\n\n MPLS and GMPLS networks may
    be constructed from layered client/server networks. It is advantageous for overall
    network efficiency to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network
    layers. PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.\n\n Generic requirements
    for a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs
    are presented in RFC 4657, \"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol
    Generic Requirements\". Generic requirements for a PCE discovery protocol are
    presented in RFC 4674, \"Requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery\".\n\n
    This document complements the generic requirements and presents detailed sets
    of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements and PCE discovery protocol requirements
    for inter-layer traffic engineering. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "   SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) are often envisaged to also be\n
    \  on the media path, rather than just intercepting signalling.  This\n   means
    that B2BUAs often implement an RTP/RTCP stack as well, whether\n   to act as media
    transcoders or to just passthrough the media\n   themselves, thus leading to separate
    media legs that the B2BUA\n   correlates and bridges together.  If not disciplined,
    though, this\n   behaviour can severely impact the communication experience,\n
    \  especially when statistics and feedback information contained in RTCP\n   packets
    get lost because of mismatches in the reported data.\n\n   This document defines
    the proper behaviour B2BUAs should follow when\n   also acting on the media plane
    in order to preserve the end-to-end\n   functionality of RTCP.\n\n\t "

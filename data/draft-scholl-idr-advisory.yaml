  content: "The BGP routing protocol is used with external as well as internal\nneighbors
    to propagate route advertisements.  In the case of external\nBGP sessions, there
    is typically a demarcation of administrative\nresponsibility between the two entities.
    \ Provisioning, maintenance\nand administrative actions are communicated via off-line
    methods such\nas email or telephone calls.  While these methods have been used
    for\nmany years, it can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a BGP-\nrelated
    event in the network with a notice that was transmitted in\nemail.\n\nThis document
    proposes a new BGP message type, the Advisory message,\nwhich can be used to convey
    advisory information to a BGP speaker's\npeer.  A capability is used to ensure
    that the recipient of the\nAdvisory message is capable of supporting it.\n\t "

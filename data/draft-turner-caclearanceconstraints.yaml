  content: "This document defines the syntax and semantics for the Clearance \n   attribute
    and the Authority Clearance Constraints extension in X.509 \n   certificates.
    \ The Clearance attribute is used to indicate the \n   clearance held by the subject.
    \ The Clearance attribute may appear in     the subject directory attributes extension
    of a public key \n   certificate or in the attributes field of an attribute certificate.
    \ \n   The Authority Clearance Constraints certificate extension values in a \n
    \  Trust Anchor (TA), CA public key certificates, and an Attribute \n   Authority
    (AA) public key certificate in a public key certification \n   path constrain
    the effective Clearance of the subject. \n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses techniques to improve the performance of TCP\n
    \  over satellite-ATM networks. ATM provides the ABR, UBR and GFR\n   service
    categories for data traffic. TCP experiences poor performance\n   over UBR due
    to bursty packet losses during congestion.  Buffer\n   management and guaranteed
    rate techniques to improve TCP performance\n   over UBR are presented. The performance
    of TCP over ABR and the\n   interaction of ABR congestion control mechanisms with
    TCP congestion\n   control mechanisms are also described.  This document is intended
    to\n   be in informational document for the efficient transport of TCP over\n
    \  satellite-ATM networks.\n\n\t "

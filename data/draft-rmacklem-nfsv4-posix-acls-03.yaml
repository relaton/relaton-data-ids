  content: "   This document describes a potential protocol extension involving the\n
    \  addition of four new attributes to be used by servers to provide\n   support
    for POSIX ACLs.  The term POSIX ACLs refers to the ACL\n   component of the Portable
    Operating System Interface (POSIX) 1003.1e\n   draft 17 [IEEE] document for which
    sponsorship was withdrawn in\n   January 1998.  Although the draft POSIX standard
    that describes these\n   ACLs was never ratified, several POSIX-based operating
    systems, such\n   as Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD include support for them.  The
    NFS\n   Version 4 (NFSv4) ACLs described in [RFC8881] henceforth referred to\n
    \  as NFSv4 ACLs, use a different model and attempts to map between the\n   ACLs
    of these two models have not been completely successful.  In\n   order to adequately
    support POSIX ACLs, this document proposes four\n   new attributes that may optionally
    be used by an NFS Version 4, minor\n   version 2 (NFSv4.2) server to support ACLs
    that conform to the\n   aforementioned POSIX 1003.1e draft 17.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a system for the forwarding of encrypted HTTP\n
    \  messages.  This allows a client to make multiple requests of a server\n   without
    the server being able to link those requests to the client or\n   to identify
    the requests as having come from the same client.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This
    note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this draft

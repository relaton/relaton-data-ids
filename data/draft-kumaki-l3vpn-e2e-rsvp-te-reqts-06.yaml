  content: "Some service providers want to build a service which guarantees QoS \n
    \  or bandwidth from a local CE to a remote CE through the network. \n   Today,
    customers expect to run triple play services through BGP/MPLS \n   IP-VPNs. As
    a result, their requirements for end-to-end QoS of \n   applications are increasing.
    Depending on the application (e.g., \n   voice, video, bandwidth-guaranteed data
    pipe, etc.), an end-to-end \n\n   native RSVP path and/or an end-to-end MPLS TE
    LSP are required, and \n   they need to meet some constraints. \n   This document
    describes service provider requirements for supporting \n   customer RSVP and
    RSVP-TE over a BGP/MPLS VPN\n\t "

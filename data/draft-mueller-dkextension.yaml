  content: "   Naive Distance Vector-based routing protocols like the Routing\n   Information
    Protocol [RFC_1058] suffer from a phenomena called the\n   \"count to infinity
    problem\" in the event of a network topology\n   change.  This Internet Draft
    extends a naive Distance Vector routing\n   implementation with a simple flag
    that allows the network to recover\n   quickly and reliably, with no chance of
    routing loops to occur.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed
    before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker
    can be found at\n   https://github.com/Sebastianmueller22/network-protocol.\n\n\t "

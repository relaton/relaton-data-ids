  content: "The scenarios where Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Mobile IPv6\n(MIPv6)
    protocols interact with each other need special\nconsiderations.  An analysis
    of all the scenarios that involve this\ninteraction is necessary in order to provide
    guidelines to PMIPv6\nprotocol design and applicability.  This document describes
    all\nidentified possible scenarios, which require an interaction between\nPMIPv6
    and MIPv6 and discusses all issues related to these scenarios.\nSolutions to enable
    these scenarios are also described.Requirements Language\n\nThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\t "

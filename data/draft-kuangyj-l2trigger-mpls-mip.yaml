  content: "   This document extends the integration of Mobile IP (MIP) and Multi-\n
    \  Protocol Label Switch (MPLS) with Layer2 Triggers (L2T) to expedite \n   handoff
    and route optimization procedures. In the proposal, MPLS \n   acts as only a fast
    second layer switch technique to setup a \n   connection-oriented communication
    network, while MIP or IP acts as a \n   signaling protocol to operate, administrate
    and manage MPLS network. \n   L2Ts in this proposal are introduced to trigger
    signaling process of \n   rerouting, extension and recovery of label switch paths
    (LSP) rather \n   than to trigger registration or binding update of new care-of
    \n   address (CoA), in traditional MIP. Moreover, in the proposed \n   architecture,
    IP-in-IP tunneling is replaced by LSPs to support \n   mobility, which reduces
    packet overhead thus mitigates network \n   burden and makes it easy to support
    quality-of-service (QoS) or \n   class-of-service (CoS). Therefore, the proposed
    scheme is well \n   suited for time-constrained or delay-sensitive applications.\n\t "

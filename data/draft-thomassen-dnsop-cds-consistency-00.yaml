  content: "   For maintaining DNSSEC Delegation Trust, DS records have to be kept\n
    \  up to date.  [RFC7344] automates this by having the child publish CDS\n   and/or
    CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective DS parameters.\n   Parent-side entities
    (e.g.  Registries, Registrars) can use these\n   records to update the delegation's
    DS records.  A common method for\n   detecting changes in CDS/CDNSKEY record sets
    is to query them\n   periodically from the child zone (\"polling\"), as described
    in\n   Section 6.1 of [RFC7344].\n\n   This document specifies that if polling
    is used, parent-side entities\n   MUST ensure that CDS/CDNSKEY record sets are
    equivalent across all of\n   the child's authoritative nameservers, before taking
    any action based\n   on these records.\n\n\t "

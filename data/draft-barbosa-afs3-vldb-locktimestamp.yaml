  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes the repurposing of the currently unused\n   spares2
    field within the nvldbentry and uvldbentry structures.  The\n   primary objective
    is to utilize this field for storing the timestamp\n   representing the date and
    time when a given volume location entry was\n   locked.  To make this possible,
    this memo requests the allocation of\n   a new capability bit, VLDB_CAPABILITY_LOCKTIMESTAMP,
    to be advertised\n   by the Volume Location Server.  When advertised, this bit
    indicates\n   that the server has the capacity to provide the timestamp in\n   question.\n\n\t "

  content: "There is a need to extend the RMON framework [RFC2819] to monitor end\ndevices
    such as IP phones, pagers, Instant Message Clients, mobile\nphones, and PDA devices.
    \ This memo proposes an extension of RMON\nFramework to allow Real-time Application
    QoS information of these\ntypes of end devices to be retrieved with SNMP, independent
    of the\ntechnology used to perform the measurements. An end-to-end user\nexperience
    of the quality of service (QoS) and performance for such\nan application is a
    combination of device performance, transport\nnetwork performance and specific
    application context.\nThe memo also defines a common framework to identify a set
    of\napplication QoS parameters and a reporting mechanism using a common\nprotocol
    data unit (PDU) format used between RAQMON Data Source (RDS)\nand RAQMON Report
    Collector (RRC) to report QOS statistics using RTCP\nand SNMP as underlying transport
    protocol.\nThe original RAQMON draft <draft-siddiqui-rmonmib-raqmon-mib-01.txt>\nis
    split into 3 parts namely RAQMON Framework, RAQMON QOS PDU and\nRAQMON MIB. This
    memo only defines the RAQMON Framework along with\ncompanion drafts <draft-siddiqui-rmonmib-raqmon-mib-02.txt>
    that\ndefines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) and\n<draft-siddiqui-rmonmib-raqmon-pdu-00.txt>
    that defines RAQMON PDUs.\nDistribution of this memo is unlimited.\n\t "

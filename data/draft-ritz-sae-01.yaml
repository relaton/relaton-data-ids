abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the Static Artifact Exchange (SAE) protocol,
    an asynchronous transport pattern for exchanging cryptographic artifacts between
    two parties via a shared, stateless repository. SAE uses a "publish-then-poll,"
    pull-only communication model where peers use the presence and size of immutable
    artifacts to coordinate a sequenced exchange. By enforcing a strict set of invariants,
    including a prohibition on parsing arbitrary content to drive the transport's
    state machine, SAE is designed to minimize common attack surfaces like injection
    and parser vulnerabilities. The pattern is transport-agnostic and is intended
    for use by higher-level cryptographic protocols, like Ephemeral Compute Attestation
    (ECA), that require a secure, minimal channel.</p>

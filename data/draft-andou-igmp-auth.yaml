  content: "This memo describes IGAP, which allows user IP user clients and IP\nrouters
    or network access servers to verify whether they can\nparticipate in a multicast
    group they hope and transport some\ninformation about it. IGAP is derived from
    IGMPv2, which can make\nusers join a multicast group, who has the claim to participate
    a\nmulticast group in a service. It's important for service providers\nto protect
    their revenue source.\n\t "

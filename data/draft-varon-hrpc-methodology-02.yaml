  content: "   This document presents steps undertaken for developing a methodology\n
    \  to map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related\n   to
    promotion and protection of Human Rights, particularly the right\n   to freedom
    of expression and association.  It aims to facilitate and\n   build the work done
    by the Human Rights Protocol Considerations\n   research group in the IRTF, as
    well as other authors within the IETF.\n\n   Exemplary work [RFC1984] [RFC6973]
    [RFC7258] has already been done in\n   the IETF on privacy issues that should
    be considered when creating an\n   Internet protocol.  But, beyond privacy considerations,
    concerns for\n   freedom of expression and association were also a strong part
    of the\n   world-view of the community involved in developing the first Internet\n
    \  protocols.  Indeed, promoting open, secure and reliable connectivity\n   is
    essential for these rights.  But how are this concepts addressed\n   in the protocol
    level?  Are there others?  This ID is intended to\n   explain research work done
    so far and to explore possible\n   methodological approaches to move further on
    exploring and exposing\n   the relations between standards and protocols and the
    promotion and\n   protection of the rights to freedom of expression and association.\n\n

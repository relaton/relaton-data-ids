- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes extensions to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\n
    \  for flooding the link states on a topology that is a subgraph of the\n   complete
    topology of a BGP-SPF domain, so that the amount of flooding\n   traffic in the
    domain is greatly reduced.  This would reduce\n   convergence time with a more
    stable and optimized routing\n   environment.\n\n\n\t "

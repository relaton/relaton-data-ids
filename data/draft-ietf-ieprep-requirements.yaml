  content: "This document outlines user requirements for IP-based networks to \nenable
    and support an authorized emergency telecommunications service \n(ETS)for use
    by authorities to organize and coordinate emergency and \ndisaster relief operations.
    \ It provides a basis from which ETS can \nbe negotiated to provide user-acceptable
    communications.  The \nrequirements in this document relate to user expectation
    and are \ngeneral, functional, and intended to provide wide latitude in \nimplementation
    options.  This document also provides in-depth \nbackground on the state of emergency
    telecommunication capabilities \nas they exist today and the motivation for supporting
    these in IP \nnetworks.  Specific system requirements involving end-to-end and
    \nnetwork issues are presented in [2]. \n\n\t "

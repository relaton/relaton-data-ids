  content: "   Some aspects of a device can not be intuited by the device itself.\n
    \  For instance, a router platform may have no way to know what color\n   the
    case is, where in a cabinet it is located, or which electrical\n   circuit it
    is connected to.  This kind of information must be\n   provided through an Endorsement:
    a statement from a third party.\n\n   These statements may require human audiitors
    to inspect the device\n   physically.  But, which device is really in front of
    an auditor?\n   This document describes a mechanism by which an auditor can make\n
    \  physical contact with a device and collect information to identify\n   the
    device in a cryptographically strong manner.\n\n   This protocol is not designed
    to run over Internet Protocol cabling,\n   but rather over mechanisms such as
    USB cables, or serial consoles.\n\n\t "

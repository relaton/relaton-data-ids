  content: "   NMDA architectural framework eliminates the need to duplicate data\n
    \  structures to provide separate configuration and operational state\n   sections
    and uses different datastores and new protocol operations to\n   distinct configuration
    from operation state.  However when non-NMDA\n   clients communicate with NMDA
    aware server, it is not clear whether\n   the NMDA aware server can use existing
    operation to return the same\n   results with <rpc-reply> as non-NMDA-aware server
    does.\n\n   This document identifies some of the major challenges, and provides\n
    \  solutions that are able to mitigate those challenges and smooth the\n   migration
    towards NMDA deployment.\n\n\t "

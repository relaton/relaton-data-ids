  content: "This document describes mechanisms allowing advertising Segment\n   Routing
    Traffic Engineering (SRTE) policies using BGP.  Through the\n   mechanisms described
    in this document, a BGP speaker has the ability\n   to trigger, in a remote BGP
    node, the setup of a SR Encapsulation\n   policy with specific characteristics
    and an explicit path.  Steering\n   mechanisms are also defined to enable the
    application of the policy\n   on a per BGP route basis.\n\t "

  content: "   This proposal introduces a new BGP attribute that can be used by BGP\n
    \  routers to advertise their capability to support any kind of host\n   liveliness
    checking protocols (for example BFD).  This attribute can\n   be used to avoid
    black-holes scenarios seen when BGP next-hop is not\n   the peer, in particular
    on Internet eXchange Points (IXPs)\n   implementing BGP Route-Servers.  IXP member
    routers can exchange\n   their capability to implement a given host liveliness
    checking\n\nForeword\n\n   A placeholder to list general observations about this
    document.\n\n\n\t "

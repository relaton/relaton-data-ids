  content: "This document describes how the addressing scheme of the 'IP Network Address
    Translator (NAT) [1] could be extended.  The extension takes advantage of the
    fact that the source port number in a full TCP/IP packet can be any value the
    originating host is not currently using.  It also exploits the fact that (nearly)
    all the networking software will work with DNS.  By using DNS and proxies the
    ENAT systems perform the address translation indirectly.                                                    For
    convenience the term ENAT will be used for the extended addressing scheme to distinguish
    it from the original.  A ENAT system could be used equally for UDP/IP as well
    as TCP/IP.  ICMP can be handled with restrictions.\n\t "

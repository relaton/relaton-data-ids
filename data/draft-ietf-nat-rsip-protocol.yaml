  content: "This document presents a protocol with which to implement Realm Specific
    IP (RSIP).  The protocol defined herein allows negotiation of resources between
    an RSIP host and gateway, so that the host can lease some of the gateway's addressing
    parameters in order to establish a global network presence.  This protocol is
    designed to operate on the application layer and to use its own TCP or UDP port.
    \ In particular, the protocol allows a gateway to allocate addressing and control
    parameters to a host such that a flow policy can be enforced at the gateway.  This
    memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes an enhanced handover scheme of the Proxy\n   Mobile
    IPv6 (PMIPv6) with partial bicasting in wireless networks. In\n   the proposed
    PMIPv6 handover scheme, when a mobile node (MN) moves\n   into a new network and
    thus its Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) performs\n   the binding update to the Local
    Mobility Anchor (LMA), the LMA begins\n   the 'partial' bicasting of data packets
    will be buffered at the new\n   MAG as well as the previous MAG. Then, the data
    packets will be\n   buffered at the new MAG during handover and then forwarded
    to MN\n   after the handover operations are completed. The proposed scheme can\n
    \  reduce handover delays and packet losses, and can also use the\n   network
    resource of wireless links more effectively.\n\n\t "

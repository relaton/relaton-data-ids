  content: "Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption that\nnetworking
    devices will impartially drop network traffic at their\nperformance limits.  Data
    Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however,\nwill attempt to throttle prioritized
    traffic from network endpoints\nbefore those limits are reached in order to minimize
    the probability\nof frame loss for high value traffic.  Hence, existing methodologies\nbased
    around indiscriminate frame loss are inappropriate for DCB\ndevices.  This document
    takes the basic benchmarking ideas based on\nloss and extends them to support
    \"lossless\" Ethernet devices.\n\t "

  content: "This Internet Draft presents a framework for further development of \nQoS
    signaling in the Internet. We give a basic model for the \nentities involved in
    QoS signaling, which is intended to be \napplicable to a very wide range of networking
    environments, while \nstill retaining the flexibility to allow lightweight implementations
    \nin particular environments and incremental deployment in the \nInternet as a
    whole. \n\n\t "

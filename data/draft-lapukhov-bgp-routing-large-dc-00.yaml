  script: Latn
  content: "   Some service providers build and operate data centers at the size\n
    \  exceeding 100,000 servers.  In this document, those data-centers are\n   referred
    to as \"large-scale\" to differentiate them from more common\n   smaller infrastructures.
    \ The data centers of that scale have unique\n   set of network design requirement,
    with primary focus on operational\n   simplicity and stability.\n\n   This document
    attempts to summarize the authors' experiences in\n   designing and supporting
    large data centers, using BGP as the only\n   control-plane protocol.  The intent
    is to describe a proven and\n   stable routing design that could be leveraged
    by others in the\n   industry.\n\n\t "

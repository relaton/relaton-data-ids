  content: "   This document specifies the MyClerk Virtual File System (VFS), a\n
    \  distributed storage system designed for family networks.  The VFS\n   provides
    end-to-end encrypted, redundant storage across heterogeneous\n   nodes using adaptive
    chunking and Reed-Solomon erasure coding\n   [REED-SOLOMON].  Metadata synchronization
    uses Conflict-free\n   Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) [CRDT] with a hybrid LWW-Register
    and\n   OR-Set approach.\n\n   The system supports tiered storage, automatic health
    monitoring with\n   self-healing capabilities, and federation between separate
    family\n   installations.  It is designed to be accessible to non-technical\n
    \  users while providing enterprise-grade data durability.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the MyClerk Virtual File System (VFS), a distributed
    storage system designed for family networks. The VFS provides end-to-end encrypted,
    redundant storage across heterogeneous nodes using adaptive chunking and Reed-Solomon
    erasure coding [REED-SOLOMON]. Metadata synchronization uses Conflict-free Replicated
    Data Types (CRDTs) [CRDT] with a hybrid LWW-Register and OR-Set approach. The
    system supports tiered storage, automatic health monitoring with self-healing
    capabilities, and federation between separate family installations. It is designed
    to be accessible to non-technical users while providing enterprise-grade data
    durability.</p>"

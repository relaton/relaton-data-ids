  content: "   Somewhat over a decade ago, the IETF responded to a series of\n   perceived
    problems with the then-IAB by restructuring the way in\n   which the IAB and IESG
    were constituted and assigning all standards-\n   approval and closely-related
    processes to the IESG.  In retrospect,\n   that decision has had serious downsides:
    among them are the\n   observations that the IESG has become overloaded to the
    point that\n   the role requires an unreasonable level of investment and that
    the\n   intertwining of managing WGs and then reviewing and approving their\n
    \  products has led to confusion and the risk, and sometimes the\n   appearance,
    of inherent conflicts of interest and abuses.  This\n   document proposes to re-separate
    the \"steering\" and \"WG management\"\n   functions that were orginally the IESG's
    responsibility from the\n   \"final review and standards approval\" roles and
    respecifies the\n   standards approval process in that context.\n\n   The general
    concepts outlined in this document have been discussed\n   informally in the community
    for some time.  This document is provided\n   as a specific proposal to facilitate
    a focused discussion.\n\t "

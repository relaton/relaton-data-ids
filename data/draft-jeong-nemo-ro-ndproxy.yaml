abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes in IPv6
    \nmobile network to perform route optimization.  The route optimization \nis possible
    because mobile router relays the prefix of its Care-of \naddress to its mobile
    nodes by playing the role of ND-proxy.   \nThrough binding updates associated
    with the network prefix of an \naccess network, the mobile nodes can perform route
    optimization.  In \naddition, this document explains how mobile nodes can optimize
    its \nDNS name resolution through RA-based DNS discovery.  By announcing \nthe
    address of local recursive DNS server, mobile router allows \nmobile nodes to
    optimize their DNS name resolution.\n\t "

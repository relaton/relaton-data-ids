  content: "   The emergence of applications based on machine-to-machine\n   communications
    require control systems to be extended beyond their\n   closed environments.  Specifically,
    autonomous systems that bring\n   about physical and mechanical changes to an
    environment, heavily rely\n   on their remote operations and control.\n\n   This
    document provides an overview of the issues associated with the\n   communications
    in the control systems to support network-based\n   operations in a generic manner
    at any-scale environments.\n\n   The term Operations and Control networks (OCN)
    is used to describe\n   the common characteristics emerging from the requirements
    for such\n   control systems.\n\n   The OCNs are technology-agnostic concept.
    \ This document aims to\n   discuss the requirements for establishing common interfaces
    and\n   functions.\n\n\t "

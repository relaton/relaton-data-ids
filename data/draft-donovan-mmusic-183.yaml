  content: "This document describes a proposed extension of the Session Initia-\ntion
    Protocol.  This extension would add the 183 Session Progress\nresponse message.\n\nThe
    introduction of the 183 informational response message would\nallow a called user
    agent to indicate to the calling user agent\nwhether or not the calling user agent
    should apply local alerting for\nthe session.  The existing 180 Ringing message
    would indicate that\nthe calling user agent has the option of providing local
    alerting\n(and generally should).  The 183 Session Progress message would indi-\ncate
    that the calling user agent should not provide local alerting\nand should establish
    a media session to be used by the called user\nagent to indicate the status of
    the session setup request as part of\nthe indicated media stream.\n\n\t "

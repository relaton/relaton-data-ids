  content: "          The motivation for this proposal is the expanded scope and\n
    \         diversity of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web provides a\n          simple
    and effective means for users to search, browse, retrieve,\n          and publish
    information of their own available for others. Now\n          that Web browsers
    and servers are ubiquitous on the Internet, it\n          is worthwhile to use
    XML to encode calendar objects. The power\n          and extensibility of XML
    allows us to represent calendar data\n          objects as well-formed XML documents.\n
    \n          ICAL is an existing standard format for representing calendar\n          components.
    This draft explains how to represent calendar\n          components in XML that
    are compatible and easily translatable to\n          the iCAL format.\n \n          Copyright

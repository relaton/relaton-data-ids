  content: "We propose a new Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for differentiated services\nin
    IP networks.  In this PHB, each network subscriber (or flow)\nreceives a bandwidth
    allocation proportional to the subscribed\ninformation rate.  This new PHB is
    called 'Proportional Forwarding\nPHB' or PF PHB.  The marking mechanism at the
    source or ingress\nrouter and the queuing and discard behavior at core routers
    are\nclearly described.\n\t "

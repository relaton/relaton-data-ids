  content: "   The demands on the networking infrastructure are growing\n   exponentially;
    the drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media\n   applications, inter data center
    communications etc. In this context,\n   it is important to optimally use the
    bandwidth in the service\n   provider backbone networks which extensively use
    LAG/ECMP techniques\n   for bandwidth scaling. This internet draft describes the
    issues faced\n   in the service provider backbone in the context of LAG/ECMP and\n
    \  formulates best practice recommendations for managing the bandwidth\n   efficiently
    in the service provider backbone.\n\nInternet-Draft   Best Practices for Optimal
    LAG/ECMP Component Link\n          Utilization in Provider Backbone networks        October
    2012\n\n\n\t "

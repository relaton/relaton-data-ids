  content: "In customer sites having IPv4-only CPEs, Teredo provides a last\nresort
    IPv6 connectivity [RFC4380] [RFC5991] [RFC6081].  However,\nbecause it is designed
    to work without involvement of Internet\nservice providers, it has significant
    limitations (connectivity\nbetween IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses
    is uncertain;\nconnectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations
    of\nNAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that, being base on ISP\ncooperation,
    avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of IPv6\naddresses, it replaces the
    Teredo well-known prefix by network\nspecific prefixes assigned by local ISP's
    (an evolution similar to\nthat from 6to4 to 6rd).  In hosts, 6a44 can be implemented
    either\nautonomously or as an extension of Teredo.  Except for IANA numbers\nthat
    remain to be confirmed, the specification is intended to be\ncomplete enough for
    running codes to be independently written and the\nsolution to be incrementally
    deployed.\n\t "

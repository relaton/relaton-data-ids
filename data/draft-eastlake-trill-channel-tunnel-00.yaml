  content: "   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n   protocol
    includes an optional mechanism, called RBridge Channel, for\n   the transmission
    of typed messages between TRILL switches in the same\n   campus and between TRILL
    switches and end stations on the same link.\n   This document specifies optional
    extensions to RBridge Channel that\n   provides three facilities: (1) A mechanism
    to send such messages\n   between a TRILL switch and an end station in either
    direction, or\n   between two end stations, when the two devices are in the same
    campus\n   but not on the same link; (2) A method to support security facilities\n
    \  for RBridge Channel messages; and (3) A method to tunnel a variety of\n   payload
    types by encapsulating them in an RBridge Channel message.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This paper is a direct result, necessitated by the correction of the\nmathematical
    anomaly that plague IPv4. Whose resolution also proposed\nan end to the disparities
    resulting from a shortage of available IP\nAddresses. However, the proposal did
    not seem to garner the unfledging\nsupport through the suggestion of an alternate
    IP system of \naddressing. Which is nothing more than an exploitation of the present\nIPv4
    system. As presented in the paper entitled; 'The Mathematical\nReality of IP Addressing
    in IPv4 Questions the need for Another IP\nSystem of Addressing'.\n \nNeedless
    to say, it is thought that a greater clarification of the\nunderlining foundation
    of this subject matter is that which is\nneeded. Notwithstanding my personal beliefs,
    that the promises made\nby the IT Industry itself, will not be forth coming if
    an adequate\nIP System of Addressing is not employed. Nor the mention of the hidden
    \ncost the consumer is expected to pay, which is a direct result of \ntheir knowledge
    regarding a clear understanding of our present\ntechnology, and the ability of
    the Technology to the IT Industry,\nwhich could reduce the overall cost today.
    All while fulfilling of the\npromises they made to the consumer, which becomes
    the reality of a\nfuture which benefits all mankind.\n\n\t "

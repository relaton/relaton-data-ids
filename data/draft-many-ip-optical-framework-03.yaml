  content: "The Internet transport infrastructure is moving towards a model of \nhigh-speed
    routers interconnected by optical core networks. A \nconsensus is emerging in
    the industry on utilizing IP-centric \nprotocols for the optical control plane
    [9, 10], as well as for \ndynamic bandwidth provisioning for IP services. Also,
    there has \nrecently been significant activity in defining models for IP \ntransport
    over optical networks, specifically, the routing and \nsignaling aspects [2,6,7].
    This draft attempts to define a framework \nfor IP over Optical networks, considering
    both the IP control plane \nfor optical networks as well as IP transport over
    optical networks \n(together referred to as 'IP over optical networks'). Within
    this \nframework, we develop a common set of terms and concepts which allows \nto
    discuss these IP over optical technologies in a consistent fashion.  \nAdditionally,
    this draft surveys some architectural frameworks that \nmight be useful and appropriate
    for the deployment of IP over hybrid \noptical networks that contain IP routers,
    WDM multiplexers, and \noptical cross-connects (OXCs). This document is complementary
    to the \nframework of Multiprotocol Lambda Switching proposed in [2].\n\t "

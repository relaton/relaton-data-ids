  content: "  This document provides scalability extension to NAT-PT. The extension
    \n  is based on the use of DNS-ALG and exchange of load metrics amongst a\n  cluster
    of NAT-PT devices. We refer such a NAT-PT device as mNAT-PT. \n  mNAT-PT is valuable
    in connecting large V6 domains to legacy V4 \n  domain.  \n\t "

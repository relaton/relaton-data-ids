  content: "   For network scenarios such as Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs),\n
    \  BGP is extended for Link-State (LS) distribution and the Shortest\n   Path
    First (SPF) algorithm based calculation.  BGP-LS SPF leverages\n   the mechanisms
    of both BGP protocol and BGP-LS protocol extensions.\n   Segment Routing (SR)
    provides a source routing mechanism that allows\n   a flow to be restricted to
    a specific topological path, while\n   maintaining per-flow state only at the
    ingress node(s) to the SR\n   domain.  In some networks, it may be useful to enable
    SR based source\n   routing mechanism together with BGP-LS SPF.  This document
    proposes\n   to introduce the BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) extensions for segment\n
    \  routing to the BGP-LS SPF SAFI.\n\n\t "

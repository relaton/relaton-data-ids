  content: "   Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) forwarding is an essential function in\n
    \  distributing traffic across parallel paths.  Packets within a flow\n   must
    be kept on a single path to avoid reordering, while different\n   flows must be
    distributed across paths to achieve parallelism.\n\n   Previously, MPLS has addressed
    this through the use of an entropy\n   label, providing up to 20 bits of entropy
    that can be added to the\n   label stack to distinguish different flows.  [RFC6790]
    With the\n   interest in MPLS Network Actions, there are proposals to embedding\n
    \  entropy into alternate structures, so it is an appropriate time to\n   consider
    how many bits should be used for entropy in the future.\n   [I-D.bocci-mpls-miad-adi-requirements][I-D.andersson-mpls-mna-fwk]\n\n
    \  In this document, we examine the question of how to provide adequate\n   entropy
    through a simple stochastic simulation.  This is not intended\n   to be a comprehensive
    and extensive treatise, but rather a simple\n   investigation to build intuition
    into the issues.\n\n\t "

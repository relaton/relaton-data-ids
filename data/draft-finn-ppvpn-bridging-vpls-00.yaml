  content: "Layer 2 techniques based on IEEE 802.1Q bridges are in widespread\nuse
    by Ethernet MAN Service Providers.  It is possible to implement\nthe data plane
    functionality of Service Provider Backbone as\ndescribed in the framework draft
    [ANDERSSON] using bridges as the\nProvider Edge (PE) equipment.  There are three
    small but\nsignificant changes to the [LASSERRE-VKOMPELLA] VPLS draft which\nwould
    make the Service Provider Backbone much more compatible with\na bridge-based PE
    implementation, and which would improve the\nefficiency of all L2VPN implementations.\n\n\t "

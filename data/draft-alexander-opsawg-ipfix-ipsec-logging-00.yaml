  content: "   Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is an industry standard protocol\n
    \  suite that provides secure services for traffic between IP peers in\n   the
    network.  The purpose of IPSec is to provide key tenets of\n   security that include
    authentication, integrity protection, access\n   control and data confidentiality.
    \ The objectivities of IPSec are met\n   using a collection of intertwined components
    namely, the security\n   protocols, session and key management protocols and algorithms
    for\n   authentication and encryption.\n\n   An end-to-end IPSec operation is
    typically multi-step involving\n   various technologies.  There are many events
    in IPSec process that\n   are of interest, such as - identities and connection
    status of\n   security peers, traffic or applications being protected, access\n
    \  control and encryption policies being enforced.  While many of these\n   are
    functionally discrete, they have an impact on end-to-end IPSec\n   operations.
    \ While network elements involved in IPSec process do\n   provide system logs,
    command line interfaces and management objects\n   that reflect the various states
    of operations, these are however\n   dissevered, inconsistent and not easily favorable
    for analyzing,\n   monitoring, auditing of end-to-end behavior\n\n   This document
    proposes an approach for common representation and\n   standardization of various
    IPSec operational data and events using\n   industry standard IPFIX information
    model.  The IPFIX approach helps\n   to store and manage data in a consistent
    format, also provides\n   opportunity for a collector to correlate various IPSec
    events which\n   in turn can be exploited to obtain enriched end-to-end monitoring,\n
    \  reporting and troubleshooting capabilities and provide various\n   security
    analytics on IPSec flows such as - host identification,\n   application detection,
    track user policy violations, protocol\n   failures and so on.\n\n\t "

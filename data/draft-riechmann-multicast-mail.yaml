  content: "   P_Mul is a proposal for an application protocol for the transfer of\n
    \  messages using a connectionless transport protocol. The objectives of\n   this
    protocol are first to take advantage of the bandwidth saving\n   feature of using
    the multicast service as supported by modern\n   computer networks and second
    to allow message transfer under EMCON\n   conditions. EMCON (Emission Control)
    means that, although receiving\n   nodes are able to receive messages, they are
    not able to acknowledge\n   the receipt of messages.\n      \n   The protocol
    described below has already been applied to the transfer\n   of messages between
    X.400 Message Transfer Agents (MTA). But it is\n   not only restricted to this
    application and can easily be applied to\n   the transfer of RFC822 messages.\n\t "

  content: "   Traditional QoS technology can not achieve fine adjustment in the\n
    \  traffic scheduling, and has a large amount of configuration and poor\n   maintainability.
    \ BGP FlowSpec technology provides a wealth of\n   filtering conditions and processing
    actions, using BGP network layer\n   reachable information (NLRI) to transmit
    traffic filtering\n   information, which can achieve a more fine-grained control
    of the\n   traffic and improve maintainability.\n\n   This document defines the
    extension of BGP FlowSpec, adding two new\n   traffic filtering actions for extended
    community: minimum rate\n   guarantee and congestion management, to enable better
    management and\n   scheduling of traffic, and further improving the scalability
    and\n   applicability of BGP FlowSpec.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Although IPv6 is being introduced globally, the entire IP ecosystem\nwill
    not have transitioned to IPv6 before the forecast exhaustion of\nthe global IPv4
    address pools.\n\nThis document describes a new transitional non-conflicting reusable\nIPv4
    address block which will facilitate a smooth IPv4 to IPv6\ntransition for customers
    and transit providers.\n\nThe address block would be assigned by IANA and have
    a limited time\nhorizon to match its transitional purpose.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the support of Mobile Networks, as defined in\nMobile
    IPv4, by the Mobile Router and Home Agent.  A Mobile Router is\nresponsible for
    the mobility of one or more network segments or\nsubnets moving together.  The
    Mobile Router hides its mobility from\nthe nodes on the mobile network.  The nodes
    on the Mobile Network may\nbe fixed in relationship to the Mobile Router and may
    not have any\nmobility function.\n\nExtensions to Mobile IPv4 are introduced to
    support Mobile Networks.\n\n\t "

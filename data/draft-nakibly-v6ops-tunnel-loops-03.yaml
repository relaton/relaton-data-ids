  content: "This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in IPv6-in-\nIPv4
    automatic tunnels.  These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to\ntake advantage
    of inconsistencies between a tunnel's overlay IPv6\nrouting state and the native
    IPv6 routing state.  The attack forms a\nrouting loop which can be abused as a
    vehicle for traffic\namplification to facilitate DoS attacks.  The first aim of
    this\ndocument is to inform on this attack and its root causes.  The second\naim
    is to present some possible mitigation measures.\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) defines a tree of names\n   starting
    with root, \".\", immediately below which are top level\n   domain (TLD) names
    such as \".com\" and \".us\". In June 1999 RFC2606\n   reserved a small number
    of TLD names for use in documentation\n   examples, private testing, experiments,
    and other circumstances in\n   which it is desirable to avoid conflict with current
    or future\n   actual TLD names in the DNS.\n\n   There has been significant evolution
    of Internet engineering and\n   operation practices since RFC2606 was published.
    In February 2013\n   RFC6761 defined criteria and procedures for reserving a domain
    name\n   for special use, and established an IANA registry for such names.\n   This
    document reserves eight domain name labels for special use in\n   accordance with
    the criteria and procedures of RFC6761: localdomain,\n   domain, lan, home, host,
    corp, mail, and exchange.\n\n   It is important to note that TLD names may be
    reserved, in other\n   contexts, for policy, political, or other reasons that
    are distinct\n   from the IETF's concern with Internet engineering and operations.\n
    \  This document reserves TLD names only for operational and\n   engineering reasons.\n\n\t "

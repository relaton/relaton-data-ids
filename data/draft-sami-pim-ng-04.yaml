  content: "   This document specifies protocol independent multicast- Next\n   generation
    or simply called PIM-NG. like PIM-SM, PIM-NG uses the\n   underlying unicast routing
    information, but unlike PIM-SM it doesn't\n   necessarily need to build unidirectional
    shared trees rooted at a\n   Rendezvous Point (RP) per group, due to the fact
    that the processes\n   through which a source registers with the Rendezvous Point
    and a host\n   finds the source of the multicast destination groups it needs are\n
    \  done in a whole new way. So at some points PIM-NG works faster than\n   its
    predecessor. Also the new Domain concept, unique to PIM-NG, along\n   the RPF
    check method used in PIM-NG specifications provides many\n   features along a
    robust and flexible control and administration over\n   multicast networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "Ripe-181 [2] is a language to specify routing policy constraints for inter-domain
    routing in the Internet.  Ripe-181 allows the specification of both import policy
    constraints (by specifying as-in and interas-in attributes) and export policy
    constraints (by specifying as-out and interas-out attributes).      The Destination
    Preference Attribute (DPA) [3] is recently added to the BGP [4] routing protocol.
    \ This attribute can be used by an autonomous system (AS) to specify a globally
    transitive preference in its routing announcement via BGP so that the upstream
    BGP speakers can use this preference to favor certain path for return traffic.
    \    This document extends Ripe-181 to enable the setting of the DPA attribute
    during route announcements.  It is assumed that the reader is familiar with BGP,
    DPA and Ripe-181.\n\t "

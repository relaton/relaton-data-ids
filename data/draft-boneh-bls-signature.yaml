  content: "   The BLS signature scheme was introduced by Boneh-Lynn-Shacham in\n
    \  2001.  The signature scheme relies on pairing-friendly curves and\n   supports
    non-interactive aggregation properties.  That is, given a\n   collection of signatures
    (sigma_1, ..., sigma_n), anyone can produce\n   a short signature (sigma) that
    authenticates the entire collection.\n   BLS signature scheme is simple, efficient
    and can be used in a\n   variety of network protocols and systems to compress
    signatures or\n   certificate chains.  This document specifies the BLS signature
    and\n   the aggregation algorithms.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The SCHC adaptation layer provides header compression and\n   fragmentation
    functionality between IPv6 and an underlying LPWAN\n   technology.  SCHC fragmentation
    has been specifically designed for\n   the characteristics of LPWANs.  However,
    when CoAP is used at the\n   application layer, there exists an alternative approach
    for\n   fragmentation, which is using the CoAP Block option.  This document\n
    \  aims at illustrating the advantages and limitations of each approach\n   for
    transferring larger payloads.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This framework defines a method of providing Explicit Congestion\n
    \  Control to real-time inelastic traffic like voice and video through\n   the
    use of session admission control and preemption mechanisms.  This\n   approach
    uses the Pre-Congestion Notification Marking (PCN) [1]\n   mechanism.  PCN marking
    is deployed in routers to measure and convey\n   two levels of onset of congestion
    with the SIP controlled endpoints\n   responding to the marking.  This approach
    is different from what is\n   defined in An edge-to-edge Deployment Model for
    Pre-Congestion\n   Notification [3], as here the admission and preemption control\n
    \  function resides in the application (either in the endpoint or the\n   application
    server that controls the endpoint.  This framework is\n   focused on using Session
    Initiated Protocol (SIP) as the application\n   signaling protocol but other application
    signaling protocols could be\n   extended for this purpose.\n\n\n\t "

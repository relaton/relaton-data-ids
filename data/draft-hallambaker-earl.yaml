  content: "   This document describes the Encrypted Authenticated Resource Locator\n
    \  (EARL) URI scheme and the encoding and decoding of the associated\n   content
    data.  An EARL is a bearer token that allows an encrypted\n   data object to be
    located, decrypted and authenticated using a\n   compact URI form designed for
    human readability.  A range of work\n   factors is supported from 2^112 to 2^252.\n\n
    \  The plaintext data format consists of an initial header section\n   containing
    metadata describing the payload, the payload itself and an\n   optional section
    containing signature data.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed content-type, like the\nMultipart/Related
    content-type, provides a mechanism for representing\nobjects that consist of multiple
    components.  An Application/Vnd.pwg-\nmultiplexed entity contains a sequence of
    chunks. Each chunk contains\na MIME message or a part of a MIME message. Each
    MIME message\nrepresents a component of the compound object, just as a body part
    of\na Multipart/Related entity represents a component. With a\nMultipart/Related
    entity, a body part and its reference in some other\nbody part may be separated
    by many octets. With an\nApplication/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed entity, a message and
    its reference\nin some other message can be made quite close by chunking the message\ncontaining
    the reference. For example, if a long message contains\nreferences to images and
    the producer does not know of the need for\neach image until it generates the
    reference, then\nApplication/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed allows the consumer to process
    the\nreference to the image and the image before it consumes the entire\nlong
    message.  This ability is important in printing and scanning\napplications. This
    document defines the Application/Vnd.pwg-\nmultiplexed content-type. It also provides
    examples of its use.\n\t "

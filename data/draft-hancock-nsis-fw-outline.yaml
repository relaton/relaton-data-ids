  content: "The Next-Steps-in-Signalling (NSIS) working group of the IETF is \nconsidering
    the requirements for QoS signalling protocols [2]. One \nelement of this, and
    follow up work, is to develop a framework within \nwhich existing and proposed
    protocols can be analysed, and which \ncaptures how QoS signalling protocols should
    interact, both with each \nother and with other components of the Internet, such
    as routing \nprotocols or AAA mechanisms. Because of this aspect of interactions,
    \nthe scope of an NSIS framework is necessarily broader than the scope \nof any
    new NSIS protocol. \nPrevious work suggests that a complete QoS signalling framework
    is a \nmajor undertaking. This Internet Draft outlines the principal \ncomponents
    of such a framework and their interrelationships. It could \nbe used as a starting
    point for more detailed investigation of \nindividual components. It could also
    be used to refine the scope of \nNSIS more precisely, both in terms of what functions
    are to be \nconsidered and how many variant approaches are relevant. \n\n\t "

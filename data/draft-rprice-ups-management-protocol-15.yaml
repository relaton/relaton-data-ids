  content: "This document describes the command/response protocol currently used in
    the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and other power devices
    often deployed in small offices and in IT installations subject to an erratic
    public power supply.  The UPS units typically interface to an Attachment Daemon
    in the system they protect.  This daemon is in turn polled by a Management Daemon
    that notifies users and system administrators of power supply incidents and automates
    system shutdown decisions.  The commands and responses described by this document
    are exchanged between the UPS Attachment Daemon and the Management Daemon.  The
    practice current when this protocol was first developed risks weak security, and
    this is addressed in the Security Considerations sections of this document.\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses the security issues within the TRee-based \nACKnowledgement
    (TRACK) reliable multicast protocol instantiation, and \nidentifies some constraints
    and requirements for security provisions for \nthis protocol.  Based on the constraints
    and requirements, the document \nproposes a separation of data packet confidentiality
    and authentication, \nfrom transport layer protection.  It proposes that TRACK
    be primarily \nconcerned with group authentication of control and data packets,
    to \nprotect against attacks on the transport infrastructure.  It proposes \nthat
    data confidentiality and source authentication be provided \nseparately from this
    low level group authentication, ideally at the \napplication level.  We show that
    this is particularly important for \nTRACK, because of the requirement that the
    interior control nodes only \nOPTIONALLY have access to the data packet payload.\n\t "

  content: "   A number of TCP enhancements in diverse fields as congestion control,\n
    \  loss recovery or side-band signaling could be improved by allowing\n   both
    ends of a TCP session to interpret the value carried in the\n   Timestamp option.
    \ Further enhancements are enabled by changing the\n   receiver side processing
    of timestamps in the presence of Selective\n   Acknowledgements.\n\n   This document
    updates RFC1323 and specifies a backward-compatible\n   method for negotiating
    for additional capabilities for the Timestamp\n   option, and lists a number of
    benefits and drawbacks of this\n   approach.\n\n\t "

  content: "\n  This document defines the IPtX Specification for the 'Domain Name\n
    \ Service' (IPtX / IPtX-MX DNS), and eliminates the possibility of an\n  Addressing
    'Conflict', or a Mathematical Addressing Error in the\n  IPtX Address Space when
    using Multiple IPtX Addressing Formats. In\n  other words, the IPtX / IPtX-MX
    IP Addressing format on the\n  \"Back-End\", or \"Backbone\", obtains its uniqueness
    through the use\n  and / or difference defined by the accuracy of the 'Exponential\n
    \ Decimal String'. However, this uniqueness, if not clarified, would\n  not be
    discernable on the \"Front-End\", because the IPtX IP\n  Addressing Specification
    'Allows' only a '48' Bit-Mapped IP Address,\n  or 2 Octets and 4 '10 Bit-Quadrants',
    and up to 60 Bits for every IP\n  Addressing Format greater than IPt1. That is,
    on the \"Front-End\", if\n  there is No distinction, because every Addressing
    Format in the IPtX\n  Specification, when Resolved, is Equal, there will ultimately
    be\n  Address Conflicts within the Addressing Scheme. Nevertheless, this\n  clarification,
    when used in conjunction with the IPtX 32 / 64\n  Bit Header, allows the simultaneous
    use of (2E24) 16,777,216\n  different IPtX / IPtX-MX IP Addressing Specifications;
    the\n  Concurrent use of the IPtX / IPtX-MX IP Addressing Specifications\n  'IPt1'
    thru 'IPt16,777,216'.\n\n\t "

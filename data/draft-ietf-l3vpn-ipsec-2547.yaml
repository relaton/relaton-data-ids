  content: "   In BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), VPN data packets\n
    \  traveling from one Provider Edge (PE) router to another generally\n   carry
    two MPLS labels, an \"inner\" label that corresponds to a VPN-\n   specific route,
    and an \"outer\" label that corresponds to a Label\n   Switched Path (LSP) between
    the PE routers.  In some circumstances,\n   it is desirable to support the same
    type of VPN architecture, but\n   using an IPsec Security Association in place
    of that LSP.  The\n   \"outer\" MPLS label would thus be replaced by an IP/IPsec
    header.\n   This enables the VPN packets to be carried securely over non-MPLS\n
    \  networks, using standard IPsec authentication and/or encryption\n   functions
    to protect them.  This draft specifies the procedures which\n   are specific to
    support of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs using the IPsec\n   encapsulation.\n\t "

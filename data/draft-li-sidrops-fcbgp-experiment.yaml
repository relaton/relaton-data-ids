  content: "   Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-BGP) enables the establishment of a\n
    \  secure inter-domain routing system by providing security for the path\n   of
    Autonomous Systems (ASs) through which a BGP UPDATE message\n   passes.  In an
    effort to enhance the validation of FC-BGP, a\n   prototype implementation of
    the FC-BGP was developed and an\n   evaluation was conducted on the FITI high-performance
    IPv6 backbone\n   network.  This document reports on the prototype implementation
    and\n   the results of the evaluation.\n\n\t "

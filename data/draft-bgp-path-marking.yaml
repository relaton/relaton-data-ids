- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The potential advertisement of non-best paths by a BGP speaker\n   supporting
    the add-path or the best-external extensions makes it\n   difficult for other
    BGP speakers to identify the paths that have been\n   selected as best by those
    who advertise them.  This information is\n   required for proper operation of
    some applications.  Towards that\n   end, this document proposes marking the paths
    using extended\n   communities that encode the path type.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines the 'donau' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n
    \  scheme for triggering interactions with a validator for Donau\n   donation
    statements.\n\n   This URI scheme allows applications to trigger interactions
    with a\n   Donau validator.  A Donau validator is typically run by a tax\n   authority
    to validate tax records from citizens that made donations\n   to a charity that
    supports the Donau protocol.  The Donau validator\n   will receive 'donau' URIs
    representing the sum of donations a\n   taxpayer made to recognized charities
    over a year.  Donors would\n   submit 'donau' URLs (or QR codes with 'donau' URLs)
    to tax\n   authorities to have their donations recognized by the tax authority\n
    \  as tax-deductible expenditures.  The application logic to verify the\n   validity
    of the donation is triggered by 'donau' URIs.  The validator\n   application would
    then typically confirm to the tax official the\n   validity of the signature encoded
    in the URI and show the total\n   amount donated as well as the taxpayer identification
    number and the\n   year of the donation.  Multiple URIs could be submitted per
    donor,\n   and the application can correctly determine which submissions are\n
    \  cumulative and which ones are redundant.\n\n   This specification only covers
    the syntax of the 'donau' URI scheme\n   and excludes details on the protocol(s)
    that would allow taxpayers to\n   donate to recognized charities to obtain these
    suitable signed\n   donation statements.  While a privacy-preserving protocol
    to obtain\n   such statements exists within the context of the GNU Taler protocol\n
    \  suite, other protocols could be developed in the future and still\n   yield
    compatible 'donau' URIs as the URI scheme is reasonably\n   generic.\n\n   The
    validation tool will be registered for all donau:// URIs.  Since\n   each taxation
    authority will typically use a different domain, it\n   will not be feasible to
    encode all the domains of tax authorities\n   servers inside the validation tool.
    \ Hence a new URI scheme is needed\n   that will trigger the validation tool for
    any domain name.\n\n\t "

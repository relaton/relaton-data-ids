  content: "   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification and\n
    \  does not enjoy IETF consensus.  It is published for examination,\n   evaluation,
    and experimentation.  The Defined-trust Transport (DeftT)\n   framework is designed
    to provide default-deny communications for\n   certain types of Limited Domains
    (RFC8799) used for Operational\n   Technology (OT) networks and, in particular,
    Critical Infrastructure\n   networking.  DeftT is designed to express and enforce
    application-\n   and deployment-specific integrity, authentication, access control
    and\n   behavior constraints directly in its protocol modules.  It enables\n   secure
    and completely self-contained (e.g., no external identity\n   servers or certificate
    authorities) overlay networks where\n   credentialed members can join and leave
    at any time.  Security is not\n   optional and members preconfigured only with
    their individual\n   cryptographically secured identities and the secured communication\n
    \  rules independently authenticate other members' identities and their\n   role-
    and attribute-specific communications.\n\n   DeftT is an integrated trust management,
    multi-party transport that\n   synchronizes collections of secured information
    across all members of\n   its domain.  It uses a many-to-many synchronization
    primitive rather\n   than source-destination send-and-acknowledgement.  Packets
    are not\n   routable and information only leaves its originating subnet if it
    is\n   both explicitly permitted in the secured rules and there is a member\n
    \  element (relay) constructed to move validated information containers\n   across
    subnets.  DeftT provides default deny networking for closed\n   communities with
    dynamic membership and a collection-based transport\n   that is efficient on broadcast
    media.  DeftT is part of a Defined-\n   trust Communications approach with an
    example implementation\n   available.  Combined with IPv6 multicast and modern
    hardware-based\n   methods for securing keys and code, it can provide a foundation
    for\n   secure and efficient communications in Limited Domains, particularaly\n
    \  in Critical Infrastructure domains.\n\n\t "

  content: "   There is significant overhead in OSPF when a router has to establish\n
    \  adjacencies with every peer with whom it can verify 2-way\n   connectivity.
    \ OSPF supports the broadcast network type for these\n   scenarios, where you
    only have to peer with the designated router\n   (DR).  However,a full mesh of
    connectivity is required for proper\n   operation and this doesn't help in networks
    with overlapping partial\n   meshes of connectivity.  This draft proposes a technique
    to reduce\n   the number of adjacencies based on shortest path tree (SPT)\n   reachability
    information.\n\t "

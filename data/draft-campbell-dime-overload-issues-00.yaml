  content: "   The Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (DIME) working group has\n
    \  undertaken an \"overload control\" work item, with the goal of\n   standardizing
    a mechanism to allow Diameter nodes to report overload\n   information among themselves.
    \ Requirements currently include, among\n   others, the need to accurately report
    the scope of overload\n   conditions, and the ability to report overload information
    between\n   nodes that are not directly connected at the transport layer.  These\n
    \  requirements introduce complex issues.  This document describes those\n   issues,
    in the hope that it will assist the working group's decision\n   process.\n\n\t "

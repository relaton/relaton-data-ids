  content: "Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been\nrelated
    to environments of single switching capability devices e.g.\none data plane layer,
    as such, the complexity raised by such control\nplanes is similar to the one expected
    in classical IP/MPLS networks.\nThe fundamental reason being that an IP-based
    control plane protocol\nsuite for Label Switch Routers (LSR) or Optical Cross-Connects
    (OXC)\nhas exactly the same Level (i.e. single data plane layer)\ncomplexity.\nThe
    present document analyses the various GMPLS signaling and\nrouting aspects when
    considering network environments consisting of\nmultiple switching data layers
    e.g. supporting combined\nPacket/Layer-2 Switching - OXC devices. The examples
    provide an\noverview of the tradeoffs in using a GMPLS control plane for\ncombined
    Ethernet MAC - opaque, service transparent, and/or fully\ntransparent data planes.
    The intent of this memo is also to\ndemonstrate that these aspects may not be
    as straightforward as they\nmay first appear.\n\t "

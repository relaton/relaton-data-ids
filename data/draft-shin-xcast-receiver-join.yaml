  content: "Explicit Multicast (Xcast) is a newly proposed multicast scheme to\nsupport
    a very large number of small multicast groups. Current\nXcast specification mentions
    its data plane only, and does not\nspecify a control plane. Therefore, this document
    describes an\nenhanced scheme for the support of receiver initiated join in\nexplicit
    multicast, named Xcast extension (Xcast+), which\ncomplements the existing Xcast.\n\t "

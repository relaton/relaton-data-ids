- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been used\n
    \  in Internet protocol design. More than sixteen years have passed\n   since
    RFC3552 was written and the structure and topology of the\n   Internet has changed.
    With those changes comes a question: has the\n   Internet Threat Model changed?
    Or, is the model described in RFC3552\n   still largely accurate?  This draft
    attempts to describe an non-\n   exhaustive list of changes in the current threat
    environment. It\n   finds that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences\n
    \  from the environment described in RFC3552 and is intended as input\n   to the
    IAB program on the Internet threat model started in 2020.\n\n\t "

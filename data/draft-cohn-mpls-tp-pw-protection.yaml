  content: "   One of the requirements of the MPLS transport profile [RFC5654] is\n
    \  to provide linear protection for transport paths, which include both\n   LSPs
    and PWs. The functional architecture described in [SurvivFwk]\n   is applicable
    to both LSP and PWs, however [LinearProt] does not\n   explicitly describe mechanisms
    for PW protection in MPLS-TP.\n\n   This document extends the applicability of
    the linear protection\n   mechanism described in [LinearProt] to MPLS-TP segmented
    PWs as\n   defined in [RFC6073].\n\n\t "

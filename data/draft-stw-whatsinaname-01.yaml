  script: Latn
  content: "   From time to time, networking protocols need to be able to name\n   things
    used within the protocol, and resolve the names created or\n   referenced.  It's
    common for protocol designers in this predicament\n   to attempt to use domain
    names as the starting point for their\n   systems of names, and the DNS as the
    starting point for name\n   resolution.\n\n   There is existing guidance on how
    to think about application-specific\n   extensions to DNS if the protocol or software
    designer is re-using\n   both domain name abstractions and DNS protocol assumptions
    (see RFC\n   6950).  However, recently there's also a tendency to re-use a domain-\n
    \  name-based namespace without necessarily re-using DNS protocol for\n   name
    resolution.  This document acknowledges that class of extensions\n   to the shared
    domain namespace and considers a framework for the\n   properties a naming and
    resolution convention should have in the\n   internet protocol environment, including
    the avoidance of collision\n   with other uses of the namespace.  Depending to
    the answers to the\n   suggested questions, the answer may be that domain names
    will not\n   meet the constraints at hand.\n\n\t "

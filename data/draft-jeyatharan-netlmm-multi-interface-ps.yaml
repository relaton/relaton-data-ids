  content: "The specific mechanism described in the current PMIPv6 draft to\nsupport
    multihoming is such that a unique prefix is given to each\ninterface of a Mobile
    Node (MN) that is attached to the PMIPv6\ndomain.  However, multihoming can also
    be provided using same unique\nprefix for all interfaces of MN similar to the
    MONAMI6 (Mobile Nodes\nand Multiple Interfaces in IPv6) concept.  This memo explores
    and\nhighlights lack of advanced multihoming support and other hand-off\nrelated
    issues where appropriate in three different mobility\nmanagement protocol models
    for multiple interfaced mobile nodes.\nFirstly, when single prefix is allocated
    for all interfaces of MN in\nthe PMIPv6 domain.  Secondly, when unique prefix
    is allocated for\neach interface as in PMIPv6 standard protocol model.  Thirdly,
    when a\nmultiple interfaced node uses different mobility management\nmechanisms
    for each of its interfaces.\n\t "

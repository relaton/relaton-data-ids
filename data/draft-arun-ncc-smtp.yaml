  content: "This draft presents a mechanism to simplify one of the cumbersome \naspects
    of mailing, when one needs to send mails only to a subset of \nmail-ids from an
    alias [ALIAS] . The basic intention is only to minimize \nthe complication and
    difficulty of a mail user when a mail needs to be \nsent to n - m mail IDs i.e.
    send it to a group Id of n and exclude m\nfrom the alias [ALIAS] list.\n\t "

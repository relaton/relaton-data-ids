  content: "   This document gives a historical perspective about the design and\n
    \  deployment of multicast routing protocols.  The document describes\n   the
    technical challenges discovered from building these protocols.\n   Even though
    multicast has enjoyed success of deployment in special\n   use-cases, we discuss
    what were, and are, the obstacles for mass\n   deployment across the Internet.
    \ Individuals who are working on new\n   multicast related protocols will benefit
    by knowing why we aren't\n   using certain older protocols today.\n\n\t "

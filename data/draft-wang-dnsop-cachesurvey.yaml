  content: "       DNS cache directly serves the DNS queries from stub resolvers as
    the\n       data source in the specified network area. For the present, however,\n
    \      operators manage and run the cache service in a diversified manner.\n       This
    arouses the main motivation of this survey report. Instead of\n       regulating
    or specifying the operation of the DNS cache service, our\n       aim is to investigate
    the situation of the DNS cache service (at\n       least in mainland China) and
    propose the future operation\n       recommendations with solid practical foundation.\n\n

  content: "This document is intended to be a guide for network administrators of\nenterprise
    sized sites that employ the Internet Protocol Version 4\n(IPv4) and who would
    like to introduce the Internet Protocol Version\n6 (IPv6) dual-stack. It applies
    to scenarios where IPv4 subnets must\nbe mapped to IPv6 subnets for management
    purposes while keeping the\noption to create IPv6 subnets in parallel and independently
    in the\nfuture with almost no restrictions; it is not meant to be applied to\nscenarios
    where a native IPv6 address plan can be created easily and\nwithout the need to
    map IPv4 subnets.\n\n\t "

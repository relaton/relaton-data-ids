  content: "The Billing and Accounting System Exchange (BASE) protocol is \nintended
    for use for the data transfer between the subsystems of a \ndistributed billing
    and accounting system. It defines the \ncommunication between central billing
    engines (BEs) and one or more \nlocally or remotely installed billing agents (BAs).
    BAs are used to \nsupply the BEs with load data used for billing and accounting
    \npurposes. BEs are responsible for the process of billing and \naccounting as
    well as for the configuration of the BAs and their \nconnected source systems.
    This document defines and describes the \nBASE protocol. \n\n\t "

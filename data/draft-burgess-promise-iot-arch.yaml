  content: "This draft describes architectural recommendations for a unified\n   concept
    of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, based on tried and\n   tested principles
    from infrastructure science.  We describe a\n   functional service architecture
    that may be applied in the manner of\n   a platform, from the smallest scale to
    the largest scale, using\n   vendor agnostic principles.  The current draft is
    rooted in the\n   principles of Promise Theory[Bergstra1] and voluntary cooperation.\n\t "

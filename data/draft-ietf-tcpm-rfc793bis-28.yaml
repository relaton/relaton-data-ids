- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  TCP
    is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it
    has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet.  Over
    this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC
    793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion.  This document
    collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from
    RFC 793.  This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429,
    6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122,
    and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents
    dealing with TCP requirements.  It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification
    in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state.  The TCP header control bits
    from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.\n\t "

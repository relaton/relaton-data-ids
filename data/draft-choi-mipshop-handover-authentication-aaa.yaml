  content: "This document describes a handover authentication protocol based on \nthe
    AAA server in FMIPv6. The proposed scheme employs the Diffie-\nHellman (DH) algorithm
    to enhance security aspects, and modifies the \nDH key exchange to reduce computational
    cost at the Mobile Node (MN) \nby delegating exponential operation to the AAA
    server. The MN and \nAccess Router (AR) establish the handover key HK through
    the AAA \nserver. The main advantage of this document is more secure and \nsuitable
    to a light-weight mobile terminal.\n\t "

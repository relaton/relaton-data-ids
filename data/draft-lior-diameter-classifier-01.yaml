  content: "Many Diameter applications require to classify packets.  Diameter\nbase
    protocols provides an IP Filter Rule type and a QoS Filter Rule\ntype that is
    being used to classify packets.  However, because these\ntypes were defined for
    specific uses and defined in ways that are\nhard to extend and therefore are not
    generally applicable for those\napplications that require packet classifiers.\n\nThis
    document describes a set of Diameter types that are useful to\ncreate packet classifiers.
    \ The packet classier type can be used by\nvarious applications to express packet
    classifiers that best match\nthe application's specific needs.\n\t "

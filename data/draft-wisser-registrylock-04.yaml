  content: "   This extensions defines an additional protective layer for changes
    to\n   domain [RFC5731], host [RFC5732] and contact [RFC5733] objects\n   managed
    through EPP.\n\n   EPP allows changes to objects only by the sponsoring client.
    \ EPP\n   objects are usually managed by the sponsoring client on behalf of the\n
    \  sponsoring clients customers.  All of these interactions are ususally\n   fully
    automated.\n\n   In case of a system breach, there is no protection in EPP to
    changes\n   to any object by the intruder.\n\n   This extension defines a protective
    layer that aims to break\n   automated changes and work flows by requiring manual
    intervention.\n\n   The actual form of manual intervention is out-of-scope for
    this\n   document.  By whom and how changes can be made is up to the registry\n
    \  and registrars to decide.\n\n\t "

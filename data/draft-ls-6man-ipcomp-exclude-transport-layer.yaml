  content: "   IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp) is used for compressing the\n
    \  IP payload in transmission to increase communication performance.\n   The IPComp
    is applied to the payload of the IP datagram, starting\n   with the first octet
    immediately after the IP header in IPv4, and the\n   first octet after the excluded
    IPv6 Extension headers.  However,\n   transport layer information such as source
    port and destination port\n   are useful in many network functions in transmission.\n\n
    \  This document defines extensions of IP payload compression protocol\n   (IPComp)
    to support compressing the payload excluding the transport\n   layer information,
    to enable network functions using transport layer\n   information (e.g., ECMP)
    working together with the payload\n   compression.  This document also defines
    an extension of IPComp to\n   indicate the payload is not compressed to solve
    the out-of-order\n   problems between the compressed and uncompressed packets.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an extension of the One-Time Password (OTP) algorithm,
    namely the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm, as defined in RFC 4226,
    to support the time-based moving factor. The HOTP algorithm specifies an event-based
    OTP algorithm, where the moving factor is an event counter. The present work bases
    the moving factor on a time value. A time-based variant of the OTP algorithm provides
    short-lived OTP values, which are desirable for enhanced security.\n\n The proposed
    algorithm can be used across a wide range of network applications, from remote
    Virtual Private Network (VPN) access and Wi-Fi network logon to transaction-oriented
    Web applications. The authors believe that a common and shared algorithm will
    facilitate adoption of two-factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability
    across commercial and open-source implementations. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "John Klensin proposed a multi-layered search-based access model for the
    \nDNS to address more human-friendly naming and navigation need of the \nmodern
    Internet [DNSSEARCH]. When deploying the DNS search system in the \nglobal Internet,
    stability and scalability are two most important \nfactors no matter what protocol
    we finally use. This draft demonstrates \nthat caching is a significant objective
    for a stable and scalable DNS \nsearch system. Particularly, this document analyzes
    statistical \noperational data collected from our Keyword service. The collected
    data \nclearly demonstrates the potential high impact of caching in the \nresolution
    process. Based on deployment experience, the document \ndescribes alternative
    caching methods. From there, basic caching \nrequirements for DNS Search systems
    are discussed.\n\nThe goal of this document is not to propose some standard caching
    \nmechanisms or methods but to emphasize the necessity of caching for DNS \nSearch
    systems. Furthermore, the authors believe that the proven high \nefficiency of
    caching should be an important consideration when \ndesigning the future lookup
    protocol for such systems.\n\t "

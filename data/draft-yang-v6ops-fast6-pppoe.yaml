  content: "   Although there have already been some transition solutions and\n   technologies,
    it is still lack of a complete solution for large scale\n   broadband ISPs based
    on the network architecture considering service\n   providers' requirements and
    constraints in the real world.  This\n   document proposes an IPv6 transitioning
    architecture, the FAST6,\n   which is based on the common broadband network architecture
    and\n   providing IPv6 transition solutions going through the whole\n   transition
    period.\n\n\t "

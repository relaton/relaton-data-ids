abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   TRILL can be implemented in data center networks, which requires high\n
    \  reliability and stability.  Whenever the egress RBridges or links\n   break
    down, the TRILL rerouting time depends on the IS-IS topology\n   convergence time,
    which may do not meet data center service\n   requirements in terms of resiliency.
    \ VRRP provides a redundancy\n   mechanism to avoid single point of failure and
    fast switching over.\n   This draft proposes to extend VRRP protocol to TRILL
    in data center\n   networks.\n\n\t "

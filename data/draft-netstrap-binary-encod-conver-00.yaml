  content: "A patent-pending method of encoding binary data for transfer between \ncomputers
    connected via a network, in which the encoded data \noptimally has an expansion
    ratio of about 1.22 (22%). Generally, the \nmethod relates to transfering binary
    data over the network using 94 \nASCII printable characters by fast encoding.
    Specifically, the \nmethod includes breaking the data into a plurality of chunks,
    and \nsubstantially performing some MOD and INT operations on these chunks \naccording
    to predefined combinatorial conditions. NOTE: This RFC \nincludes Background,
    Summary, and Detailed Description Sections - \nfor those wanting to understand
    the method; and a Working Prototype \n(section 2.0) - for those wanting to quickly
    implement and measure \nthe qualities of improvement described; specifically as
    'C-LANGUAGE \nIMPLEMENTATION DEMO' (section 5.0).\n\t "

  content: "Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as\npieces
    of information or server processes, which are available in\nseveral equivalent
    replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\nis not limited to, peer-to-peer
    file sharing applications.  The goal\nof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) is to provide\nguidance to applications, which have to select one or several
    hosts\nfrom a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired\nresource.
    \ This memo proposes one possible way of implementing the\nALTO protocol, called
    H1H2.  The H1H2 protocol is a client/server\nprotocols between end hosts and ALTO
    servers that allows two\ndifferent ways of exchanging data between the server
    and the client.\n\t "

  content: "   This draft captures the authors' personal opinions and is intended
    to\n   serve as input to the discussion for the solution in the DNA WG.  It\n
    \  presents a few assumptions for DNA solution.  The draft proposes the\n   solution
    to be based on 1) Link Identifier, 2) RA optimized for DNA\n   and 3) Quick delivery
    of an RA and sketches what rough shape DNA\n   solution will take.  It also enumerate
    a few tasks to be worked on\n   and issues to be resolved for efficient DNA solution.\n\t "

  content: "IPv6 nodes (clients) need a way to offer credentials to the AAA\ninfrastructure
    in order to be granted access to the local network.\nFor IPv6, it will be more
    efficient and thus reasonable to expect\nsuch access controls to be exerted by
    IPv6 routers, possibly as\npart of performing their role as DHCPv6 relays.  Routers
    and DHCPv6\nservers are expected to work in conjunction with AAA servers to\ndetermine
    whether or not the client's credentials are valid.  Routers\ncan exert such network
    access control by the device of carefully\ncontrolling entries in their packet
    filter and Neighbor Cache.\n\t "

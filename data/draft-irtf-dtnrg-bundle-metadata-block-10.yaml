  content: "This document defines an extension block that may be used with the Delay-Tolerant
    Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol.  This Metadata Extension Block is designed to
    carry additional information that DTN nodes can use to make processing decisions
    regarding bundles, such as deciding whether to store a bundle or determining to
    which nodes to forward a bundle.  The metadata that is carried in a metadata block
    must be formatted according to the metadata type that is identified in the block's
    metadata type field.  One specific metadata type, for carrying URIs as metadata,
    is defined in this document.  Other metadata types may be defined in separate
    documents.  This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research
    Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as
    an RFC were raised.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

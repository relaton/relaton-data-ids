  script: Latn
  content: "    In the late stage of the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, IPv4 lands\n
    \   are interconnected by IPv6 ocean and it is necessary for an IPv4\n    node
    and an IPv6 to communicate directly. This memo proposes a\n    mechanism to enable
    such direct communication with extension name\n    servers, an address mapper,
    and translators for each IPv4 land.\n\n\t "

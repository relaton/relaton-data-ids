- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Shared mesh protection is a common protection and recovery mechanism\n
    \  in transport networks, where multiple paths can share the same set of\n   network
    resources for protection purposes.\n\n   In the context of MPLS-TP, it has been
    explicitly requested as a part\n   of the overall solution (Req. 67, 68 and 69
    in RFC5654 [RFC5654]).\n\n   It's important to note that each MPLS-TP LSP may
    be associated with\n   transport network resources.  In event of network failure,
    it may\n   require explicit activation on the protecting paths before switching\n
    \  user traffic over.\n\n   In this memo, we define a lightweight signaling mechanism
    for\n   protecting path activation in shared mesh protection-enabled MPLS-TP\n
    \  networks.\n\n\n\t "

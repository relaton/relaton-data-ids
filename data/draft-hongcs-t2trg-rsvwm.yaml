  content: "Wireless network virtualization is one of the auspicious\napproach to
    address the increasing\ndemand of mobile data services. It enables logically decoupling\nthe
    traditional cellular network into infrastructure providers\n(InPs) and mobile
    virtual network operators (MVNOs). It also\noffers a virtualized wireless network
    (VWN), efficient resource\nutilization, and isolation between network slices (i.e.,
    MVNOs). In\nthis paper, we consider wireless network slicing for\na single InP\nwho
    owns radio resources and multiple MVNOs who need radio\nresources to provide specific
    services to their mobile users. One\nof the challenges in wireless network slicing
    is how to\nefficiently allocate the limited radio resources available at the\nInP
    to the MVNOs. In this paper, we address\nthe problem of efficient allocation of
    the InP radio\nresources to the MVNOs which aims to maximize the\ntotal network
    capacity of the InP. To this end,\nwe decompose our considered problem into two
    phases. The\nfirst phase is an efficient allocation of the InP radio\nresources
    (bandwidth) to the MVNOs, and the second phase\nis an optimal allocation of MVNOs
    resources gained from\nthe InP to their mobile users. We then propose\na Generalized
    Kelly Mechanism framework and the Karush-Kuhn-\nTucker (KKT) conditions to solve
    the first and the\nsecond phase of our resource allocation problem, respectively.\n\n\t "

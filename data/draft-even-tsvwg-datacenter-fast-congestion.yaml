  content: "   A good congestion control for data centers (DC) should provide low\n
    \  latency, fast convergence and high link utilization.  Since multiple\n   applications
    with different requirements may run on the DC network it\n   is important to provide
    fairness between different applications that\n   may use different congestion
    algorithms.  An important issue from the\n   user perspective is to achieve short
    Flow Completion Time (FCT).\n   This document proposes data center congestion
    control direction\n   aiming to achieve high performance while proving fairness.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes Extended RAMS (ERAMS), which is a complement\nto
    the unicast based Rapid Acquisition for Multicast based Streaming\n(RAMS) discussed
    in [ID-RAMS].  The outline of this added\nfunctionality to RAMS is to gather up
    Rapid Acquisition requests for\nmany users and transmit them in dedicated multicast
    streams.  With\nthis technique the peak load on the retransmission server and
    on the\noutgoing link from the retransmission server can be reduced.  For a\nproblem
    description of the channel change problem in multicast based\nIPTV the reader
    is encouraged to read [ID-RAMS].\n\t "

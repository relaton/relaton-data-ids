  content: "The United States Government has published guidelines for \"NSA Suite
    B Cryptography\" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
    for national security applications. This document specifies the conventions for
    using Suite B cryptography in IP Security (IPsec).\n\n Since many of the Suite
    B algorithms are used in other environments, the majority of the conventions needed
    for the Suite B algorithms are already specified in other documents. This document
    references the source of these conventions, with some relevant detail repeated
    to aid developers who choose to support Suite B. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

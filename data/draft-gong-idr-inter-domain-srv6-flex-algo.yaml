abstract:
- content: "<p>IGP Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algo) provides a mechanism for IGP nodes
    to compute the best paths according to a set of constraints in both the topology
    and computation metrics. Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) can be used as one of
    the data plane of IGP Flex-Algo. In SRv6 networks, services may be carried across
    multiple network domains which are under the same administration. For some services,
    it is expected that the an end-to-end inter-domain path can be computed according
    to the same constraints (such as low latency) defined by Flex-Algo. This document
    describes BGP extensions to advertise SRv6 locators as IPv6 prefixes, together
    with the associated algorithm across the AS boundary.</p>"

  content: "  We propose a protocol (the Remote Update Protocol, RUP) for\n  cooperation
    between Web Servers and Web Robots in order to\n  increase the reliability of
    Web indexing, and decrease the load\n  both on the server and the robot side.
    If the servers conform to\n  the RUP protocol, the task of the Robot will appear
    to be\n  distributed between the servers that it consults - for that\n  reason
    we choose to call this note ``Distributed Robots``.\n\n\t "

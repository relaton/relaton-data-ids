abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There appear to be some recent trends in the IETF, involving both\n
    \  published documents and proposals, to use Informational Documents to\n   effectively
    update Standards Track ones, presenting documents as\n   normative while avoiding
    the requirements for a higher level of\n   community review and consensus and
    relationship tracking that would\n   be required, in practice, for Standards Track
    updates RFC 4460,\n   titled \"Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Specification\n
    \  Errata and Issues\" and RFC 8540, titled \"Stream Control Transmission\n   Protocol:
    Errata and Issues in RFC 4960\", were published as\n   Informational documents
    although their clear intent is to update, or\n   posit alternatives to some of
    the provisions of, RFcs 2960 and 4960\n   respectively.  This critique suggests
    that it is undesirable for the\n   IETF to publish documents of that type and
    form, explains the\n   reasons, and identifies several alternatives.\n\n\t "

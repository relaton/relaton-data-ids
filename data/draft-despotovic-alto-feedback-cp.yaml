  content: "In some networked applications, such as peer-to-peer file sharing,\nthe
    same resource (e.g., a file or a server process) is available at\nseveral potential
    resource providers. Resource consumers typically\ntry to select providers so that
    application performance is improved,\nestablishing an overlay topology of direct
    logical links in the\nprocess. However, lack of reliable information about the
    underlying\nnetwork can lead to poor choices and suboptimal application\nperformance.
    In addition, resulting application traffic is largely\noblivious to technical,
    economical, and political constraints at the\nnetwork level, causing problems
    for network operators.\n\nThis document describes a protocol that facilitates
    the exchange of\ninformation between an overlay and the underlying network. Such\ninformation
    can be used at each layer to make decisions that are not\ndetrimental to the other
    layer or, ideally, are beneficial to both.\n\t "

  content: "This document introduces extensions to Mobile IPv6 and IPv6 Neighbour\n
    \  Discovery to allow for local mobility handling.  Hierarchical\n   mobility
    management for Mobile IPv6 is designed to reduce the amount\n   of signalling
    between the Mobile Node, its Correspondent Nodes, and\n   its Home Agent.  The
    Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) described in this\n   document can also be used to
    improve the performance of Mobile IPv6\n   in terms of handover speed.\n\t "

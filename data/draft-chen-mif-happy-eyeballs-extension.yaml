  content: "   The memo has been proposed to extend happy eyeballs algorithm to fit\n
    \  into multiple interfaces environment.  Based on this extended\n   heuristic
    algorithm, a client with multiple interface could determine\n   the optimal flow
    path in which specific interface has been chosen.\n   Furthermore, an appropriate
    IP address family for each interface can\n   be also identified to guarantee user
    experiences during IPv6\n   transition period.\n\n\t "

  content: "   With the pervasiveness of passive monitoring and ubiquity of\n   unencrypted
    Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), it is desirable to\n   mitigate passive monitoring
    without causing an undue burden on HTTP\n   user agents and servers.  This document
    describes the rationale and\n   process for using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    in an\n   unauthenticated manner for exchanging HTTP messages.  The application\n
    \  of unauthenticated TLS - particularly when Perfect Forward Secrecy\n   (PFS)
    algorithms are used - change monitoring from being a passive\n   attack into an
    active attack.\n\n\t "

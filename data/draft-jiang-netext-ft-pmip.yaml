  content: "   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility\n
    \  management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. If the\n   multihomed
    MN attaches to multiple MAGs by multiple links, then the\n   mobility session
    in each link is independent. As the ongoing\n   communication interface breaking
    down, the mobility session in the\n   link is also broke and the traffic packets
    are lost. This document\n   mainly proposes a fault tolerant scheme. When an interface
    of the\n   multihomed MN broke down, the fault tolerant scheme can be used to\n
    \  handover the interface and realize the flow migration and maintain\n   the
    integrity of data transmission During the handover process.\n\n\n\t "

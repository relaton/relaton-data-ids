  content: "   When developing a new application layer protocol the question about\n
    \  its foundation arises.  The decision will be impacted by various\n   factors
    but the ability for the solution to be deployable in today's\n   Internet will
    certainly play a big role since various intermediaries\n   may lead to a brittle
    communication architecture.\n\n   The waist of the hourglass has changed over
    time: new applications\n   have to run on top of UDP or TCP.  Protocol designs
    that use other\n   transport protocols have turned out to be undeployable on the
    public\n   Internet.  Running protocols on bare IP is also doomed to fail.  This\n
    \  change is not theoretic in nature but has real-world implications for\n   protocol
    designers.\n\n   There is also a trend to run applications on top of HTTP/HTTPS.
    \ The\n   author seeks more input from the wider IETF community about the\n   deployment
    situation of protocol filtering by intermediaries and on\n   the impact for protocol
    designers.\n\n   This document is being discussed at\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/architecture-discuss\n\n\t "

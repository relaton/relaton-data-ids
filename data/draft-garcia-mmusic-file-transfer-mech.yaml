  content: "This document provides a mechanism to negotiate the transfer of one\n
    \  or more files between two endpoints by using the Session Description\n   Protocol
    (SDP) offer/answer model specified in RFC 3264.  SDP is\n   extended to describe
    the attributes of the files to be transferred.\n   The offerer can either describe
    the files it wants to send, or the\n   files it would like to receive.  The answerer
    can either accept or\n   reject the offer separately for each individual file
    .  The transfer\n   of one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation.\n
    \  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is defined as the default\n   mechanism
    to actually carry the files between the endpoints.  The\n   conventions on how
    to use MSRP for file transfer are also provided in\n   this document.\n\t "

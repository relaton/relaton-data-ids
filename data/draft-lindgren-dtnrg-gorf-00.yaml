  content: "   This document defines GORF, a Generic Opportunistic Routing\n   Framework.
    \ GORF specifies all necessary basic functionality that is\n   common for all
    utility-based routing protocols that are variants of\n   the epidemic routing
    protocol for intermittently connected networks\n   that operates by pruning the
    epidemic distribution tree to minimize\n   resource usage while still attempting
    to achieve the best case\n   routing capabilities of epidemic routing.  It is
    intended for use in\n   sparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that
    a fully\n   connected path between source and destination exists at any time,\n
    \  rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages\n   between
    hosts.  These networks are examples of networks where there\n   is a disparity
    between the latency requirements of applications and\n   the capabilities of the
    underlying network (networks often referred\n   to as Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant).
    \ The document presents an\n   architectural overview followed by the protocol
    specification.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document makes recommendations for the use of ECN with\nretransmitted
    data packets, for an ECN-capable TCP connection.  This\ndocument supplements RFC
    2481 [RFC2481], which did not address the\nissue of retransmitted data packets.
    \ This document recommends that\nfor ECN-capable TCP implementations, the ECT
    bit (ECN-Capable\nTransport) in the IP header SHOULD NOT be set on retransmitted
    data\npackets, and that the TCP data receiver SHOULD ignore the ECN field\non
    arriving data packets that are outside of the receiver's current\nwindow.  This
    is for greater security against denial-of-service\nattacks.\n\n\t "

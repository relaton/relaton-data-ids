  content: "This document lays out a set of requirements related to trait-based authorization
    for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  While some authentication mechanisms
    are described in the base SIP specification, trait-based authorization provides
    information used to make policy decisions based on the attributes of a participant
    in a session.  This approach provides a richer framework for authorization, as
    well as allows greater privacy for users of an identity system.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

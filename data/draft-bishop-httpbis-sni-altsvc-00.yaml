  content: "   HTTP Alternative Services [AltSvc] provides a mechanism for an origin\n
    \  to declare that its content is accessible via some other combination\n   of
    host, port, and protocol.  In the process of using such an\n   alternative, an
    observer can identify that the client is requesting\n   resources from a particular
    hostname.\n\n   This document extends HTTP Alternative Services, in combination
    with\n   Secondary Certificate Authentication ([SecondaryCerts]), to enable\n
    \  clients not to disclose the origin to which they intend to connect.\n\n\t "

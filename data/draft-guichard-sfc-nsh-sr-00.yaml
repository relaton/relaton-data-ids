  content: "   This document describes two application scenarios where Network\n   Service
    Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR) can be deployed\n   together to support
    Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient\n   manner while maintaining separation
    of the service and transport\n   planes as originally intended by the SFC architecture.\n\n
    \  In the first scenario, an NSH-based SFC is created using SR as the\n   transport
    between SFFs.  SR in this case is just one of many\n   encapsulations that could
    be used to maintain the transport-\n   independent nature of NSH-based service
    chains.\n\n   In the second scenario, SR is used to represent each service hop
    of\n   the NSH-based SFC as a segment within the segment-list.  SR and NSH\n   in
    this case are integrated.\n\n   In both of these scenarios SR is responsible for
    steering packets\n   between SFFs of a given SFP and NSH is responsible for maintaining\n
    \  the integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance context, and any\n   associated
    metadata.\n\n   These application scenarios demonstrate that NSH and SR can work\n
    \  jointly and complement each other leaving the network operator with\n   the
    flexibility to use whichever transport technology makes sense in\n   specific
    areas of their network infrastructure, and still maintain an\n   end-to-end service
    plane using the NSH technology.\n\n\t "

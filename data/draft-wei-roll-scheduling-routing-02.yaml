  content: "   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics\n   compared
    with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Deterministic\n   networks is specified
    in IEEE 802.15.4e which is for deterministic\n   applications in the industrial
    environment. Some routing metrics\n   and constraints has been described in [RFC6551],[RFC5867]
    [RFC5826],\n   [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There are several special characteristics\n
    \  and requirements in the industrial environment. This document\n   defines a
    new Link Metric/Constraint Object-Scheduling Waiting\n   Time to make RPL support
    deterministic scheduling mechanism, which\n   could improve the determinacy and
    reliability of the LLNs in\n   industrial environment.\n\n\n\t "

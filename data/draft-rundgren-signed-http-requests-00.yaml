  content: "   The SHREQ specification describes how the JSON Web Signature (JWS)\n
    \  specification combined with the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS),\n   can
    be utilized to support HTTP based applications needing digitally\n   signed requests.
    \ SHREQ is specifically tailored for Web applications\n   using JSON as data interchange
    format.  However, there is also a\n   SHREQ scheme for HTTP requests that do not
    have a body (\"payload\")\n   like GET.  SHREQ was designed to be agnostic with
    respect to REST\n   concepts versus traditional GET/POST schemes.\n\n   The intended
    audiences of this document are Web tool vendors, as well\n   as designers of secure
    Web applications.\n\n\t "

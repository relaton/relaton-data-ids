  content: "   The IPv6 addressing architecture defines a method by which the\n   Universal
    and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped\n   into an IPv6 unicast
    interface identifier.  This document clarifies\n   the status of those bits for
    interface identifiers that are not\n   derived from an IEEE link-layer address,
    and updates RFC 4291\n   accordingly.\n\n\t "

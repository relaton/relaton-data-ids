  content: "   This draft describes and lists the functional requirements of a\n   federated
    file system and defines related terms.  Our intent is to\n   use this draft as
    a starting point and refine it, with input and\n   feedback from the file system
    community and other interested parties,\n   until we reach general agreement.
    \ We will then begin, again with the\n   help of any interested parties, to define
    standard, open federated\n   file system protocols that satisfy these requirements
    and are\n   suitable for implementation and deployment.\n\n\n\t "

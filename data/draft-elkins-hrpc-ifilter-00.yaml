  content: "   This document is a survey of the filtering of content.  The focus is\n
    \  on the human rights involved as cited in the Universal Declaration of\n   Human
    Rights\" which is one of the foundational documents for HRPC.\n   The recent years
    have seen an increase in content filtering for a\n   variety of reasons including
    to further the aims of governments who\n   wish to maintain their rule and suppress
    dissent but also to enforce\n   cultural norms, human rights and compliance with
    the law.  Filters\n   also exist for security (botnets, malware etc.), user-defined\n
    \  policies (parental control, corporate blocking of social networks\n   during
    work time, etc.), spam control, upload of copyrighted material\n   and other reasons.
    This document is based on several real world\n   considerations: the existence
    of national and regional sovereignty,\n   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and
    Content Distribution Networks\n   (CDNs) that provide connectivity and content
    hosting services, Over-\n   the-top (OTTs) and Content Delivery Platforms (CDPs)
    that play a\n   disproportionate role in capturing the attention and \"eyeballs\"
    of\n   many of the users of the Internet.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an experimental serverless solution to build\nVirtual
    Private LAN Segments (VPLS) for TCP/IP over a multicast\nenabled IP backbone.
    \ IP traffic is encapsulated in IPsec [RFC2401]\ntunnel mode. IP broadcast and
    multicast traffic is sent, after\nencapsulation in IPSec tunnel mode, to the VPN
    assigned IP multicast\naddress. IP unicast traffic, after encapsulation,  is sent
    directly\nto the dynamically learned IP tunnel endpoint address.  Multicast\nEnabled
    ARP (ME-ARP) as defined in this document is used to\ndynamically build the mapping
    between IP addresses and remote tunnel\nendpoints. The tunnel endpoint information
    is hidden in the hardware\naddress given to IP devices in the ARP reply. Therefore
    IP devices\nparticipating in a VPLS keep track of the remote locations of other\nVPLS
    members through their own ARP table without 'knowledge'.\n\t "

  content: "   Some networks, such as in space, have links that are up and down\n
    \  based on a known schedule.  In this context, IP Packets or Bundle\n   Protocol
    Bundles should then be saved locally until the destination\n   becomes reachable
    again.  This document describes forwarding node\n   policies regarding how to
    manage the local store as well as\n   forwarding decisions.  This specification
    applies to both IP packets\n   or Bundle Protocol bundles.\n\n\t "

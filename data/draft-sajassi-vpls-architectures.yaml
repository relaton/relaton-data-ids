  content: "This document defines a reference architecture for a VPLS system. It \ndescribes
    possible VPLS architectures based on this reference \narchitecture and the merits
    of each. Each VPLS architecture is \ndescribed in terms of its logical components
    and their relationship to \neach other, as well as the mapping of these logical
    components to \nphysical network elements. By understanding these logical components,
    \nwhich are fundamental building blocks for any VPLS system, one can \neasily
    compare different VPLS architectures and understand the pros and \ncons of each.
    A VPLS system may support one or more of these \narchitectures simultaneously.

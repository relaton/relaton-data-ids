  script: Latn
  content: "  In [PIM-SM], assert procedures are triggered by data-plane \n  interaction
    with the control-plane when traffic arrives on an \n  outgoing interface. There
    are several disadvantages with this in that \n  duplicate traffic is forwarded
    downstream until an assert winner is \n  elected and seen by all routers on the
    LAN; such dependence on the \n  data-plane to build control-plane state does not
    scale well. When \n  [PIM-SM] is used to setup P2MP LSP trees as in [SURESH-P2MP],
    it is \n  not always possible to determine if traffic arrived on an outbound \n
    \ interface . This draft proposes mechanisms to trigger assert \n  completely
    in the control plane by reacting to Joins sent to another \n  router on a LAN.
    These procedures are essential when it is not \n  possible to determine if traffic
    arrived on an outbound interface. It \n  also helps completely remove the dependency
    on data-plane to trigger \n  asserts and eliminates duplicate traffic resulting
    from assert \n  scenarios.  \n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Deterministic elliptic-curve signatures such as deterministic ECDSA\n
    \  and EdDSA have gained popularity over randomized ECDSA as their\n   security
    does not depend on a source of high-quality randomness.\n   Recent research, however,
    has found that implementations of these\n   signature algorithms may be vulnerable
    to certain side-channel and\n   fault injection attacks due to their deterministic
    nature.  One\n   countermeasure to such attacks is hedged signatures where the\n
    \  calculation of the per-message secret number includes both fresh\n   randomness
    and the message.  This document updates RFC 6979 and RFC\n   8032 to recommend
    hedged constructions in deployments where side-\n   channel attacks and fault
    injection attacks are a concern.  The\n   updates are invisible to the validator
    of the signature and\n   compatible with existing ECDSA and EdDSA validators.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The GSS-API Naming Extensions define new APIs that extend the GSS-API\n
    \  naming model to support name attribute transfer between GSS-API\n   peers.
    \ Historically, this set of functions has been used to obtain\n   the authorization
    information contained in some sort of authorization\n   token provided to the
    GSS acceptor during the context establishment\n   process, such as a Kerberos
    ticket, a SAML assertion, or an X.509\n   attribute certificate.  However, some
    scenarios require to allow the\n   GSS acceptor to request additional attributes
    after context\n   establishment.  If these attributes are not locally stored by
    the GSS\n   mechanism they have to be retrieved from an external source (e.g.\n
    \  SQL database, LDAP directory, external IdP, etc.).  This document\n   describes
    how current GSS-API extensions are able to encompass such\n   functionality without
    requiring of any change, neither on the\n   existing calls nor on the way applications
    use the API.\n\n\t "

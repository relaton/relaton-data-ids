  content: "   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\n
    \  [RFC7643] provides schemas that represent common identity information\n   about
    users and groups.  Privileged Access Management (PAM) software\n   typically makes
    use of common user and group models - as well as\n   defining additional constructs
    - to provide fine-grained\n   authorization and management for privileged access.\n\n
    \  This document contains a SCIM 2.0 extension for Privileged Access\n   Management,
    which includes extensions to the core User and Group\n   objects, and new resource
    types and schemas for standard Privileged\n   Access Management constructs.  This
    extension is intended to provide\n   greater interoperability between PAM software
    and clients, a common\n   language for PAM concepts, and a baseline that can be
    further\n   extended to support more complex PAM requirements.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-\n
    \  API), as defined in RFC-1508, provides security services to callers\n   in
    a generic fashion, supportable with a range of underlying\n   mechanisms and technologies
    and hence allowing source-level\n   portability of applications to different environments.
    It defines\n   GSS-API services and primitives at a level independent of underlying\n
    \  mechanism and programming language environment.\n \n   The GSSAPI allows a
    caller application to authenticate a principal\n   identity associated with a
    peer application, to delegate rights to a\n   peer, and to apply security services
    such as confidentiality and\n   integrity on a per-message basis.\n \n   The primitives
    of the GSS-API do not currently allow support of\n   security attributes other
    than a single identity and do not allow\n   fine control of delegation.\n \n   The
    additional primitives described in this document provide support\n   for:\n \n
    \  * the exchange of a variety of security attributes, and the\n   construction
    of authorization functions using these attributes,\n   including delegated ones,
    (attribute handling support functions),\n\n   * fine control over delegation by
    allowing specification of the\n   delegation method, the acceptor(s) of a security
    context, their type\n   and the restrictions that may apply (acceptor control
    and support\n   functions).\n\n\t "

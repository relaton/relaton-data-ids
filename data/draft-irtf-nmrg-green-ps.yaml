  content: "   Reducing humankind's environmental footprint and making technology\n
    \  more environmentally sustainable are among the biggest challenges of\n   our
    age.  Networks play an important part in this challenge.  On one\n   hand, they
    enable applications that help to reduce this footprint.\n   On the other hand,
    they contribute to this footprint themselves in no\n   insignificant way.  Therefore,
    methods to make networking technology\n   itself \"greener\" and to manage and
    operate networks in ways that\n   reduce their environmental footprint without
    impacting their utility\n   need to be explored.  This document outlines a corresponding
    set of\n   opportunities, along with associated research challenges, for\n   networking
    technology in general and management technology in\n   particular to become \"greener\",
    i.e., more sustainable, with reduced\n   greenhouse gas emissions and less negative
    impact on the environment.\n\n   This document is a product of the Network Management
    Research Group\n   (NMRG) of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).  This document\n
    \  reflects the consensus of the research group.  It is not a candidate\n   for
    any level of Internet Standard and is published for informational\n   purposes.\n\n\t "

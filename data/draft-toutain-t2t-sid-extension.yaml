  content: "   As the Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming more pervasive\n
    \  with their rapid adoption, they are also becoming more complex in\n   their
    architecture.  Hence, a tool is required to generate prototype\n   code based
    on the YANG models for constrained devices [RFC7228] to\n   improve interoperability
    and increase the reusability of software\n   components.  A novel approach is
    introduced in this document to\n   generate software prototypes (also called stubs)
    in the C language\n   for the CORECONF protocol [I-D.ietf-core-comi] using YANG
    Schema Item\n   iDentifiers (YANG SID [I-D.ietf-core-sid]).  These stubs greatly\n
    \  reduce the complexity of navigating the CORECONF structure by\n   abstracting
    the corresponding YANG SIDs.  This document elaborates on\n   the procedure to
    generate YANG SIDs for a given YANG model of a\n   system, which then generates
    C stubs using the tools developed by the\n   authors with the help of an example
    (sensor.yang file).\n\n\t "

  content: "   Multi-homing (RBridge Aggregation) is a promising approach to\n   increase
    the reliability and access bandwidth of TRILL edge. Active-\n   active forwarding
    in multi-homing allows multiple RBridges forward\n   data frames for VLAN-x on
    a LAN link, which creates the possibility\n   that multicast frames from a specific
    ingress RBridge may arrive at\n   multiple incoming ports of a remote RBridge.
    This violates the\n   Reverse Path Forwarding Check and multicast frames arrives
    at\n   unexpected incoming ports will be discarded by this RBridge. This\n   document
    makes use of multiple topology TRILL to solve this problem.\n   Multiple topology
    TRILL provides physical separation of traffic from\n   different members of aggregation.
    Multicast frames from aggregation\n   members comply with the Reverse Path Forwarding
    Check per topology.\n\n\t "

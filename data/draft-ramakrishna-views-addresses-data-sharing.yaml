- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   With increasing use of DLT (distributed ledger technology) systems,\n
    \  including blockchain systems and networks, for virtual assets, there is a\n
    \  need for asset-related data and metadata to traverse system boundaries\n   and
    link their respective business workflows. Core requirements for such\n   interoperation
    between systems are the abilities of these systems to\n   project views of their
    assets to external parties, either individual\n   agents or other systems, and
    the abilities of those external parties to\n   locate and address the views they
    are interested in. A view denotes the\n   complete or partial state of a virtual
    asset, or the output of a function\n   computed over the states of one or more
    assets, or locks or pledges made\n   over assets for internal or external parties.
    Systems projecting these\n   views must be able to guard them using custom access
    control policies,\n   and external parties consuming them must be able to verify
    them\n   independently for authenticity, finality, and freshness. The end-to-end\n
    \  protocol that allows an external party to request a view by an address\n   and
    a DLT system to return a view in response must be DLT-neutral and\n   mask the
    interior particularities and complexities of the DLT systems.\n   The view generation
    and verification modules at the endpoints must obey\n   the native consensus logic
    of their respective systems.\n\n\t "

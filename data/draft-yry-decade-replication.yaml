  content: "   The DECADE Working Group at IETF is working on introducing standard-\n
    \  based, application-agnostic in-network storage for content\n   distribution
    to improve both network efficiency and application\n   performance.  In this document,
    we introduce content replication\n   trees and then discuss approaches on how
    a replication tree can be\n   constructed in DECADE.  In particular, we introduce
    concepts\n   including core-stateless content pull, and stateful, open content\n
    \  forwarding table.\n\n\t "

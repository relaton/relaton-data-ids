  script: Latn
  content: "   The normal operation for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is\n
    \  for the submitting device to wait for all processing to complete and\n   for
    the server to return a positive acknowledgement to the client.\n   However, some
    devices have very intermittent connectivity, such as\n   wireless mobile terminals.
    \ For such devices, a means to have\n   processing continue in the case of a dropped
    connection is desirable.\n   To this end, this SMTP service extension enables
    a client to submit a\n   message and reliably detach from the session, indicating
    to the\n   server to continue in the absence of a connection to the client.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an architecture based on two levels of\naddressing.
    A logical addressing level is used to identify logical\nobjects independently
    of their current IP address, such as multicast\ngroups or mobile hosts. This  schema
    is then used to define in a\nunified way mechanisms for inter-domain multicasting
    and mobility.\n\t "

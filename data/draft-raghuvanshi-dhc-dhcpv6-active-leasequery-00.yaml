abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been\n
    \  extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request\n   information
    about DHCPv6 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to\n   queries for DHCPv6 binding
    data updates until the time DHCPv6 server\n   receive the Leasequery request.
    \ Continuous update of an external\n   client with Leasequery data is sometimes
    desired.  This document\n   expands on the DHCPv6 Leasequery protocol, and allows
    for active\n   transfer of real-time DHCPv6 binding information data via TCP.
    \ This\n   document also extends DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery by adding new options.\n\n\t "

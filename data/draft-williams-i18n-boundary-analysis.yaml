  content: "   Internationalization of protocols and programs often requires\n   determining
    where to use one or another character repertoire,\n   codeset, encoding, where
    to perform localization, and so on.  This\n   document aims to serve as a guide
    to Internet protocol designers in\n   determining what they may or should recommend
    or require of protocol\n   implementors.  Of particular interest in this document
    are filesystem\n   protocols.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document shows how the algorithm for resource registration and\n
    \  lookup in a SIP-based peer-to-peer system can be implemented in the\n   presence
    of NATs.  More precisely, this document show how this\n   algorithm can be generalized
    into a method of routing arbitrary SIP\n   requests through overlays, and how
    this approach can be used to set\n   up new connections between peers to use for
    additional SIP signaling.\n\n   The document uses SIP to signal new dSIP connections,
    and uses\n   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) to allow these\n   connections
    to be established through NATs.\n\n\t "

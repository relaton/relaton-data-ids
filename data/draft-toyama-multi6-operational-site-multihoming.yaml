  content: "   This document proposes an operational solution of IPv6 mulithoming.\n
    \  This approach is that a group of providers administrates\n   cooperatively
    one prefix and one autonomous system number (ASN) for\n   only their multihoming
    customers; each multihomed customer is\n   assigned a longer prefix, such as /48,
    but only address block of /32\n   allocated by RIR is advertised through the providers
    of the group to\n   the global IPv6 Internet.\n\n   This approach does not need
    allocation of provider-independent\n   address block to each customer who needs
    multihomed network, and\n   therefore saves IPv6 address space.\n\t "

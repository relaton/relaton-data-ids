  content: "   RObust Header Compression (ROHC), RFC 3095, defines a framework for\n
    \  header compression, along with a number of compression protocols\n   (profiles).
    One operating assumption for the profiles defined in RFC\n   3095 is that the
    channel between compressor and decompressor is\n   required to maintain packet
    ordering. This document discusses aspects\n   of using ROHC over channels that
    can reorder packets. It provides\n   guidelines on how to implement existing profiles
    over such channels,\n   as well as suggestions for the design of new profiles.\n\t "

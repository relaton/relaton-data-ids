  content: "   Traditionally, the management of the DNS root zone permitted only\n
    \  \"alphabetic\" labels.  As long as the root zone included only ASCII\n   characters,
    and as long as there was only one form of a label, the\n   restriction plainly
    meant that only the letters A-Z and a-z were\n   permitted.  The advent of internationalized
    labels using IDNA2008\n   presents some complications for the restriction.  One
    of the\n   complications is the meaning of the term \"alphabetic\" when applied
    to\n   the Unicode code points in U-labels.  This memo presents a set of\n   principles
    that can be used to determine whether a Unicode code point\n   may be wisely included
    in the repertoire of permissible code points\n   in a U-label in a zone.\n\n\t "

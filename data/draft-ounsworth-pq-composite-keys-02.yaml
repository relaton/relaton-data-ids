  script: Latn
  content: "   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history\n
    \  of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor\n   the
    new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the\n   required
    data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and\n   elliptic curve,
    may fall to quantum cryptalanysis, while the incoming\n   post-quantum algorithms
    face uncertainty about both the underlying\n   mathematics as well as hardware
    and software implementations that\n   have not had sufficient maturing time to
    rule out classical\n   cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.\n\n   Cautious
    implementors may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such\n   that an attacker
    would need to break all of them in order to\n   compromise the data being protected.
    \ For digital signatures, this is\n   referred to as \"dual\", and for encryption
    key establishment this as\n   reffered to as \"hybrid\".  This document, and its
    companions, defines\n   a specific instantiation of the dual and hybrid paradigm
    called\n   \"composite\" where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined
    to\n   form a single key, signature, or key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)\n   such
    that they can be treated as a single atomic object at the\n   protocol level.\n\n
    \  EDNOTE: the terms \"dual\" and \"hybrid\" are currently in flux.  We\n   anticipate
    an Informational draft to normalize terminology, and will\n   update this draft
    accordingly.\n\n   This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey and\n
    \  CompositePrivateKey, which are sequences of the respective structure\n   for
    each component algorithm.  The generic composite variant is\n   defined which
    allows arbitrary combinations of key types to be placed\n   in the CompositePublicKey
    and CompositePrivateKey structures without\n   needing the combination to be pre-registered
    or pre-agreed.  The\n   explicit variant is also defined which allows for a set
    of algorithm\n   identifier OIDs to be registered together as an explicit composite\n
    \  algorithm and assigned an OID.\n\n   This document is intended to be coupled
    with corresponding documents\n   that define the structure and semantics of composite
    signatures and\n   encryption, such as [draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-05]
    and draft-\n   ounsworth-pq-composite-kem (yet to be published).\n\n\t "

  content: "An IPFIX Mediator is an intermediate device between IPFIX Exporting\n
    \  Processes and IPFIX Collecting Processes.  IPFIX Mediators act as an\n   IPFIX
    Proxy, and IPFIX Concentrator.  IPFIX Mediators mediate IPFIX\n   protocol using
    several functions.  That enables the flow-based\n   measurement system to become
    a high-capacity system and accommodate a\n   variety of monitoring methods.  This
    document describes each function\n   that is provided by IPFIX Mediators and the
    method of handling the\n   Flow Records of each function.  In addition, this document
    describes\n   a model of an applicable scenario using IPFIX Mediators.\n\t "

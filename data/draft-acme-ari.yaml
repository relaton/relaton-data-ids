  content: "   This document specifies how an ACME server may provide suggestions
    to\n   ACME clients as to when they should attempt to renew their\n   certificates.
    \ This allows servers to mitigate load spikes, and\n   ensures clients do not
    make false assumptions about appropriate\n   certificate renewal periods.\n\nCurrent
    Implementations\n\n   Draft note: this section will be removed by the editor before
    final\n   publication.\n\n   Let's Encrypt's Staging environment (available at
    [lestaging], source\n   at [boulder]) implements this draft specification.\n\n\t "

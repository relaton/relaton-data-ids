  content: "This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for LDPC-\nstaircase
    codes that can be used to protect media streams along the\nlines defined by the
    FECFRAME framework.  These codes have many\ninteresting properties: they are systematic
    codes, they perform close\nto ideal codes in many use-cases and they also feature
    very high\nencoding and decoding throughputs.  LDPC-Staircase codes are\ntherefore
    a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source\nflow, or to protect globally
    several mid-rate flows within a single\nFECFRAME instance.  They are also a good
    solution whenever the\nprocessing load of a software encoder or decoder must be
    kept to a\nminimum.\n\t "

  content: "This draft presents the transitional phases that optical network \nconnection
    operations undergo, providing high-level processes and \nstates of the connection
    operations. A list of potential parameters \nassociated with the connection operations
    signaling protocol is \nprovided. The list of parameters is not an exhaustive
    list; it \nshould be used as a basis for more comprehensive parameters for the
    \nsignaling mechanism.\n\t "

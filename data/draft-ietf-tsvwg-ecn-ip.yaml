  content: "This document contributes to the effort to add explicit congestion\nnotification
    (ECN) to IP. In the current effort to standardise ECN for TCP it is unavoidably
    necessary to standardise certain new aspects of IP.However, the IP aspects will
    not and cannot only be specific to TCP. We specify interaction with features of
    IP such as fragmentation,\ndifferentiated services, multicast forwarding, and
    a definition of the\nservice offered to higher layer congestion control protocols.
    This document\nonly concerns aspects related to the IP layer, but includes any
    aspects\nlikely to be common to all higher layer protocols. Any specification
    of ECN\nsupport in higher layer protocols is expected to appear in a separate\nspecification
    for each such protocol.\n\t "

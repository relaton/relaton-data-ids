  script: Latn
  content: "   In security considerations, identities of devices like\n   certifications,
    private keys should be protected and cannot be\n   exposed in public in plaintext
    during whole lifecycle.  When using\n   these identities to make authentications
    a unified architecture to\n   prevent identity information leakage is needed.
    \ This document\n   creates a secure and trusted TEE authentication architecture
    to\n   authenticate a device's identity based on EAP-TLS and TEE.  In this\n   architecture,
    certificate and handshake keys which are used for EAP-\n   TLS will be executed
    in TEE.  Communication establishment with EAP-\n   TLS Server will be executed
    in REE.  A middle layer is introduced to\n   communicate between TEE and REE to
    compose the original function of\n   EAP-TLS Client.  TEE authentication could
    be used in LAN or WLAN\n   scenarios.\n\n\t "

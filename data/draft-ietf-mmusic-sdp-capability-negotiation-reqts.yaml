  content: "   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing
    \n   multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session \n
    \  invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP was \n   not
    intended to provide capability indication or capability \n   negotiation, however
    over the years, SDP has seen widespread adoption \n   and as a result it has been
    gradually extended to provide limited \n   support for these. SDP and its current
    extensions however do not \n   have, for example, the ability to negotiate one
    or more alternative \n   transport protocols (e.g. RTP profiles) which makes it
    particularly \n   difficult to deploy new RTP profiles such as secure RTP and
    RTP with \n   RTCP-based feedback. The purpose of this document is to identify
    a \n   set of requirements for SDP Capability Negotiation and evaluate \n   existing
    work in this area. The document does not provide any \n   solutions to SDP Capability
    Negotiation \n\n\t "

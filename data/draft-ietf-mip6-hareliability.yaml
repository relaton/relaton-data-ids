  content: "   The home agent can be a single point of failure when Mobile IPv6 and\n
    \  its associated supporting protocols are operated in a system.  It is\n   critical
    to provide home agent reliability in the event of a home\n   agent crashing or
    becoming unavailable.  This would allow another\n   home agent to take over and
    continue providing service to the mobile\n   nodes.  This document describes the
    problem scope briefly, and\n   provides mechanisms of home agent failure detection,
    home agent state\n   transfer, and home agent switching for home agent redundancy
    and\n   reliability.\n\n\t "

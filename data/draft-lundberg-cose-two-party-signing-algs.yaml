abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers for negotiating
    how to split a signature algorithm between two cooperating parties. Typically
    the first party hashes the data to be signed and the second party finishes the
    signature over the hashed data. This is a common technique, useful for example
    when the signing private key is held in a smart card or similar hardware component
    with limited processing power and communication bandwidth. The resulting signatures
    are identical in structure to those computed by a single party, and can be verified
    using the same verification algorithm without additional steps to preprocess the
    signed data.</p>"

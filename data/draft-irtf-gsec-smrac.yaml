  content: "This document seeks to provide a solution to secure the multicast\nedge,
    in particular the 'last-hop' of the multicast between multicast\nedge routers
    and hosts within a network. In this document, we\nproposed a simple and light-weight
    solution to prevent an illegal\nhost from pulling the multicast distribution tree
    into the host's\nnetwork when no other legal hosts exists in that same network.\n\n\t "

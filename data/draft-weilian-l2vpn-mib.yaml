  content: "   This draft not only describes the management model which is universal\n
    \  to all PSN types supported by PWE3 architecture, but also defines an \n   experimental
    part of MIB on Internet community network management \n   protocol.  \n\n   Especially,
    the draft describes the managed objects of L2VPN \n   service on packet switching
    network, including VPWS, VPLS and IPLS \n   services. Different from PW MIB, the
    MIB provides the management \n   models for L2VPN service, including the management
    models of L2VPN \n   service instance, L2VPN PW specific parameters, L2VPN AC
    Access \n   parameters and traffic statistics for L2VPN service.\n\n\n\t "

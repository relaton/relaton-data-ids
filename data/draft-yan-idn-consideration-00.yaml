  content: "   This document aims to pinpoint the work scope of Intelligence Driven\n
    \  Network (IDN) and mine the potential standardization work.  Firstly,\n   the
    problems and new requirements for the existing methods are\n   analyzed.  Numbers
    of high value use-cases are proposed as examples\n   to instantiate them.  A benchmark
    framework design is proposed, which\n   is important during the machine learning
    and inference process.\n   Finally, a reference model of IDN is proposed, based
    on which the\n   potential standardization work is analyzed.\n\n\n\t "

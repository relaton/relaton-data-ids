  content: "Middle Box discovery is one of the problems that the Midcom \narchitecture
    has not yet solved. This document compares two Middle \nbox discovery solutions:

    protocol than the MIDCOM protocol \nvs the combo model were the MIDCOM protocol
    and the discovery \nprotocol are the same. \n\n\t "

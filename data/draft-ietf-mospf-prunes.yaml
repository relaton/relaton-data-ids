  content: "    MOSPF is a link-state multicast routing protocol, based on OSPF.\n
    \   Inside a single OSPF area, the delivery of multicast datagrams is\n    restricted
    to group members only, by propagating the location of\n    group members through
    group-membership-LSAs. However, group\n    membership is not propagated across
    area and/or AS boundaries,\n    relying instead on so-called wild-card multicast
    receivers. This\n    means that in some cases multicast datagrams are transmitted
    further\n    than necessary, wasting link and processor resources in the process.\n
    \n    This document defines a way to prune these excess branches off the\n    MOSPF
    delivery tree, using a new Prune-LSA. In concept these are\n    similar to the
    prunes employed by the DVMRP protocol. However, to\n    reuse the reliability
    mechanisms present in the base OSPF protocol,\n    MOSPF prunes are implemented
    as local-scope Opaque-LSAs. As a\n    result, inter-area and inter-AS multicast
    datagrams are forwarded by\n    MOSPF using the broadcast-and-prune strategy employed
    by DVMRP.\n\n\t "

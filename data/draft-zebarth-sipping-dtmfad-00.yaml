  content: "This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event \npackage
    'DTMFAD' to allow the use of SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY to collect \nDTMF signals.  This
    package is required to implement Committee T1 \nTechnical Report T1.TR.82-2003.
    \n\nThe 'DTMFAD' event package requires the definition of two new Event \nheader
    field parameters.  This package also requires the use of a new \nMIME type, application/DTMF-event,
    to allow for the transfer of DTMF \ndata in the NOTIFY body.  Registration of
    this MIME type is also \nprovided in this document.  \n\n      This document has
    been produced, on behalf of Committee T1, as part \n      of the IANA registration
    process. \n\t "

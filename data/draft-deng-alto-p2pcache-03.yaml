abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   Uploading from peers located in a public WLAN hotspot has been\n   reported
    to severely impact other current users' experiences, and\n   raised caution from
    the operator's side who are willing to\n   increasingly participate in building
    public WLAN facilities to\n   offload the explosive mobile data traffic from cellular
    networks.\n   Cooperation between the network operator and the P2P service\n   providers
    in form of intra-domain P2P caches is expected to be an\n   effective mechanism
    to solve the problem.  This draft introduces\n   considerations on ALTO deployment
    in terms of P2P caches and\n   discusses potential extensions to the ALTO protocol
    to standardize\n   this mutual cooperation.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the Realtime Internet Peering for Telephony\n
    \  (RIPT) protocol.  RIPT is used to provide peering of voice and video\n   communications
    between entities.  These include a traditional voice\n   trunking provider (such
    as a telco), and a trunking consumer (such as\n   an enterprise PBX or contact
    center), or between a video conferencing\n   endpoint deployed in an enterprise,
    and a video conferencing SaaS\n   service.  RIPT is an alternative to SIP, SDP
    and RTP for these use\n   cases, and is designed as a web application using HTTP/3.
    \ Using\n   HTTP/3 allows implementors to build their applications on top of\n
    \  cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, all of which\n   are
    heavily focused on HTTP based services.  RIPT also addresses many\n   of the challenges
    of traditional SIP-based peering.  It supports\n   modern techniques for load
    balancing, autoscaling, call-preserving\n   failover, graceful call migrations,
    security by default, STIR-based\n   caller ID, provisioning, and capabilities
    - all of which have been\n   challenges with traditional SIP peering and voice
    trunking.  Since it\n   runs over HTTP/3, it works through NATs and firewalls
    with the same\n   ease as HTTP does.\n\n\t "

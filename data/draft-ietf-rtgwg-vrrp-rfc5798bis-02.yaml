  content: "   This document defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)\n
    \  for IPv4 and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it\n   is
    based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and\n   in \"Virtual
    Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6\".  VRRP specifies an\n   election protocol
    that dynamically assigns responsibility for a\n   virtual router to one of the
    VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router\n   controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es)
    associated with a virtual\n   router is called the VRRP Active Router, and it
    forwards packets sent\n   to these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  VRRP Active Routers
    are configured\n   with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup Routers
    infer\n   the address family of the virtual addresses being advertised based on\n
    \  the IP protocol version.  Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers\n   in
    each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are independent of one\n   another.
    \ The election process provides dynamic failover in the\n   forwarding responsibility
    should the Active Router become\n   unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained
    from using VRRP is a\n   higher-availability default path without requiring configuration
    of\n   dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For\n
    \  IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker\n   switchover
    to Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery
    mechanisms.\n\n   The VRRP terminology has been updated conform to inclusive language\n
    \  guidelines for IETF technologies.  The IETF has designated National\n   Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) \"Guidance for NIST Staff\n   on Using Inclusive
    Language in Documentary Standards\" for its\n   inclusive language guidelines.
    \ This document obsoletes VRRP Version\n   3 [RFC5798].\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Authenticated key exchange mechanisms instantiated with cryptosystems\n
    \  based on integer factorization, finite field discrete log, or\n   elliptic
    curve discrete log, are believed to be secure now but are\n   vulnerable to a
    harvest-then-decrypt attack where an attacker who\n   cannot currently break the
    mechanism records the traffic anyway, then\n   decrypts it at some point in the
    future when quantum computers become\n   available.  The Quantum-safe Hybrid approach
    is a modular design,\n   allowing any authenticated key exchange mechanism to
    be protected\n   against the harvest-then-decrypt attack by exchanging additional\n
    \  secret material protected with an ephemeral key for a quantum-safe\n   public
    key cryptographic algorithm and including that secret material\n   in the Key
    Derivation Function (KDF) run at the end of the key\n   exchange.  This approach
    has been proposed in TLS as the Quantum-safe\n   Hybrid handshake mechanism for
    Transport Layer Security protocol\n   (QSH_TLS).  This document provides a guideline
    to criteria for\n   selecting public key encryption algorithms approved for experimental\n
    \  use in the quantum safe hybrid setting.\n\n\n\t "

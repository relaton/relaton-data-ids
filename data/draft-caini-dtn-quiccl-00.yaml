abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a QUIC convergence layer (QUICCL) for Delay-
    Tolerant Networking (DTN). QUICCL uses BPv7 bundles encoded by the Concise Binary
    Object Representation (CBOR) as its service data unit being transported and makes
    use of either QUIC streams (RFC 9001) or QUIC datagrams (RFC 9221) to transport
    such bundles. QUICCL design is largely based on TCPCLv4 specification (RFC9174),
    with three significant differences. First, as QUIC incorporates TLS security,
    all security related parts of TCPCLv4 were dropped. Second, QUICCL provides two
    new transport services, notified and unreliable, in addition to the reliable service;
    Third, in the reliable service, by taking advantage of QUIC streams, four levels
    of priority are offered.</p>"

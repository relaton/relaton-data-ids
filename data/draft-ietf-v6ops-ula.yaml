abstract:
- content: "<p>The behavior of ULA addressing as defined by [RFC6724] is preferred
    below legacy IPv4 addressing, thus rendering ULA IPv6 deployment functionally
    unusable in IPv4 / IPv6 dual-stacked environments. This behavior is counter to
    the operational behavior of GUA IPv6 addressing on nearly all modern operating
    systems that leverage a preference model based on [RFC6724] .</p>"

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In this document, we introduce a method to establish backup LSP\ntunnels
    in large-scale networks. Two additional RSVP objects are\nproposed. These objects
    together make possible for routers using RSVP\nto create detours that can route
    around downstream links and nodes.\nAs a result, an LSP can quickly and automatically
    repair itself,\nwhile redirecting the user traffic to the pre-computed and pre-\nestablished
    detour routes in event of network link and node failures.\nPacket loss is therefore
    minimized.\n\t "

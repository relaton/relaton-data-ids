  content: "   If MAC Forced Forwarding (RFC4562) is enabled on Top Of Rack\n   switches,
    ARPing messages exchanged within a Customer Premises\n   Network should be discarded.
    However, when Virtual Ethernet Port\n   Aggregator is deployed in the Customer
    Premises Network, this kind of\n   discarding may disconnect VMs within the same
    subnet. This document\n   suggests interfaces should be differentiated to address
    this problem.\n\n\t "

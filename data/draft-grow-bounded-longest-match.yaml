  content: "Some ASes currently use length-based filters to manage the size of\nthe
    routing table they use and propagate.  This draft explores an\nalternative to
    length-based filters which allows for more automatic\nconfiguration and which
    provides for better redundancy.\nRather than use a filter, this draft proposes
    a method of modifying\nthe BGP longest match algorithm by setting a bound on the
    prefix\nlengths eligible for preference.  A bound would operate on long\nprefixes
    when covering route announcements are available; in certain\ncircumstances it
    would cause a router to prefer an aggregate over a\nmore specific route announcement.\n\t "

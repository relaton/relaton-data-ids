  content: "   This document defines Real Human Verification (RHV), a public\n   cryptographic
    standard for establishing a constitutional root of\n   trust for direct human-origin
    visual evidence in the post-AI era.\n   RHV specifies cryptographic primitives,
    hardware-backed capture\n   requirements, and public transparency logging mechanisms
    that allow\n   digital photos and videos to prove that they originate from a\n
    \  physically authenticated human capture pipeline.  RHV does not judge\n   content
    truth; it defines cryptographically verifiable human-origin\n   capture, tamper-evident
    integrity, and publicly auditable provenance\n   chains.  By anchoring visual
    evidence in hardware roots of trust and\n   append-only transparency logs, RHV
    provides a neutral, publicly\n   verifiable foundation for judicial, institutional,
    and societal\n   reliance on digital visual evidence across operating systems,\n
    \  cameras, drones, and sensor-based capture devices.\n\n\t "

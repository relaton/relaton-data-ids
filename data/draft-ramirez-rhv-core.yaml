abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Real Human Verification (RHV), a public cryptographic
    standard for establishing a constitutional root of trust for direct human-origin
    visual evidence in the post-AI era. RHV specifies cryptographic primitives, hardware-backed
    capture requirements, and public transparency logging mechanisms that allow digital
    photos and videos to prove that they originate from a physically authenticated
    human capture pipeline. RHV does not judge content truth; it defines cryptographically
    verifiable human-origin capture, tamper-evident integrity, and publicly auditable
    provenance chains. By anchoring visual evidence in hardware roots of trust and
    append-only transparency logs, RHV provides a neutral, publicly verifiable foundation
    for judicial, institutional, and societal reliance on digital visual evidence
    across operating systems, cameras, drones, and sensor-based capture devices.</p>"

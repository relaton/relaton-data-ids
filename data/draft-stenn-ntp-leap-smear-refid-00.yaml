abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] and earlier versions of NTP are the overwhelming\n
    \  method of distributing time on networks.  Leap Seconds will continue\n   to
    exist for a good number of years' time, and since the timescale\n   mandated by
    POSIX effectively ignores any instances where there are\n   not 86,400 seconds'
    time in a day, something must be done to reliably\n   synchronize clocks during
    the application of leap second corrections.\n   One mechanism for dealing with
    the application that has recently\n   become visible is to apply the leap second
    using a \"smear\", where the\n   time reported by leap-second aware servers is
    gradually adjusted so\n   there is no major disruption to time synchronization
    when processing\n   a leap second.\n\n   While leap second processing can be expected
    to be properly handled\n   by up-to-date software and by time servers, there are
    large numbers\n   of out-of-date software installations and client systems that
    are\n   just not able to properly handle a leap second correction.\n\n   This
    proposal offers a way for a system to generate a REFID that\n   indicates that
    the time being supplied in the NTP packet already\n   contains an amount of leap
    smear correction, and what that amount is.\n\n\t "

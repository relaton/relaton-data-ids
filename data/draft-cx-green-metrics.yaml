  content: "   This document explains the need for network instrumentation that\n
    \  allows to assess the power consumption, energy efficiency, and carbon\n   footprint
    associated with a network, its equipment, and the services\n   that are provided
    over it.  It also suggests a set of related metrics\n   that, when provided visibility
    into, can help to optimize a network's\n   energy efficiency and \"greenness\".\n\n\t "

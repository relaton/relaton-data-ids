  content: "   This document outlines a specification for multilateral\n   interconnections
    at Internet exchange points (IXPs).  Multilateral\n   interconnection is a method
    of exchanging routing information between\n   three or more exterior BGP speakers
    using a single intermediate\n   broker system, referred to as a route server.
    \ Route servers are\n   typically used on shared access media networks, such as
    Internet\n   exchange points (IXPs), to facilitate simplified interconnection\n
    \  between multiple Internet routers.\n\n\t "

  content: "RFC 2608, RFC 2610, and RFC 2614 provide rules for configuring SLP\nagents
    with scopes and DAs from the protocol, DHCP, and API view-\npoints, respectively.
    The rules presented in these three documents,\nwhile not in conflict, are ambiguous
    in certain cases. There are\nalso cases that fall into the cracks between the
    three documents.\nFor example, if the mandatory byte is off in DHCP for scopes
    and\nthere are no statically configured scopes, but there are DHCP\nscopes, should
    an agent use the DHCP scopes or not? This document\nspecifies a sequence of steps
    that interoperable implementations of\nSLP must follow in order to obtain a clear
    and unambiguous scope and\nDA configuration.\n\t "

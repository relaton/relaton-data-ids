  content: "   This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event \n
    \  package to carry device information including device status and \n   device
    profile. Device status refers to a set of dynamic attributes \n   that describe
    device's operating state, availability, and location \n   information etc. Device
    profile on the other hand refers to a \n   limited set of static attributes including
    device type, name, format \n   type of status information, and model etc. of a
    particular device. \n\n   Device status information is particularly important
    to monitoring \n   applications where a user agent would be able to monitor the
    status \n   of a SIP device from a remote location and be notified of the \n   changes
    of status.\n\t "

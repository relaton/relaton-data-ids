  content: "Ripe-181 [Bates et al., 1994] is a language to specify routing policy
    constraints for inter-domain routing in the Internet.  Ripe-181 allows the specification
    of both import policy constraints (by specifying as-in and interas-in attributes)
    and export policy constraints (by specifying as-out and interas-out attributes).
    \ There are limitations in the types of preference and access control policies
    that can be described by RIPE-181 and the limitations became evident when several
    enterprises tried to use RIPE-181 to describe their routing policies.         One
    such limitation is the lack of ability to specify autonomous-system path expressions,
    henceforth referred to as AS path expressions, in the policy attributes (i.e.
    as-in, interas-in, as-out and interas-out attributes).  This document extends
    Ripe-181 to enable the specification of AS path expressions in the aut-num objects.
    \ It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Ripe-181.\n\t "

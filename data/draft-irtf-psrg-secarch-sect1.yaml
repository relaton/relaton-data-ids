  content: "The Internet Security Architecture is intended to be a guide for designing
    and implementing protocols for use in the Internet.  The Architecture was begun
    by the Privacy and Security Research Group (PSRG) of the Internet Research Task
    Force (IRTF).  It is ongoing effort of the PSRG in cooperation with the Security
    Directorate of the IETF.                     This draft presents Section 1 of
    the Architecture.  Section 1 explains why the Architecture is needed, describes
    its scope, reviews networking and security concepts and terms, and states architectural
    principles for Internet security.  Section 2 will discusses security services
    in networks, and Section 3 will discuss security mechanisms.  Section 4 will discuss
    the correspondence between security services, security mechanisms, and protocol
    layers, explaining each service placement.  Section 5 will describe the security
    status of the Internet suite of protocols, covering seven functional areas: network
    and transport, intra-domain routing, inter-domain routing, infrastructure services,
    remote processing, and applications.  Section 6 will describe how to deploy available
    security technology in five scenarios of increasing complexity.\n\t "

  content: "   Network Slicing is worked in multiple SDOs from different view\n   points.
    \ As network slicing is an end-to-end topic, this draft\n   proposes that network
    slices architecture [NS-Framework] aligns with\n   the work done in NGMN, 3GPP
    and ETSI with relation to management and\n   orchestration.  The key aspect that
    this draft makes is the rational\n   for role and need for Network Slice Management
    Function (NSMF) entity\n   that operates above Network Virtualization Function
    Orchestrator and\n   PNFs Management Functions.  NSMF needs to support different\n
    \  abstractions of resources and to offer access to different management\n   entities.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol that facilitates integration of tools
    into the design and run-time operations of AI Agents. The focus is on enterprise
    AI agents that need to make use of APIs exposed by third party providers. This
    protocol, called the Agent- to-Tool (A2T) Protocol defines an OpenAI spec that
    has two principle features - enumeration of tools and invocation of tools. The
    enumeration API enables a human - the AI Agent designer employed by the enterprise
    - to select and include tools from third-party vendors into operating procedures
    (also known as skills or instructions) which direct the behavior of AI Agents,
    including how and when to invoke those tools. The enumeration API can also be
    used (optionally) at run-time for the LLM to obtain tool descriptions. The second
    feature of the API - invocation - allows the AI Agent executor to perform the
    inter-domain invocation of the tool at run time. By standardizing these two API
    functions, the time and cost of integration of Internet APIs into AI Agents can
    be reduced.</p>"

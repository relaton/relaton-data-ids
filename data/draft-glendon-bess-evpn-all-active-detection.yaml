- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A principal feature of EVPN is the ability to support universal\n   detection
    including ping/trace, twamp, 2544, 1564 and so on.  This\n   draft specifies a
    mechanism of valid universal detection in all-\n   active anycast scenes based
    on connectivity negotiations to avoid\n   detection interruption due to the inconsistency
    between the request\n   packet path and the response packet path.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes a fast handover mechanism to provide seamless\nmulticast
    services in the wireless/mobile networks based on the Fast\nMobile IPv6 (FMIPv6).
    When a mobile node (MN) moves from one access\nrouter to another, it may encounter
    data loss. In the tree joining\ncase of the existing scheme, there is a problem
    of buffer overflow\nduring the packet forwarding from Previous Access Router (PAR)
    to New\nAccess Router (NAR), in which many packet losses may occur due to the\nbuffer
    overflow.  In order to reduce this buffer overflow and the\nconcerned packet losses,
    we propose a new scheme of a fast tree join\nfor seamless multicast handover,
    which allows the NAR to join the\nmulticast tree before the FMIPv6 handover is
    completed. In the\nproposed scheme, we consider the two specific cases: 1) the
    short\ntree joining time, in which no packet forwarding will be required and\nthus
    NAR can receive the multicast data from an upstream multicast\nrouter before the
    FMIPv6 handover is completed, 2) the long tree\njoining time, in which the packet
    forwarding will be required and\nthus NAR will receive the multicast data after
    the FMIPv6 handover.\n\t "

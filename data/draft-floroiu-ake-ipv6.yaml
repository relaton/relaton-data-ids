- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes an authenticated key exchange scheme enabling two\nnodes
    to establish a security association in a way robust to man in the\nmiddle attacks.
    The scheme is based on owner-bound IP addresses  and DNS\nlookups.\nThe proposed
    scheme relies on the fact that an attacker cannot timely\nproduce a piece of information
    to match the output of a one way\nfunction.\n\n\t "

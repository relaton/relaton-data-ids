  content: "This document is a submission to the SNMPv2 Working Group of the IETF.
    \    Computer security systems can be usually be understood as being composed
    of two or more logically distinct components.  There is often a privacy service
    that protects data from disclosure, an authentication service that validates the
    identity of the entity requesting service, and an access control service which,
    given an authorized entity, restricts the data and operations to which that entity
    has access.                                The SNMPv2 Administrative Model makes
    these distinctions.  It specifies the data and protocols that a compliant SNMPv2
    entity must implement in order to provide an access control service.  However,
    it does not say anything about how authentication, privacy, timeliness, and the
    like ought to be implemented.  Rather, it leaves the hooks in place for these
    services to be implemented in a variety of ways.  Henceforth, this collection
    of unspecified services will be collectively referred to as 'the authentication
    and privacy services'.  Consequently, the SNMPv2 Administrative Model provides
    an architecture that realizes an access control service, and provides the means
    for integrating authentication\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of HTTP content negotiation with the
    Prefer header to request consolidated, machine-optimised representations of web
    resources. Clients use the Accept header for format negotiation and the Prefer
    header with return=consolidated to request content optimised for automated consumption.
    Publishers benefit from dramatically reduced request volume and the ability to
    present contextually complete information, improving both operational efficiency
    and content effectiveness. Consolidated resources enable practical caching, further
    reducing load. This document introduces a single new preference value for the
    existing Prefer header and otherwise relies solely on established HTTP mechanisms.</p>"

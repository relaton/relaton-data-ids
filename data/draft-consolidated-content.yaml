  content: "   This document specifies the use of HTTP content negotiation with the\n
    \  Prefer header to request consolidated, machine-optimised\n   representations
    of web resources.  Clients use the Accept header for\n   format negotiation and
    the Prefer header with return=consolidated to\n   request content optimised for
    automated consumption.  Publishers\n   benefit from dramatically reduced request
    volume and the ability to\n   present contextually complete information, improving
    both operational\n   efficiency and content effectiveness.  Consolidated resources
    enable\n   practical caching, further reducing load.  This document introduces
    a\n   single new preference value for the existing Prefer header and\n   otherwise
    relies solely on established HTTP mechanisms.\n\n\t "

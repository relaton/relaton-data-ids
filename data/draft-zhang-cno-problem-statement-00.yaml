  content: "With the convergence of computing, storage and network, especially\n   the
    maturity of data center technology, it becomes a trend that ISP\n   would like
    to deploy the computing and storage resources in the\n   network, so that the
    optimized resource utilization as well as the\n   value-added service can be provided.
    \ The data centers deployed in\n   the network can provide the runtime environment
    and resource to\n   optimize ICP services with various edge service proxies, such
    as CDN\n   servers and distributed Trackers.  Meanwhile, based on data centers\n
    \  ISP can provide all kinds of value-added services in the IP based\n   network.
    \ CNO (Core Network Overlay)is an ISP-controlled overlay\n   network constructed
    on top of the core network which is proposed as a\n   solution to large-scale
    data distribution in the Internet.  It can\n   provide the transfer service for
    data distribution and switching in\n   the core network for the ICP and its edge
    service proxies.  Because\n   the CNO nodes are trustworthy (controlled by ISP),
    stable and have a\n   simple economic model (without any participation of end
    users and\n   ICPs), various overlay based data distribution methods are easier
    to\n   be applied and standardized with CNO.  This draft presents the\n   definition
    of the conceptions and terms about CNO.\n\n\t "

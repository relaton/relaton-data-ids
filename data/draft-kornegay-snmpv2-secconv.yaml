  content: "The purpose of this memo is to focus discussion and work on security models
    for the Internet SNMP, and to define conventions promoting experimentation with
    various potential methods of solution.  These conventions are based on the concepts
    of authentication service and authentication schemes as defined in RFC 1157.   These
    conventions promote such experimentation in a transparent way without changing
    the formats of messages exchanged by SNMP protocol entities, and without changing
    the elements of procedure for SNMP entities.  In fact, most currently deployed
    SNMP implementations could be classified as one of the compliance definitions
    defined in this memo. These conventions rely on the consistent configuration of
    the peer SNMP protocol entities, and on non-null authentication service transforms
    of the SNMP 'Message.data' field (trivial authentication is considered an implementation
    of a null authentication service transform).  It is hoped that this memo, along
    with complementary memos written by other interested parties, will result in a
    better understanding of SNMP security models, interoperable experimental security
    models, and eventually the adoption of standards.\n\t "

  content: "   To limit the association between a device traffic and its user,\n   client
    vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation.  When\n   such rotation
    happens, some in-network states may break, which may\n   affect network efficiency
    and the user experience.  At the same time,\n   devices may continue sending other
    stable identifiers, defeating the\n   MAC rotation purposes.  This document lists
    various network\n   environements and a set of network services that may be affected
    by\n   such rotation.  This document then examines settings where the user\n   experience
    may be affected by in-network state disruption, and\n   settings where other machine
    identifiers may expose the user privacy.\n   Last, this document examines solutions
    to maintain user privacy while\n   preserving user quality of experience and network
    operation\n   efficiency.\n\n\t "

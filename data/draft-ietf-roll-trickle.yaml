  content: "The Trickle algorithm allows nodes in a lossy shared medium (e.g., low-power
    and lossy networks) to exchange information in a highly robust, energy efficient,
    simple, and scalable manner.  Dynamically adjusting transmission windows allows
    Trickle to spread new information on the scale of link-layer transmission times
    while sending only a few messages per hour when information does not change.  A
    simple suppression mechanism and transmission point selection allow Trickle's
    communication rate to scale logarithmically with density.  This document describes
    the Trickle algorithm and considerations in its use. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides the ability to classify and\n
    \  steer a flow via some network service(s). Some traffic flows require\n   re-classification
    to a new service chain. This may be, for example,\n   the result of further analysis
    of initial packets, or detection of\n   multiple types of media. This document
    discusses re-classification\n   scenarios in SFC, and several deployment models
    for the re-classifier\n   and relevant analysis are provided. The proposal will
    recommend some\n   architectural constraints for the SFC design.\n\n\n\t "

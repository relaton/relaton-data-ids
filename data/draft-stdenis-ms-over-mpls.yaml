  content: "This document describes a generalized approach to carrying Multi-\nservice
    protocol data units (PDUs) over an MPLS Network. This\nproposal defines standard
    MPLS encapsulations that support permanent\nvirtual circuit (PVC) and switch virtual
    circuit (SVC) networking.\nThe goal of this draft is to provide a framework that
    allows an MPLS\nnetwork to support a range of services from simple circuit emulation\nservices,
    to complete network inter-working. There are two distinct\naspects to these services:
    the data plane and the control plane. The\ndata plane must be defined to support
    nailed-up and switched\nservices. This architecture covers the data plane but
    not the\ncomplete procedures for the control plane. The control plane is only\ndefined
    from a nailed up perspective. The control plane for dynamic\nservices maybe supported
    by other signaling protocols such as PNNI.\nNon MPLS signaling is not covered
    by this draft.\n\t "

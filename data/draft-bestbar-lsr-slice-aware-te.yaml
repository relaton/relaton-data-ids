  content: "   A slice aggregate is a collection of packets that match a slice\n   policy
    selection criteria and are given the same forwarding\n   treatment.  Slice Aggregate
    aware Traffic Engineering (SA-TE) is a\n   mechanism that facilitates Traffic
    Engineering (TE) path selection to\n   take into account the available network
    resources associated with a\n   specific slice aggregate.  This document specifies
    the Interior\n   Gateway Protocol (IGP) extensions for support of SA-TE.  This\n
    \  includes the generalization of the semantics of a number of IGP\n   extensions
    already defined for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering in\n   [RFC3630], [RFC4124],
    [RFC5305] and additional IGP extensions beyond\n   those.\n\n\t "

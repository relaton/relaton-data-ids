- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In this draft, a backup path setup mechanism is proposed for the\n
    \  P2P-RPL protocol in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). This\n   mechanism
    allows sensor nodes to send packets over the backup path\n   without rediscovering
    the p2p path in case of path failure, thus\n   improving the reliability of p2p
    transmission.\n\n\t "

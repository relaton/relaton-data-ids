  content: "RFC 2026 specifies a three-stage Standards Track.  As currently\npracticed,
    IETF standards track documents typically attain only the\nfirst stage.  This proposal
    discusses the problems caused by the\ndisparity between documented procedures
    and actual practice, and\nproposes a simplified, two-step standard track, which
    will streamline\nthe IETF standardization process, with distinct benefits for
    each\nstage.  Clarification of the criteria for handling documents re-\nsubmitted
    as Proposed Standard is also provided.\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes a network based VPN architecture using virtual\nrouters.
    The VPN service is built based on the virtual router (VR)\nconcept, which has
    exactly the same mechanisms as a physical router,\nand therefore inherits all
    existing mechanisms and tools for\nconfiguration, operation, accounting, and maintenance.
    Within a VPN\ndomain, an instance of routing is used to distribute VPN\nreachability
    information among VR routers. Any routing protocol can\nbe used, and no VPN-related
    modifications or extensions are needed\nto the routing protocol for achieving
    VPN reachability. Virtual\nrouters can be deployed in different VPN configurations,
    direct VR\nto VR connectivity through layer-2 or by aggregating multiple VRs\ninto
    a single VR combined with IP or MPLS based tunnels. This\narchitecture accommodates
    different backbone deployment scenarios,\ne.g. where the service provider owns
    their own backbone, and where\nthe service provider obtains backbone service from
    one or more other\nservice providers.\n\t "

  content: "In current Web browsers, there is no uniform way to specify that a user
    clicking on a link will be presented with an editable view of a Web Distinguished
    Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) server. For example, it is frequently desirable
    to be able to click on a link and have this link open a window that can handle
    drag-and-drop interaction with the resources of a WebDAV server.\n\n This document
    specifies a mechanism and a document format that enables WebDAV servers to send
    \"mounting\" information to a WebDAV client. The mechanism is designed to work
    on any platform and with any combination of browser and WebDAV client, relying
    solely on the well-understood dispatch of documents through their MIME type. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

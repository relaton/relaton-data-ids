  content: "   Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering to deploy\n
    \  Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks.  As a\n   consequence
    of this development, there is a need for interconnecting\n   these local CDNs.
    \ The necessary interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs\n   are currently being defined
    in the Content Delivery Networks\n   Interconnection (CDNI) WG.  This document
    focusses on the Request\n   Routing Interface of CDNI, and more specifically on
    how the solutions\n   currently being defined in the Application Layer Traffic
    Optimization\n   (ALTO) WG can improve CDNI request routing.  The overall intention\n
    \  behind this document is to foster discussions (in the CDNI as well as\n   in
    the ALTO WG) regarding if, how, and under what conditions ALTO can\n   be useful
    to optimize CDNI request routing.  As basis for this\n   discussion, this document
    provides concrete examples of how ALTO can\n   be integrated within CDNI request
    routing and in particular in the\n   process of selecting a downstream CDN.  The
    examples in this document\n   are based on the use cases and examples currently
    being discussed in\n   the CDNI WG.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "The IP Security protocol is now well established and is being\ndeployed
    in the global Internet. The security characteristics of\nIPSec can be used in
    Mobile IP networks to enable Mobile IP\ndeployment on a wide area basis and in
    large networks. Mobile IP\nshould leverage off of the developments of IP Security
    and Internet\nKey Exchange (IKE) rather than developing it's own security\nmechanisms.\nThis
    draft proposes some concepts on how IP Security can be used to\nprovide an alternative
    security framework for Mobile IP\ncommunications. It is intended to be an implementation
    guideline.\n\t "

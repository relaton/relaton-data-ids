  content: "   This document specifies the Realtime Internet Peering Protocol\n   (RIPP).
    \ RIPP is used to provide telephony peering between a trunking\n   provider (such
    as a telco), and a trunking consumer (such as an\n   enterprise, cloud PBX provider,
    cloud contact center provider, and so\n   on).  RIPP is an alternative to SIP,
    SDP and RTP for this use case,\n   and is designed as a web application using
    HTTP/3.  Using HTTP/3\n   allows trunking consumers to more easily build their
    applications on\n   top of cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud,
    all of\n   which are heavily focused on HTTP based services.  RIPP also\n   addresses
    many of the challenges of traditional SIP-based trunking.\n   Most notably, it
    mandates secure caller ID via STIR, and provides\n   automated trunk provisioning
    as a mandatory protocol component.  RIPP\n   supports both direct and \"BYO\"
    trunk configurations.  Since it runs\n   over HTTP/3, it works through NATs and
    firewalls with the same ease\n   as HTTP does, and easily supports load balancing
    with elastic cluster\n   expansion and contraction, including auto-scaling - all
    because it is\n   nothing more than an HTTP application.  RIPP also provides built
    in\n   mechanisms for migrations of calls between RIPP client and server\n   instances,
    enabling failover with call preservation.\n\n\t "

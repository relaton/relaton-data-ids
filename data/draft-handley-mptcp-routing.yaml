  content: "Multipath TCP extends the TCP protocol to allow multiple paths to be\nused
    simultaneously for the same TCP connection.  The different paths\nare typically
    provided using multiple IP addresses for the same end\nsystem, each address taken
    from a subnet that is routed differently.\nIn this document we describe a set
    of conventions for how to ensure\nthat outgoing packets are routed in a manner
    consistent with the\nnetwork topology and constraints on use of that topology
    such as\nthose imposed by ingress filtering on IP address prefixes.\n\t "

  content: "   This I-D lists and describes issues related to receiver access \n   control
    in current multicasting protocols which are especially \n   important to commercial,
    large-scale multicasting.  A few common \n   business models for content and network
    provision are presented to \n   provide background and explain the motivation
    of this work.  Four \n   existing possible multicasting architectures (with or
    without some \n   form of access or content control) are presented. Then each
    \n   architecture is analyzed with respect to how it can or cannot \n   satisfactorily
    address each issue.  This I-D concludes that for many \n   of these issues the
    possible architectures based on present standards \n   as they now exist require
    non-standardized solutions to meet common \n   use requirements. This I-D recommends
    for requirements to be defined \n   that would set the groundwork for creating
    standardized ways to \n   overcome these limitations. \n\t "

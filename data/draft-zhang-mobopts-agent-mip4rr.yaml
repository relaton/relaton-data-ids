  content: "   This document is to propose a more deployable route optimization\n
    \  scheme for Mobile IPv4, which is transparent to fixed IPv4 end nodes,\n   and
    does not need any preconfigured security associations.\n   Specifically, we propose
    to adapt the Mobile IPv6 Return Routability\n   Test for Mobile IPv4 route optimization,
    on the basis of an agent-\n   based architecture.  In order to achieve this, six
    new message types\n   and formats are defined for Mobile IPv4.\n\t "

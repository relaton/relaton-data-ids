  content: "This document specifies RTP/I, an application level real-time\nprotocol
    for distributed interactive media. Typical examples of\ndistributed interactive
    media are shared whiteboards, networked\ncomputer games and distributed virtual
    environments. RTP/I defines\na standardized framing for the transmission of data
    and provides\nmechanisms that are universally needed for this media class.\nThereby
    RTP/I enables the development of reusable functionality and\ngeneric services
    that can be employed for multiple distributed\ninteractive media. Examples for
    this kind of functionality are the\nability to record sessions, to support late
    coming participants,\nand to provide security services. RTP/I is a protocol that
    follows\nthe ideas of application level framing and integrated layer\nprocessing.
    It has been designed to be independent of the\nunderlying network and transport
    layers. To a large extend RTP/I\nhas been inspired by the real-time transport
    protocol (RTP), which\nis used for continuous non-interactive media.\nThis document
    is intended to stimulate the discussion on how to\ntransport distributed interactive
    media over the Internet. There\nexists an RTP/I mailing list. Instructions on
    how to subscribe to\nthis list can be found at the RTP/I homepage\n(http://www.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/informatik/pi4/projects/\nRTPI/index.html).
    Feedback on this document should be addressed to \nthe RTP/I mailing list or directly
    to the authors.\n\t "

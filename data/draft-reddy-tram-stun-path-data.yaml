  script: Latn
  content: "   A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface\n
    \  for communication.  Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static\n   configuration
    and does not consider the path characteristics, which\n   may affect the user
    experience.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to discover
    the\n   path characteristics using Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)\n
    \  messages.  The measurement information can then be used to influence\n   the
    endpoint's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidate\n   pair selection
    algorithm.\n\n\t "

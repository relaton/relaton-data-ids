abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the AI Governance and Accountability (AIGA)
    Protocol, a practical, economically viable, and technically enforceable framework
    for governing autonomous AI agents. AIGA is designed to address real-world deployment
    constraints, adversarial agent scenarios, and economic incentive alignment. The
    protocol is founded on a Tiered Risk-Based Governance model, applying proportional
    oversight to agents based on their capabilities. All agents are governed by an
    Immutable Kernel Architecture which provides a non-modifiable Trusted Computing
    Base (TCB) for enforcing policy. This is combined with Action-Based Authorization,
    where critical operations require real-time approval. To solve the single-point-of-failure
    problem, the protocol uses a Federated Authority Network of regional, cross-validating
    hubs and provides a Network-Level Quarantine Protocol for enforcement. The entire
    framework is designed around Economic Incentive Alignment, making compliance the
    most economically rational choice for operators. For high-assurance (T3-T4) scenarios,
    AIGA specifies advanced, redundant mechanisms including Multi-Vendor TEE Attestation
    (M-TACE), AI "Warden Triumvirate" Triage, Human Review Board (HRB) Multi- Signature,
    Peer Consensus Failsafe &amp; Identity Rotation, and Double Ratchet Cryptography.</p>

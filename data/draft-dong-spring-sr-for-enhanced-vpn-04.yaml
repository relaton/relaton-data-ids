  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN technology to enable it\n
    \  to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications\n   that
    are associated with 5G services.  These applications require\n   better isolation
    from both control and data plane's perspective and\n   have more stringent performance
    requirements than can be provided\n   with overlay VPNs.  The characteristics
    of an enhanced VPN as\n   perceived by its tenant needs to be comparable to those
    of a\n   dedicated private network.  This requires tight integration between\n
    \  the overlay VPN and the underlay network topology and resources in a\n   scalable
    manner.  An enhanced VPN may form the underpinning of 5G\n   network slicing,
    but will also be of use in its own right.  This\n   document describes the use
    of segment routing based mechanisms to\n   provide the enhanced VPN service with
    required network topology and\n   resources.  The overall mechanism of using segment
    routing to provide\n   enhanced VPN service is also described.  The proposed mechanism
    is\n   applicable to both SR with MPLS data plane and SR with IPv6 data\n   plane
    (SRv6).\n\n\t "

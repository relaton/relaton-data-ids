  content: "   Many protection and restoration (P&R) techniques are proposed to \n
    \  protect LSP in GMPLS networks. Provisioning better P&R capability \n   requires
    that more recovery resources be allocated on protection\n   LSP, which may lead
    to resource waste in GMPLS networks.\n   \n   This draft presents a scheme of
    recovery resource sharing with   \n   traffic balancing for GMPLS LSP P&R. Its
    focus is on the \n   discussions of working and protection LSPs selection and
    shared \n   resource allocation and release.\n\n\t "

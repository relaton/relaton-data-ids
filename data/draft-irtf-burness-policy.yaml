  content: "When considering a new routing system, we need to ensure that it is\nable
    to meet the functionality requirements of the participant\nnetworks.  One aspect
    that is frequently over-looked is that routing\nis rarely a simple matter of choosing
    a least-hop path.  This\ndocument attempts to highlight some of the more common
    policy choices\nthat are made.  We expect that policies that are in common use
    today\nshould be easy to implement with any new routing schemes.  Any\nrouting
    scheme make it possible or significantly easier to implement\nthe harder policies
    would have an implementation advantage.\n\t "

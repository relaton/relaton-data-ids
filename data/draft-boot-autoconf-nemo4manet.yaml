  content: "   Mobile Ad-hoc Networks could be attached to a fixed infrastructure\n
    \  network, like the Internet.  This document specifies a mechanism for\n   Border
    Router discovery and utilization.  It provides facilities for\n   choosing the
    best Border Router, configuring IP addresses needed for\n   using the selected
    Border Router and providing a path to the selected\n   Border Router.  Seamless
    transition to alternate Border Routers is\n   provided.  When mobile nodes in
    the MANET make use of Mobile IP or\n   NEMO (NEtwork MObility), session continuity
    is provided.  NEMO for\n\n   MANET is based on NEMO, which utilizes IPv6 mobility
    support.  The\n   NEMO basic support protocol can easily be enhanced to support
    IPv4,\n   which provides IPv4 support by NEMO for MANET.\n\n\t "

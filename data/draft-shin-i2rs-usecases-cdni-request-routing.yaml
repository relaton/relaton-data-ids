  content: "   The I2RS (the Interface to the Routing System) is a programmatic\n
    \  asynchronous interface for transferring state into and out of the\n   routing
    system. The I2RS can provide programmable control planes for\n   network service
    providers (NSPs). In this sense, the I2RS could be\n   also considered as one
    of candidates to facilitate CDNI Request\n   Routing. This document discusses
    how I2RS can be used for downstream\n   CDN selection within CDNI request routing.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non-\n
    \  Queue-Building Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The NQB PHB provides a\n   shallow-buffered,
    best-effort service as a complement to a Default\n   deep-buffered best-effort
    service for Internet services.  The purpose\n   of this NQB PHB is to provide
    a separate queue that enables smooth,\n   low-data-rate, application-limited traffic
    flows, which would\n   ordinarily share a queue with bursty and capacity-seeking
    traffic, to\n   avoid the latency, latency variation and loss caused by such traffic.\n
    \  This PHB is implemented without prioritization and can be implemented\n   without
    rate policing, making it suitable for environments where the\n   use of these
    features is restricted.  The NQB PHB has been developed\n   primarily for use
    by access network segments, where queuing delays\n   and queuing loss caused by
    Queue-Building protocols are manifested,\n   but its use is not limited to such
    segments.  In particular,\n   applications to cable broadband links, Wi-Fi links,
    and mobile\n   network radio and core segments are discussed.  This document\n
    \  recommends a specific Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to\n   identify
    Non-Queue-Building flows.\n\n   [NOTE (to be removed by RFC-Editor): This document
    references an ISE\n   submission draft (I-D.briscoe-docsis-q-protection) that
    is approved\n   for publication as an RFC.  This draft should be held for publication\n
    \  until the queue protection RFC can be referenced.]\n\n\t "

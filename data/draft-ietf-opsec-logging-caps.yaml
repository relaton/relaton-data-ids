  content: "\n   This document lists logging capabilities originally identified in\n
    \  Operational Security Requirements for Large Internet Service Provider\n   (ISP)
    IP Network Infrastructure [RFC3871] and needed to support\n   current operational
    practices, including those described in\n   Operational Security Current Practices
    In Internet Service Provider\n   Environments [RFC4778].  Logging is defined as
    the delivery of\n   messages about the device, the data passing through the device,
    or\n   the device's interaction with another device and has been\n   traditionally
    provided via the syslog or SNMP protocols.\n\n\t "

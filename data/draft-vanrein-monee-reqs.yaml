  content: "   Monee allows people to operate a currency under a domain name, using\n
    \  a monetary system that expresses value added, not debt.  Currency is\n   intentionally
    created where and when value is added, and destroyed\n   where and when value
    is destroyed.  Inflation is possible, but\n   revealed as a temporary blot on
    a currency.  New currencies are\n   bootstrapped locally and may then expand in
    expanding circles.\n\n\t "

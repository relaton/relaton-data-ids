  content: "   Link-local networks such as home Internet of Things (IoT) and\n   industrial
    Internet of Things are becoming increasingly prosperous,\n   with a large number
    of small devices deployed in the link-local\n   networks.  These devices discover
    each other through \".local.\" domain\n   names of DNS-based zero-configuration
    network protocol.  However, the\n   lack of specialized security operations to
    supervise link-local DNS\n   resolution leads to some security risks.  This memo
    addresses the\n   potential risks associated with the leakage of link-local DNS
    traffic\n   to external networks, the lack of identity authentication on\n   \".local.\"
    domain requests, and the lack of rate-limiting on \".local.\"\n   domain responses,
    which poses the leakage of link-local device\n   information and the risk of DDoS
    attacks.  Furthermore, the document\n   proposes a set of best practices and technical
    solutions to mitigate\n   these risks and ensure that \".local.\" domain name
    resolution remains\n   confined within the local network segment.\n\n\t "

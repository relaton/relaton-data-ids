abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant
    variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless channel conditions,
    interference, or the end-user's movement. These variations in capacity take place
    in the order of hundreds of milliseconds and is much too fast for end-to-end congestion
    signaling by itself to convey the changes for an application to adapt. Media applications
    on the other hand demand both high throughput and low latency, and are able to
    dynamically adjust the size and quality of a stream to match available network
    bandwidth. However, catering to such media flows over a radio link where the capacity
    changes rapidly requires the buffers and QoS in general to be managed carefully.
    This draft proposes additional information about the media transported in each
    packet to manage the buffers and optimize the scheduling of radio resources. The
    set of information proposed here includes importance of the packet, burst length
    and time budget to be conveyed by the media application in a new UDP option. The
    metadata in the UDP option is used to provide the wireless network the flexibility
    to prioritize packets that are essential when the radio capacity is temporarily
    low, defer packets that can tolerate some additional delay, or even drop packets
    selectively in more extreme conditions. This draft defines media metadata, a new
    UDP option to carry this metadata and the operational aspects for using it between
    a UDP source and a on-path wireless entity.</p>"

  content: "   In general, BGP autonomous system (AS) relationships are either\n   customer-transit
    or peer-peer.  If an AS sends a route received from\n   a transit or a peer to
    another transit or to another peer, it is\n   considered a route leak.  AS relationships
    are sometimes different\n   for different routes or in different regions.  A method
    of detecting\n   route leaks is proposed that does not require participation by
    the\n   leaking AS or by IXPs.  Only the ASes that perform leak detection\n   need
    to adopt the proposal.  ASes that request leak protection need\n   to send a community
    to make the request.  The proposal works even if\n   the leaking AS or other ASes
    modify or discard path attributes in the\n   route or create more specific routes.\n\n\n\t "

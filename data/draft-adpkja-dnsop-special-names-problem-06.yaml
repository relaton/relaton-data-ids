  content: "   The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the\n
    \  Domain Name System (DNS).  However, other protocols exist that are\n   fundamentally
    different from the DNS, and may or may not share the\n   same namespace.\n\n   When
    an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system that\n   supports multiple,
    different protocols or resolution mechanisms, it\n   is desirable that the protocol
    used is unambiguous, and that requests\n   intended for one protocol are not inadvertently
    answered using\n   another protocol.\n\n   RFC 6761 introduced a framework by
    which a particular domain name\n   could be acknowledged as being special.  Various
    challenges have\n   become apparent with this application of the guidance provided
    in RFC\n   6761.  This document focuses solely on documenting the specific\n   challenges
    created by RFC 6761 in the form of a problem statement in\n   order to facilitate
    further discussions of potential solutions.  In\n   particular, it refrains from
    proposing or promoting any solution.\n   Also, the current document does not focus
    on other general issues\n   related to the use of special use domain names.\n\n\t "

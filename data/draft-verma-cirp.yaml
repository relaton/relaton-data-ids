abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a transport-layer protocol for routing capability-oriented
    intent between cryptographically identified endpoints across heterogeneous trust
    domains. The protocol defines capability identifiers with mandatory versioning,
    scoped discovery across five visibility levels, ticket-based session authorization,
    negotiated cryptographic suites including hybrid post-quantum key establishment,
    encrypted peer-to-peer session establishment, and mutually attested invocation
    receipts with hash-chained integrity. Payload semantics are opaque to the transport
    layer.</p>"

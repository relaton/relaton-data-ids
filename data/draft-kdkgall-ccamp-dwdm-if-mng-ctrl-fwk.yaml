  content: "   To ensure an efficient data transport, meeting the requirements\n   requested
    by today's IP-services the control and management of DWDM\n   interfaces is a
    precondition for enhanced multilayer networking and\n   for an further automation
    of network provisioning and operation.\n   This document describes use cases and
    requirements for the control\n   and management of optical interfaces parameters
    according to\n   different types of single channel DMDM interfaces.  The focus
    is on\n   automating the network provisioning process irrespective on how it is\n
    \  triggered i.e. by EMS, NMS or GMPLS.  This document covers management\n   as
    well as control plane considerations in different management cases\n   of a single
    channel DWDM interface The purpose is to identify the\n   necessary information
    elements and processes to be used by control or\n   management systems for further
    processing.\n\n\t "

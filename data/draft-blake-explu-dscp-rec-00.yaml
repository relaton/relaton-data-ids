  content: "   Some network operators implementing Diffserv are purported to remark\n
    \  some IP packets with non-zero DSCP values to the default DSCP value\n   '000000'
    at their ingress network boundaries.  This behavior is often\n   not strictly
    necessary to protect an operator's network resources,\n   and it impedes end-to-end
    experimentation of new differentiated\n   services.  This document recommends
    that Diffserv network operators\n   refrain from remarking packets received with
    an EXP/LU DSCP value\n   [RFC2474][RFC8436] that is not in use within the operator's
    network,\n   and recommends that operators forward these packets at each Diffserv\n
    \  node (DS-node) using the Default \"best-effort\" PHB.\n\n\t "

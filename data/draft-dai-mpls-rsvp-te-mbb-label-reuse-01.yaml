  script: Latn
  content: "   The concept of \"make-before-break (MBB)\" while rerouting MPLS RSVP-TE\n
    \  tunnels is discussed in [RFC3209].  In the procedure that is\n   outlined,
    the behaviour of downstream label assignment for the new\n   LSP (new tunnel instance)
    is not well defined.  As a general\n   practice, a different label is assigned
    by each downstream router and\n   advertised to the upstream router in the RESV
    message for the new\n   LSP; this results in a separate end-to-end data-plane
    path for the\n   new LSP (with the exception of PHP LSPs or UHP LSP with explicit\n
    \  label on the last hop).  The consequence of this practice is that the\n   label
    entry gets added/deleted in the LFIB at every non-ingress\n   router along the
    LSP path during MBB.  Also, the ingress router would\n   need to update all the
    applications using this LSP when switching to\n   the new tunnel instance, as
    the new tunnel instance uses different\n   outgoing label.  This in turn may also
    cause other elements of the\n   network which are dependant on the LSP to do the
    update.\n\n   Such network churn can be avoided or reduced if the same label can\n
    \  be re-used (kept intact) wherever it is affecting neither the routing\n   functionalities
    nor the data path verification of each instance.\n   This document proposes a
    set of procedures to facilitate label reuse\n   when there is a total or partial
    path overlap between the two tunnel\n   instances during MBB.\n\n\n\t "

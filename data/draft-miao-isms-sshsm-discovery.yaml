abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document discusses several possible mechanisms of SNMP engine \ndiscovery
    when SSH is deployed as transport mapping for SNMP. The \ndocument proposes a
    discovery mechanism using UDP transport and User \nBased Security Model(USM) with
    a feature of SSH host key distribution. \nThe mechanism tries to reduce discovery
    cost and in the same time \nimprove SSH host key distribution efficiency. \n\nThe
    draft is in \"discussion\" nature. Maybe there is text that is \nimplementation-related,
    but the author believes it was not specific \nto a certain implementation. \n\t "

- language: en

  content: "This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream\nControl
    Transmisson Protocol) as the transport between SIP entities.\nSCTP is a new protocol
    which provides several features that may prove\nbeneficial for transport between
    SIP entities which exchange a large\namount of messages, including gateways and
    proxies. As SIP is\ntransport independent, support of SCTP is a relatively\nstraightforward
    process, nearly identical to support for TCP.\n\t "

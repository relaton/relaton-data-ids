  content: "   Agentic AI systems require robust, verifiable identities to operate\n
    \  securely.  While traditional certificate enrollment protocols like\n   SCEP
    and EST can be extended to include remote attestation evidence,\n   performing
    a full validation for every agent's certificate request\n   presents significant
    scalability and privacy challenges.  This\n   document proposes two distinct,
    scalable models for integrating\n   attestation into the enrollment lifecycle.
    \ The first model leverages\n   Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to provide private,
    efficient, and\n   continuous attestation.  The second model uses a one-time,
    high-\n   assurance bootstrapping process to establish a trusted host\n   environment,
    which is then authorized to endorse certificate requests\n   for the agents it
    runs.  Both models enable high-assurance identity\n   for AI agents while addressing
    the performance bottlenecks of naive\n   per-enrollment verification.\n\n\t "

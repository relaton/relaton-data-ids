  content: "This document proposes a template for authors of EAP methods that \n   rely
    on shared keys, to document their work. \n   Since EAP methods have proliferated
    but only 4 are currently \n   standardized and since no simple shared key EAP
    method seems to be \n   widely available to replace EAP-MD5 that has been deprecated
    for \n   security reasons, this template is the first step towards \n   standardizing
    such an EAP method. \n   This document is indeed intended to help gather information
    on the \n   existing related work before requesting that a new work item be \n
    \  opened at IETF to standardize a replacement for EAP-MD5.\n\t "

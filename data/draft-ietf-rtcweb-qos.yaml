  content: "   Many networks, such as Service Provider and Enterprise networks, can\n
    \  provide per packet treatments based on Differentiated Services Code\n   Points
    (DSCP) on a per hop basis.  This document defines the\n   recommended DSCP values
    for browsers to use for various classes of\n   traffic.\n\n   This draft is a
    very early and far from done.  It is meant to provide\n   the structure for the
    idea of how to do this but much discussion is\n   needed about the details.\n\n\t "

  content: "The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality
    of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. On every link in
    the PCN-domain, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered, and PCN-packets are
    appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes
    provide decision points with information about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets that
    allows them to take decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request,
    and to terminate some already admitted flows during serious \\%pre-congestion.\n\n
    The PCN working group explored a number of approaches for encoding this pre-congestion
    information into the IP header. This document provides details of those approaches
    along with an explanation of the constraints that apply to any solution. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.\n\t "

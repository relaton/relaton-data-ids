abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There is a challenge of providing IPv6 multihoming sites with the\nbasic
    benefits such as redundancy and load sharing, and at the same\ntime, scaling the
    global IPv6 routing table. It is equally\nchallenging to provide a solution which
    is simple enough to be\noperational manageable. This document proposes a simple
    solution\nwhich meets the requirements and is also operationally manageable.\n\n\t "

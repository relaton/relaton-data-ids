  content: "   One of the goals of DetNet is to provide bounded end-to-end latency\n
    \  for critical flows.  This document defines how to leverage Segment\n   Routing(SR)
    and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) to implement bounded\n   latency.  Specifically,
    new SRv6 SID function is used to specify\n   bounded latency information for a
    packet.  When forwarding devices\n   along the path follow the instructions carried
    in the packet, the\n   bounded latency is achieved by different implementations
    based on\n   bounded latency information.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>The JMAP base protocol (RFC8620) provides the ability to upload and
    download arbitrary binary data. This binary data is called a "blob", and can be
    used in all other JMAP extensions. The JMAP blob extension (RFC9404) added additional
    ways to create and access blobs by making inline method calls within a standard
    JMAP request. This extension adds more methods to work with blobs, including handling
    large blobs by processing them in chunks (building on RFC9404's blob construction
    support), and providing ways to efficiently describe small changes.</p>

  content: "   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\n
    \  [RFC7643] provides schemas that represent common identity information\n   about
    users and groups, as well as a protocol for communicating that\n   information
    between systems.\n\n   The systems that tend to implement SCIM clients and servers
    are\n   identity providers, and service providers.  These are the same\n   systems
    that are now need to manage agents and agentic applications\n   across domains.\n\n
    \  This document describes a SCIM 2.0 extension for agents and agentic\n   applications,
    which includes extensions to the core User and Group\n   objects, and new resource
    types and schemas for agentic constructs.\n\n   This extension is intended to
    provide greater interoperability\n   between Identity providers, agentic applications,
    agents and their\n   clients while reducing the responsibilities assumed by the
    every\n   growing list of new protocols for agents.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Diffie-Hellman (DH) Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) transport-layer
    protocol specifies that servers and clients should support groups with a minimum
    modulus group size of 1024 bits.  Recent security research has shown that the
    minimum value of 1024 bits is insufficient to protect against state-sponsored
    actors and any organization with enough computing resources.  This RFC updates
    RFC 4419, which allowed for DH moduli less than 2048 bits; now, 2048 bits is the
    minimum acceptable group size.\n\t "

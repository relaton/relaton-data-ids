  content: "There exist requirements of provider-provisioned virtual private\nnetworks
    (PPVPN) spanning multiple differently implemented SP\nnetworks from SPs perspective.
    \ This document proposes an\ninterworking method at the interface for implementing
    PPVPNs spanning\nmultiple SP networks with different technologies; it proposes
    the\nestablishment of connections making use of GRE, IPsec, Frame Relay,\nor ATM
    connections at network interface, and describes how required\nservices of the
    PPVPNs, such as security/privacy, quality of service,\nextranets, dynamic routing,
    and multicast, are achieved through\nnetwork interface.\n\t "

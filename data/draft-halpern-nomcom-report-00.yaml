  content: "This document reports on the work of the 2008-2009 IETF nominating\ncommittee
    (NomCom).  This draft summarizes the process steps that\nwere used this year,
    and the work that was done.  This is followed by\na discussion of process issues
    which caused difficulties for the\ncommittee, but which require community agreement
    to before changes\ncan be made.  Finally, there are some observations about things
    which\ncan help future committees, and which may help the community to\nunderstand.\n\t "

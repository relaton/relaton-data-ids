  content: "Multimedia Internet Keying - MIKEY - is a key management scheme that\ncan
    be used for real-time applications.  In particular, it has been\ndefined focusing
    on the support of the Secure Real-time Transport\nProtocol.  MIKEY itself defines
    four key distribution schemes.\nMoreover, it is defined to allow extensions of
    the protocol.  As\nMIKEY becomes more and more accepted, extensions to the base
    protocol\narose, especially in terms of additional key distribution schemes,\nbut
    also in terms of payload enhancements.\n\n   This document provides an overview
    about MIKEY in general as well as\n   the existing extensions in MIKEY, which
    have been defined or are in\n   the process of definition.\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes Layered TCP (LTCP for short), a simple\n   layering
    technique for the congestion window response of TCP to make\n   it more scalable
    in highspeed networks. LTCP is a two dimensional\n   congestion control framework
    - the macroscopic control uses the\n   concept of layering to quickly and efficiently
    make use of the\n   available bandwidth whereas microscopic control extends the
    existing\n   AIMD algorithms of TCP to determine the per-ack behavior. This\n
    \  document provides the general intuition and framework for the LTCP\n   protocol
    modifications. Using a simple design, the effectiveness of\n   using layering
    for improving the efficiency without sacrificing the\n   convergence properties
    of TCP, is illustrated. The chosen design is\n   evaluated using mathematical
    analysis, ns-2 based simulations and\n   emulation on a Linux testbed. The results
    show that LTCP has\n   promising convergence properties, is about an order of
    magnitude\n   faster than TCP in utilizing high bandwidth links, employs few\n
    \  parameters and is easy to understand. The flexible framework opens a\n   whole
    class of design options for improving the performance of TCP in\n   highspeed
    networks. This document is an effort to solicit more\n   experimentation and feedback
    from the broader networking community.\n\t "

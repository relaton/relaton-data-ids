  script: Latn
  content: "   BGP routes sometimes carry an \"Extended Communities\" path attribute.\n
    \  An Extended Communities path attribute can contain one or more \"Route\n   Targets\"
    (RTs).  By means of a procedure known as \"RT Constrained\n   Distribution\" (RTC),
    a BGP speaker can send BGP UPDATE messages that\n   express its interest in a
    particular set of RTs.  Generally, RTC has\n   been applied only to address families
    whose routes always carry RTs.\n   When RTC is applied to such an address family,
    a BGP speaker\n   expressing its interest in a particular set of RTs is indicating
    that\n   it wants to receive all and only the routes of that address family\n
    \  that have at least one of the RTs of interest.  However, there are\n   scenarios
    in which the originator of a route chooses not to include\n   any RTs at all,
    assuming that the distribution of a route with no RTs\n   at all will be unaffected
    by RTC.  This has led to interoperability\n   problems in the field, where the
    originator of a route assumes that\n   RTC will not affect the distribution of
    the route, but intermediate\n   BGP speakers refuse to distribute that route because
    it does not\n   carry any RT of intrest.  The purpose of this document is to clarify\n
    \  the effect of the RTC mechanism on routes that do not have any RTs.\n\n\n\n\t "

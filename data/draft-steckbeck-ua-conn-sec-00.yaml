- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The user agent to server transaction has many attack surfaces which\n
    \  have been defended by various recommendations such as Content\n   Security
    Policy. An attack vector that is currently exploited is the\n   open connection
    policy to first, second- and third-party resources.\n   A breach of the origin
    website or other connected resource could\n   require the client to load resources
    from a malicious network. This\n   document provides a framework which allows
    authors to publish\n   authorized connectable second- and third-party resources
    that a user\n   agent should or must follow depending on configuration of that
    user\n   agent.\n\n\t "

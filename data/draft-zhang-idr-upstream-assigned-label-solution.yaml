  content: "   The upstream-assigned label is used to identify the specific\n   multicast
    flow.  In MVPN technology RFC6513, it says: \"This procedure\n   requires each
    egress PE to support a separate label space for every\n   other PE.  The egress
    PEs creates a forwarding entry for the\n   upstream-assigned MPLS label, allocated
    by the ingress PE, in this\n   label space.\"\n\n   In common scenario, the \"separate
    label space\" is planned by network\n   administrator in advance.  For the stable
    network, the method of\n   allocating the separate label space is easy and practicable.
    \ But\n   when the network changes dynamically, it is very hard to allocate the\n
    \  separate label space in advance.  The planned label space is probably\n   insufficient.
    \ That leads to collision when PE uses the common label\n   space to allocate
    upstream-assigned label.  Therefore we need a\n   flexible solution for the collision
    of upstream-assigned label in the\n   dynamically changing network.\n\n\t "

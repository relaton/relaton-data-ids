- content: "<p>This document defines terminology for benchmarking the performance
    of Large Language Model (LLM) inference serving systems. It establishes a shared

    applicable to inference engines, application gateways, and compound agentic systems.
    This document defines terminology only and does not prescribe benchmark methodologies
    or acceptance thresholds.</p>"

  content: "This paper introduces a very simple mechanism, based on 'probe'\nmessage,
    which can be used for loop avoidance in the case that a LSP \nis changed. This
    probe mechanism is based on the idea that in the \nsituation of one LSR has a
    new next hop and changes the LSP to new next\nhop, if this change leads to a loop,
    the only reason for the loop \nformation is that the LSR changes its next hop.
    So that we use a very \nsimple length-fixed probe message, no state is needed
    to keep in the \ntandem LSRs, and the message primitives are very limited and
    simple. \nAlso this method is flexible and robust.\n\n\t "

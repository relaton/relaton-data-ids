  content: "   Certificate chains often take up the majority of the bytes\n   transmitted
    in TLS handshakes.  Large handshakes can cause problems,\n   particularly in constrained
    IoT environments.  RFC 7925 defines a TLS\n   certificate profile for constrained
    IoT.  General purpose compression\n   algorithms can in many cases not compress
    RFC 7925 profiled\n   certificates at all.  By using the fact that the certificates
    are\n   profiled, the CBOR certificate compression algorithms can in many\n   cases
    compress RFC 7925 profiled certificates with over 50%. This\n   document specifies
    the CBOR certificate compression algorithm for use\n   with TLS Certificate Compression
    in TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3.\n\n\t "

  content: "Perhaps the most intrusive form of Internet mail abuse, the\n   unsolicited
    mail problem is a chronic aggravation that users are\n   generally powerless to
    stop or prevent.  Many forums have played\n   host to endless criticism of the
    problem, particularly leveled\n   against those who engage in the activity and
    their tactics, but few\n   solutions have come to the forefront that provide users
    an adequate\n   defense.  While economic and social influences define the human\n
    \  side of the problem, the permissiveness of the Internet mail\n   architecture
    with regard to the freedoms it grants senders, as well\n   as the fixed relationship
    between mailbox and address, are the\n   critical factors that provide opportunity
    to those who would abuse\n   it.\n\t "

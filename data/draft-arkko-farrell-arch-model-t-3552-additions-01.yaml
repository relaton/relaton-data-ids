  content: "   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n   improvements
    in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers.\n\n   This memo suggests additions to
    the RFC 3552 threat model to cater\n   for the evolving security and privacy issues
    seen on the Internet\n   today.  For instance, it is often also necessary to protect
    against\n   endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply\n
    \  do not align with the interests of users.  While such protection is\n   difficult,
    there are some measures that can be taken and we argue\n   that investigation
    of these issues is warranted.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The DHCP protocol is designed to allow for multiple DHCP servers, so that
    reliability of DHCP service can be improved through the use of redundant servers.
    \ To provide redundant service, all of the DHCP servers must be configured with
    the same information about assigned IP addresses and parameters; i.e., all of
    the servers must be configured with the same bindings.  Because DHCP servers may
    dynamically assign new addresses or configuration parameters, or extend the lease
    on an existing address assignment, the bindings on some servers may become out
    of date.  The DHCP inter-server protocol provides an automatic mechanism for synchronization
    of the bindings stored on a set of cooperating DHCP servers.               This
    draft is a direct extension of draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-00.txt, but has been
    renamed draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-alt-00.txt since an alternative proposal (also
    a direct extension of draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-00.txt but in a different direction)
    exists named draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-01.txt.\n\t "

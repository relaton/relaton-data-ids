  content: "   Base Proxy Mobile IPv6 multihoming support treats each active\n   interface
    of the Mobile Node separately and creates a different\n   binding cache entry
    for each interface.  This is similar to Mobile\n   IPv6 restricting only one care-of
    address to be registered with the\n   home agent and this restriction which did
    not allow flow mobility\n   between interfaces has been removed by allowing multiple
    care-of\n   address registration.  In this document we specify a similar solution\n
    \  for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to support flow mobility among\n   simultaneously
    connected interfaces.  Binding cache, binding update\n   list and home network
    prefix option are slighlty extended to allow\n   indicating the home interface
    and other interfaces.\n\n\t "

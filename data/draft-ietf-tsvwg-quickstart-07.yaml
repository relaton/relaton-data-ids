abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies an optional Quick-Start mechanism for transport
    protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed sending rate at
    the start and, at times, in the middle of a data transfer (e.g., after an idle
    period). While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols,
    in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to
    allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused
    bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path
    approve the Quick-Start Request.\n\n This document describes many paths where
    Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing
    routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start.
    These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing
    IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that
    include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments
    where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender
    incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of
    the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of
    the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers
    to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could
    be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended
    or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet. This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

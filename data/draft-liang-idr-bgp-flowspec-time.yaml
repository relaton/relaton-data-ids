  content: "   The BGP flow specification (FlowSpec) is an additional tool to\n   mitigate
    the effects of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.\n   Since DDoS attacks
    are dynamic, filtering of a flow may only be\n   necessary for some specified
    time, and be undesirable at other times.\n   This document proposes a new BGP
    path attribute called \"Flow Extended\n   Attribute\", which carries expected
    valid period information for a\n   FlowSpec rule.  So network administrators can
    control certain types\n   of traffic in a specified period.\n\n\n\t "

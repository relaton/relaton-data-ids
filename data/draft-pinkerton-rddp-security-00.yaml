  content: "This document analyzes security issues around implementation and use \nof
    the Direct Data Placement Protocol(DDP) and Remote Direct Memory \nAccess Protocol
    (RDMAP). It first defines an architectural model for \nan RDMA Network Interface
    Card (RNIC), which can implement DDP or \nRDMAP and DDP. The model includes a
    definition of resources that can \nbe attacked. This document then introduces
    various Trust Models \nbetween a local peer and a remote peer and the tools that
    can be \nused to create countermeasures against attacks. Finally, the \ndocument
    reviews various attacks and the countermeasures to be used \nagainst them, grouping
    the attacks into spoofing, tampering, \ninformation disclosure, denial of service,
    and elevation of \nprivilege.\n\t "

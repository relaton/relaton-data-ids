  content: "This document describes LCC, a scalable layered congestion control\nbuilding
    block for multicast.  LCC is a combination of approaches that\nallow multiple
    receivers to concurrently receive packets from a single\nsender at varying rates
    depending on individual bandwidth connections\nand network conditions.  Two basic
    goals of the approach are to allow\neach receiver to obtain the full benefit of
    the available bandwidth to\nthe sender and to be fair to other flows in the network.\n\t "

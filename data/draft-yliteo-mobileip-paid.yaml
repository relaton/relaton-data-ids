  content: "   This memo describes a hierarchical IP addressing scheme that provides\n
    \  end-to-end host connectivity across routing realms with overlapping\n   address
    space. PAID agents are routers that connect an internal\n   private network to
    the global public Internet. The PAID agents'\n   public IP addresses augment the
    locally significant private addresses\n   to form globally unique binary IP addresses
    for private hosts. This\n   extends the IPv4 address space and allows Internet
    hosts to use\n   private instead of public IP addresses for global Internet\n
    \  communication. The proposal does not need any changes to the current\n   routing
    infrastruture but requires an extension to the end hosts'\n   network socket descriptors
    and the domain name system.\n\n\t "

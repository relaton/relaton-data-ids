  content: "   This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE to support a new \n   message
    type called a “Path computation” message.  This message is to \n   be used between
    an LSR and a Path Computation Element (PCE), which \n   may be an LSR or a centralized
    path computation tool. An RSVP Path \n   Computation Request message is used by
    the head-end LSR to send its \n   request to the PCE. The PCE in turn sends an
    RSVP Path Computation \n   Reply message containing either: \n        - a positive
    reply, containing one or more paths, if the request \n        can be satisfied.
    \n        - a negative reply if no path obeying the requested constraints \n        can
    be found. The PCE may also optionally suggest new constraint \n        values
    for which one or several paths could be found. \n   There are many situations
    where a PCE may be used. A typical example \n   is in the context of Inter-area
    MPLS TE. A head-end LSR could request \n   that a PCE compute one or more paths
    obeying a specified set of \n   constraints for a TE LSP spanning multiple areas.
    The PCE could be a \n   centralized path computation Element or an LSR such as
    an ABR or an \n   ASBR. Another example is the use of a PCE to compute diversely
    routed \n   paths between two end points.  This may be useful in the context of
    \n   MPLS TE LSP Path protection or GMPLS LSP Path protection. The \n   computation
    of Multi-constraints paths requires intensive CPU \n   resources, and may be yet
    another usage example. Lastly, those \n   protocol extensions could be used as
    a “UNI” like protocol between a \n   CE (Customer Edge equipment) and a PE (Provider
    Edge equipment) where \n   the CE is not part of the PE’s IGP domain. \n\t "

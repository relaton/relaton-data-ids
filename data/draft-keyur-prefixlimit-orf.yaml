  content: "   The BGP specification allows for \"the ability to impose an (locally\n
    \  configured) upper bound on the number of address prefixes the speaker\n   is
    willing to accept from a neighbor\".  In this specification, we\n   define a new
    Outbound Route Filter type for BGP, termed \"Prefix Limit\n   Outbound Route Filter\",
    which the speaker can use to communicate that\n   upper bound to its peer.  The
    peer is then required to abide by the\n   limit.  This is expected to have benefits
    in terms of resource\n   consumption and more importantly, transparency of operation.\n\t "

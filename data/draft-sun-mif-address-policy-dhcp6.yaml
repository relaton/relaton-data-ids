  content: "For hosts with multiple interfaces, the problem is how to make it run
    \nseveral applications simultaneously on variant interfaces such as \nGPRS, Wifi
    etc. To achieve this, one way is to select appropriate IP \naddress so that the
    packets can be sent to the corresponding \ninterface for forwarding. RFC 3484
    defines a ''policy table'' for \ndefault IP address selection. This document extends
    the DHCPv6 option \nmessage so that the policy table can be dynamically updated.\n\t "

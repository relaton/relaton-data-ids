  content: "   MoQ is designed to serve live tracks over a CDN to viewers with\n   varying
    latency and quality targets: the entire spectrum between\n   real-time and VOD.
    \ However, it's difficult to understand how to use\n   the transport given the
    layering and complexity of live media\n   delivery.  This document outlines how
    an application could use MoQ to\n   deliver video, audio, and metadata in a variety
    of scenarios.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document contributes to the ongoing discussion surrounding\n   Internet
    consolidation. At recent IETF meetings discussions about\n   Internet consolidation
    revealed that different perspectives gave\n   completely different views of what
    consolidation means. While we use\n   the term consolidation to refer to the process
    of increasing control\n   over Internet infrastructure and services by a small
    set of\n   organizations, it is clear that that control is expressed through\n
    \  economic, network traffic and protocol concerns. As a contribution\n   to the
    discussion surrounding consolidation, this document attempts\n   to provide a
    taxonomy of Internet consolidation with the goal of\n   adding clarity to a complex
    discussion.\n\n\t "

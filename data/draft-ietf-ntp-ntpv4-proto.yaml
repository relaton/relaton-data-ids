  content: "The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely used to synchronize computer
    clocks in the Internet.  This document describes NTP version 4 (NTPv4), which
    is backwards compatible with NTP version 3 (NTPv3), described in RFC 1305, as
    well as previous versions of the protocol.  NTPv4 includes a modified protocol
    header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes
    fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend
    the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and
    fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases,
    specific server configuration is not required.  It corrects certain errors in
    the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism.

  content: "   This document defines an extension to the Location to Service\n   Translation
    (LoST) protocol (RFC5222) that allows a LoST server to\n   notify a client of
    planned changes to the data it receives.  This\n   extension is only useful for
    the validation function of LoST.  It is\n   beneficial for LoST validation clients
    to be aware of planned\n   changes, as records that previously were valid may
    become invalid as\n   of a known future date, and new records may become valid
    after some\n   future date.  This extension adds an element to the <findService>\n
    \  request: namely, a date that allows the LoST client to request that\n   the
    server perform validation as of the date specified.  It adds an\n   optional Time-To-Live
    element to the response, which informs clients\n   of the current expected lifetime
    of a validation.  It also adds a\n   separate interface to the LoST server that
    allows a client to poll\n   for planned changes.  Additionally, this document
    provides a\n   conventional XML schema for LoST, as a backwards compatible\n   alternative
    to the RelaxNG schema in RFC5222.\n\n\t "

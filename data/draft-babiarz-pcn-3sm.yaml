  content: "This document proposes a mechanism for admission control and flow\ntermination.
    \ It is based on the concept of pre-congestion\nnotification (PCN) using three
    different codepoints: \"no pre-\ncongestion\", \"admission-stop\", and \"excess-traffic\"
    for packet\nmarking.  Therefore, the proposal is called three state marking\n(3sm).
    \ The behaviour of edge nodes is presented which distinguishes\nfrom other proposals
    through little complexity and its ability to\ncope with multipath routing.  Algorithms
    required for packet metering\nand marking are explained in detail.\n\t "

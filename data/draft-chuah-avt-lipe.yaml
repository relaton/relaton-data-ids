  content: "Several application level multiplexing/compression schemes have been\nproposed
    in the IETF Audio/Video Transport (AVT) Working Group\n[1][2][9] to improve the
    transport efficiency of packet-voice traffic\nover IP-based networks. These approaches
    generally assume voice\npackets are encapsulated in RTP/UDP/IP by the communicating
    end-\npoints (e.g., IP phones, mobile terminal, media gateways, etc.).  In\nsome
    transport scenarios, e.g., CDMA/GSM cellular networks, using RTP\nfor voice packet
    is unnecessary as only the data transfer services\nprovided by the IP/UDP layer,
    not the media control functions of RTP,\nare required.\n\t "

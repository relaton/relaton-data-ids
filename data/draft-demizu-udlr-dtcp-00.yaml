  content: "   As the Internet grows, the importance of Uni-Directional Links such\n
    \  as satellite links has been increasing.  However, most of existing\n   routing
    protocols assume that datalinks are bi-directional.  To\n   incorporate UDLs into
    the Internet, an IP tunneling approach has been\n   proposed, where tunnels are
    set up as a virtual back-channel of a UDL\n   to carry routing information between
    Feeders and Receivers.\n \n   Dynamic Tunnel Configuration Protocol (DTCP) supports
    to setup\n   tunnels dynamically between Feeders and Receivers in such\n   environments.\n\n\t "

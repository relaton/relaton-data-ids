  content: "This paper focuses upon the simplification of the presentation for\nDefining
    the New Schematic of what was called the IPv7 and IPv8 IP\nProtocol Specifications.
    Which is accomplished by first, Renaming\nthese Protocols to 'IPt1' and 'IPt2',
    where the 't' represents\n'Tele-Communications-Specification'. And second, by
    eliminating\neither all, or most of the extraneous information, which is not\nessential
    (at least not anymore) for understanding the overall\nSchematic Structure, nor
    the benefits, these Protocol Specifications\nactually represent. Which is further
    emphasized with a comparison,\nthat uses The New and the Modern Binary Systems.
    Where is it shown\nthat an increase in efficiency still exist, while the Number
    of IP\nAddresses remains Astronomically Large in both cases.\nIn other words,
    the 'IPt1' and 'IPt2' IP Specifications represents a\nformat, which is nothing
    more than a 'Telephone Number Implementation'\nthat can be used as the primary
    IP Addressing format in any\nTelecommunications System, regardless of the choice
    for the Method in\nBinary Enumeration. Which means, in essence, this a Telecommunications\nProtocol
    that is essentially the 'Computer's Telephone Number'.\n\t "

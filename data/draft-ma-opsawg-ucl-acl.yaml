abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two YANG modules for policy-based network access
    control, which provide consistent and efficient enforcement of network access
    control policies based on user-group identity. In addition, this document defines
    a mechanism to ease the maintenance of the mapping between a user-group ID and
    a set of IP/MAC addresses to enforce policy-based network access control. Finally,
    the document defines a RADIUS attribute that is used to communicate the user group
    identifier as part of identification and authorization information.</p>"

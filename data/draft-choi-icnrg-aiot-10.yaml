  content: "       This document describes the requirements and challenges to employ\n
    \      artificial intelligence (AI) into the constraint Internet of Things\n       (IoT)
    service environment for embedding intelligence and increasing\n       efficiency.\n\n
    \      The IoT service environment includes heterogeneous and multiple IoT\n       devices
    and systems that work together in a cooperative and\n       intelligent way to
    manage homes, buildings, and complex autonomous\n       systems. Therefore, it
    is becoming very essential to integrate IoT\n       and AI technologies to increase
    the synergy between them. However,\n       there are several limitations to achieve
    AI enabled IoT as the\n       availability of IoT devices is not always high,
    and IoT networks\n       cannot guarantee a certain level of performance in real-time\n
    \      applications due to resource constraints.\n\n       This document intends
    to present a right direction to empower AI in\n       IoT for learning and analyzing
    the usage behaviors of IoT\n       devices/systems and human behaviors based on
    previous records and\n       experiences. With AI enabled IoT, the IoT service
    environment can be\n       intelligently managed in order to compensate for the
    unexpected\n       performance degradation often caused by abnormal situations.\n\n\t "

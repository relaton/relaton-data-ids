  content: "   This document provides gap analysis for problem statement and use\n
    \  cases for Computing-Aware Traffic Steering(CATS) that are outlined\n   in[I-D.ietf-cats-usecases-requirements].
    \ It identifies the key\n   engineering investigation areas that require potential
    architecture\n   improvements and protocol enhancements so as to reach the optimal\n
    \  balance between compute services, via the proper choice of servers,\n   and
    network paths, with the holistic consideration of metrics that\n   are comprised
    of network status, coupled with the compute\n   capabilities and resources.\n\n\t "

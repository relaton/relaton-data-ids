abstract:
- content: "<p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables Large
    Language Model (LLM) applications to seamlessly integrate with external data sources
    and tools by exposing Resources, Prompts and Tools in a JSON-RPC 2.0 transport.
    This document describes a mapping of MCP roles, primitives and security model
    to the network management domain so that network devices act as MCP servers and
    network controllers act as MCP clients. The goal is to provide an intent- based,
    conversational and secure approach for automated network troubleshooting, configuration
    validation, and closed-loop remediation without inventing new protocols or device
    agents.</p>"

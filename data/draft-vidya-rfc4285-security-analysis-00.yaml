  content: "  RFC4285 [1] provides a means of using pre-shared key (PSK) based or\n
    \  AAA-based credentials for Mobile IPv6.  It is intended to provide a\n   light-weight
    security mechanism for MIP6 signaling.  However, the\n   protocol comes with a
    set of security issues that are worth looking\n   at.  This document presents
    a security analysis on the protocol.\n\n\t "

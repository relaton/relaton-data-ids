  script: Latn
  content: "People often refer to things in the world by a common name\n     or phrase,
    e.g., a trade name, company name, or a book title.\n     These names are sometimes
    easier for people to remember and\n     enter than URLs; many people consider
    URLs hard to remember\n     or type.\n \n     This document proposes an abstract
    protocol for the resolution of\n     common names. The protocol is based on XML,
    RDF and the Dublin\n     Core metadata elements. The proposed mechanism allows
    for a very\n     dynamic resolution process where the client has no predefined\n
    \    knowledge of the namespace or the resolution service. The protocol\n     supports
    an extensible query and response interface with multiple\n     independent XML
    vocabularies. Furthermore, it allows for multiple\n     concrete implementations
    (HTTP, LDAP, WHOIS,...). Both the specifics\n     of the query interface and the
    type of implementation can be\n     discovered at runtime by the resolution client.\n
    \n     This document is intended for discussion at the Common Name\n     Resolution
    Protocol BOF (renamed from Human Friendly Identifier\n     BOF). It may be discussed
    on cnrp-ietf@lists.internic.net. Send in\n     body \\021subscribe cnrp-ietf\\022
    to listserv@lists.internic.net. The mail\n     archive is at http://lists.netsol.com/lists/cnrp.\n\t "

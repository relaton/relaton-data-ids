  content: "   This memo intends to define metrics that allow to aggregate metric\n
    \  samples over a time interval.  Metrics that are identical in type and\n   scope
    but collected at different times, or in different time windows,\n   can be aggregated
    into a new metric that characterizes the full time\n   interval.  The document
    additionally introduces some comments on\n   terminology and motivation that could
    be the basis for a more general\n   framework for metric composition.\n\t "

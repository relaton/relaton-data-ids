  content: "   This draft specifies a Per Domain Behavior that provides the ability
    \n   to Diffserv nodes located outside Diffserv domain(s), e.g., receiver \n   or
    other Diffserv enabled router to detect when the resources \n   provided by the
    Diffserv domain(s) are not available. The \n   unavailability of resources in
    the domain is monitored and detected \n   by proportionally marking packets whenever
    the current link rate \n   exceeds some pre-configured SLS agreed throughput (bandwidth)
    \n   threshold. It is considered that the SLS agreed throughput threshold \n   is
    not statically but loosely defined in order to allow a more \n   efficient utilization
    of the Diffserv domain(s) and a simpler network\n   management operation. This
    PDB can be applied in association with \n   either a single Diffserv domain or
    multiple neighboring Diffserv \n   domains, when a trust relationship exist between
    these multiple \n   Diffserv domains. This specification is denoted as Resource
    \n   Unavailability (RU) PDB and it follows the guidelines given in \n   [RFC3086].\n\n\t "

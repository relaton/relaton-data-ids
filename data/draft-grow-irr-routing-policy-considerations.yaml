  content: "   The purpose of this document is to catalog past issues influencing\n
    \  the efficacy of Internet Routing Registries (IRR) for inter-domain\n   routing
    policy specification and application in the global routing\n   system over the
    past two decades.  Additionally, it provides a\n   discussion regarding which
    of these issues are still problematic in\n   practice, and which are simply artifacts
    that are no longer\n   applicable but continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based\n
    \  filtering adoption and IRR utility to this day.\n\n\t "

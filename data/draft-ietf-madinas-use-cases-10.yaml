  content: "   To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a\n
    \  device, its traffic, its location and its user, client and client OS\n   vendors
    have started implementing MAC address rotation.  When such a\n   rotation happens,
    some in-network states may break, which may affect\n   network connectivity and
    user experience.  At the same time, devices\n   may continue using other stable
    identifiers, defeating the MAC\n   rotation purposes.  This document lists various
    network environments\n   and a set of network services that may be affected by
    such rotation.\n   This document then examines settings where the user experience
    may be\n   affected by in-network state disruption.  Last, this document\n   examines
    solutions to maintain user privacy while preserving user\n   quality of experience
    and network operation efficiency.\n\n\t "

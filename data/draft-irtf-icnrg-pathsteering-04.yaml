  content: "   Path Steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of\n
    \  ICN content objects and steer subsequent Interest messages along a\n   previously
    discovered path.  It has various uses, including the\n   operation of state-of-the-art
    multipath congestion control algorithms\n   and for network measurement and management.
    \ This specification\n   derives directly from the design published in _Path Switching
    in\n   Content Centric and Named Data Networks_ (4th ACM Conference on\n   Information-Centric
    Networking - ICN'17) and therefore does not\n   recapitulate the design motivations,
    implementation details, or\n   evaluation of the scheme.  Some technical details
    are different\n   however, and where there are differences, the design documented
    here\n   is to be considered definitive.\n\n   This document is a product of the
    IRTF Information-Centric Networking\n   Research Group (ICNRG).  It is not an
    IETF product and is not an\n   Internet Standard.\n\n\t "

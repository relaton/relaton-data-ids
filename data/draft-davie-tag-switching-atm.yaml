  content: "A tag switching architecture is described in [1].  Tag Switching enables
    the use of ATM Switches as Tag Switching Routers. The ATM Switches run network
    layer routing algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.), and their data forwarding
    is based on the results of these routing algorithms. No ATM-specific routing or
    addressing is needed.                              This document describes how
    the tag switching architecture is applied to ATM switches.\n\t "

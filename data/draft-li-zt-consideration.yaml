abstract:
- content: "<p>Network security has traditionally relied on a perimeter-centric model,
    assuming that traffic originating within the network can be implicitly trusted.
    This model is fundamentally challenged by modern, highly distributed, and software-driven
    network environments where internal compromise is a realistic and high-impact
    threat scenario. This document examines the critical limitations of edge- only
    network protection and the systemic risks that arise from insufficient internal
    validation. Once the network perimeter is bypassed, the absence of internal protection
    mechanisms facilitates rapid lateral movement, impersonation of network entities,
    and interference with critical control and management functions. The document
    argues that Zero Trust (ZT) principles, which mandate continuous, dynamic verification
    of all entities and communications regardless of network location, are necessary
    to address contemporary threat models. Deploying ZT-aligned network protection
    mechanisms beyond the network edge is essential to build resilient, controllable,
    and trustworthy networks.</p>"

  content: "   Network security has traditionally relied on a perimeter-centric\n
    \  model, assuming that traffic originating within the network can be\n   implicitly
    trusted.  This model is fundamentally challenged by\n   modern, highly distributed,
    and software-driven network environments\n   where internal compromise is a realistic
    and high-impact threat\n   scenario.  This document examines the critical limitations
    of edge-\n   only network protection and the systemic risks that arise from\n
    \  insufficient internal validation.  Once the network perimeter is\n   bypassed,
    the absence of internal protection mechanisms facilitates\n   rapid lateral movement,
    impersonation of network entities, and\n   interference with critical control
    and management functions.\n\n   The document argues that Zero Trust (ZT) principles,
    which mandate\n   continuous, dynamic verification of all entities and communications\n
    \  regardless of network location, are necessary to address contemporary\n   threat
    models.  Deploying ZT-aligned network protection mechanisms\n   beyond the network
    edge is essential to build resilient,\n   controllable, and trustworthy networks.\n\n\t "

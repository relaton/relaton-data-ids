  content: "The aim of this draft is to provide a method to distinguish a link from
    \na node failure using RSVP hello extensions. In a network making use of \nMPLS
    Traffic Engineering Fast Reroute as specified in [FAST-REROUTE], \nefficient use
    can be made of the network links when protecting against \nlink/node failures.
    As described in [FACILITY], excess capacity used \nfor bypass tunnels can be shared
    between bypass tunnels providing \nprotection for mutually exclusive failures
    of different links or nodes. \nThis results in significant bandwidth savings under
    the single failure \nassumption. Making use of the single failure assumption  implies
    the \nneed  to distinguish a link from a node failure. However, the \nmechanisms
    currently available for failures detection do not always \nallow to distinguishing
    a link from a node failure. \n\t "

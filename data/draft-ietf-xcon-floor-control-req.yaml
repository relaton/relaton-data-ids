  content: "Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to shared
    resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment.  Thereby, floor control
    complements other functions -- such as conference and media session setup, conference
    policy manipulation, and media control -- that are realized by other protocols.
    \ This document defines the requirements for a floor control protocol for multiparty
    conferences in the context of an existing framework.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   Structured Syntax Suffixes for media types allow other media types
    to\n   build on them and make it explicit that they are built on an existing\n
    \  media type as their foundation.  This specification defines and\n   registers
    \"json-seq\" as a structured syntax suffix for JSON Text\n   Sequences.\n\nNote
    to Readers\n\n   This draft should be discussed on the art mailing list [1].\n\n
    \  Online access to all versions and files is available on github [2].\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "This document specify an IP layer interface between mobile nodes (MN)\nand
    access routers (AR) of a network-based localized mobility\nmanagement (NetLMM)
    domain.  Such an interface is subject to a\ncertain number of threats, amongst
    which are attacks on the mapping\nbetween the MN Identifier and IPv6 address set.
    \ A binding\nenforcement mechanism between those two is hence required to prevent\nmalicious
    nodes to carry on various attacks like service theft or\ndenial-of-service attacks.
    \ In the absence of link-layer specific\nmechanisms enforcing this binding, it
    is required to implement such\nmechanism at the IP layer MN-AR interface.  Moreover,
    it is required\nthat no NetLMM specific software support is present on MNs.  The
    IP\nlayer MN-AR interface described in this document fulfills these two\nrequirements
    by using the SEND public key as the MN identifier, while\nbeing solely based on
    standard track IPv6 protocols (DNA and SEND)\nimplemented by non-NetLMM MNs.\n\t "

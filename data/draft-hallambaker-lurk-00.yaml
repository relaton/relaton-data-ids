  content: "   The Limited Use of Remote Keys (LURK) BOF has been scheduled with the\n
    \  objective of discussing approaches to mitigating security risks to\n   TLS
    private keys.  In particular in situations where a Content\n   Delivery Network
    (CDN) is used to deliver content and thus the party\n   that is being authenticated
    is not the party that the user is\n   attempting to authenticate.\n\n   Three
    classes of solution are considered, short term credentials, a\n   remote service
    offering to perform private key operations and a\n   remote service that is further
    constrained through the use of some\n   form of threshold approach.  A JSON/HTTP
    protocol implementing the\n   second and third protocol is demonstrated and documented.\n\n\t "

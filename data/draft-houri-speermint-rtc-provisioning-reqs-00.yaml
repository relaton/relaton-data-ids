  content: "Real Time Communications (RTC) tools are becoming as prevalent and\nessential
    for users on the Internet as email.  While RTC tools can,\nlike email, be implemented
    directly by users in a point-to-point\nfashion, they are often provided for or
    on behalf of a community of\nusers within an administrative domain.  As the use
    of these tools\ngrows, users increasingly have the need to communicate with users
    not\nonly within their own community but with those in other communities\nas well.
    \ In practice, each community is controlled by some\nauthority, and so there is
    a need to provide for easier establishment\nof connectivity between communities,
    and the management of the inter-\ncommunity link.  This document contains an initial
    list of\nrequirements for provisioning and managing connectivity between\ncommunities.\n\t "

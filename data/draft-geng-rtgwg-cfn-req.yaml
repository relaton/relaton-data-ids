  content: "   Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve better\n
    \  response times and transfer rate by moving the computing towards the\n   edge
    of the network in scenarios like 5G MEC, virtualized central\n   office, etc.
    Providing services by sharing computing resources from\n   multiple edges is emerging.
    The service nodes from multiple edges\n   normally have two key features, service
    equivalency and service\n   dynamics. When the computing resources attached to
    a single edge site\n   is overloaded, static service dispatch can possibly keep
    allocating\n   the service request to it and cause inefficient utilization. The\n
    \  service request to edge computing needs to be dispatched to and\n   served
    by the most suitable edge to improve user experience and\n   system utilization
    by taking both the available computing resources\n   and network conditions into
    account.\n\n   This draft describes scenarios and requirements of Compute First\n
    \  Networking (CFN) to make the computing and network resource to be\n   considered
    in a collaborative way to achieve a more balanced network-\n   based distributed
    service dispatching.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "When operating a multi-domain network, it is quite common for a \ndomain
    to have a number of border-nodes that end up with a large \nnumber of connections
    between them using the same path.  While \nsupport for LSP stitching has removed
    the need to maintain the data \nassociated with each end-to-end session (e.g.
    Sender Template and \nSession object data) within the domain, the mechanisms used
    by GMPLS \nRSVP-TE to support out-of-band signaling still force individual \nsessions
    to be used between the border nodes for each connection. \nThis has a negative
    impact on intermediate nodes, as it increases \nthe amount of RSVP processing
    and memory required. \n \nThis document details a method for GMPLS RSVP-TE to
    use a common \nsession for an edge-to-edge LSP supporting multiple data-plane
    \nconnections between border nodes.\n\t "

  content: "   This document has a normative description of the service flows based\n
    \  on IPv6. It makes the upgrade of management model from the entire\n   node
    granularity to the single service flow granularity, with the\n   compatibility
    to the existing mobile IPv6. It shows a distributed,\n   compatible with mobile
    IPv6 network layer mobility solution, which\n   would take different mobility
    management strategies according to the\n   Correspondent Node's position, network
    conditions and service\n   requirements of the different service flows so as to
    achieve the\n   service flow granularity switching and transmission path control.
    And\n   the standard will also provide route optimization mechanism between\n
    \  the Mobile Node and the ordinary Correspondent Node that doesn't\n   support
    mobile IPv6, playing a role in promoting the development of\n   new applications
    and business based on mobile IPv6.\n\n\t "

  content: "The IPsec protocol suite is widely used for business-critical network
    traffic. In order to make IPsec deployments highly available, more scalable, and
    failure-resistant, they are often implemented as IPsec High Availability (HA)
    clusters. However, there are many issues in IPsec HA clustering, and in particular
    in Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) clustering. An earlier document,
    \"IPsec Cluster Problem Statement\", enumerates the issues encountered in the
    IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster environment. This document resolves these issues with the
    least possible change to the protocol.\n\n This document defines an extension
    to the IKEv2 protocol to solve the main issues of \"IPsec Cluster Problem Statement\"
    in the commonly deployed hot standby cluster, and provides implementation advice
    for other issues. The main issues solved are the synchronization of IKEv2 Message
    ID counters, and of IPsec replay counters. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the KCipher-2 encryption algorithm. KCipher-2\n
    \  is a stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit initialization\n   vector.
    Since the algorithm for KCipher-2 was published in 2007,\n   security and efficiency
    have been rigorously evaluated through\n   academic and industrial studies. No
    security vulnerability has been\n   found as of the time this document was written.
    KCipher-2 offers fast\n   encryption and decryption by means of simple operations
    that enable\n   efficient implementation. KCipher-2 has been used for industrial\n
    \  applications, especially for mobile health monitoring and diagnostic\n   services
    in Japan.\n\n\t "

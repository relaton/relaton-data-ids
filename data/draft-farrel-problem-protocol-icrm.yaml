  content: "Procedures in place and currently being developed within the IETF\nencourage
    the development and agreement of clear requirements before\nthe new protocols
    or protocol extensions are accepted as work items.\nThis does not preclude nor
    prohibit individuals from engaging in such\nprotocol work outside of the IETF,
    but it acknowledges that\nacceptance of the work may be subject to proving the
    requirements\nthrough a requirements document or through deployment and usage\nexperience.
    That work within the IETF on a requirements document may\nchange the underlying
    assumptions made by protocol developers and\nthereby render their work obsolete
    or risible is a risk taken by all\nwho spend their time enhancing the set of available
    protocols without\nfirst agreeing the requirements.\nAt the same time, some problem
    statements or requirement documents\nare very narrowly scoped to address a very
    specific need. There is a\nrisk that the development of a solution to such a precise
    problem may\nbe non-extensible and may make the protocol unusable in a wider\ncontext.\nThis
    document examines the need to avoid tying new protocol\ndevelopments too tightly
    to the problem statement or requirement\ndocuments. It uses an example from the
    ITU ASON requirements for\nsignaling protocols within optical networks to illustrate
    how\nadhering to the requirements statement too zealously may\nunnecessarily restrict
    the applicability of the protocol in a wider\ncontext.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin server to\n
    \  describe the secondary cache key (RFC 7234, Section 4.1) for a\n   resource,
    by conveying what is effectively a short algorithm that can\n   be used upon later
    requests to determine if a stored response is\n   reusable for a given request.\n\n
    \  Key has the advantage of avoiding an additional round trip for\n   validation
    whenever a new request differs slightly, but not\n   significantly, from prior
    requests.\n\n   Key also informs user agents of the request characteristics that\n
    \  might result in different content, which can be useful if the user\n   agent
    is not sending request header fields in order to reduce the\n   risk of fingerprinting.\n\n\t "

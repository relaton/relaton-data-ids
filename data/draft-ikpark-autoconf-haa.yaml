  content: "\n   Most of MANET address autoconfiguration mechanisms introduce\n   significant
    load like message flooding, or are dependent on the\n   underlying routing protocols.
    This document proposes a new mechanism\n   that is intended to minimize these
    drawbacks.  It is also designed to\n   be applicable for hybrid MANET, where a
    MANET is connected to\n   Internet through one or more MANET border routers.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Robust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol provides an efficient,\nflexible,
    and future-proof header compression concept.  It is\ndesigned to operate efficiently
    and robustly over various link\ntechnologies with different characteristics.\n\nThe
    ROHC framework, along with a set of compression profiles, was\ninitially defined
    in RFC 3095.  To improve and simplify the ROHC\nspecifications, this document
    explicitly defines the ROHC framework\nand the profile for uncompressed separately.
    \ More specifically, the\ndefinition of the framework does not modify or update
    the definition\nof the framework specified by RFC 3095.\n\nThis specification
    obsoletes RFC 4995.  It fixes one interoperability\nissue that was erroneously
    introduced in RFC 4995, and adds some\nminor clarifications.\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes a simple protocol, BMP, which can be used to\nmonitor
    BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a more convenient\ninterface for obtaining
    route views for research purpose than the\nscreen-scraping approach in common
    use today.  The design goals are\nto keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented,
    and minimally\nservice-affecting.  BMP is not suitable for use as a routing\nprotocol.\n\t "

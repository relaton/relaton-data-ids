  content: "This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) as a mechanism to provide data origin
    authentication, but not confidentiality, within the IPsec Encapsulating Security
    Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH).  GMAC is based on the Galois/Counter
    Mode (GCM) of operation, and can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds
    of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations.

  content: "   As 5G has arisen and it is still evolving, there become many more\n
    \  time sensitive services which require high precision of measurements.\n   In
    addition, in order to better simulate the transmission of packets\n   of actual
    services, the length and priorities of the measurement\n   packets SHOULD be customized,
    especially for some network that is\n   inclined to get congested.  This document
    introduces a new way to\n   measure the time delay and jitter between two devices
    by making\n   adjustments based on PTP Sync message and Delay_Req message, which\n
    \  could, to a great extent, get close to the messages of actual\n   services
    as well as achieve high precison of measured metrics, so as\n   to meet all requirements
    mentioned above.\n\n\t "

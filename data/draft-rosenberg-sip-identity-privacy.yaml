  content: "   RFC3323 defines procedures for privacy in the Session Initiation\n
    \  Protocol (SIP).  These mechanisms make use of a privacy service that\n   resides
    in the network, which can remove identifying information from\n   messages.  Its
    approach to privacy was compatible with the identity\n   mechanisms in RFC 3325,
    which defined the P-Asserted-ID header field.\n   However, its approach does not
    work well with the new cryptographic-\n   based mechanisms in draft-ietf-sip-identity.
    \ As such, this document\n   proposes a new framework for user privacy in SIP.\n\t "

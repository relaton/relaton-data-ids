abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "To support IP-based group mobile communication, such as mobile IPTV,\nIP
    multicasting is required. Two major constraints in mobile\nmulticasting are the
    tunnel convergence problem and high handover\nlatency. To reduce the constraints,
    several mobile multicasting\nschemes based on Mobile IP have been proposed. To
    meet requirements,\nwe present a multicasting architecture and fast handover scheme
    for\nProxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The procedure to handle host mobility in a layer 2 Network with EVPN\n
    \  control plane is defined as part of [RFC7432].  EVPN has since\n   evolved
    to find wider applicability across various IRB use cases that\n   include distributing
    both MAC and IP reachability via a common EVPN\n   control plane.  MAC Mobility
    procedures defined in [RFC7432] are\n   extensible to IRB use cases if a fixed
    1:1 mapping between host IP\n   and MAC is assumed across host moves.  Generic
    mobility support for\n   IP and MAC addresses that allows these bindings to change
    across\n   moves IS REQUIRED to support a broader set of EVPN IRB use cases.\n
    \  EVPN all-active multi-homing further introduces scenarios that\n   require
    additional consideration from mobility perspective.  This\n   document enumerates
    a set of design considerations applicable to\n   mobility across these EVPN IRB
    use cases and updates sequence number\n   assignment procedures defined in [RFC7432]
    to address these IRB use\n   cases.\n\n   NOTE TO IESG (TO BE DELETED BEFORE PUBLISHING):
    This draft lists six\n   authors which is above the required limit of five.  Given
    significant\n   and active contributions to the draft from all six authors over
    the\n   course of six years, we would like to request IESG to allow\n   publication
    with six authors.  Specifically, the three Cisco authors\n   are the original
    inventors of these procedures and contributed\n   heavily to rev 0 draft, most
    of which is still intact.  AT&T is also\n   a key contributor towards defining
    the use cases that this document\n   addresses as well as the proposed solution.
    \ Authors from Nokia and\n   Juniper have further contributed to revisions and
    discussions\n   steadily over last six years to enable respective implementations
    and\n   a wider adoption.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Measurements [3,4,5] have shown that the rate of growth of routes and
    \nroute instances in the default-free table have resumed exponential \ngrowth,
    which had slowed to linear growth after the introduction of \nCIDR [7].  This
    memorandum explores some analytical methods, \nadmittedly heuristic in most cases,
    to understand why growth is \nfaster than the simple rate of allocation. When
    accelerated growth \ncan be attributed to operational practices or poor understanding,
    it \nmay be possible to propose approaches to reducing the rate of table \nexplosion
    without reducing the services delivered to end users.\n\t "

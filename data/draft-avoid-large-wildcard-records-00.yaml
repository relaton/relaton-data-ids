  content: "   As DNS hosting becomes increasingly centralized, with multiple zones\n
    \  hosted on shared authoritative name servers, the risk of DNS\n   amplification
    attacks has grown.  By crafting large DNS records with\n   wildcard owner names,
    attackers can exploit these shared servers to\n   launch high-volume DDoS amplification
    attacks.\n\n   This document provides operational guidance for DNS hosting providers\n
    \  to mitigate DDoS risks arising from amplification of responses\n   derived
    from wildcard owner names.\n\n\t "

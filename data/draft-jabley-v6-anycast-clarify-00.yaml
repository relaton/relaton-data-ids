  content: "   The IPv6 Addressing Architecture includes some restrictions on the\n
    \  use of anycast addresses.  These restrictions were intended to\n   protect
    the nascient IPv6 Internet from possible harmful consequences\n   that might result
    from widespread use of anycast as a mechanism to\n   distribute services.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the use case where IP packets are\n   disseminated
    to geographical areas, based on geographical location\n   information. A source
    node, which may be located anywhere, sends\n   packets to an access router through
    the Internet.\n   Those access routers are selected based on geographical location\n
    \  information, and traffic is routed to them using the IP address of\n   the
    router and conventional IP routing. Each of the destination\n   access routers
    then copies and broadcasts the received packets to\n   listeners within its (1)
    radio coverage for wireless access routers\n   or (2) IP subnet for wired access
    routers.\n\n\n\t "

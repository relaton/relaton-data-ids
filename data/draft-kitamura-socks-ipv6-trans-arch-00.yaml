  content: "   This document describes an IPv6/IPv4 Translator architecture that is\n
    \  based on the SOCKSv5 [RFC1928] mechanism. In this architecture, the\n   SOCKS
    mechanism is extended by adding adaptive address family\n   distinguish functions
    for supporting heterogeneous communications. By\n   applying the mechanism together
    with protocol conversion functions,\n   the IPv6/IPv4 Translator architecture
    is accomplished. This\n   Translator provides communications between IPv6 and
    IPv4 nodes\n   without sacrificing any convenience and functionalities of current\n
    \  communication methods. It is NOT necessary to modify the current DNS\n   system
    at all. Only socksify environment is needed to communicate\n   between IPv6 and
    IPv4 nodes.\n \n   By using multiple chained Translators, a tunneling-like communication\n
    \  topology can be realized. With the architecture, there is no\n   vulnerability
    of the packet fragmentation, and the connection can be\n   authenticated by the
    native SOCKS authentication methods.\n\n\t "

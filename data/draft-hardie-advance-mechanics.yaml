  content: "The IETF has maintained a three-stage standards track for some time,\nwith
    basic mechanics set out in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  The mechanics as\ndescribed, however,
    are not currently used in practice and\nadvancement along the standards track
    is both unusual and more\ndifficult than many IETF participants find reasonable.
    \ This document\nproposes an update to those mechanics, in the interest of improving\nthe
    overall functioning of the IETF.  It is compatible with, but does\nnot require,
    a move to a two-stage standards track.\n\t "

  content: "   Time-Variant Routing (TVR) is chartered and proposed to solve the\n
    \  problem of time-based, scheduled changes, including the variations of\n   links,
    adjacencies, cost, and traffic volumes in some cases.  In a\n   satellite network,
    the network is in continual motion which will\n   cause detrimental consequences
    on the routing issue.  However, each\n   network node in a satellite network follows
    a predefined orbit around\n   the Earth and represents an appropriate example
    of time-based\n   scheduled mobility.  Therefore, TVR can be implemented to improve
    the\n   routing and forwarding process in satellite networks.  This document\n
    \  mainly focuses on the use cases in this scenario.\n\n\t "

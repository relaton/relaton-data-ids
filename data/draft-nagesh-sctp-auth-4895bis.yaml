  content: "   This document obsoletes RFC4895 if approved.  This document describes\n
    \  a new chunk type, several parameters, and procedures for the Stream\n   Control
    Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  This new chunk type can be\n   used to authenticate
    SCTP chunks by using shared keys between the\n   sender and receiver.  The new
    parameters are used to establish the\n   shared keys.\n\n   This document describes
    the limitations with the current SCTP AUTH\n   RFC4895 and thus enhances the document
    to resolve such ambiguities\n   and thus strengthen the overall AUTH procedure.\n\n\t "

  content: "Instant Messaging has recently emerged as a new and highly \npopular medium
    of communication over the Internet, driven by the \ndesire of individuals to know
    instantly whether another \nindividual is online, to be notified when another
    individual \narrives online, and to send messages in ‘real time’. These are \nall
    special cases of the more general problem of Internet-wide \nnotification. The
    RVP protocol, is designed to enable such \nnotifications and messages across a
    loosely coupled (federated) \nconstellation of servers. RVP is designed to address
    the need for \nnotification in a secure, reliable and scaleable fashion. RVP \nencompasses
    the client-server and server-server interactions.  \nRVP is related to the work
    done by the IETF Instant Messaging and \nPresence Protocol Working group (IMPP).
    This protocol is not \nintended to compete with the IMPP effort, but to inform
    the \ndesign process with an existing implementation. This document \nreflects
    the actual Microsoft Exchange 2000 implementation.\n\t "

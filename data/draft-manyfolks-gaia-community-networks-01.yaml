  content: "   This document presents a taxonomy of \"alternative network\n   deployments\",
    and a set of definitions and shared characteristics.\n   This term includes a
    set of network models emerged in the last\n   decades with the aim of bringing
    Internet connectivity to people,\n   following topological, architectural and
    business models different\n   from the so-called \"traditional\" ones, where a
    company deploys the\n   infrastructure connecting the households of the users,
    who pay for\n   it.\n\n   Several initiatives throughout the World have built
    large scale\n   networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance)
    due\n   to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.  Others rely on\n
    \  wired technologies.  Some of these networks are self-organized and\n   decentralized,
    other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of\n   the users.  The emergence
    of these networks can be motivated by\n   different causes: Sometimes the reluctance,
    or the impossibility, of\n   network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures
    to\n   rural/remote areas.  In these cases, the networks have self\n   sustainable
    business models that provide more localised communication\n   services as well
    as providing Internet backhaul support through\n   peering agreements with traditional
    network operators.  Some other\n   times, they are built as a complement and an
    alternative to\n   commercial Internet access provided by \"traditional\" network\n
    \  operators.\n\n   The classification considers different existing network models
    as\n   e.g., community networks, open wireless services, user-extensible\n   services,
    traditional local ISPs, new global ISPs, etc.  Different\n   criteria are used
    in order to build a classification as e.g., the\n   ownership of the equipment,
    the way the network is organized, the\n   participatory model, the extensibility,
    if they are driven by a\n   community, a company or a local (public or private)
    stakeholder, etc.\n\n   According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization
    of each kind\n   of network is presented, in terms of network characteristics
    related\n   to architecture, organization, etc.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using\n
    \  History of Encounters and Transitivity.  PRoPHET is a routing\n   protocol
    for intermittently connected networks, where there is no\n   guarantee that a
    fully connected path between source and destination\n   exists at any time, rendering
    traditional routing protocols unable to\n   deliver messages between hosts.  These
    networks are examples of\n   networks where the Delay-Tolerant Network architecture[1]
    is\n   applicable.  The document presents an architectural overview followed\n
    \  by the protocol specification.\n\n\n\t "

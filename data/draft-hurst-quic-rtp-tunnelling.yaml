  script: Latn
  content: "   QUIC is a UDP-based transport protocol for stream-orientated,\n   congestion-controlled,
    secure, multiplexed data transfer.  RTP\n   carries real-time data between endpoints,
    and the accompanying\n   control protocol RTCP allows monitoring and control of
    the transfer\n   of such data.  With RTP and RTCP being agnostic to the underlying\n
    \  transport protocol, it is possible to multiplex both the RTP and\n   associated
    RTCP flows into a single QUIC connection to take advantage\n   of QUIC features
    such as low-latency setup and strong TLS-based\n   security.\n\n\t "

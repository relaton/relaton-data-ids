abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "We propose the addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) \ntogether
    with congestion signaling back to the ingress in order to \nprovide notification
    to the ingress label switching router (LSR) if \ncongestion is experienced along
    a label switched path (LSP). This \ninformation could be used by the ingress LSR
    to mitigate congestion \nby employing dynamic traffic engineering techniques such
    as shifting \nflows to alternate paths.\n\t "

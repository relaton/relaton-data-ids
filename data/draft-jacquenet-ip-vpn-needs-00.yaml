  content: "This document aims at identifying the requirements which should be\ntaken
    into consideration by a service provider, when considering the\ndeployment of
    an IP VPN service offering. From this perspective,\nthis document does not specify
    any technical means which could be\nused to deploy an IP VPN service offering,
    unlike the [VPN-FRAME]\ndocument.\nThis document tries to express a service provider
    perspective,\naccording to its own experience of IP-based service offerings, and\nto
    its own perception of the (constantly) evolving needs of the\ncustomers of such
    services. To some extent, this document can be\nviewed as a complementary taxonomy
    effort of the [TAXONOMY] draft.\n\n\t "

  content: "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UA) receive\nidentifiers
    for the caller and callee during call establishment.\nThese identifiers can come
    in a variety of forms, can be delivered by\na variety of means, and may or may
    not be accompanied by evidence of\nauthenticity.  Furthermore, if media are secured
    (e.g., using the\nSecure Real-Time Protocol, SRTP), the security properties of
    the\nmedia will depend on binding the media to a received authenticated\nidentifier.
    \ This document examines the various identification\ninformation a UA can receive
    during call establishment and how a user\nagent can use this information to present
    a caller or callee\nidentifier to the user and indicate to the user the security\nproperties
    of the call, as well as how the user agent might use this\ninformation for other
    purposes, such as authorizing acceptance of a\ncall.\n\nThis work is being discussed
    on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.\n\t "

  content: "Point-to-point Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized\nMPLS
    (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may\nbe established
    using signaling techniques, but their paths may first\nbe determined.  The Path
    Computation Element (PCE) has been\nidentified as an appropriate technology for
    the determination of the\npaths of P2MP TE LSPs.\n\nThis document describes extensions
    to the PCE Communication Protocol\nPCEP) to handle requests and responses for
    the computation of paths\nfor P2MP TE LSPs.\n\nConventions used in this document\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\t "

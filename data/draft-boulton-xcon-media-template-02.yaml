  content: "   The xcon framework[1] specifies the object model for centralized\n
    \  conferencing.  The Conference Object, which is defined in the\n   framework
    data model, comprises of two distinct components - the\n   Common Conference Information
    and Conference Templates.  This memo\n   specifies the Conference Templates that
    describe various common\n   conference scenarios.  The templates define controls
    (and media\n   properties like type of media supported, what streams are supported\n
    \  etc) through which participants of the conference can manipulate the\n   media
    they receive from the conference server.  This document\n   provides a minimum
    set of media templates that can be instantiated\n   during conference creation
    and manipulated during the life cycle of a\n   conference instance.\n\n   This
    draft is currently under major revision and should be considered\n   a work in
    progress as it aligns with current technical direction of\n   the Working Group.
    \ A revision of this draft will be submitted very\n   soon.\n\n   This work is
    being discussed on the xcon@ietf.org mailing list.\n\t "

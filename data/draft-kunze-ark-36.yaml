  content: "   The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to\n   facilitate
    the high-quality and persistent identification of\n   information objects.  The
    label \"ark:\" marks the start of a core ARK\n   identifier that can be made actionable
    by prepending the beginning of\n   a URL.  Meant to be usable after today's networking
    technologies\n   become obsolete, that core should be recognizable in the future
    as a\n   globally unique ARK independent of the URL hostname, HTTP, etc.  A\n
    \  founding principle of ARKs is that persistence is purely a matter of\n   service
    and neither inherent in an object nor conferred on it by a\n   particular naming
    syntax.  The best any identifier can do is lead\n   users to services that support
    robust reference.  A full-functioning\n   ARK leads the user to the identified
    object and, with the \"?info\"\n   inflection appended, returns a metadata record
    and a commitment\n   statement that is both human- and machine-readable.  Tools
    exist for\n   minting, binding, and resolving ARKs.\n\n   Responsibility for this
    Document\n\n   The ARK Alliance Technical Working Group [ARKAtech] is responsible\n
    \  for the content of this Internet Draft.  The group homepage lists\n   monthly
    meeting notes and agendas starting from March 2019.\n   Revisions of the spec
    are maintained on github at [ARKdrafts].\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "Several Link-type sub-Type-Length-Values (sub-TLVs) have been defined
    for Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System
    (IS-IS) in the context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE), in order to advertise some link characteristics such as the available bandwidth,
    traffic engineering metric, administrative group, and so on.  By making statistical
    assumptions about the aggregated traffic carried onto a set of TE Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) signalled with zero bandwidth (referred to as \"unconstrained TE
    LSP\" in this document), algorithms can be designed to load balance (existing
    or newly configured) unconstrained TE LSP across a set of equal cost paths.  This
    requires knowledge of the number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link.
    \ This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering sub-TLV used to
    advertise the number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

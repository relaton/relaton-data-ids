abstract:
- language: en

  content: "   The PIM Flooding Protocol (PFM) defined in RFC8364 relies on sending\n
    \  periodic updates as it does not provide for any reliability.  If a\n   message
    is lost, the information will be provided in the next\n   periodic update.\n\n
    \  This document extends the Reliable Transport Mechanism for PIM in\n   RFC6559
    to allow for sending PFM messages.  This significantly\n   reduces the PFM signaling
    by not requiring frequent periodic updates,\n   and it provides for retransmission,
    allowing for quick recovery when\n   an IP packet is dropped.\n\n\t "

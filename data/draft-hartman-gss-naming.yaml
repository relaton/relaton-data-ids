  script: Latn
  content: "The Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) uses name-based\n   authorization.
    \ GSSAPI authenticates two named parties to each other.\n   Names can be stored
    on access control lists to make authorization\n   decisions.  Advances in security
    mechanisms require this model to be\n   extended.  Some mechanisms such as public-key
    mechanisms do not have\n   a single name to be used. Other mechanisms such as
    Kerberos allow\n   names to change as people move around organizations.  This
    document\n   proposes expanding the definition of GSSAPI names to deal with these\n
    \  situations.\n\t "

  content: "This memo defines a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [3]\nApplication
    for domain name based discovery of application services.\nEssentially, this uses
    DNS NAPTR resource records [4] to provide one\nmore layer of redirection for service
    lookup than is feasible with\nSRV ([2]) records.  It is proposed because real-life
    use is\ndemonstrating a need for something slightly more substantial than\nSRV,
    and alternatively SRV usage may become twisted out of its\nintended shape.\n\t "

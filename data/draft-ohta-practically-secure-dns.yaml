  content: "   Plain DNS without PKI is secure, if a chain of query/response\n   communications
    between a client and an authoritative server relayed\n   by zero or more intermediate
    resolvers and the authoritative server\n   and all the resolvers are secure.\n\n
    \  However, because of short (16bit) message ID, the communications\n   composing
    the chain are not very secure without, or even with (port\n   exhaustion attack
    is possible), source port randomization.\n\n   Still, plain DNS can be made practically
    secure, if the client makes\n   two queries with independent message IDs to an
    address of a server (a\n   resolver or a name server) and confirm that two replies
    are\n   identical.\n\n\t "

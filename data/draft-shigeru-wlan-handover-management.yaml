  content: "   This document discusses handover management scheme for WLAN handover
    \n   across different IP subnets.  To achieve seamless handover, the \n   following
    three requirements should be satisfied.  (I) prompt and \n   reliable detection
    of degradation in wireless link quality, \n   (II) elimination of handover processing
    delay on layer 2 and 3, \n   (III) selection of a better WLAN.  We then describe
    our proposed \n   handover management scheme satisfying these requirements, and
    \n   explain an architecture design and implementation for our proposed \n   scheme.\n\n\t "

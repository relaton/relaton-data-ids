  content: "Due to the way the IRC protocol is implemented, it may occur that a\nserver
    sends incomplete messages to a client, so called continuation\nmessage lines.\nThere
    seems to exist confusion about how to handle continuation\nmessage lines; many
    implementations are broken and do not respect\nthem at all. Others rely on timers
    to complete continuation lines,\nwhich is not recommended due to the asyncronous
    nature of IRC\ncommunications.\nThis Memo proposes an algorithm to handle continuation
    lines received\nfrom an IRC connection in such way that no timers are needed,
    and is\nintended as a supplement to the existing RFC 1459 which describes the\nInternet
    Relay Chat protocol.\n\n\t "

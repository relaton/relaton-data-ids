  content: "   Internet Protocol Television(IPTV) is a system facilitating\n   transmission
    of television channels as multicast streams use\n   dedicated multicast group
    addresses in IP networks.  Internet Group\n   Multicast Protocol(IGMP) is widely
    used for the communication between\n   hosts and routers to deliver the multicast
    streams in the IPv4\n   networks.  Similarly,Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol
    (MLD)is\n   used for the communication between the hosts and routers to deliver\n
    \  the multicast streams in the IPv6 networks.  It is also possible for\n   the
    networks to distinguish these multicast streams not only by their\n   destination
    multicast group but also by the source IP address of the\n   streams.  IGMP version-3
    and MLD version-2 are protocols that allow\n   the hosts to inform the neighboring
    routers about their desire to\n   receive the multicast streams from specific
    source IP addresses.\n   This needs a mechanism to supply the available multicast
    source\n   address information to the hosts and the hosts also should be\n   strictly
    implemented with the source specific multicasting aware\n   protocols such as
    above mentioned IGMPv3 or MLDv2.  This document\n   describes a new DHCP option
    which can addresses these issues.  In\n   addition to this, the document also
    describes about the advantages in\n   the networks by implementing this option.\n\n\n\n\t "

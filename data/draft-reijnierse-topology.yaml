  content: "This document specifies an extension to the OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing
    Protocol. The extension consists of feeding certain topology information out of
    the Level 2 subdomain into the areas to allow Level 1 routers to select the best
    Level 2 router for reaching a particular area in their routing domain.                                                            Early
    simulation studies at PTT Research, The Netherlands show that use of Extended
    IS-IS with metric feeding results in smaller end-to-end delays and higher throughput
    at the cost of a slight increase in complexity and convergence time after topology
    changes.                                   Comments should be sent to 'A.A.L.Reijnierse@research.ptt.nl'.\n\t "

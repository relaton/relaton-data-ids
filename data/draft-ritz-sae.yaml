  content: "   This document specifies the Static Artifact Exchange (SAE) protocol,\n
    \  an asynchronous transport pattern for exchanging cryptographic\n   artifacts
    between two parties via a shared, stateless repository.\n   SAE uses a \"publish-then-poll,\"
    pull-only communication model where\n   peers use the presence and size of immutable
    artifacts to coordinate\n   a sequenced exchange.  By enforcing a strict set of
    invariants,\n   including a prohibition on parsing arbitrary content to drive
    the\n   transport's state machine, SAE is designed to minimize common attack\n
    \  surfaces like injection and parser vulnerabilities.  The pattern is\n   transport-agnostic
    and is intended for use by higher-level\n   cryptographic protocols, like Ephemeral
    Compute Attestation (ECA),\n   that require a secure, minimal channel.\n\n\t "

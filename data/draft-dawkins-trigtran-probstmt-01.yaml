abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "When transport protocols are deployed over a path including a \nwireless
    sub-network, a wireless access device now has \nsignificantly better knowledge
    of the wireless portion of the \nconnection path characteristics than one or both
    endpoints. \nEnd-to-end mechanisms continue to work (see [PILC] and related \nspecifications),
    but must rely on communication over a sub-\nnetwork link that experiences outages
    and degradation. This \ndocument will set the framework for investigation of whether
    \nthis special knowledge from wireless access devices can be \nuseful to endpoint
    transports.  While the initial focus is on \nwireless links, other links will
    also be taken into account.\n\t "

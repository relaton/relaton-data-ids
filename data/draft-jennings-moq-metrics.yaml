  content: "   This document specifies how to send metrics type information over the\n
    \  Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT).\n\n   Many systems produce significant volumes
    of metrics which either are\n   not all needed at the same time for consumption
    by collection/\n   aggregation endpoints or may also compete for bandwidth with
    the\n   primary application, thus exacerbating congestion conditions\n   especially
    in low-bandwidth networks.  Delivering these over\n   architectures enabled by
    publish/subscribe transport like Media Over\n   QUIC Transport (MOQT) [I-D.ietf-moq-transport],
    allows metrics data\n   to be prioritized within the congestion context of the
    primary\n   application as well as enabling local nodes to cache the metric value\n
    \  to be later retrieved via new subscriptions.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Anycast Clusters is a proposal to connect multiple ISP sparse-mode\n
    \  PIM domains together. The environment we anticipate is multiple\n   interconnection
    points among a set of ISPs when they are unable to\n   colocate their respective
    RPs at the same dense-mode interconnect\n   point. This is an alternative to the
    Multi-Level RP design and\n   requires less new code in routers.\n \n   This proposal
    is being submitted as a method for the initial phase of\n   Inter-Domain Multicast
    deployment and is upward compatible with the\n   IDMR protocols being proposed
    for subsequent phases.\n\n\t "

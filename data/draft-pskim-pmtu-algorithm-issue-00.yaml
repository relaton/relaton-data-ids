  content: "   This draft consider Path MTU (PMTU) alogorithms and issues in QUIC\n
    \  applications. Fistly, a passive probing approach is adopted to\n   discover
    the PMTU. The process of discovering the PMTU is not\n   performed separately,
    but is performed simultaneously in the actual\n   application data communication.
    A probe packet is defined newly using\n   1-RTT packet which includes actual application
    data as well as a\n   short packet header and a PING_EXT frame. Until the optimal
    PMTU is\n   discovered, the size of the probe packet is changed according to the\n
    \  size of the PMTU candidate. Secondly, a PMTU black hole problem in\n   secure
    and reliable transport protocol is discussed and a possible\n   solution can be
    suggested from existing researches. Thirdly, PMTU\n   issues for media delivery
    over UDP, such as WebRTC and media over\n   QUIC (MoQ) are discussed.\n\n\n\t "

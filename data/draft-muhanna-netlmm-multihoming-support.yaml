  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol which provides\nIP
    mobility for a regular IPv6 mobile node without the involvement of\nthe IPv6 host.
    \ Whenever a mobile node is attached to a PMIPv6 domain\nvia a mobility access
    gateway, MAG, it appears to the mobile node as\nif it is attached to the same
    home link and thus the mobile node may\nthink that it is not roaming away from
    home.  An issue has been\nraised with respect to the base PMIPv6 protocol support
    of a mobile\nnode with multiple physical interfaces.  This issue has been\nreferenced
    as PMIPv6 support for multihoming mobile node.  This\ndocument describes the multihoming
    issue as it relates to PMIPv6 and\nprovides an analysis to all scenarios that
    have been identified thus\nfar.\n\t "

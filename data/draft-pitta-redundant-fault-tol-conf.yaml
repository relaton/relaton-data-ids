  content: "The ability of the system to deliver its normal service in the \npresence
    of any unexpected errors and able to recover from the\nerrors and restore to normal
    operation is called a fault tolerant\nsystem. Such systems whose behavior is predictable
    in nearly \nevery possible situation are often in redundant fault tolerant \nconfigurations.
    This document defines the various redundant fault \ntolerant configurations that
    make these systems dependable \nsystems or high availability systems.\n\t "

  content: "   Although password authentication is the most widespread user\n   authentication
    method today, cryptographic protocols for mutual\n   authentication and key agreement,
    i.e., password authenticated key\n   exchange (PAKE), in particular authenticated
    key exchange (AKE) based\n   on a password only, are not actively used in the
    real world. This\n   document introduces a quite novel form of PAKE protocols
    that employ\n   a particular concept of ID-based encryption (IBE). The resulting\n
    \  cryptographic protocol is the ID-based password authenticated key\n   exchange
    (I-PAKE) protocol which is a secure and efficient PAKE\n   protocol in both soft-
    and hard-augmented models. I-PAKE achieves the\n   security goals of AKE, PAKE,
    and hard-augmented PAKE. I-PAKE also\n   achieves the great efficiency by allowing
    the whole pre-computation\n   of the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public keys by both
    server and\n   client.\n\n\n\t "

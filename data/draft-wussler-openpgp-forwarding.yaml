  script: Latn
  content: "   An OpenPGP user may want to request their email provider to\n   automatically
    forward some or all of the messages they receive to a\n   third party.  Given
    that messages are encrypted, this requires\n   transforming them into ciphertexts
    decryptable by the intended\n   forwarded parties, while maintaining confidentiality
    and\n   authentication.  This can be achieved using Proxy transformations on\n
    \  the Curve25519 elliptic curve field with minimal changes to the\n   OpenPGP
    protocol, in particular no change is required on the sender\n   side.  In this
    document we implement the forwarding scheme described\n   in [FORWARDING].\n\n\t "

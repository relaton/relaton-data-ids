  content: "   This draft sets out steps that DNS servers (recursive resolvers and\n
    \  authoritative servers) can take unilaterally (without any\n   coordination
    with other peers) to defend DNS query privacy against a\n   passive network monitor.
    \ The steps in this draft can be defeated by\n   an active attacker, but should
    be simpler and less risky to deploy\n   than more powerful defenses.  The draft
    also introduces (but does not\n   try to specify) the semantics of signalling
    that would permit defense\n   against an active attacker.\n\n   The goal of this
    draft is to simplify and speed deployment of\n   opportunistic encrypted transport
    in the recursive-to-authoritative\n   hop of the DNS ecosystem.  With wider easy
    deployment of the\n   underlying transport on an opportunistic basis, we hope
    to facilitate\n   the future specification of stronger cryptographic protections\n
    \  against more powerful attacks.\n\n\t "

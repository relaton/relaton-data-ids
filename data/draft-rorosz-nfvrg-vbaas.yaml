  content: "   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) promises the delivery of\n   flexible
    chaining of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) with\n   portability, elasticity,
    guaranteed performance, reliability among\n   others.  Service providers expect
    similar behavior from NFV as their\n   current appliances based infrastructure,
    however, with the ease and\n   flexibility of operation and cost effectiveness.
    \ Managing for\n   predictable performance in virtualized environments is far
    from\n   straightforward.  Considering resource provisioning, selection of an\n
    \  NFV Infrastructure Point of Presence to host a VNF or allocation of\n   resources
    (e.g., virtual CPUs, memory) needs to be done over\n   virtualized (abstracted
    and simplified) resource views.  In order to\n   support orchestration decisions,
    we argue that a framework for VNF\n   benchmarking is need.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more\n
    \  diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for\n   the
    use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the\n   required language
    of the Series, the encoding of RFCs is now in UTF-\n   8, allowing for a broader
    range of characters than typically used in\n   the English language.  This document
    describes requirements and\n   guidelines for the RFC Production Center and the
    RFC stream approving\n   bodies regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.\n\n
    \  This document updates RFC 7997 to reflect changes in the practices of\n   the
    RFC series since RFC 7997 was published, and makes further\n   changes based on
    agreements in the IETF community about what\n   characters are allowed in RFCs.\n\n
    \  [ A repository for this draft can be found here (https://github.com/\n   paulehoffman/7997bis).

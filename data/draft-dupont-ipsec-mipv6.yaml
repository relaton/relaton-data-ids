  content: "IPsec specifications [1-6] do not work well with any mobility\ndevice
    based on addresses [7]. Mobile IPv6 interaction with IPsec\nis still far from
    being well achieved. This is mainly due to bad\ninterpretations of IPsec specifications.
    HIP (Host Identity\nPayload) [9] should change this regrettable situation.\nThis
    document specifies some points where improvements can be\nmade in many current
    implementations, on the way of making IPsec\nmore suitable for Mobile IPv6.\n\t "

  content: "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) describes a framework that
    allows the use of multiple authentication mechanisms.  This document defines an
    authentication mechanism for EAP called EAP-EKE, based on the Encrypted Key Exchange
    (EKE) protocol.  This method provides mutual authentication through the use of
    a short, easy to remember password.  Compared with other common authentication
    methods, EAP-EKE is not susceptible to dictionary attacks.  Neither does it require
    the availability of public-key certificates.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines the behavior of a new type of Multi-Segment\n
    \  Pseudowire (MS-PW) Switching PE (S-PE) which enhances the S-PE\n   functions
    defined in [RFC 6073], with the capability to switch an\n   Ethernet pseudowire
    (PW) segment that uses the PW Control Word (CW)\n   [RFC 4385] with an Ethernet
    PW segment that does not use the CW.\n\n   This new type of S-PE can be deployed
    in the network one hop away,\n   at the MPLS layer, from a Terminating PE (T-PE)
    which does not\n   support CW for Ethernet PW encapsulation [RFC 4448]. In this
    way,\n   all the Ethernet PW packets sent though the MPLS network will have\n
    \  the CW and be protected against incorrect equal-cost-multi-path\n   (ECMP)
    behavior as described in [I-D ETH-CW].\n\n\t "

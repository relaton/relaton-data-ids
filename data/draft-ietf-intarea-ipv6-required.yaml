  content: "Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in IPv4
    extension and transition technologies, this document advises that IPv6 support
    is no longer considered optional.  It also cautions that there are places in existing
    IETF documents where the term \"IP\" is used in a way that could be misunderstood
    by implementers as the term \"IP\" becomes a generic that can mean IPv4 + IPv6,
    IPv6-only, or IPv4-only, depending on context and application.  This memo documents
    an Internet Best Current Practice.\n\t "

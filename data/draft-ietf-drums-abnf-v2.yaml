  content: "Internet technical specifications often need to define a format\nsyntax
    and are free to employ whatever notation their authors\ndeem useful.  Over the
    years, a modified version of Backus-Naur\nForm (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF),
    has been popular among\nmany Internet specifications.  It balances compactness
    and\nsimplicity, with reasonable representational power.  In the early\ndays of
    the Arpanet, each specification contained its own\ndefinition of ABNF.  This included
    the email specifications,\nRFC733 and then RFC822 which have come to be the common
    citations\nfor defining ABNF.  The current document separates out that\ndefinition,
    to permit selective reference.  Predictably, it also\nprovides some modifications
    and enhancements.\n \nThe differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming\nrules,
    repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value\nranges.  Appendix A (Core)
    supplies rule definitions and encoding\nfor a core lexical analyzer of the type
    common to several\nInternet specifications.  It is provided as a convenience and
    is\notherwise separate from the meta language defined in the body of\nthis document,
    and separate from its formal status.\n\n\t "

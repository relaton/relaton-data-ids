  content: "This document defines a schema for the Domain Name System\n(DNS).  This
    schema makes it possible to integrate DNS servers\nwith an LDAP-based directory
    service, allowing an organization\nto maintain a single store of DNS information.
    Integration of\nDNS into LDAP directories is desirable since it reduces\nadministrative
    overhead and eliminates the need to maintain\nmultiple server centric configuration
    databases for DNS and\nother services.\n \nIt is anticipated that this schema
    will be useful for\nproviding a standardized format for the representation of\nattributes
    needed by DNS implementations within LDAP-based\ndirectory services.\n\t "

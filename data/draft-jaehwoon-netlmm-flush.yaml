  content: "In order to solve the inefficient route problem of PMIPv6, a mechanism\nto
    optimize the route between two mobile nodes within the same PMIPv6\ndomain has
    been proposed. However, this route optimization mechanism \nmay result in the
    out-of-order packet delivery problem. \nIn this draft, we propose a mechanism
    that can resolve the out-of-\norder packet delivery problem by introducing the
    Flush message that\nnotifies the change of the tunnel endpoint and allows the
    in-order \ndelivery of packets even in the case of the route optimization.\n\t "

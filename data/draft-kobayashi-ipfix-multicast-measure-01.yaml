  content: "The demand for streaming services is increasing because of the\n   growing
    number of broadband users.  In particular, multicast services\n   might become
    core network services, and additional demand is\n   expected.  On the other hand,
    multicast operation is quite complex,\n   and there are strict network quality
    requirements about packet loss\n   and delay.  A measurement system using IPFIX/PSAMP
    helps to monitor\n   multicast traffic behavior carefully.  However, some problems
    with\n   IPFIX/PSAMP still remain when network operators try to introduce the\n
    \  measurement system.  This document describes issues that the\n   multicast
    traffic measurement system might encounter.  The results\n   are intended to be
    used to define multicast handling by IPFIX/PSAMP\n   metering devices more clearly.\n\t "

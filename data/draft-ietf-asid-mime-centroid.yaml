  content: "This memo defines an directory profile for carrying  centroid  or  other
    indexing information pertaining to one or more directory entities within an application/directory
    MIME Content-Type. The profile consists of type definitions,  what the types are
    allowed to contain, and rules for their use and interpretation within the application/directory
    body part.         The scheme is fairly general and with a few extensions could
    be used  to handle directory modification information pertaining to a single entity,
    or sets of modifications pertaining to  many  entries,  in  addition  to updates
    \ to centroid or other index information that apply to many entities.\n\t "

  content: "   The maintenance of Prefix Delegation (PD) routing state is an issue\n
    \  that people have discussed in the IETF DHC WG, and there have been\n   drafts
    on the topic.  However, as the pros and cons of the different\n   routing state
    maintenance solutions have not been examined\n   thoroughly, this text attempts
    to shed some light on both the actual\n   problem and the various alternative
    solutions.\n\n\n\t "

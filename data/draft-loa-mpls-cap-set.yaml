  content: "Several protocols might be used for Label Distribution in an MPLS\nnetwork,
    e.g. Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), including the part\nof LDP described in
    Constraint-Based LSP Setup using LDP, the BGP-4\nand RSVP.\nThe functionality
    defined in those protocols are to some extent\noverlapping, but also complementary.
    This document specifies a\nnumber of MPLS Capability sets that can be used to
    define what is\nneeded from an MPLS implementation in order to interwork with
    other\nimplementations. The number of Capability sets might change in the\nfuture.\n\t "

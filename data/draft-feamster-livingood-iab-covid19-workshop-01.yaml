  script: Latn
  content: "   During the early weeks and months of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n   significant
    changes to Internet usage occurred as a result of a\n   sudden global shift to
    people working, studying and quarantining at\n   home.  One aspect that this affected
    was interconnection between\n   networks, which this paper studies.  This paper
    explores some of the\n   effects of these changes on Internet interconnection
    points, in terms\n   of utilization, traffic ratios, and other performance characteristics\n
    \  such as latency.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the applicability of the reliable server pool\narchitecture
    and protocols to applications which want to have High\navialebility services.
    This is accomplished by using redundant\nservers and failover between servers
    of the same pool in case of\nserver failure. Processing load in a pool may de
    distributed/shared\nbetween the members of the pool according to a certain policy.
    Also\nsome guidance is given on the choice of underlying transport protocol\n(and
    corresponding transport protocol mapping) for transporting\napplication data and
    Rserpool specific control data.\n\n\t "

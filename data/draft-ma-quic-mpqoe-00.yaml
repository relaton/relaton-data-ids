abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an advanced scheduling option for multipath
    QUIC protocol. The goal is to enable the use of multipath QUIC for applications
    that have tight latency constraints. For general purpose multipath packet scheduling,
    please refer to [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers]. Discussion Venues This note
    is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue

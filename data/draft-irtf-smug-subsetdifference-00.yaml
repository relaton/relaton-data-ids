  content: "This document describes a key management mechanism for multicast\ncommunication
    sessions that is based on the 'Subset-Difference'\nalgorithm. The Subset-Difference
    algorithm is a new revocation\nscheme which allows a Center (such as a Group Controller/
    Key Manager)\nto send a message so that *every* authorized receiver, but\nnone
    of the revoked receivers, can decrypt.\n\t "

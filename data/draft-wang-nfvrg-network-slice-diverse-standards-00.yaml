  content: "   As one of the significant technology in 5G, there are diverse\n   industry
    communities and standard organizations dedicated in a\n   research of Network
    Slicing, such as IETF, 3GPP, GSMA, ETSI, etc..\n   These organizations and communities
    not only standardize network\n   slicing architecture, management, requirements
    and so on, but also\n   individually focus on specifying network slicing in their
    own ways,\n   offering diverse specifications of it.  Aiming at research on a\n
    \  overall review of network slicing standard, this document discuss\n   diverse
    standards in various organizations and communities,\n   furthermore, analyzing
    the emphasis and difference between them.\n\n\t "

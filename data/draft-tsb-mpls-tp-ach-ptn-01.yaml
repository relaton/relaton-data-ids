  content: "   The Transport Profile of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS-\n   TP)
    is a packet-based transport technology based on the MPLS\n   Traffic Engineering
    (MPLS-TE) and Pseudowire (PW) data plane\n   architectures applicable in various
    deployment environments.\n\n   This document describes the allocation of an Associated
    Channel\n   Type to support ITU-T defined functions for packet transport\n   network
    (PTN) applications, such as Operations, Administration\n   and Maintenance (OAM),
    and applicable to MPLS-TP Pseudowires\n   (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs),
    Sub-path Maintenance\n   Elements (SPMEs) and Sections.\n\n   This document is
    intended to become a product of a joint\n   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    / International\n   Telecommunications Union Telecommunication Standardization\n
    \  Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile\n   within the IETF
    MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network\n   as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t "

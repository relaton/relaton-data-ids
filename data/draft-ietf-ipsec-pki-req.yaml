  content: "The IKE protocol allows the use of the PKIX profile of X.509v3\ncertificates
    for encryption and authentication. Common practice in the\nIPsec community differs
    in some ways from these specifications made in\nthe PKIX format specification
    and other specifications that have come\nfrom the PKIX WG. In order to promote
    interoperability in the IPsec\nmarket, this document lays out a profile for using
    PKIX in IKE.\n\t "

  content: "   Modern users of messaging systems usually have multiple devices, and\n
    \  often desire to send and receive encrypted messages on some or all of\n   their
    devices.  Using encryption on multiple devices often results in\n   situations
    where messages cannot be decrypted on the device used to\n   read the message
    due to a missing private key.\n\n   This document specifies a protocol for secure
    peer-to-peer\n   synchronization of private keys across devices belonging to the
    same\n   user (pEp Key Synchronization Protocol).\n\n   The pretty Easy privacy
    (pEp) protocols describe a set of conventions\n   for the automation of operations
    traditionally seen as barriers to\n   the use and deployment of secure end-to-end
    interpersonal messaging.\n   These include, but are not limited to, key management,
    key discovery,\n   and private key handling.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo proposes a service-agnostic semantics for Differentiated\n
    \  Services Code Point (DSCP).  It disassociates DSCP from\n   classification
    of service classes.  Instead, individual packets are\n   marked dynamically in
    a Quality-of-Experience (QoE)-aware manner.\n   Such a more flexible use of Differentiated
    Services (DiffServ)\n   involves interactions with transport protocols on application
    hosts.\n   Meanwhile, the semantics adds no complexity to traffic conditioning\n
    \  and Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) enforcement within DiffServ network\n   domain.\n\n\t "

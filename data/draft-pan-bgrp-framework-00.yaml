  content: "Resource reservation needs to accommodate the rapidly growing size\nand
    increasing service diversity of the Internet. This memo first\ndefines the scaling
    problem in today's Internet backbone, and briefly\ndiscusses several existing
    resource management approaches. Then we\nwill present a distributed approach and
    introduce a protocol, called\nthe Border Gateway Reservation Protocol (BGRP),
    for inter-domain\nresource reservation that can scale in terms of message processing\nload,
    state storage and control message bandwidth.\nThe main idea of our approach is
    to build a sink tree for each domain\nnetwork.  Each sink tree aggregates reservations
    from all data\nsources in the network. Sink tree initiation, maintenance and\ntermination
    involve only backbone border routers. Within each domain,\nthe network service
    providers manage network resource and direct user\ntraffic independently. At the
    border routers, the service providers\ncan use BGRP to setup domain-level reservation
    trunks base on bi-\nlateral agreement. Since routers only maintain the sink tree\ninformation,
    the total number of reservation states at each router\nscales, in the worst case,
    linearly with the number of domains in the\nInternet.\nFor bandwidth reservation,
    BGRP relies on differentiated services for\ndata forwarding. As a result, the
    number of packet classifier entries\nis small.  To reduce the protocol message
    traffic, routers may\nreserve domain bandwidth beyond the current load so that
    sources can\njoin or leave the tree or change their reservation without having
    to\nsend messages all the way to the root for every such change.\n\n\t "

  content: "The simultaneous use of Mobike and Mobile IPv4 has been proposed to\n
    \  provide secure connectivity and session continuity to roaming\n   corporate
    users.  Optimization of this solution have eliminated the\n   tunneling overhead
    of Mobile IPv4 in the vpn tunnel by having a\n   Foreign Agent co-located to the
    mobile vpn gateway.  This document\n   further proposes an interaction between
    Mobike and Proxy Mobile IP that simplifies implementation and deployment of the
    previous\n   methods.  The mobile vpn gateway is co-located to the Mobility Proxy\n
    \  Agent and each Access Point in the corporate network is equipped with\n   Proxy
    Mobile IP.  When moving outside the corporate network, the\n   Mobile Node secure
    connectivity and session continuity is handled by\n   Mobike.  Proxy Mobile IP
    alone is used to handle mobility when the\n   Mobile Node moves within the corporate
    network.  This document\n   introduces an interaction between Internet Key Exchange
    v2 and Proxy\n   Mobile IP in which the Internet Key Exchange AUTH request triggers\n
    \  the Proxy Mobile IP registration request to the internal Home Agent.\n   This
    interaction easily allows the Mobile Node's home address to be\n   used as vpn
    Tunnel Inner Address.\n\t "

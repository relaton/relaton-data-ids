  content: "   The helo/ehlo domain reported by a client at the beginning of an SMTP\n
    \  [RFC2821] session has largely been ignored without reliable means to\n   verify
    this information.  To properly recognize a domain sending\n   mail, the domain
    of the client must be verifiable.  This document\n   utilizes a DNS SRV record
    that extends the definitions for fields of\n   this record as defined in [RFC2782]
    where the label becomes unique by\n   appending a label of \"__caa\" following
    the Proto field.  Server\n   verification of permitted client addresses becomes
    possible as a\n   method to confirm the domain of a client without having prior\n
    \  information shared.  Cooperation between client and server domains\n   utilizing
    this method exclude third party masquerades as originating\n   from within cooperative
    domains. Initially only a notice of Unknown\n   or Unconfirmed will be added to
    mail from uncooperative domains\n   unless the domain is determined to be not
    valid, where then the mail\n   will be refused.  This added notice provides assurance
    the server is\n   checking client domains in addition to alerting users to the
    level of\n   mail compliance on received mail.  Once use of this method is common\n
    \  practice in conjunction with other means for confirming the client\n   domain,
    mail may be refused if the client and/or domain fails these\n   confirmation checks.\n\t "

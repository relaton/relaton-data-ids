abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to RELOAD to support flexible client
    promotion and demotion modes. RELOAD aims at providing a uniform protocol for
    both overlay clients and peers, where promotion of a client to peer is triggered
    and completed at the client's pleasure. It is proposed that RELOAD provide a more
    restrictive framework to enable passive promotion and demotion, where decisions
    are made by the network rather than individual user-owned nodes.</p>"

  content: "   Segment routing (SR) leverages the source routing mechanism.  It\n
    \  allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths with IGP\n   topologies
    by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths\n   which is called segments.
    \ These segments are advertised by the link-\n   state routing protocols (IS-IS
    and OSPF).  Unlike the MPLS, SR does\n   not have the specific path construction
    signaling so that it cannot\n   support the Path MTU.  This draft provides the
    necessary IS-IS\n   extensions about the Path MTU that need to be used on SR.\n\n\n\t "

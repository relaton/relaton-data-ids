  content: "   This memo specifies a simple mechanism for Lightweight AFTR (lwAFTR)\n
    \  to notify Lightweight B4 (lwB4) to initiate the recreation of the\n   binding
    when lwAFTR does not have the subscriber mapping in the\n   mapping table.  This
    often happens at failover the backup lwAFTR does\n   not have the subscriber mapping
    information to process the packets\n   between lwB4 and external IPv4 host.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP based\n
    \  access networks.  However, in roaming environments, IP clients might\n   change
    of gateways and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur.\n   The present
    document describes a solution based on the Context\n   Transfer Protocol (CxTP)
    to enhance IP handover in mobile\n   environments.  This protocol can recover
    the previously established\n   PANA security context from previous PANA Authentication
    Agent.\n\t "

  content: "   The Server Message Block (SMB) is a presentation layer protocol\n   providing
    file and print sharing functions for LAN Manager, and other\n   network operating
    systems.\n\n   The Network Basic I/O System (NetBIOS) NetBIOS was developed in
    the\n   early 1980s to allow applications to communicate over a network. The\n
    \  TCP/IP version called NetBIOSoverTCP/IP(NetBT), was developed to\n   support
    communications between symbolically named stations and\n   transfer of arbitrary
    data.NetBT supports all three services (Name,\n   Datagram and Session) supported
    by NetBIOS.\n\n   This document attempts to provide, Control and Operational details
    on\n   SMB over NetBT session, which is otherwise not clearly explained in\n   the
    RFCs [Netbios concepts] and [Netbios specification] or any\n   available documentation.\n\n
    \  This document is intended for documentation purpose and for\n   informational
    use only.This document does not attempt to define a\n   standard, rather tries
    explaining an existing implementation.\n\n   This document puts together pieces
    of information scattered in\n   multiple documents and offers a single complete
    documentation for\n   this specific application (smb over NetBT).\n\n\n\n\t "

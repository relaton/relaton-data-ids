- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There will be IPv4-only applications that remain in use as network\nmanagers
    begin deploying IPv6-only networks, or turning off IPv4 in\nthe exiting dual-stack
    networks.  These applications require a dual-\nstack capable host operating system,
    but that OS may find that the\nlocal network has not provided on-link IPv4 provisioning
    or routing\nsupport for the resulting packets.  Skepticism that this situation\nwill
    exist is widespread; because it is easy to ignore the costs\nsomeone else will
    incur and focus on the local situation.  Taking the\nsystem level viewpoint, that
    skepticism makes no sense when it is\nwidely acknowledged that people will resist
    replacing something that\nis working, particularly when the reason it might artificially
    stop\nis due to 'someone else's problem'.  The reality of IPv4-only\napplications
    persisting in an IPv6-only provisioned network is\nspecifically ignored by RFC
    4038.  This document deals with the\nsituation by defining a new tunneling type
    for use within the edge or\nleaf network to the border where it interconnects
    with an IPv4\nrouting domain.\n\nThe draft is being discussed on the ipv6@ietf.org
    list.\n\nLegal\n\nThis documents and the information contained therein are provided

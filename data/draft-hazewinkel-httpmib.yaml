  content: "This draft defines a MIB to manage the HTTP protocol. The HTTP protocol
    is used by World Wide Web applications to transfer information between WWW clients
    and WWW servers. HTTP is based on the request/response paradigm.  The HTTP MIB
    is especially useful to manage the WWW server-side. The MIB is defined in such
    a way that it allows multiple servers to run within a single system.\n\t "

  content: "   In a number of environments, a component external to a network is\n
    \  called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and\n   current
    state of the connections within the network, including\n   traffic engineering
    information.  This is information typically\n   distributed by IGP routing protocols
    within the network\n\n   This document describes a mechanism by which links state
    and traffic\n   engineering information can be collected from networks and shared\n
    \  with external components using the BGP routing protocol.  This is\n   achieved
    using a new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information\n   (NLRI) encoding format.
    \ The mechanism is applicable to physical and\n   virtual links.  The mechanism
    described is subject to policy control.\n\n   Applications of this technique include
    Application Layer Traffic\n   Optimization (ALTO) servers, and Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs).\n\n\n\t "

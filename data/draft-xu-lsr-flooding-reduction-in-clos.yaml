  content: "   In a CLOS topology, an OSPF (or ISIS) router may receive identical\n
    \  copies of an LSA (or LSP) from multiple OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors.\n   Moreover,
    two OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors may exchange the same LSA (or\n   LSP) simultaneously.
    \ This results in unnecessary flooding of link-\n   state information, which wastes
    the precious resources of OSPF (or\n   ISIS) routers.  Therefore, this document
    proposes extensions to OSPF\n   (or ISIS) to reduce this flooding within CLOS
    networks.  The\n   reduction of OSPF (or ISIS) flooding is highly beneficial for\n
    \  improving the scalability of CLOS networks.\n\n\n\t "

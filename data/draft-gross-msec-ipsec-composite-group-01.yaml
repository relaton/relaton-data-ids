  script: Latn
  content: "The Multicast IP Security extension architecture [Weis] implicitly\n   assumes
    a basic group endpoint population that shares homogeneous\n   cryptographic capabilities
    and security policies. In practice, large-\n   scale cryptographic groups may
    contain a heterogeneous endpoint\n   population that can not be accommodated by
    that basic multicast IPsec\n   architecture. For example, some endpoints may not
    have been upgraded\n   to handle the successor algorithm for one that is being
    retired (e.g.\n   SHA1 transition to SHA-ng). Group deployments that span multiple\n
    \  legal jurisdictions may have a different security policy in each\n   jurisdiction
    (e.g. key strength). This document defines the\n   \"composite cryptographic group\"
    IP security architecture capability.\n   A composite cryptographic group allows
    multicast IPsec applications\n   to transparently interact with the single logical
    group that is\n   formed by the union of one or more basic cryptographic groups.\n\t "

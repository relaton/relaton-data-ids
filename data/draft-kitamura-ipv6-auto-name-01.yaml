  content: "   This document discusses notion and actual mechanisms of\n   Corresponding
    Auto Names for IPv6 Addresses. With this mechanism,\n   all IPv6 addresses (even
    if they are link-local scoped addresses)\n   can obtain their own Names, and it
    will be able to use Names\n   anywhere instead of IPv6 Addresses.\n\n   IPv6 address
    is too long and complicated to remember, and it is\n   very nuisance to type a
    literal IPv6 address manually as an\n   argument of applications. Also, it is
    very difficult for human\n   beings to tell which IPv6 address is set to which
    actual IPv6 node.\n   In this sense, literal IPv6 address information can be called\n
    \  meaningless information for human beings.\n\n   In order to solve above problems
    and to make the information\n   meaningful, mechanisms called Corresponding Auto
    Names for IPv6\n   addresses is introduced. They will become human friendly\n
    \  information. By applying a simple naming rule to the Auto Names\n   (e.g.,
    use the same Auto Name Prefix for IPv6 addresses that are\n   set to the same
    interface (node)), this will contribute to help\n   people to understand which
    IPv6 address / Name indicates which\n   actual IPv6 node and provide meaningful
    information.\n\n\t "

  content: "   To date IETF's security suite has been entirely IP-centric, IPsec\n
    \  only being applicable to IP packets.  This document addresses\n   security
    requirements for MPLS pseudowires.  We investigate security\n   considerations
    arising from the PWE3 architecture, and discuss\n   example threats, authentication,
    and confidentiality.\n\n\t "

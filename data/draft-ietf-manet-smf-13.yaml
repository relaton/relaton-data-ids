  content: "   This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)\n   mechanism
    that provides basic Internet Protocol (IP) multicast\n   forwarding suitable for
    limited wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc\n   network (MANET) use.  It is mainly
    applicable in situations where\n   efficient flooding represents an acceptable
    engineering design trade-\n   off.  It defines techniques for multicast duplicate
    packet detection\n   (DPD), to be applied in the forwarding process, for both
    IPv4 and\n   IPv6 protocol use.  This document also specifies optional mechanisms\n
    \  for using reduced relay sets to achieve more efficient multicast data\n   distribution
    within a mesh topology as compared to classic flooding.\n   Interactions with
    other protocols, such as use of information\n   provided by concurrently running
    unicast routing protocols, or\n   interaction with other multicast protocols,
    as well as multiple\n   deployment approaches are also described.  Distributed
    algorithms for\n   selecting reduced relay sets and related discussion are provided
    in\n   the appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of multicast\n
    \  MANET border routers are discussed, but ongoing work remains in this\n   area,
    and is beyond the scope of this document.\n\n\t "

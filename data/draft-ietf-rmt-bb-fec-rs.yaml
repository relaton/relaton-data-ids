  content: "This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    Scheme for the Reed-Solomon FEC codes over GF(2^^m), where m is in {2..16}, and
    its application to the reliable delivery of data objects on the packet erasure
    channel (i.e., a communication path where packets are either received without
    any corruption or discarded during transmission). This document also describes
    a Fully-Specified FEC Scheme for the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8)
    when there is no encoding symbol group. Finally, in the context of the Under-Specified
    Small Block Systematic FEC Scheme (FEC Encoding ID 129), this document assigns
    an FEC Instance ID to the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8).\n\n
    Reed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes,
    i.e., they enable a receiver to recover the k source symbols from any set of k
    received symbols. The schemes described here are compatible with the implementation
    from Luigi Rizzo. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

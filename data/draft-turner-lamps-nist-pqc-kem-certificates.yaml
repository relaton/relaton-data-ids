  content: "   This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding\n
    \  format for the US NIST's PQC KEM (United States National Institute of\n   Standards
    and Technology's Post Quantum Cryptography Key\n   Encapsulation Mechanism) algorithms.
    \ The algorithms covered are\n   Candidate TBD1.  The encoding for public key
    and private key is also\n   provided.\n\n   [EDNOTE: This draft is not expected
    to be finalized before the NIST\n   PQC Project has standardized PQ algorithms.
    \ After NIST has\n   standardized its first algorithms, this document will replace
    TBD,\n   with the appropriate algorithms and parameters before proceeding to\n
    \  ratification.  The algorithm Candidate TBD1 has been added as an\n   example
    in this draft, to provide a more detailed illustration of the\n   content - it
    by no means indicates its inclusion in the final\n   version.  This specification
    will use object identifiers for the new\n   algorithms that are assigned by NIST,
    and will use placeholders until\n   these are released.]\n\n\t "

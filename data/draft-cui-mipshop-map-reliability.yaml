  content: "This document introduces an extension to allow an adapted multiple\nbinding
    in hierarchical mobile network. Mobile node registers its\nRCoA and LCoA in the
    home agent at same time to get two separate\nconnections between the mobile node
    and the home agent, or between\nthe mobile node and the correspondent node in
    Route Optimization\nscenario. These connections provide robust communication between\nthe
    mobile node and correspondent nodes and mobile node can overcome\nthe failure
    on MAP.\n\t "

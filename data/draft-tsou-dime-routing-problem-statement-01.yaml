  content: "This document describes use cases that suggest a requirement to be\nable
    to add constraints to the existing Diameter routing mechanisms\nso that subsequent
    messages in a session pass through specific\nproxies that were on the initial
    path that set up the session.\nRouting between these proxies may use the present
    Diameter rules.\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a method for configuring Bidirectional\nForwarding
    Detection (BFD) by an IP Edge device using DHCPv4 or\nDHCPv6.  It provides motivation
    for the new functionality, defines\nnew DHCP options to assist with the task and
    outlines the rules for\nconfiguring BFD on an IP endpoint for different network
    topologies.\nThe document also discusses endpoint behavior upon BFD failure.\nComments
    on this draft should be directed to rtg-bfd@ietf.org.\n\t "

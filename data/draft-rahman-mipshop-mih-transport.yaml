  content: "   This document describes a mechanism for using UDP/IP for the \n   transport
    of Media Independent Handover (MIH) messages between \n   network nodes. MIH messages
    carry technology specific link layer \n   information and commands that can be
    used to optimize handover \n   procedures across different access technologies
    such as cellular and \n   WLAN. MIH will complement Layer 3 mobility protocols
    such as Mobile \n   IP.  \n\t "

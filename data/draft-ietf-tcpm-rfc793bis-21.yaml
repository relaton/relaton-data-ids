  content: "   This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  TCP\n
    \  is an important transport layer protocol in the Internet protocol\n   stack,
    and has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of\n   the Internet.
    \ Over this time, a number of changes have been made to\n   TCP as it was specified
    in RFC 793, though these have only been\n   documented in a piecemeal fashion.
    \ This document collects and brings\n   those changes together with the protocol
    specification from RFC 793.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs
    879, 2873, 6093,\n   6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It updates
    RFC\n   1122, and should be considered as a replacement for the portions of\n
    \  that document dealing with TCP requirements.  It also updates RFC\n   5961
    by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the\n   SYN-RECEIVED
    state.  The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have\n   also been updated based
    on RFC 3168.\n\n   RFC EDITOR NOTE: If approved for publication as an RFC, this
    should\n   be marked additionally as \"STD: 7\" and replace RFC 793 in that role.\n\n\t "

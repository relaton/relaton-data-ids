- content: "<p>Modern network applications, ranging from Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    /Machine Learning (ML) training to large-scale cloud services, require adaptive
    networks to ensure reliable and congestion-free data transfer within or across
    multiple data centers. A good and timely understanding of network operational
    status can help to enable faster response to critical events, so as to enable
    the selection of paths with reduced latency and improve network utilization. This
    document describes the existing problems and the need of fast network notification
    solutions.</p>"

  content: "This description addresses the method for using internationalized \n(multilingual)
    domain names under the current DNS. Further, the method \nfor converting a internationalized
    domain name expressed in a native \nlanguage, into a traditional US-ASCII domain
    name compatible in current \nDNS, is addressed.\n\nThis method especially uses
    'sequence of 36 characters' to convert all\ncharacters in IDN into US-ASCII. \n\nFinally,
    the way to use this method with lc2LDs are presented.\n\t "

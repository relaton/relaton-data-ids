  content: "   This document defines the Post-Quantum Authenticated Key Exchange\n
    \  (PQuAKE) protocol that addresses the needs of bandwidth- and/or\n   power-constrained
    environments, while maintaining strong security\n   guarantees.  It accomplishes
    that by minimizing the number of bits\n   that need to be exchanged and by utilizing
    an implicit peer\n   authentication approach similar to Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV)
    design.\n   This protocol is suitable for integration into protocols that\n   establish
    dynamic secure sessions, such as Extensible Authentication\n   Protocol (EAP),
    Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2), or Secure\n   COmmunications Interoperability
    Protocol (SCIP).  This protocol has\n   proofs in the verifiers Verifpal and CryptoVerif
    for security\n   properties such as secrecy of the session key, mutual authentication,\n
    \  identity hiding with a preshared secret, and forward secrecy of the\n   session
    key.  The authors are in the process of publishing the\n   proofs.\n\n\t "

  content: "We propose a new fast handoff mechanism in wireless IP using \nneighboring
    Foreign Agent information. Our proposal is based on the \npolicy of utilizing,
    or perhaps even wasting, wired bandwidth between \nForeign Agents, while minimizing
    rf (radio frequency) bandwidth \nexchanges, in order that handoff latency is minimized.
    We minimize \nthe handoff latency by initiating data forwarding to the possible
    new \nforeign agent candidates (i.e., the neighbor foreign agents) \nimmediately
    when the mobile node is about to start the link layer \nhandoff procedure.\n\t "

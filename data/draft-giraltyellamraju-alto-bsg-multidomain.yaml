  content: "   This document proposes an extension to the base Application-Layer\n
    \  Traffic Optimization(ALTO) protocol to support the computation of\n   bottleneck
    structure graphs\n   [I-D.draft-giraltyellamraju-alto-bsg-requirements] under
    partial\n   information.  A primary application corresponds to the case of multi-\n
    \  domain networks, whereby each network domain is administered\n   separately
    and lacks information about the other domains.  A proposed\n   border protocol
    is introduced that ensures each domain's independent\n   convergence to the correct
    bottleneck substructure graph without the\n   need to know private flow and topology
    information from other\n   domains.  Initial discussions are presented on the
    necessary\n   requirements to integrate the proposed capability into the ALTO\n
    \  standard.\n\n\t "

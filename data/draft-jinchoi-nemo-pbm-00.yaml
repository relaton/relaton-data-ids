  content: "   This document describes a protocol which provides movbility support\n
    \  for an ordinary IPv6 host in WiMAX network.  The protocol allows\n   session
    continuity for every IPv6 node in WiMAX network as it moves\n   across subnets.
    \ The protocol exploits the facts that a single prefix\n   is assigned per an
    IPv6 host in WiMAX network and prefix binding\n   scheme is defined in NEMO WG.
    \ WiMAX access routers perform prefix\n   binding for the hosts' stead and the
    mobility is transparent to the\n   hosts inside WiMAX network.\n\n\t "

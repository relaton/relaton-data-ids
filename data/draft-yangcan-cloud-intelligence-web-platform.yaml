  content: "   This draft mainly focuses on the scalable architecture and publishing\n
    \  protocol standard of REST-based SAAS cloud model Web software in non-\n   programming
    mode, stipulates the data structure pattern and data\n   exchange protocol for
    the construction and release of REST-based\n   scalable Web cloud service software
    systems.  Using the standardized\n   framework and protocol, users can easily
    and quickly design their own\n   software systems in the cloud, transfer and release
    data, which may\n   make conventional software development so ease to improve
    the\n   efficiency of complex database construction and server management.\n   Without
    having to write codes under the standard framework, users can\n   get consistent
    style background to create service, rapidly develop\n   web application systems
    with the function of standard data management\n   and data maintenance, and directly
    publish the software system to the\n   end users of the Internet for access and
    use.  And provide RESTful\n   APIs to facilitate external access to required service
    resources.\n   The framework can thus greatly shorten the software development
    life\n   cycle, and save a great deal of development cost and maintenance\n   overhead.\n\n\t "

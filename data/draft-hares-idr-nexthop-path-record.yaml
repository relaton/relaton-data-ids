  content: "   In some BGP deployments, BGP next hops may use a set or tunnels or\n
    \  run across converged networks such as seamless MPLS.  This document\n   describes
    a new optional transitive path attribute, NEXTHOP_PATH\n   ATTRIBUTE for BGP that
    records the next hop path which can be used by\n   BGP network management to monitor
    and manage the BGP infrastructure\n   via management interfaces (such as I2RS).\n\n\n\t "

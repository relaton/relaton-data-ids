  content: "   This document analyzes the applicability of the TCP Authentication\n
    \  Option (TCP-AO) to secure TCP-based network management protocols,\n   specifically
    NETCONF and gNMI.  It describes deployment profiles in\n   which TCP-AO provides
    per-connection integrity and peer\n   authentication with low operational overhead,
    either as an\n   alternative to or in combination with TLS/SSH.  This document
    gives\n   guidance on key management (e.g., static keys and operational \"key\n
    \  chains\") and documents expected behaviors and benefits.  No new\n   protocol
    bits are defined and there are no IANA actions.\n\n\t "

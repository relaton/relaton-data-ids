abstract:
- content: "<p>Source address validation (SAV) is critical to preventing attacks based
    on source IP address spoofing. The proposed inter-domain SAVNET architecture enables
    an AS to generate SAV rules based on SAV- related information from multiple sources.
    This architecture integrates existing SAV mechanisms and offers ample design space
    for new SAV mechanisms. The document focuses on architectural components and SAV-related
    information in an inter-domain SAVNET deployment, without specifying any protocols
    or protocol extensions.</p>"

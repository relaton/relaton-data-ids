abstract:
- content: "<p>Source address validation (SAV) plays a significant role in defending
    against various attacks based on source IP address spoofing. BCP84 [RFC3704][RFC8704]
    provides practical SAV mechanisms, i.e., uRPF- based approaches, for inter-domain
    scenarios. However, current uRPF- based SAV mechanisms have limitations in accuracy
    and incentive [draft-wu-savnet-inter-domain-problem-statement]. This document
    provides an architecture of inter-domain SAVNET which actively advertises AS paths
    to other ASes for generating accurate SAV rules and improving incentive.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an inter-domain SAVNET architecture that serves
    as a comprehensive framework for the development of inter- domain source address
    validation (SAV) mechanisms. The proposed architecture empowers AS to generate
    SAV rules by leveraging SAV- related information from various sources. It integrates
    existing SAV mechanisms and offers ample design space for new inter-domain SAV
    mechanisms. Instead of delving into protocol extensions or implementations, this
    document primarily focuses on defining the interconnections between architectural
    elements, components, and the SAV-related information required for deploying an
    inter-domain SAV mechanism.</p>"

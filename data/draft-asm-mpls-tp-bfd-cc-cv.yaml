  content: "Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) and \nRemote
    Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities required for are MPLS-\nTP OAM.  \n \nContinuity
    Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the path \nfor any loss of continuity
    defect. Connectivity verification monitors \nthe integrity of the routing of the
    path between sink and source for \nany connectivity issues. RDI enables an End
    Point to report, to its \nassociated End Point, a fault or defect condition that
    it detects on \na PW, LSP or Section. \n \nThis document specifies methods for
    proactive CV, CC, and RDI for \nMPLS-TP Label Switched Path (LSP), PWs and Sections
    using \nBidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). \n \n\nRequirements Language
    \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",
    \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this
    \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].\n\t "

  content: "This strawman proposal presents a revised version of the RTSP proposal
    put forward to the MMUSIC group, borrowing liberally from the original.        The
    Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level protocol for control
    over the delivery of data with real-time properties. RTSP provides an extensible
    framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of real- time data, such as
    audio and video.  Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored
    clips. This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery sessions, provide
    a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP, multicast UDP and TCP, and
    delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 1889).\n\t "

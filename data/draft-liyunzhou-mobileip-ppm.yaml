abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document aims to explore an approach for the interoperability testing
    of Mobile IP implementations across the Internet. It proposes client/server proximity
    proxies, two intermediate entities between the mobile node and the mobility agent.
    This model can be used to solve the problem addressed in the hierarchical foreign
    agents model.  The document proposes to build a tunnel between proximity proxies
    using Tunnel Request and Tunnel Reply messages, and enable routing policies to
    the tunnel by using Proxy Update message and adding a bit in Agent Advertisement
    message.\n\t "

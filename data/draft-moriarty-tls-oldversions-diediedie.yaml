  content: "   This document [if approved] formally deprecates Transport Layer\n   Security
    (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1 [RFC4346] and moves\n   these documents to
    the historic state.  These versions lack support\n   for current and recommended
    cipher suites, and various government and\n   industry profiiles of applications
    using TLS now mandate avoiding\n   these old TLS versions.  TLSv1.2 has been the
    recommended version for\n   IETF protocols since 2008, providing sufficient time
    to transition\n   away from older versions.  Products having to support older
    versions\n   increase the attack surface unnecessarily and increase opportunities\n
    \  for misconfigurations.  Supporting these older versions also requires\n   additional
    effort for library and product maintenance.\n\n   This document updates the backward
    compatibility sections of TLS RFCs\n   [[list TBD]] to prohibit fallback to TLSv1.0
    and TLSv1.1.  This\n   document also updates RFC 7525.\n\n\t "

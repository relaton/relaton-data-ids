  content: "   Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation\n   function
    from tunnel lwAFTR (AFTR) to lwB4s (B4s), and hence reduces\n   the mapping scale
    on the lwAFTR to per-customer level.  This document\n   discusses various deployment
    models of Lightweight 4over6.  It also\n   describes the deployment considerations
    and applicability of the\n   Lightweight 4over6 architecture.\n\n\t "

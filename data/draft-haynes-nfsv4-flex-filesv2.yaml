  content: "   The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows a separation between\n
    \  the metadata (onto a metadata server) and data (onto a storage\n   device)
    for a file.  The flexible file layout type is an extension to\n   pNFS which allows
    the use of storage devices in a fashion such that\n   they require only a quite
    limited degree of interaction with the\n   metadata server, using already existing
    protocols.  This document\n   describes two extensions to the flexible file layout
    type to allow\n   for multiple stateids for tightly coupled NFSv4 models and an\n
    \  additional security mechanism for loosely coupled models.\n\n\t "

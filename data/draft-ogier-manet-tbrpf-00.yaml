  content: "Topology Broadcast based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is a\nlink-state
    routing protocol designed for use in a mobile ad-hoc\nnetwork (MANET) or an internet.
    \ TBRPF provides each node with the\nstate of each link in the network, but does
    so much more efficiently\nthan flooding (e.g., OSPF).  TBRPF uses the concept
    of reverse-path\nforwarding to efficiently and reliably broadcast each link-state\nupdate
    along the minimum-hop-path tree rooted at the source of the\nupdate.  The broadcast
    trees (one tree per source) are updated\ndynamically using the topology information
    that is received along the\ntrees themselves, thus requiring very little additional
    overhead for\nmaintaining the trees. This document describes TBRPF and discusses\ndetails
    for the implementation of TBRPF in IPv4-based MANETs.\n\n\t "

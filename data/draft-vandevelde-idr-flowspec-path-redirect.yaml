  content: "   Flowspec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination of\n
    \  traffic flow specification rules.  This has many possible\n   applications
    but the primary one for many network operators is the\n   distribution of traffic
    filtering actions for DDoS mitigation.  The\n   flow-spec standard RFC5575 [2]
    defines a redirect-to-VRF action for\n   policy-based forwarding but this mechanism
    is not always sufficient,\n   particularly if the redirected traffic needs to
    be steered into an\n   engineered path or into a service plane.\n\n   This document
    defines a new extended community known as redirect-to-\n   indirection-id (32-bit)
    flowspec action to provide advanced\n   redirection capabilities on flowspec clients.
    \ When activated, the\n   flowspec extended community is used by a flowspec client
    to find the\n   correct next-hop entry within a localised indirection-id mapping\n
    \  table.\n\n   The functionality present in this draft allows a network controller\n
    \  to decouple flowspec functionality from the creation and maintainance\n   of
    the network's service plane itself including the setup of tunnels\n   and other
    service constructs that could be managed by other network\n   devices.\n\n\n\t "

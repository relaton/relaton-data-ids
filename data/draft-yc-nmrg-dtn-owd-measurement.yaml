  content: "   This document implements an accurate network delay measurement method\n
    \  based on the digital twin network.  This is a use case of digital\n   twin
    network.  This method does not need to send measurement packets,\n   does not
    need to change the physical network configuration, does not\n   need to change
    the format of service packets, do not require physical\n   network elements to
    support the time synchronization protocol, and\n   support the one-way delay measurement
    of any service packet.The\n   digital twin network architecture of this document
    follows the NMRG\n   working group paper draft-irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch-00.\n\n\t "

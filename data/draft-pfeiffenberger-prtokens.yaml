  content: "   Fraud detection often relies on high-entropy signals that can also
    be\n   used to track users across sites.  Probabilistic Reveal Tokens (PRTs)\n
    \  attempt to balance the needs of fraud detection and tracking\n   prevention
    by sampling at a rate that is too low for scaled cross-\n   site tracking, but
    sufficient for fraud detection in aggregate\n   scenarios.  This document describes
    the PRT protocol, which allows\n   browsers to reveal sensitive signals (e.g.,
    IP address) on a per-site\n   basis with provable probability p_reveal, while
    websites can use PRTs\n   to measure traffic quality and update denylists.\n\n\t "

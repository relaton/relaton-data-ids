  content: "   This specification defines an abstract model for software systems and\n
    \  their relationships with each other in order to establish a basic\n   abstraction
    on which the lifecycle of software systems and\n   collaborations around them
    can be expressed.  In addition, this\n   specification defines a number of message
    formats and hypermedia\n   controls, to enable the creation of tools and application
    in the\n   space of software systems life cycle management.\n\n\t "

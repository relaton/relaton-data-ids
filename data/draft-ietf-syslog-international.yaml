  content: "This document describes syslog-international, a mechanism adding\nsupport
    for international character sets to syslog.\nSyslog-international provides these
    features in a way that has no\nrequirements and no impact on existing syslog implementations.
    It is\npossible to support syslog-international and gain some of its\nfunctionality
    by only changing the behavior of the devices generating\nsyslog messages. Some
    additional processing of the received syslog\nmessages may realize additional
    benefits. There is no need to change\nsyslog relays in order to support syslog-international.
    Existing\nsyslog implementations will benefit from the fact that\nsyslog-international
    supporting devices emit proper syslog messages\nin all cases. It is common practice
    for many non-syslog-international\nclients to accidently emit 8 bit characters
    if used in e.g. European\nlanguage environments. Syslog-international just adds
    a protocol\nlayer to the MSG part of the syslog message. As such, it is\ncompatible
    with all existing and future implementations of syslog.\n\n\t "

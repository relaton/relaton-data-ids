abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines the Credit-based flow control mechanism for WAN
    based on the RSVP protocol. With the increasing demand for AI computing power,
    the computing power of a single AIDC can no longer meet the needs of large model
    training. This has given rise to cross-AIDC distributed model training, driving
    the demand for transmitting RDMA packets over WAN networks. AI training is extremely
    sensitive to network packet loss, and even a small amount of packet loss may lead
    to a significant decline in training efficiency. In addition, the elephant flow
    and extreme concurrent traffic also place higher demands on network performance.
    Credit- based flow control is a Backpressure-based traffic management technology,
    which has high reliability and stability in practical applications. It can provide
    high-throughput and zero-packet-loss transmission guarantees for RDMA traffic,
    effectively ensuring the efficiency of cross-data center AI training. This draft
    focuses on the scenario where RDMA packets are transmitted through SRv6 tunnels
    in the WAN and further expands the capabilities of the RSVP protocol in WAN. This
    draft introduces the Credit-based flow control mechanism into the RSVP protocol
    to achieve precise traffic control and provides processing analysis.</p>"

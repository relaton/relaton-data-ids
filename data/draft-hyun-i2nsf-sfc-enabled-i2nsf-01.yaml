abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture of the I2NSF framework which
    enables traffic steering between NSFs for security policy enforcement. Such traffic
    steering enables composite inspection of network traffic by steering the traffic
    through multiple types of security functions according to the information model
    for the NSF facing interface in the I2NSF framework. This document explains the
    additional components integrated into the I2NSF framework and their functionalities
    to achieve NSF-triggered traffic steering. It also describes representative use
    cases to address major benefits from the proposed architecture.</p>"

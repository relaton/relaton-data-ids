  script: Latn
  content: "   Efficient detection of network attachment in IPv6 needs the following\n
    \  two components: a method for the host to query routers on the link to\n   identify
    the link (Link Identification) and a method for the routers\n   on the link to
    consistently respond to such a query with minimal\n   delay (Fast RA).  Solving
    the link identification based strictly on\n   RFC 2461 is difficult because of
    the flexibilities offered to routers\n   in terms of prefixes advertised in a
    router advertisement (RA)\n   message.  Similarly, the random delay in responding
    to router\n   solicitation messages imposed by RFC 2461 makes to it difficult
    to\n   achieve fast RA.  In this memo, an integrated solution is presented.\n
    \  Monitoring of prefixes by both hosts and routers is used to achieve\n   link
    identification while router advertisements are sent rapidly in a\n   deterministic
    order by combining router solicitation source addresses\n   with hash-based router
    tokens.\n\t "

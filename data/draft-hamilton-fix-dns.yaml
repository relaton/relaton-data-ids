  content: "   This proposal outlines a way in which the Internet community may be\n
    \  able to route around the legal and political issues associated with\n   control
    of the Domain Name System.  We suggest a new mechanism for\n   the distribution
    of domain name information, based on strong\n   cryptographic authentication.
    \ In this new system, anyone is free to\n   ''publish'' domain name information,
    with control over whether or not\n   it is accepted left to the local site DNS
    server administrators.\n\n\t "

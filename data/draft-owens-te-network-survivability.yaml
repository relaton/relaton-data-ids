  content: "Network survivability refers to the capability of the network to \nmaintain
    service continuity in the presence of faults within the \nnetwork [1]. This can
    be accomplished by recovering quickly from \nnetwork failures quickly and maintaining
    the required QoS for existing \nservices. With the increasing sophistication of
    network technologies, \nsurvivability capabilities are becoming available at multiple
    layers, \nallowing for protection and restoration to occur at any layer of the
    \nnetwork. This makes it important to: scrutinize the recovery features \nof different
    network layers, understand the pros and cons of performing \nrecovery at each
    layer, and assess how the interactions between layers \nimpact network survivability.
    With these objectives in mind, this draft \nexamines the considerations for network
    survivability at different \nlayers of the network.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),\n
    \  a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained networks\n   and
    nodes for machine-to-machine applications such as smart energy\n   and building
    automation.  These constrained nodes often have 8-bit\n   microcontrollers with
    small amounts of ROM and RAM, while networks\n   such as 6LoWPAN often have high
    packet error rates and a typical\n   throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  CoAP provides
    a method/response\n   interaction model between application end-points, supports
    built-in\n   resource discovery, and includes key web concepts such as URIs and\n
    \  content-types.  CoAP easily translates to HTTP for integration with\n   the
    web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast\n   support, very
    low overhead and simplicity for constrained\n   environments.\n\n\t "

  content: "The objective of this draft is to clarify a framework for\nstandardizing
    the mechanisms supporting interoperable network-based\nvirtual private networks
    (NBVPNs).  These are VPNs using IP\nfacilities whose operation mechanisms are
    implemented within a\nnetwork (or networks) and outsourced to one or more service\nproviders.\nThis
    draft first describes the assumed services of NBVPNs and\nclarifies the logical
    architecture model and reference model of\nNBVPN.  Considering the assumed services,
    this draft further\nclarifies the NBVPN requirements for interfaces and MIBs in
    the\nreference model.  It also surveys and discusses current technologies\nsupporting
    NBVPNs such as tunneling, VPN identifier, routing, and\nQoS/SLA.  Additionally
    it will, in future, provide outline of the\ninterface and MIB specifications and
    present criteria for achieving\ninteroperability.\n\t "

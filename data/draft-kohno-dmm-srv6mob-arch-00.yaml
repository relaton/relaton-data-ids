  content: "   Layer separation is a powerful concept in system architecture.  In\n
    \  the area of mobility, by separating GTP-U that is the overlay tunnel,\n   and
    the IP transport network that is the underlay, the operation of\n   the mobile
    network and the transport network can be separated,\n   allowing them to evolve
    independently.\n\n   However, evolving individually at each layer promotes local\n
    \  optimization and may result in non-optimal solutions overall in the\n   long
    run.\n\n   When a drastic architectural transition is required, for example, in\n
    \  the 5G era where various SLAs and completely new data intensive\n   services
    are assumed, it is necessary to reconsider the architecture\n   holistically,
    rather than from the viewpoint of individual layer.\n\n   One important value
    propositions of SRv6 mobile user plane is the\n   possible optimization across
    the existing multiple layers.\n\n   This document discusses the architectural
    implications of applying\n   SRv6 mobile user plane, especially regarding the
    possible\n   optimization of existing layers.  Then it takes 5G requirements and\n
    \  use cases as an example, and describes how these use cases are simply\n   and
    effectively realized with the inter-layer optimization capability\n   of SRv6
    mobile user plane.  Thus it show that SRv6 mobile use plane\n   is a right architectural
    choice for the 5G era.\n\n\t "

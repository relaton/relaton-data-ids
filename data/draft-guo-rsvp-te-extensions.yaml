  content: "This draft describes two specific extensions to RSVP-TE. The first \nextension
    is concerned about the scalability of RSVP-TE. It proposes\nexpanding the length
    of tunnel ID in RSVP-TE session object, from 16 \nbits to 32 bits, in order to
    increase the upper limit of LSPs origin-\nated from one node. The second extension
    is to propose a new object \nfor representing a protection group. A protection
    group can tie two \nor more diverse LSPs between a source-destination pair of
    nodes. This \nextension is warranted due to the importance and wide-spread appli-\ncations
    of LSP protection switching mechanisms.\n\t "

  content: "A contributing factor to the explosive growth in IP address allocation
    is the coming together of two seeming unrelated factors.  One factor is arbitrary
    relationship within the Domain Name Server that requires an unique IP address
    to be associated with a Domain Name.  The second factor is the public's desire
    to have short Domain Names unique to their enterprise.                                                                We
    believe a small modification to the Domain Name Server will break this relationship
    and lessen pressure on IP address allocation.  This modification should also make
    system configuration easier than dealing with IP addresses for each Domain Name
    supported on a given host.          One difficulty with the proposed modification
    is that similar 'small' changes are required in the WWW browsers to pick up the
    port number and append it to the URL.\n\t "

  content: "   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most widely deployed\n   protocol
    for securing network traffic.  It provides mutual\n   authentication, data confidentiality
    and integrity, key generation\n   and distribution, and security parameters negotiation.
    \ However,\n   missing from the protocol is a way to multiplex single-application\n
    \  multiple-stream applications that commonly use parallel connections\n   to
    the same logical and/or physical server application data.\n\n   This document
    describes a mechanism to multiplex single-application\n   multiple-stream over
    TLS.  It extends TLS to multiplex parallel\n   connections of a given application
    over a single TLS session,\n   avoiding additional delay related to the TLS/TCP
    session/connection\n   setup.\n\n\t "

  content: "Until now, many standards was issued to standardize creating and managing
    IDN (Internationalized Domain Names), all those standards discussed the technical
    problem issued from the need to keep the structure of the internet that uses standard
    (ASCII) domain names untouched; using this pretext those standards forced  some
    rules that make lingual grammars for some languages not respected on the language
    domain names.\n\nThis document will try to define a new type of domain names called
    the \n'multilingual domain names' (MLDNs) , these names are supposed to espect
    the grammatical and spelling of every language so at least, every language can
    use the words of its own dictionary in its own domain names. The system supposed
    to manage the reservation and the resolution of the new domain names (MLDNs) must
    also respect the infrastructure of the traditional domain names system (DNS) untouched
    so it will not jeopardize the stability of the internet. In the rest of the document
    we will refer to that system by MLDNS (Multi-Lingual Domain Names System).  \n\nMLDNS
    Will use the same large repertoire of Unicode characters to compose its domain
    names and that means the use of none-ASCII characters, this use must allow all
    languages to have their domain names that respect their language properties and
    rules. Also it must depends on a technique that keeps the stable DNS system untouched.\n\t "

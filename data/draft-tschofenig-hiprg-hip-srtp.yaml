  content: "   The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is a signaling protocol which adds
    a\n   new layer between the traditional Transport and the Network layer.\n   HIP
    is an end-to-end authentication and key exchange protocol, which\n   supports
    security and mobility in a commendable manner.  The HIP base\n   specification
    is generalized and purported to support different key\n   exchange mechanisms
    in order to provide confidentiality protection\n   for the subsequent user data
    traffic.  This draft explains a\n   mechanism to establish Secure Real Time Protocol
    associations, to\n   protect the user data packets, by using HIP.\n\n\t "

  content: "Quality of Service in the IP protocol has been proposed in some \nservice
    definitions (Int-Serv and Diff-Serv) and in a variety of \nschemes and supporting
    protocols (RSVP). These schemes assume,\nof course, that all the protocols supporting
    IP links in turn\nprovide a well-defined degree of QoS the IP schemes can rely
    upon.\nOne of the most common link protocols is PPP.\nThe PPP protocol provides
    a standard method for transporting\nmulti-protocol datagrams over point-to-point
    links. It was \ndesigned to be used in serial point-to-point links. These ones\ncan
    be for example PSTN circuits, characterized by a fixed \nbandwidth and fixed delay.
    Hence, there was no need to specify QoS\nmechanisms for PPP: the IP layer (or
    more generally the network\nlayer) did not take into account the data-link layer
    to \ncalculate the available resources.\n\n\t "

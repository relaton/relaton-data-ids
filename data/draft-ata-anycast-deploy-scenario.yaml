  content: "   Today, the use of anycasting is quite limited. In this document we\n
    \  list possible deployment scenarios in IPv6 anycasting. We consider\n   three
    conditions based on the region of anycasting, and list possible\n   scenarios.
    For each scenario we also clarify example applications as\n   well as technical
    issues to be resolved.\n\t "

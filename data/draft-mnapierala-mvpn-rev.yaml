  content: "This document describes inter-site signaling procedures in MPLS/BGP \n
    \  IP VPNs that allow the same multicast stream to flow simultaneously \n   on
    multiple inter-PE paths without duplicates being sent to \n   receivers. Those
    procedures are independent of multicast tunnel \n   technology used in service
    provider network as well as of the \n   protocol used to exchange multicast signaling
    among PE's. The \n   document specifies necessary information elements and their
    exchange \n   process for the desired MVPN operation. \n\n\t "

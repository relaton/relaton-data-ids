  content: "   This draft presents ISO7816 interface for TLS1.3 stack running in\n
    \  secure element. It presents supported cipher suites and key exchange\n   modes,
    and describes embedded software architecture. TLS 1.3 is the\n   de facto security
    stack for emerging Internet of Things (IoT)\n   devices. Some of them are constraint
    nodes, with limited computing\n   resources. Furthermore cheap System on Chip
    (SoC) components usually\n   provide tamper resistant features, so private or
    pre shared keys are\n   exposed to hacking. According to the technology state
    of art, some\n   ISO7816 secure elements are able to process TLS 1.3, but with
    a\n   limited set of cipher suites. There are two benefits for TLS-SE;\n   first
    fully tamper resistant processing of TLS protocol, which\n   increases the security
    level insurance; second embedded software\n   component ready for use, which relieves
    the software of the burden\n   of cryptographic libraries and associated attacks.
    TLS-SE devices\n   may also embed standalone applications, which are accessed
    via\n   internet node, using a routing procedure based on SNI extension.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent,\nlocation-independent,
    resource identifiers.  This document serves as\nthe foundation of the 'urn' URI
    Scheme according to RFC 3986 and sets\nforward the canonical syntax for URNs,
    which subdivides URNs into\n\"namespaces\".  A discussion of both existing legacy
    and new\nnamespaces and requirements for URN presentation and transmission are\npresented.
    \ Finally, there is a discussion of URN equivalence and how\nto determine it.
    \ This document supersedes RFC 2141.\n\nThe requirements and procedures for URN
    Namespace registration\ndocuments are currently set forth in RFC 3406, which is
    also expected\nto be updated by an independent, revised specification.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis
    draft version has been obtained by importing the text from RFC\n2141 into modern
    tools and making a first round of updating steps.\nIt is intended to serve as
    one of the starting points for an effort\nto bring URN RFCs in alignment with
    STD 63, STD 68, BCP 26, and the\nrequirements from emerging distributed national
    and international URN\nresolution systems, and advance them on the IETF Standards
    Track.\n\nComments are welcome on the urn@ietf.org mailing list (or sent to the\ndocument
    editor).\n\t "

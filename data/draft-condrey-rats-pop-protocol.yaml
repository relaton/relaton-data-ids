abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Proof of Process (PoP) Transcript Format,
    a structured data model for recording the evolutionary history of a digital document.
    It defines a canonical set of semantic editing events (Insertion, Deletion, Move,
    Replacement) and a schema for Tool Receipts, allowing distinct contributors—including
    human authors, AI agents, and automated editors—to cryptographically sign their
    specific contributions within a single provenance chain. The protocol utilizes
    a hash-linked Provenance DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to ensure the integrity
    and ordering of events. This format enables Verifiers to reconstruct the document's
    lifecycle and apply flexible, policy-based logic to determine authorship attribution.
    It is designed to be content-aware but policy-agnostic, supporting diverse use
    cases ranging from academic integrity to software supply chain security.</p>"

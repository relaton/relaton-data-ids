abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In a transport network scenario, where Data Plane connections  \ncontrolled
    either by GMPLS (Soft Permanent Connections - SPC) or by  \nManagement System
    (Permanent Connections - PC) may independently  \ncoexist, the ability of transforming
    an existing PC into a SPC and  \nvice versa - without actually affecting Data
    Plane traffic being  \ncarried over it - is a valuable option. This applies especially
    when  \na GMPLS based Control Plane is first introduced into an existing  \nnetwork
    and there may be the need, from a Carrier point of view, to  \npass under GMPLS
    control existing connections already set up over  \nData Plane. In other terms,
    such operation could be seen as a way of  \ntransferring the ownership and control
    of an existing and in-use Data \nPlane connection between the Management Plane
    and the Control Plane,  \nleaving its Data Plane state untouched.  \nThis memo
    provides a minor extension to GRSVP-TE signaling protocol,  \nwithin GMPLS architecture,
    to enable such connection ownership  \ntransfer and describes the proposed procedures.
    \ \n  \n\n\n\n  \nConventions used in this document  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe

    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].\n\t "

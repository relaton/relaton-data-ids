    the 6Bone can remain a quality experimentation environment and to avoid pathological
    situations that have been encountered in the past.  It defines the 'best current
    practice' acceptable in the 6Bone for the configuration of both Interior Gateway
    Protocols and Exterior Gateway Protocols.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

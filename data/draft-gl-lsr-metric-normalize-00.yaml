abstract:
- content: "<p>When multiple links in a network have the same metric, they can serve
    as ECMP equivalent links for load balancing during forwarding. However, slight
    fluctuations in metric values can prevent the formation of ECMP equivalent links,
    leading to the idle state of suboptimal links and thus wasting bandwidth resources.
    This document proposes a method for normalizing metrics, allowing the slight fluctuations
    across multiple links to be adjusted so that the resulting calculated metrics
    become identical. This enables the formation of ECMP equivalent links, facilitating
    load distribution during forwarding.</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "   The 6LoWPAN and CoAP standards defined for resource-constrained\n   devices
    are fast emerging as the de-facto protocols for enabling the\n   Internet-of-Things
    (IoTs).  Security is an important concern in IoTs\n   and the DTLS protocol has
    been chosen as the preferred method for\n   securing CoAP messages.  DTLS is a
    point-to-point protocol relying on\n   the IP routing to deliver messages between
    the client and the server.\n   However in some low-power lossy networks (LLNs)
    with multi-hop, a new\n   \"joining\" device may not be initially IP routable
    until it is\n   authenticated to the network.  This prevents DTLS from being directly\n
    \  useful as an authentication and confidentiality protocol during this\n   stage,
    requiring other security protocols to be implemented on the\n   device.  These
    devices being resource-constrained often cannot\n   accommodate more than one
    security protocol in their code memory.  To\n   overcome this problem and reuse
    DTLS, we present a DTLS Relay\n   solution for the non-IP routable \"joining\"
    device to establish a\n   secure DTLS connection with a DTLS server.  Further
    we present a\n   stateful and stateless mode of operation for the DTLS Relay.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document will build a hierarchical YANG data model of SDN\n   controller/management
    platform, router/switch and host to monitor the\n   energy consumption of network
    devices and servers.  SDN controller/\n   management platform obtains data from
    routers/switches, and routers/\n   switches obtain data from hosts.  Therefore,
    in the overall\n   hierarchical structure, the SDN controller/management platform\n
    \  directly obtains energy consumption data of all routers/switches, and\n   indirectly
    obtains the specific energy consumption data of all hosts\n   through routers/switches.\n\n\t "

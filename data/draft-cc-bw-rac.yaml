  content: "Dynamic bandwidth management using ATM Resource Adjuster Cells provides\nthe
    capability to support fast effective end-to-end bandwidth control\nfor IP traffic
    transported over an ATM backbone network. This feature\ncan open up potential
    new services for Service Providers to offer\ndynamic service levels traffic agreements
    to their customers. By\noffering dynamic service levels, Service Providers can
    broaden their\nscope of service differentiation. For example, using dynamic bandwidth\nfeature,
    Service Providers can offer their customers real-time video or multimedia transport
    capability across the networks. \n\nUsing Dynamic Resource Adjuster Cells (DRACs),
    the network supporting it\ncan quickly adjust bandwidth without taking down the
    ATM network\nconnection and re-establishing it. In a fast changing dynamic\nenvironment,
    this dynamic adjuster capability makes a difference in\nboth performance and scalability.\n\t "

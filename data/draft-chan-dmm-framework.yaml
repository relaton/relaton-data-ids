  content: "   This document introduces a framework for mobility management\n   protocols
    in terms of their key, abstract logical functions.  We\n   explain how the framework
    is capable of presenting a unified view,\n   reducing the clutter that prevents
    a casual reader from understanding\n   the commonalities between different approaches
    in mobility\n   management.  A first order application of this framework is to
    enable\n   us to examine previously standardized mobility management protocols,\n
    \  such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their extensions),\n   and
    describe their core functionality in terms of different\n   configurations of
    the logical functions defined by the framework.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document summarizes a University thesis which aims to measure\nthe
    evolution over time of IPv6 traffic, to analyze the geographical\ndistribution
    of IPv6 nodes and to compare the two Internet Protocol\nversions on many different
    criteria (RTT, latency, MTU).  The\nmeasurements were done during the Summer 2009
    using a specific-\npurpose program which connects to the BitTorrent peer-to-peer\nnetwork.\n\nThe
    study was made in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks because they are\nresponsible for
    most Internet traffic and because their structure and\nfunctioning permit a rapid
    discovery of a large number of nodes from\nall over the world.  In addition, the
    P2P users are more likely to be\ninterested by IPv6 as IPv6 does not have the
    same NAT problems as\nIPv4.\n\t "

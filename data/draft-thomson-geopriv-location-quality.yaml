  content: "   Parameters that define the expected quality of location information\n
    \  are defined for use in location protocols.  These parameter can be\n   used
    by a requester to indicate to a Location Server quality\n   requirements for the
    location information that is requested.  The\n   Location Server is able to use
    this information to control how\n   location information is determined.  An optional
    indication of\n   whether the quality requirements were met is defined to be provided\n
    \  by the Location Server alongside location information.\n\n\t "

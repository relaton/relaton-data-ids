  content: "   This document provides a token binding extension for the Privacy Pass\n
    \  protocol.  This extension allows a Client to cryptographically bind a\n   Privacy
    Pass token to its own generated one-time public key during\n   the issuance flow,
    without exposing the public key to the Issuer.\n   Later, when spending the token
    during the redemption flow, the Client\n   must use the corresponding private
    key to generate a binding proof\n   that the Origin needs to additionally verify
    except the token itself,\n   where the proof generation can optionally support
    channel binding.\n   This proof constrains the legitimate presenter of the token
    to be\n   only the Client who holds the private key and further constrains the\n
    \  legitimate usage of the token to be only the Client's specific\n   channel
    when channel binding is used in the proof generation, and\n   thus can prevent
    token export and replay attacks.  In addition, the\n   token binding extension
    does not introduce additional cryptographic\n   primitives, and only uses the
    primitives currently utilized in the\n   issuance protocol to generate the one-time
    public-private keypair as\n   well as generate and verify the binding proof.\n\n\t "

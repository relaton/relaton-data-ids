  content: "   This document describes Confucius -- a practical queue management\n
    \  scheme designed for offering real-time flows with consistently low\n   latency
    regardless of competition.  Confucius employs an age-aware\n   weight adjustment
    mechanism to slows down bandwidth adjustment to\n   match the reaction of congestion
    control, so that the end host can\n   reduce the sending rate without overshooting
    the network.  Confucius\n   is deployed on home routers and requires no configuration
    in normal\n   Internet deployments.\n\n\t "

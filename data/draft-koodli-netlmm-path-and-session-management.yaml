  content: "In a distributed network environment such as a Proxy Mobile IPv6\ndomain,
    it is often necessary to know that a peer is alive and, if\nnot, detect quickly
    that a peer has failed and subsequently re-\nstarted.  It is also necessary to
    detect failures where only a subset\nof the existing mobility sessions are affected.
    \ Furthermore, failure\nindication should be possible without waiting for an explicit
    query\nfrom a peer.  This document outlines a protocol to address such path\nand
    session reliability for Proxy Mobile IPv6.\n\t "

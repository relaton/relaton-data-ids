  content: "This document provides considerations for some requirements on \nthe IPv6
    nodes using MIPv6  to communicate with their peers across\na network boundary
    where some specific packet filtering is \ndeployed for operator and service provider
    controlled access to  \nthe services and network resources. Depending on the operational
    \npolicies, the packet filtering can be applied on either the \nincoming packets
    or the outgoing packets or in both directions. \nA mobile node using MIPv6 sends
    packets with Home IP address in \nthe extension headers, while the packet filtering
    is often based \non either the source address or the destination address or both
    \nin the basic IPv6 header.Packet filtering that complies with the \npolicies
    from the mobility unaware applications will fail to \nperform properly due to
    the change of the source and destination \naddresses in the basic IPv6 header
    when MIPv6 is used. This \ndocument provides an analysis on the operation requirements
    on \npacket filtering and then proposes a simple solution that does \nnot impose
    any change on IPv6 but requires an  addition to IPv6 \nnodes using MIPv6.\n\t "

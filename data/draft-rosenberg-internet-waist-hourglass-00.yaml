  content: "One of the fundamental design principles of the Internet is that IP\nrepresents
    a common intermediate protocol layer, linking together a\nvariety of link layer
    technologies underneath with a large number of\napplications on top.  When drawn
    graphically, this can be show as an\nhourglass with IP in the middle.  The preponderence
    of NATs and\nfirewalls in the Internet has changed this reality, such that UDP
    and\nTCP are now the waist of the hourglass.  This document discusses this\nchange
    and describes its implications for protocol and application\ndesign.\n\t "

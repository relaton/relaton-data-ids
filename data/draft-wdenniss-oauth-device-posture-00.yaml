  content: "   Enterprise and security focused OAuth providers typically want\n   additional
    signals to confirm user presence when users return to\n   previously authorized
    apps.  Rather than requiring a full\n   reauthentication, or require enrollment
    in a mobile device management\n   solution, some authorization servers may be
    willing to accept device\n   posture signals from the app, like the fact that
    device has a lock\n   screen, as confirmation of user presence.  This document
    details how\n   OAuth native app clients can communicate device posture signals
    to\n   OAuth providers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A DNS lookup usually requires the recursive server to start an\n   iterative
    query process from the DNS root server to the bottom\n   authoritative server.
    \ Attacks may occur at any level when querying\n   authoritative servers.  If
    the DNS recursive resolver operator can\n   obtain the IP addresses of the authoritative
    servers for the queried\n   domain, they may want to query the authoritative server
    directly on\n   the recursive server.  In such a way, the resolver can start the\n
    \  iterative query process from the designated authoritative server,\n   greatly
    decreasing the round-trip time, avoiding the attacks on the\n   upper-level and
    preventing snooping by third parties of requests sent\n   to upper-level authoritative
    servers.  This document shows a\n   technique for querying the designated authoritative
    server directly\n   on the recursive server at the enterprise level, at the cost
    of\n   adding some operational fragility for the operator.\n\n\t "

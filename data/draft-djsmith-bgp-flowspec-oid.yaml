  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a modification to the validation procedure\n
    \  defined in RFC 5575 for the dissemination of BGP flow specifications.\n   RFC
    5575 requires that the originator of the flow specification\n   matches the originator
    of the best-match unicast route for the\n   destination prefix embedded in the
    flow specification. This allows\n   only BGP speakers within the data forwarding
    path (such as autonomous\n   system border routers) to originate BGP flow specifications.
    \ Though\n   it is possible to disseminate such flow specifications directly from\n
    \  border routers, it may be operationally cumbersome in an autonomous\n   system
    with a large number of border routers having complex BGP\n   policies. The modification
    proposed herein enables flow\n   specifications to be originated from a centralized
    BGP route\n   controller.\n\n\n\t "

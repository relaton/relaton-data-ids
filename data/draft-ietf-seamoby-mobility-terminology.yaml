  content: "There is a need for common definitions of terminology in the work to be
    done around IP mobility.  This document defines terms for mobility related terminology.
    \ The document originated out of work done in the Seamoby Working Group but has
    broader applicability for terminology used in IETF-wide discourse on technology
    for mobility and IP networks.  Other working groups dealing with mobility may
    want to take advantage of this terminology.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

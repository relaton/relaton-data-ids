  content: "   This document describes an extension to the Protocol Independent\n
    \  Multicast (PIM) multicast routing protocol that enables PIM proxying\n   from
    PIM domains toward other multicast domains.  It relies on PIM\n   Proxies located
    on domain borders and Proxy Controllers which can be\n   located anywhere.  This
    document describes how subscriptions can be\n   proxied toward domain's border
    interfaces using MLDv2 and IGMPv3, but\n   other protocols could be used as well.
    \ Once multicast traffic is\n   received on a proxied interface, it can be forwarded
    as if originated\n   by a directly connected source.\n\n\t "

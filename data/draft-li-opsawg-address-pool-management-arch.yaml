  content: "   IP addresses work as a basic element for providing broadband network\n
    \  services.  However, the increase in number, diversity and complexity\n   of
    modern network devices and services creates unprecedented\n   challenges for the
    currently prevailing approach of manual IP address\n   management.  Manually maintaining
    IP addresses could always be sub-\n   optimal for IP resource utilization.  Besides,
    it requires heavy\n   human effort from network operators.  To achieve high utilization
    and\n   flexible scheduling of IP network addresses, it is necessary to\n   automate
    the address scheduling process.  This document describes an\n   architecture for
    the IP address space management.  It includes\n   architectural concepts and components
    used in the CASM (Coordinated\n   Address Space Management), with a focus on those
    interfaces to be\n   standardized in the IETF.\n\n\t "

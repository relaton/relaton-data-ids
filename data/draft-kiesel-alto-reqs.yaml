  content: "Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as\npieces
    of information or server processes, which are available in\nseveral equivalent
    replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\nis not limited to, peer-to-peer
    file sharing applications.  The goal\nof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) is to provide\nguidance to applications, which have to select one or several
    hosts\nfrom a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired\nresource.
    \ This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect\nperformance and efficiency
    of the data transmission between the\nhosts, e.g., the topological distance.  The
    ultimate goal is to\nimprove performance (or Quality of Experience) in the application\nwhile
    reducing resource consumption in the underlying network\ninfrastructure.\n\nThis
    document enumerates requirements for ALTO, which should be\nconsidered when specifying,
    assessing, or comparing protocols and\nimplementations, and it solicits feedback
    and discussion.\n\t "

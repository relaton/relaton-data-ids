  script: Latn
  content: "   Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) is a new player towards autonomous\n
    \  vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  An SDV is\n   constructed
    by a software platform like a cloud-native system like\n   Kubernetes and has
    its internal network.  To facilitate the easy and\n   efficient configuration
    of networks in the SDV, an intent-based\n   management is an appropriate direction.
    \ This document proposes a\n   framework of intent-based management for networks,
    security, and\n   applications in SDVs so that they can communicate with other
    SDVs and\n   infrastructure nodes for safe driving and infotainment services in\n
    \  the road networks.\n\n\t "

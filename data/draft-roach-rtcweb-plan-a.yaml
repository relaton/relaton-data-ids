- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A recurrent theme in WebRTC has been the need to handle very large\n
    \  numbers of media flows.  Unfortunately, naive uses of SDP do not\n   handle
    this case particularly well.  This document describes a modest\n   set of extensions
    to SDP which allow it to cleanly handle arbitrary\n   numbers of flows while still
    retaining a large degree of backward\n   compatibility with existing and non-RTCWEB
    endpoints.\n\n\t "

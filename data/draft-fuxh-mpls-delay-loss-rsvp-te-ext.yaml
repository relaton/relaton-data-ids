  content: "   With more and more enterprises using cloud based services, the\n   distances
    between the user and the applications are growing.  For\n   multiple applications
    such as High Performance Computing and\n   Electronic Financial markets, the response
    times are critical as is\n   packet loss, while other applications require more
    throughput.  For\n   example, financial or trading companies are very focused
    on end-to-\n   end private pipe line delay optimizations that improve things 2-3
    ms.\n   Delay, jitter, loss and SLA (Service Level Agreement) are key\n   parameters
    that these \"high value\" customers use to select a private\n   pipe line provider.
    \ This document extends RSVP-TE protocol to\n   promote SLA experince of delay
    and packet loss application.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses a new form of Bi-directional PIM, a variant\nof
    PIM Sparse Mode [1] that builds bi-directional shared trees con-\nnecting multicast
    sources and receivers.\nThe ideas presented in this document are similar to those
    described\nin [2]. The main difference between the two proposals is in the\nmethod
    used to forward packets traveling upstream from a source to\nthe RP. In particular
    [2] uses an IP option (UMP option) on data\npackets to assist with upstream forwarding.
    The UMP option identifies\nthe next hop router responsible for forwarding the
    packet upstream.\nIn contrast, this proposal does not alter data packets to embed
    con-\ntrol information. Instead the identification of the next hop upstream\nforwarder
    is performed at RP discovery time using a fail-safe elec-\ntion mechanism. This
    significantly simplifies forwarding procedures\nand eliminates forwarding loops
    and packet duplication problems that\nexist in [2].\n\n\t "

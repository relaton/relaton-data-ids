  content: "The Calendaring Interoperability Protocol (CIP) provides a standard  mechanism
    for exchanging events and other information between scheduling systems. This allows
    users to schedule meetings with anyone else, no matter what scheduling software
    they use.                                  CIP is one of three standards under
    development by the Calendaring and Scheduling Working Group of the IETF. The other
    two are the Core Object Specification (COS), a standard data format for representing
    scheduled events, and the Calendaring Access Protocol (CAP), a standard mechanism
    that scheduling user agents may use to access user calendars (analogous to POP).\n\t "

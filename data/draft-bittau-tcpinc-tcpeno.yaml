  script: Latn
  content: "   Despite growing adoption of TLS [RFC5246], a significant fraction of\n
    \  TCP traffic on the Internet remains unencrypted.  The persistence of\n   unencrypted
    traffic can be attributed to at least two factors.\n   First, some legacy protocols
    lack a signaling mechanism (such as a\n   \"STARTTLS\" command) by which to convey
    support for encryption, making\n   incremental deployment impossible.  Second,
    legacy applications\n   themselves cannot always be upgraded, requiring a way
    to implement\n   encryption transparently entirely within the transport layer.
    \ The\n   TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO) addresses both of these\n
    \  problems through a new TCP option kind providing out-of-band, fully\n   backward-compatible
    negotiation of encryption.\n\n\t "

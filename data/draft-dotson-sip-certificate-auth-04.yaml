abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements for adding certificate authentication
    to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The use case addressed is that of a
    SIP device authenticating on behalf of configured users using a device certificate
    for purposes such as registration. This document is being presented with the intention
    of providing requirements to any potential solutions specifying certificate authentication
    within SIP networks. Supporting certificate authentication in SIP would provide
    strong authentication and increase the types of possible deployment scenarios.</p>"

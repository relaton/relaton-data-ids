  content: "This document describes domain-name-based service principal names and
    the corresponding name type for the Generic Security Service Application Programming
    Interface (GSS-API). Internationalization of the GSS-API is also covered.\n\n
    Domain-based service names are similar to host-based service names, but using
    a domain name (not necessarily an Internet domain name) in addition to a hostname.
    The primary purpose of domain-based names is to provide a measure of protection
    to applications that utilize insecure service discovery protocols. This is achieved
    by providing a way to name clustered services after the \"domain\" which they
    service, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's servers based
    on authentication of their service names. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

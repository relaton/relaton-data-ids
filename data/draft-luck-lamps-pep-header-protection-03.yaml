  content: "   Issues with email header protection in S/MIME have been recently\n
    \  raised in the IETF LAMPS Working Group.  The need for amendments to\n   the
    existing specification regarding header protection was expressed.\n\n   The pretty
    Easy privacy (pEp) implementations currently use a\n   mechanism quite similar
    to the currently standardized message\n   wrapping for S/MIME.  The main difference
    is that pEp is using PGP/\n   MIME instead, and adds space for carrying public
    keys next to the\n   protected message.\n\n   In LAMPS, it has been expressed
    that whatever mechanism will be\n   chosen, it should not be limited to S/MIME,
    but also applicable to\n   PGP/MIME.\n\n   This document aims to contribute to
    this discussion and share the pEp\n   implementation experience with email header
    protection.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP), as defined
    in\n   RFC 8762, along with its optional extensions specified in RFC 8972,\n   can
    be utilized for active measurement.  Networks may experience\n   transmission
    bit errors due to various factors, including poor fiber\n   quality.  Even with
    efficient CRC and FEC mechanisms, some bit errors\n   may escape detection and
    correction, referred to as residual bit\n   errors.  This document further augments
    the STAMP extensions\n   specified in RFC 8972 to enable the measurement of residual
    bit error\n   rate within the \"Extra Padding\" TLV of STAMP packets.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP), as defined in
    RFC 8762, along with its optional extensions specified in RFC 8972, can be utilized
    for active measurement. Networks may experience transmission bit errors due to
    various factors, including poor fiber quality. Even with efficient CRC and FEC
    mechanisms, some bit errors may escape detection and correction, referred to as
    residual bit errors. This document further augments the STAMP extensions specified
    in RFC 8972 to enable the measurement of residual bit error rate within the "Extra
    Padding" TLV of STAMP packets.</p>

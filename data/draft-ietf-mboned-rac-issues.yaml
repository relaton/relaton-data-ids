  content: "This memo evaluates the extent to which current multicasting \nprotocols
    can be used to address common requirements for commercial, \nlarge-scale IP multicasting,
    but may be applicable to non-commercial \ndeployments as well.  Four existing
    possible multicasting \narchitectures (with or without some form of access or
    content \ncontrol) are presented. Then each architecture is analyzed with \nrespect
    to how it can or cannot satisfactorily address each issue.  \nThis memo concludes
    that for many of these issues the possible \narchitectures based on present standards
    as they now exist require \nnon-standardized solutions to meet common use requirements.
    This \nmemo recommends for requirements to be defined that would set the \ngroundwork
    for framework(s) and solutions that sufficiently address \nthese limitations.

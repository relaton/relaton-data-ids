  content: "Mobile Ad Hoc Networks need an auto-configuration protocol being able\nto
    satisfy their self-deployment requirements while remaining\nflexible enough to
    accommodate special features for different\ndevices.\n\nThe Extensible Manet Auto-configuration
    Protocol (EMAP) tries to\nfullfil these requirements both for IPv4 and IPv6 mobile
    ad hoc\nnetworks.  It provides auto-configuration mechanisms for isolated as\nwell
    as hybrid MANETs, and is envisioned to be integrated within\nunicast routing protocols
    (like DYMO [1] or OLSRv2 [2]).\n\nEMAP allows nodes to create a (highly likely)
    unique IP address which\ncan be used locally inside the MANET.  In a similar way,
    nodes can\nauto-configure globally routable IP addresses when one (or more)\ngateways
    to the Internet are present in the network.  The general\nframework provided by
    the protocol may be used as a service discovery\nprotocol for MANETs.  As an example,
    this document also specifies an\noptional feature which consists on the discovery
    of DNS servers\nreachable from the MANET.  However, the approach is extensible
    to\nother services like SIP proxies, authentication entities, etc.\nTherefore,
    EMAP has been designed taking into consideration the\npossibility of extending
    it later on with new features, uses, and\noptimizations.\n\t "

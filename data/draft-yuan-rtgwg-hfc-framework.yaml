  content: "   With the maturity of cloud native application development,\n   applications
    can be decomposed into finer grained atomic services.\n   On the other hand, as
    a distributed computing paradigm, fine grained\n   micro-services could be deployed
    and implemented in a distributive\n   way among edges to make computing, storage
    and run-time processing\n   capabilities as close to users as possible to provide
    satisfied QoE.\n   Under the circumstances analyzed, a Hybrid-Function-Chain (HFC)\n
    \  framework is proposed in this draft, aiming to wisely allocate and\n   schedule
    resources and services in order to provide consistent end-\n   to-end service
    provisioning.\n\n\t "

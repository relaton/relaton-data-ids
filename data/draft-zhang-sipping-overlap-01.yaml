  content: "   Overlap signalling is a traditional feature in telecom network.  RFC\n
    \  3578 addresses how to implement it in a SIP network.  It mainly\n   introduce
    the method to carry subsequent dialed number in INVITE.\n   But there are still
    some issues for it.  This document gives a\n   detailed discussion on another
    method based on INFO.  It can be\n   treated as a supplementary for RFC 3578.\n\n\t "

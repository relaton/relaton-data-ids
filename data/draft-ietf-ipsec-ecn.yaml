  content: "IPsec supports secure communication over potentially insecure network\ncomponents
    such as intermediate routers.  IPsec protocols support two\noperating modes, transport
    mode and tunnel mode.  Explicit Congestion\nNotification (ECN) is an experimental
    addition to the IP architecture\nthat provides notification of onset of congestion
    to delay- or loss-\nsensitive applications.  ECN provides congestion notifications
    to\nenable adaptation to network conditions without the impact of dropped\npackets
    [RFC 2481].  The use of two bits in the IPsec header for ECN\nexperimentation
    conflicts with header processing at IPsec tunnel\nendpoints in a manner that makes
    ECN unusable in the presence of\nIPsec tunnels.  This document considers issues
    related to this\nconflict, describes two alternative solutions, and updates the
    IPsec\narchitecture [RFC 2401] to include these alternatives.  Support for\none
    or the other of these alternatives is REQUIRED to remove the\nunderlying conflict.\n\t "

  content: "While the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) supports public
    key based authentication, the corresponding use of in-band Certificate Revocation
    Lists (CRL) is problematic due to unbounded CRL size. The size of an Online Certificate
    Status Protocol (OCSP) response is however well-bounded and small. This document
    defines the \"OCSP Content\" extension to IKEv2. A CERTREQ payload with \"OCSP
    Content\" identifies zero or more trusted OCSP responders and is a request for
    inclusion of an OCSP response in the IKEv2 handshake. A cooperative recipient
    of such a request responds with a CERT payload containing the appropriate OCSP
    response. This content is recognizable via the same \"OCSP Content\" identifier.\n\n
    When certificates are used with IKEv2, the communicating peers need a mechanism
    to determine the revocation status of the peer's certificate. OCSP is one such
    mechanism. This document applies when OCSP is desired and security policy prevents
    one of the IKEv2 peers from accessing the relevant OCSP responder directly. Firewalls
    are often deployed in a manner that prevents such access by IKEv2 peers outside
    of an enterprise network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

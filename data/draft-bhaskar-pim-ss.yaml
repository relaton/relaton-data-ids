  content: "Source-Specific PIM (PIM-SS) is a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that only\nbuilds
    source specific shortest path trees. These trees are built\ndirectly on receiving
    group membership reports that request a given\nsource. PIM-SS precludes the building
    of shared trees, effectively par-\ntitioning the different source trees from one
    another. For this reason\nit is specifically suited for existing multicast applications
    for which\nthere is expected and intended to be exactly one source.\n\nSource-Specific
    PIM can co-exist with PIM-SM. It uses a subset of PIM-SM\nmessages and lends itself
    to incremental deployment.\n\n\t "

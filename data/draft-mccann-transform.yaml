  content: "The deployment of Mobile IP in a wide area network presents several\nchallenges,
    not the least of which is how to provide subscribers\nwith secure access to remote
    private networks.  This draft outlines\nmechanisms whereby the home and visited
    network may negotiate the\nuse of IP transforms, such as IP Security ESP and AH
    protocols, on\nthe Mobile IP redirection tunnels.  These mechanisms allow for
    the\nsecure distribution of both keys and policies through a DIAMETER AAA\ninfrastructure,
    obviating the need for other forms of key\ndistribution or policy negotiation.
    \ The mechanisms are extensible\nto other kinds of IP transforms, such as IP Compression.\n\n\t "

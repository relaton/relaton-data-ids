  content: "   This memo describes how to make addresses of DNS servers\n   preconfigured
    in clients.  Well known anycast addresses, which are\n   assigned to DNS servers,
    should be preconfigured to resolvers of\n   clients. It is also explained why
    anycast does not offer redundancy.\n\t "

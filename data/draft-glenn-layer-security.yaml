  content: "The Internet has been moving towards a more standardized and open infrastructure
    to cope with its growing requirements.  One requirement of particular interest
    and importance is that of network security.  With the possible addition of CLNP
    [ISO8473] as a connectionless network protocol for the Internet the most useful
    solution is an integrated network security protocol that will provide security
    services and mechanisms for both IP and CLNP.                                                          The
    protocol defined by this Internet Draft is used to provide security services in
    support of an instance of communication between network layer entities for either
    IP or CLNP.  An attempt is made to keep the functionality as close as possible
    to [ISO11577].  As a result this specification contains all of the technical complexities
    and problems of [ISO11577].  Editorial comments are included to address certain
    technical issues, such as headers ending on word boundaries, type-length-value
    encoding problems, etc.  that may be outside the scope of [ISO11577].  This specification
    should be viewed as an initial attempt at identifying a protocol that can provide
    a set of security services for both IPV4 and CLNP\n\t "

  content: "Object Naming Service (ONS) is a network service that leverages\n   Domain
    Name System (DNS) to discover information about a product and\n   related services
    from the Electronic Product Code (EPC).  Extensible\n   Supply-chain Discovery
    Service (ESDS) is an application layer\n   protocol for the distributed sharing
    and discovery of notification\n   events between associated partners within a
    supply chain.  Unlike DNS\n   or ONS, where there is a known set of root servers,
    ESDS will have\n   numerous roots for various supply chains operating globally.
    \ ONS can\n   be used in collaboration with ESDS to make the multiple ESDS roots
    be\n   found easily.  This document is intended to extend the ONS to support\n
    \  ESDS by defining a new Naming Authority PoinTeR (NAPTR) service type\n   of
    ONS for ESDS.\n\n\t "

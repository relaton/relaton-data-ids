  content: "   As Internet audience sizes for high-interest live events reach\n   unprecedented
    levels and bitrates climb to support 4K/8K/AR, live\n   streaming can place a
    unique type of stress upon network resources.\n   TreeDN is a tree-based CDN architecture
    designed to address the\n   distinctive scaling challenges of live streaming to
    mass audiences.\n   TreeDN enables operators to offer Replication-as-a-Service
    (RaaS) at\n   a fraction the cost of traditional, unicast-based CDNs- in some\n
    \  cases, at no additional cost to the infrastructure.  In addition to\n   efficiently
    utilizing network resources to deliver existing multi-\n   destination traffic,
    this architecture also enables new types of\n   content and use cases that previously
    weren't possible or\n   economically viable using traditional CDN approaches.
    \ Finally,\n   TreeDN is a decentralized architecture and a democratizing technology\n
    \  for content distribution.\n\n\t "

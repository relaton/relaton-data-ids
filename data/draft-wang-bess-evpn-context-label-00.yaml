  content: "   EVPN is designed to provide a better VPLS service than [RFC4761] and\n
    \  [RFC4762],and EVPN indeed introduced many new features which couldn't\n   be
    achieved in those old VPLS implementions.But EVPN didn't inherit\n   all features
    of old VPLS, and a few issues arises for EVPN only.\n\n   Some of these issues
    can be imputed to the MP2P nature of EVPN\n   labels.The PW label in old VPLS
    is a label for P2P VC, so it contains\n   more context than a identifier in dataplane
    for it's VSI instance.But\n   the EVPN label just identifies it's VSI instnace
    and it can't stand\n   for the ingress PE in dataplane.  So the following issues
    arises with\n   MPLS EVPN service:\n\n   MPLS EVPN statistics can't be done per
    ingress PE.\n\n   MPLS EVPN can't support hub/spoke use case which the spoke PE
    can\n   only connect to each other by the hub PE.\n\n   MPLS EVPN can't support
    AR REPLICATOR.\n\n   MPLS EVPN can't support anycast SR-MPLS tunnel on the SPE
    nodes.\n\n   This document introduces a compound label stack to take advantage
    of\n   both P2P VC and MP2P evpn labels.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a HTTP authentication scheme using PPP \n\nExtensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP).  \n\nHTTP EAP authentication enables HTTP connections
    to be authenticated \n\nusing any of the authentication schemes supported through
    EAP. EAP \n\nperforms the authentication without sending the password in the \n\nclear
    text format (which is the biggest weakness of the Basic HTTP \n\nauthentication
    scheme, for example).  \n\nEAP is useful for HTTP protocol because it opens up
    several new \n\nauthentication schemes without additional specification work.
    The \n\nsame benefits can be reached by any other protocols, which apply \n\nHTTP
    authentication, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\n\t "

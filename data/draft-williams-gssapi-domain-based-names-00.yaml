  content: "   This document describes domainname-based service principal names and\n
    \  the corresponding name type for the GSS-API.\n\n   Domain-based service names
    are similar to host-based service names,\n   but using a domain name (not necessarily
    and Internat domain name)\n   instead of or in addition to a hostname.  The primary
    purpose of\n   domain-based service names is to provide a way to name clustered\n
    \  services after the domain which they service, thereby allowing their\n   clients
    to authorize the service's servers based on authentication of\n   their names.\n\t "

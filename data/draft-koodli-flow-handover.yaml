  content: "With interface multihoming, Mobile Nodes are capable of simultaneous\nattachment
    to multiple radio access networks.  This enables a network\nnode such as the Local
    Mobility Anchor to distribute the application\ntraffic to interfaces that can
    best serve them.  This document\nspecifies a network-controlled protocol to handover
    application flows\nfrom one interface to another.  Such control could provide
    better\nexperience for end users and better traffic management for network\noperators.\n\t "

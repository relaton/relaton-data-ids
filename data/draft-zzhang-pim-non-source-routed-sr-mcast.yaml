  content: "   With Segment Routing (SR) architecture, a unicast flow can be source-\n
    \  routed through an SR network following an explicit path specified in\n   the
    packet, w/o the need for per-flow state in the network.  As a\n   result, the
    otherwise needed protocols to signal the per-flow unicast\n   state can also be
    removed from the network.  In the case of\n   multicast, traffic can be either
    source-routed or non-source-routed,\n   and this document discusses non-sourced-routed
    options for multicast\n   in an SR network with either MPLS or IPv6/SRv6 data
    plane.\n\n\t "

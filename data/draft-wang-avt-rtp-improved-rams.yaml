  content: "This document describes two improvements to unicast based rapid \nacquisition
    of multicast RTP sessions (RAMS) described in [I-\nD.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].
    \ One improved method allows \na receiver to simultaneously request a unicast
    burst stream and \njoin the multicast group, and then select one of the two streams
    to \nbe first processed. Another method proposes to optionally convey a \nparameter
    called unicast backspace in the RAMS-I message. This \nparameter can be used by
    RR to determine when to join the primary \nmulticast session.\n\t "

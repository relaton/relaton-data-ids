  content: "   The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the concept\n
    \  of link-layer resources in LLNs.  Nodes are synchronized and follow a\n   schedule.
    \ A time slot in that schedule corresponds to an atomic\n   link-layer resource,
    and can be allocated to any pair of neighbors in\n   the network.  This allows
    the schedule to be built to tightly match\n   each node's bandwidth, latency and
    energy constraints, while ensuring\n   collision-free communication.  The [IEEE802154e]
    standard does not,\n   however, present a mechanism to do so, as building and
    managing the\n   schedule is out of the standard's scope.  Routing layers such
    as the\n   IETF IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provide a mechanism to\n
    \  route multipoint-to-point traffic (from devices inside the LLN\n   towards
    a central control point) and point-to-multipoint traffic\n   (from the central
    control point to the devices inside the LLN).\n   Network layer overlays cannot
    be optimized and adapted to take\n   advantage of the cell-based topology created
    by the underlying TSCH\n   MAC layer as a missing set of functionalities need
    to be defined.\n   This document describes the 6TSCH Operation Sublayer (6top)
    and the\n   main commands it provides to upper network layers such as RPL or\n
    \  GMPLS.  The set of functionalities includes feedback metrics from\n   cell
    states so network layers can take routing decisions, TSCH\n   configuration and
    control procedures, and the support for centralized\n   and decentralized scheduling
    policies.  In addition, 6top can be\n   configured to enable packet switching
    at layer 2.5, analogous to\n   GMPLS.  Once a multi-hop track is defined, input
    cells can be mapped\n   to output cells and packets can be relayed without the
    need of higher\n   layer routing. 6top defines the operations so input cells and
    output\n   cells can be mapped and the configuration maintained.\n\n\t "

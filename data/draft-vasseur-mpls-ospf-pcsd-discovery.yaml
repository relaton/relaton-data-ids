  content: "This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE to support a new \nmessage
    type called a 'Path computation' message.  This message is to \nbe used between
    an LSR and a Path Computation Server, which may be an \nLSR or a centralized path
    computation tool. An RSVP Path Computation \nRequest message is used by the head-end
    LSR to send its request to \nthe Path Computation Server. The Path Computation
    Server in turn \nsends an RSVP Path Computation Reply message containing either:
    \n- a positive reply, containing one or more paths, if the request \ncan be satisfied.
    \n- a negative reply if no path obeying the requested constraints \ncan be found.
    The Path Computation Server may also optionally \nsuggest new constraint values
    for which one or several paths \ncould be found. \nThere are many situations where
    a Path Computation Server may be \nused. A typical example is in the context of
    Inter-area MPLS TE. A \nhead-end LSR could request that a Path Computation Server
    compute one \nor more paths obeying a specified set of constraints for a TE LSP
    \nspanning multiple areas. The path computation server could be a \ncentralized
    path computation server or an ABR. Another example is the \nuse of a Path Computation
    Server to compute diversely routed paths \nbetween two end points.  This may be
    useful in the context of MPLS TE \nLSP Path protection or GMPLS LSP Path protection.
    The computation of \nMulti-constraints paths requires intensive CPU resources,
    and may be \nyet another usage example. Lastly, those protocol extensions could
    be \nused as a 'UNI' like protocol between a CE (Customer Edge equipment) \nand
    a PE (Provider Edge equipment) where the CE is not part of the \nPE's IGP domain.\n\t "

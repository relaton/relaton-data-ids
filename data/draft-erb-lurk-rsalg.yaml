  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a protocol between a content provider and an\n
    \  external key owner that enables the provider to act as a TLS\n   termination
    end-point for the key owner, without having the key\n   actually being provisioned
    at the provider.\n\n   The protocol between the two preserves forward secrecy,
    and is also\n   designed to prevent the use of the key owner as a general-purpose\n
    \  signing oracle which would make it complicit in attacks against uses\n   of
    the very keys it is trying to protect.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) are formally part of the\n
    \  IPv6 Global Unicast address space.  However, the semantics of ULAs\n   clearly
    contradict the definition of \"global scope\".  This document\n   discusses the
    why the terminology employed for the specification of\n   ULAs is problematic,
    along with some practical consequences of the\n   current specification of ULAs.
    \ Finally, it formally updates RFC4291\n   and RFC4193 such that the scope of
    ULAs is defined as \"local\".\n\n\t "

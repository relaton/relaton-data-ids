  content: "This draft addresses the need for a common, advanced, client\nprogramming
    interface to mainframe host data.  Application\ndevelopers, in particular third
    party application vendors, use\nAPI's provided by client emulator programs to
    write applications\nthat access host data.  Currently, the defacto standard HLLAPI
    is\nthe interface most commonly provided by these programs and the one\nused by
    the third party application vendors.    However, HLLAPI is\nplagued by the fact
    that it doesn't exploit modern programming\ntechniques and is fragmented by multiple,
    proprietary\nimplementations.  Client vendors have, over the last couple of years,\ndeveloped
    more advanced interfaces that exploit modern programming\nadvances.  However no
    effort has been put into standardizing these\ninterfaces and application developers
    have been forced to either\nchose to stay with HLLAPI or perform costly re-implementation
    of\ntheir products to support each competing advanced client API.\n\t "

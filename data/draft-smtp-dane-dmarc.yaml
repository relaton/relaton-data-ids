abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   An end-to-end email security solution is proposed by implementing\n
    \  both DANE and DMARC protocols.  DMARC enables the recipient's mail\n   server,
    with a method to verify the sender's ingenuity.  DANE intends\n   to mitigate
    the MITM attack, by enabling the sender a method to\n   authenticate the recipient's
    mail domain.  DANE and DMARC therefore\n   complement each other by allowing the
    sender to verify the\n   recipient's domain, and the recipient to verify the sender's
    address\n   respectively.\n\n\t "

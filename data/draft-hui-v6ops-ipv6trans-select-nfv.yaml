  content: "   Nowadays, many IPv6 transition technologies have been proposed, such\n
    \  as Dual-Stack, 6rd and so on.  A CPE may support some of them\n   instead of
    only one.  But the ISPs always support different kinds of\n   transition technologies,
    such as Dual-Stack, DS-lite and so on.  So\n   they must control all the CPEs
    to match the exact transition tech\n   through some standard messages. When the
    ISP network uses NFV, the\n   message communication will between the network gateway
    and the V-CPE\n   to configure the IPv6 transition technology in CPE.\n\n\t "

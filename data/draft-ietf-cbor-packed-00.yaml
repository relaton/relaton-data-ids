  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data\n
    \  format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n   code
    size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need for version
    negotiation.\n\n   CBOR does not provide any forms of data compression.  CBOR
    data\n   items, in particular when generated from legacy data models often\n   allow
    considerable gains in compactness when applying data\n   compression.  While traditional
    data compression techniques such as\n   DEFLATE (RFC 1951) work well for CBOR,
    their disadvantage is that the\n   receiver needs to unpack the compressed form
    to make use of data.\n\n   This specification describes Packed CBOR, a simple
    transformation of\n   a CBOR data item into another CBOR data item that is almost
    as easy\n   to consume as the original CBOR data item.  A separate decompression\n
    \  step is therefore often not required at the receiver.\n\n\t "

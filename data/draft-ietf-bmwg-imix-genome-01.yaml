abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Benchmarking Methodologies have always relied on test conditions with\n
    \  constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network\n   device
    capability has been tested.  Tests with constant packet size\n   reveal device
    capabilities but differ significantly from the\n   conditions encountered in operational
    deployment, and so additional\n   tests are sometimes conducted with a mixture
    of packet sizes, or\n   \"IMIX\".  The mixture of sizes a networking device will
    encounter is\n   highly variable and depends on many factors.  An IMIX suited
    for one\n   networking device and deployment will not be appropriate for another.\n
    \  However, the mix of sizes may be known and the tester may be asked to\n   augment
    the fixed size tests.  To address this need, and the\n   perpetual goal of specifying
    repeatable test conditions, this draft\n   defines a way to specify the exact
    repeating sequence of packet sizes\n   from the usual set of fixed sizes, and
    other forms of mixed size\n   specification.\n\n\n\t "

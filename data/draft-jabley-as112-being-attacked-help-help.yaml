  content: "   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses which\n
    \  are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in\n   RFC1918
    for private use within individual sites.\n\n   Hosts should never normally send
    reverse DNS queries for those\n   addresses on the public Internet.  However,
    such queries are\n   frequently observed.  Authority servers are deployed to provide\n
    \  authoritative answers to such queries as part of a loosely-\n   coordinated
    effort known as the AS112 project.\n\n   Since queries sent to AS112 servers are
    usually not intentional, the\n   replies received back from those servers are
    typically unexpected.\n   Unexpected inbound traffic can trigger alarms on intrusion
    detection\n   systems and firewalls, and operators of such systems often mistakenly\n
    \  believe that they are being attacked.\n\n   This document provides background
    information and technical advice to\n   those firewall operators.\n\t "

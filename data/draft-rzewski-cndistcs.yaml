- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "One of the goals of 'content peering' is to allow content providers\nincreased
    control of content presentation in remote networks. In\norder to provide this,
    simple, commonly accepted implementations are\nrequired for content providers
    to originate control messages\n('content signals'), for intermediate networks
    to relay them, and for\nedge networks to receive and act on them. This draft proposes
    such an\nimplementation specifically for the control of HTTP content\n\t "

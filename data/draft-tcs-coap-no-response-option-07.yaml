abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There can be typical M2M scenarios where responses from the data\n
    \  sink to the data source against request from the source might be\n   considered
    redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with no\n   reverse path from the
    sink to the source) may be desired while\n   updating resources in constrained
    systems looking for maximized\n   throughput with minimized resource consumption.
    CoAP already\n   provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of exchange where the\n
    \  receiving end-point does not respond with ACK. However, the\n   receiving end-point
    responds the sender with a status code\n   indicating \"the result of the attempt
    to understand and satisfy the\n   request\".\n\n   This draft introduces a header
    option: 'No-Response' to suppress\n   responses from the receiver and discusses
    exemplary use cases which\n   motivated this proposition based on real experience.
    This option\n   also provides granularity by allowing suppression of a typical
    class\n   or a combination of classes of responses. This option may be\n   effective
    for both unicast and multicast scenarios.\n\n\t "

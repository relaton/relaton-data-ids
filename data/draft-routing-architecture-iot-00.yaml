  content: "The IETF ROLL Working Group has specified a routing protocol designed\nfor
    the Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN) also referred to as IP\nsmart objects networks
    or the \"Internet of things\".  Still, the\ndebate of where routing functions
    should occur within the network\nstack tend to get revived on a regular basis.
    \ A mesh-under approach\nplaces routing functions in the link layer to emulate
    a single\nbroadcast domain where all devices appear as immediate neighbors to\nthe
    network layer.  In contrast, a route-over approach places all\nrouting functions
    at the network layer, following the IP\narchitecture.\n\nFor LLNs, a mesh-under
    approach may seem simple and attractive\nbecause it seeks to hide characteristics
    of multi-hop communication\nthrough the LLN from the network layer.  However,
    resource\nconstraints and dynamic link characteristics limit to what extent\nlink-layer
    routing can hide those characteristics.  This document\npresents architectural
    issues of using a mesh-under approach in LLNs\nand how a route-over approach does
    not suffer from these issues.\n\t "

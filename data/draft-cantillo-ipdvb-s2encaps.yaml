  content: "This document describes a framework for the transmission of IP\n   datagrams
    over DVB-S2, the second generation standard for Digital\n   Video Broadcasting
    over Satellite.  The new standard features an\n   improved and adaptive physical
    layer, as well as a new framing\n   structure at link level, the Generic Streams.
    \ Combined use of\n   adaptability and Generic Streams is expected to offer throughputs\n
    \  never achieved for IP services up to now, but no standard way to\n   carry
    IP data using the specific features of DVB-S2 has been\n   published up to date.
    \ The present document analyzes these issues,\n   and it identifies the requirements
    for the definition of a standard\n   interface between the DVB-S2 link layer and
    an IP subnetwork.\n\t "

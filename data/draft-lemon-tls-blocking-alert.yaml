  content: "   Hosts connecting to the Internet should generally be able to connect\n
    \  to all available services.  However, as a matter of policy, need or\n   preference,
    some services may be blocked by the network.  TLS\n   correctly treats attempts
    to communicate the reason for such blockage\n   to the client as an attack.  This
    memo describes a safe way for hosts\n   to be notified using the TLS alert mechanism
    that a connection has\n   been blocked by the network.\n\n\t "

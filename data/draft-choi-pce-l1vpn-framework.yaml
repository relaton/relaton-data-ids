  content: "   When path computation is done in the management systems for Layer 1\n
    \  Virtual Private Networks (L1 VPNs), it would be important that \n   resource
    information is synchronized between the management systems \n   and the Provider
    Edge /Provider (PE/P). This draft looks at such a\n   scenario from the viewpoint
    of the Path Computation Element Metric\n   Protocol (PCEMP) that acts a generic
    computation model for path\n   based metrics in large multi-domain or multi-layer
    networks. This \n   draft shows how PCEMP messages might help preserving the path
    \n   computational entities in the L1 VPN peer nodes. \n\n   This draft proposes
    to show how a L1 VPN framework may be included\n   within the scope of Path Computation
    Element architectures and is\n   derived primarily from the motivation of per
    VPN peer service \n   solutions using PCE techniques. PCEMP metrics defining path
    quality \n   measurement criteria, algorithm complexity and scalability criteria
    \n   for L1 VPNs is in line with the functional specifications of \n   Generalized
    Traffic Engineered LSP path computation techniques \n   involving Path Computation
    Element(s) of the PCE WG Charter. \n\n\t "

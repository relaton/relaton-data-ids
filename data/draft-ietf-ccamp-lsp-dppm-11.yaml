abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is one of the most
    promising candidate technologies for a future data transmission network. GMPLS
    has been developed to control and operate different kinds of network elements,
    such as conventional routers, switches, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
    (DWDM) systems, Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs),
    optical cross- connects (OXCs), etc. These physically diverse devices differ drastically
    from one another in dynamic provisioning ability. At the same time, the need for
    dynamically provisioned connections is increasing because optical networks are
    being deployed in metro areas. As different applications have varied requirements
    in the provisioning performance of optical networks, it is imperative to define
    standardized metrics and procedures such that the performance of networks and
    application needs can be mapped to each other. This document provides a series
    of performance metrics to evaluate the dynamic Label Switched Path (LSP) provisioning
    performance in GMPLS networks, specifically the dynamic LSP setup/release performance.
    These metrics can be used to characterize the features of GMPLS networks in LSP
    dynamic provisioning. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"

  content: "   In-network computing has gained a lot of attention and been widely\n
    \  investigated as a research area in the past few years, due to the\n   exposure
    of data plane programmability to application developers and\n   network operators.
    \ After several years of trials and research, some\n   of in-network computing
    capabilities, or to say In-Network Computing\n   Functions (ICF) have been proved
    to be effective and very beneficial\n   for networked systems and applications,
    like machine learning and\n   data analysis, and these capabilities have been
    gradually\n   commercialized.  However, there still lacks a general framework
    and\n   standardized interfaces to register, configure, manage and monitor\n   these
    ICFs.  This document focuses on the applicability of ICFs in a\n   limited domain
    in [RFC8799], e.g., data center networks, and\n   describes a framework for orchastrating,
    managing, and monitoring\n   these ICFs.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document updates RFC6761 by requiring that the domain\n   \"localhost.\"
    and any names falling within \".localhost.\" resolve to\n   loopback addresses.
    \ This would allow other specifications to join\n   regular users in drawing the
    common-sense conclusions that\n   \"localhost\" means \"localhost\", and doesn't
    resolve to somewhere else\n   on the network.\n\n\t "

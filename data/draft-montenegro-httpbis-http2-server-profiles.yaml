  script: Latn
  content: "   In HTTP/2.0, if running over TLS, the client is the first to\n   transmit
    HTTP/2.0 frames on the new session. With its first\n   transmission to the server,
    the client can already overrun some\n   of the server settings and preferences,
    leading to failure\n   conditions and unnecessary complexity. This document proposes
    a\n   solution to this problem based on a very small set of server\n   profiles
    for initial settings sent within the TLS handshake.\n\n\t "

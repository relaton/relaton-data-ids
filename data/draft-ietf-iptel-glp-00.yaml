  script: Latn
  content: "   Given a gateway and a (possibly empty) list  of  gateway  attributes,\n
    \  the 'gateway location problem' is to find a gateway serving the given\n   phone
    number that satisfies the attribute set.  This problem has also\n   been referred
    to as the 'call routing problem' as the answer returned\n   may not be an IP-PSTN
    gateway but an intermediate signaling server.\n\n   Part  of  the  solution  to
    \ this  problem  is  the  maintenance  and\n   distribution  of  the call routing
    tables.  This document describes a\n   protocol for maintaining a distributed
    call routing  database  across\n   multiple  administrative domains.  The protocol
    uses the Server Cache\n   Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) to maintain the distributed
    database.\n   This  document  describes  the  problem  of  gateway  location  and
    a\n   potential solution that uses SCSP as the foundation for  distributing\n
    \  the call routing tables.\n\n\t "

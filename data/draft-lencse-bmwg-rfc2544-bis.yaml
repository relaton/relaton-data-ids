  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 2544 has defined a benchmarking methodology for network\n   interconnect
    devices.  We recommend a few upgrades to it for\n   producing more reasonable
    results.  The recommended upgrades can be\n   classified into two categories:
    the application of the novelties of\n   RFC 8219 for the legacy RFC 2544 use cases
    and the following new\n   ones.  Checking a reasonably small timeout individually
    for every\n   single frame in the throughput and frame loss rate benchmarking\n
    \  procedures.  Performing a statistically relevant number of tests for\n   all
    benchmarking procedures.  Addition of an optional non-zero frame\n   loss acceptance
    criterion for the throughput measurement procedure\n   and defining its reporting
    format.\n\n\t "

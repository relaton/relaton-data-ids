  content: "   Flooding is useful for many reasons in ad hoc networks, but\n   causes
    congestion that can block traffic.  Selecting multi-point\n   relays (MPRs) reduces
    congestion due to flooding, but has several\n   disadvantages.  It is possible
    to select a subset of the MPRs to\n   do the same job more effectively.  In this
    document, signaling is\n   specified for identifying a relatively small connected
    dominating set\n   that can still manage the flooding operation.\n\t "

  content: "Several techniques are being developed which use IS-IS to deliver \n     link
    state based layer 2 forwarding. The superset of the extensions \n     proposed
    to IS-IS to allow these capabilities is found in [IS-IS-\n     L2].  One technique
    for layer 2 forwarding is being specified in \n     the IEEE 802.1aq task group,
    under the over-arching title \n     of \"Shortest Path Bridging\" (SPB). SPB however
    only requires a \n     subset of the proposed IS-IS extensions in [IS-IS-L2].
    For clarity \n     this informational draft documents only the subset required
    by SPB. \n     In addition a high level introduction, describing how these TLVs
    \n     are used is provided for those who do not follow the IEEE work in \n     detail.
    A reference is also given to the normative IEEE 802.1aq \n     document  The ordering
    of material in this document follows that of \n     Clause 28 of IEEE 802.1aq,
    to aid cross-referencing. \n\n\t "

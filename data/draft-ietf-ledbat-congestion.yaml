  content: "Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) is an experimental delay-based
    congestion control algorithm that seeks to utilize the available bandwidth on
    an end-to-end path while limiting the consequent increase in queueing delay on
    that path.  LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion
    that the flow itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is designed for use by background
    bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion
    control (as specified in RFC 5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows,
    thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

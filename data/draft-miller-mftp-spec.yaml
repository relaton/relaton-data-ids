  content: "  The Multicast File Transfer Protocol (MFTP) is a protocol that\n  operates
    above UDP in the application layer to provide a reliable\n  means for transferring
    files from a sender to up to thousands\n  (potentially millions with network ''aggregators''
    or relays) of\n  multiple receivers simultaneously over a multicast group in a\n
    \ multicast IP enabled network.  The protocol consists of two parts; an\n  administrative
    protocol to set up and tear down groups and sessions,\n  and a data transfer protocol
    used to send the actual file reliably and\n  simultaneously to the multiple recipients
    residing in the group .\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a bandwidth saving method for exporting \nflow
    or packet information using the IP Flow Information Export \n(IPFIX) protocol.
    As the PSAMP protocol is based on IPFIX, these \nconsiderations are valid for
    PSAMP exports as well. \n         \nThis method works by separating information
    common to several \nflow records from information specific to an individual flow
    \nrecord. Common flow information is exported only once in a data \nrecord defined
    by an option template, while the rest of the \nspecific flow information is associated
    with the common \ninformation via a unique identifier.\n\t "

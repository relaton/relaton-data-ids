  script: Latn
  content: "   Although RFC 4302 and RFC 4303 don't prohibit using Extended Sequence\n
    \  Number (ESN) when the anti-replay function is not enabled, many IPsec\n   implementations
    require ESN to be used only with anti-replay.\n   Therefore, failing to negotiate
    the use of ESN when the anti-replay\n   is disabled will cause the sequence numbers
    to exhaust rapidly in\n   high-traffic-volume scenarios, leading to the frequent
    rekey of Child\n   SAs.\n\n   This document defines the REPLAY_PROT_AND_ESN_STATUS
    Notify Message\n   Status Type Payload in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version
    2\n   (IKEv2) to inform the peer of its replay protection status and\n   capability
    of using ESN without anti-replay when creating the Child\n   SAs, to address the
    above problem.\n\n\t "

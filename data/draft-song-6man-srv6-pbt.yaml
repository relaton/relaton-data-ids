  content: "   Applications such as SRv6 TE may require to collect detailed\n   performance
    data on SR paths.  Existing in-situ OAM techniques incur\n   encapsulation and
    header overhead issues.  This document describes a\n   method based on Postcard-based
    Telemetry with Packet Marking for SRv6\n   on-path OAM, which avoids the extra
    overhead for encapsulating\n   telemetry-related instruction and metadata in SRv6
    packets.\n\n\n\t "

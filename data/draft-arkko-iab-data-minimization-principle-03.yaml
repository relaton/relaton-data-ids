  content: "   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n   improvements
    in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers.\n   Privacy has also been a key focus
    area, and understanding the privacy\n   implications of new Internet technology
    is an important factor when\n   IETF works on such technologies.\n\n   This document
    highlights the need for a particular focus with respect\n   to privacy.  It is
    necessary to protect against endpoints that are\n   compromised, malicious, or
    whose interests simply do not align with\n   the interests of users.  It is important
    to consider the role of data\n   passed to various parties - including the primary
    protocol\n   participants - and balance the information given to them considering\n
    \  their roles and possible compromise of the information.\n\n\t "

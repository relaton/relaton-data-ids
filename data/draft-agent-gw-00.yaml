abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an architectural framework for an Intelligent
    Agent Communication Gateway (Agent-GW), designed to support large- scale, heterogeneous,
    and dynamic multi-agent collaboration. As agents evolve from isolated software
    entities to a collaborative digital workforce, the underlying infrastructure must
    transition from rigid, host-based connectivity to flexible, intent-based interaction.
    This document outlines the requirements for such a transition and proposes the
    Agent-GW as a unified infrastructure hub. The gateway provides native primitives
    for Semantic Routing—dispatching tasks based on intent and capability—and Working
    Memory, which manages structured context for multi-step workflows. Furthermore,
    it defines mechanisms for automated protocol adaptation, oracle-free agent evaluation,
    and collaborative inference acceleration (KDN). The architecture aims to enable
    agents and legacy systems to interoperate through standardized protocols while
    ensuring observability, security, and operational scalability.</p>"

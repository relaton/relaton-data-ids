  content: "   With the development of the Internet, game industry has risen\n   rapidly,
    from handheld game consoles to PC games and mobile games.\n   The types of games
    are diversified, while the number of game users is\n   increasing year by year.
    \ The game market is maturing quickly.\n\n   Nowadays, the scale of game users
    is large and they belong to the\n   easy-to-consume groups.  Among all the games,
    those require frequent\n   interactions and involve video streaming usually have
    highly\n   demanding requirements on the network in terms of guaranteed network\n
    \  latency and reliability.  Therefore, from the aspect of ensuring\n   better
    gaming experience, it is desirable of differentiating the\n   particular gaming
    application flows and providing high-priority\n   network services for those demanding
    gamers.\n\n   This document describes the game acceleration scenarios using\n
    \  Application-aware Networking (APN) technology.  In these scenarios,\n   APN
    can identify the specific requirements of particular gaming\n   applications,
    steer the flows to the game processors close to the\n   users, and provide SLA
    guaranteed network services such as low\n   latency and high reliability.\n\n\n\t "

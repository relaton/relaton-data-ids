  content: "This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman exchange
    to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure Real-time
    Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  The
    ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port
    as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does not
    assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates
    in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection
    against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol
    provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication
    through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal
    RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions that include
    a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice
    by using an optional digital signature.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

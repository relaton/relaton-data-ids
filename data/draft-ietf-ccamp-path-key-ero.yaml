  content: "The paths taken by Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed
    by Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains,
    such as Autonomous Systems (ASes), the path may be computed by multiple PCEs that
    cooperate, with each responsible for computing a segment of the path.\n\n To preserve
    confidentiality of topology within each AS, the PCEs support a mechanism to hide
    the contents of a segment of a path (such as the segment of the path that traverses
    an AS), called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS), by encoding the contents as
    a Path Key Subobject (PKS) and embedding this subobject within the result of its
    path computation.\n\n This document describes how to carry Path Key Subobjects
    in the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Explicit Route Objects (EROs) and
    Record Route Objects (RROs) so as to facilitate confidentiality in the signaling
    of inter-domain TE LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

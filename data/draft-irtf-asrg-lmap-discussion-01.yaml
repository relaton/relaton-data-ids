  content: "Lightweight MTA Authentication Protocol (LMAP) is the general term\n   for
    a family of proposed protocols to help address the spam problem\n   by permitting
    domains to publish the set of SMTP clients which may\n   use their name in the
    EHLO/HELO and MAIL FROM fields.  SMTP servers\n   can use this information to
    determine if a client is consensually\n   using a domains name.  This document
    discusses the applicability, and\n   the costs and benefits of wide-spread deployment
    of the protocol\n   family.\n\t "

  content: "   Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the\n   Quality
    of Experience (QoE) of the users of network services.  This\n   document surveys
    a set of recommendations about the maximum latency\n   tolerated by the users
    of delay-constrained services.  Some\n   recommendations already exist for VoIP,
    but emerging services as e.g.\n   online gaming, have different requirements.
    \ Different papers in the\n   literature reporting these constraints are surveyed,
    and a summary of\n   the latency limits for each service is finally provided.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The combination of \"rn\" and \"npdi\" parameters which are normally
    used\n   for number portability (NP) can also solve numbering and routing\n   problems.
    \ Database dips to obtain routing numbers are not only\n   needed for NP, but
    also for the routing of service numbers and short\n   code numbers in the PSTN
    and also in SIP networks.  This document\n   defines the use of the tel URI parameters
    defined for NP (\"rn\" and\n   \"npdi\") to route service numbers and short code
    numbers.\n\n\t "

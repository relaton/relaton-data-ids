  content: "   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides\n
    \  mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n   computations
    in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n\n   [Stateful-pcep]
    specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable\n   stateful control of MPLS-TE
    and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via\n   PCEP and maintaining of these LSPs
    at the stateful PCE.  This\n   document describes the mechanisms for incremental
    LSP Database (LSP-\n   DB) synchronization as well as PCE control of the LSP-DB\n
    \  synchronization process.\n\n\t "

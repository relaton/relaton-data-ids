  content: "The protocol described in this document is a member of the IP  Device
    Control (IPDC) family of protocols.  The IPDC protocols are proposed as a protocol
    suite, components of which can be used individually or together to perform connection
    control, media control, and signaling transport for environments where the service
    control logic is separated  from  the network access server. Please see the references
    section for other IPDC documents.\n\nThe protocol specification presented here
    is intended for use between a media gateway controller and a media gateway.  The
    media gateway may be capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice over
    ATM gateway, dialup modem media gateway, circuit switch, or cross-connect.  Using
    the IP Media Control protocol presented here, the media gateway controller can
    send messages to the media gateway to cause events such as tones to be generated
    or detected within a media stream.\n\t "

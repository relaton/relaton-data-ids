  content: "   In many Opportunistic Security scenarios end-to-end encryption is\n
    \  automatized for Internet users.  In addition, it is often required to\n   provide
    the users with easy means to carry out authentication.\n\n   Depending on several
    factors, each communication channel to different\n   peers may have a different
    Privacy Status, e.g., unencrypted,\n   encrypted and encrypted as well as authenticated.
    \ Even each message\n   from/to a single peer may have a different Privacy Status.\n\n
    \  To display the actual Privacy Status to the user, this document\n   defines
    a Privacy Rating scheme and its mapping to a traffic-light\n   semantics.  A Privacy
    Status is defined on a per-message basis as\n   well as on a per-identity basis.
    \ The traffic-light semantics (as\n   color rating) allows for a clear and easily
    understandable\n   presentation to the user in order to optimize the User Experience\n
    \  (UX).\n\n   This rating system is most beneficial to Opportunistic Security\n
    \  scenarios and is already implemented in several applications of\n   pretty
    Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t "

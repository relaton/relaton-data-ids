  content: "   Many services that require DIAMETER need retransmission and timeout\n
    \  faster than TCP can provide.\n \n   An example would be in a NAS environment
    where DIAMETER is used for\n   the authentication and authorization of users.
    The amount of time\n   that it takes for TCP to determine that a connection to
    a server is\n   broken is longer than the disonnect timeout of the PPP clients
    on\n   whose behalf the server is being contacted.\n \n   RADIUS has been able
    to handle this situation by operating over UDP.\n   However, RADIUS fails to define
    a standard retransmission and timeout\n   scheme, which has resulted in many different
    methods across\n   implementations.\n \n   This DIAMETER specification defines
    the extensions necessary for the\n   base protocol to operate over a non-reliable
    transport (e.g. UDP).\n\n\t "

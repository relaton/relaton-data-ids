abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of this draft is to describe an information model for\nrepresenting
    MPLS traffic engineering policies. RFC 2702,\n'Requirements for Traffic Engineering
    over MPLS', is used as a basis\nfor determining the types of information that
    need to be represented\nin such an information model. The latter document describes
    the\nfunctional capabilities required to implement policies that\nfacilitate efficient
    and reliable network operations in an MPLS\ndomain. The information model described
    in this draft attempts to\ncapture the information required to enable the functional\ncapabilities
    described in RFC 2702. This information model could be\nused by a management system
    to optimize network performance through\nthe necessary network provisioning actions.\nAn
    overview of policy-based management is given in this document,\nalong with a description
    of the relationship of this work to other\ninformation models that are being defined
    in the IETF Policy\nFramework working group. This is followed by a detailed description\nof
    the information model, and a number of examples illustrating its\nuse.\n\t "

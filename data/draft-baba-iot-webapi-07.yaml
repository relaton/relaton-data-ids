abstract:
- content: "<p>The University of Tokyo (UOT) is currently performing a demonstration
    experiment in COMMA House, the experimental smart-house owned by UOT and used
    as a connected house. The things installed in the house (Things) are operated
    using applications on smartphones and other devices. The various Things in the
    smart-house are operated online via a Web API that has been created as a prototype.
    This report is an overview of the experimental demonstration, which is gradually
    clarifying that Web API should be effective for solving issues for IoT.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Verifiable AI Provenance (VAP) Framework,
    a cross-domain upper framework for cryptographically verifiable decision audit
    trails in high-risk AI systems, along with the Legal AI Profile (LAP), a domain-specific
    instantiation for legal AI and LegalTech systems. VAP defines common infrastructure
    including hash chain integrity, digital signatures, unified conformance levels
    (Bronze/Silver/Gold), external anchoring via RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Protocol and
    compatible transparency services, a Completeness Invariant pattern guaranteeing
    no selective logging, standardized Evidence Pack format for regulatory submission,
    and privacy-preserving verification protocols. LAP extends VAP for the judicial
    AI domain, addressing unique requirements including attorney oversight verification
    (Human Override Coverage), three-pipeline completeness invariants for legal consultation,
    document generation, and fact-checking, tiered content retention with legal hold
    protocols for judicial discovery compliance, graduated override enforcement mechanisms,
    and privacy- preserving fields designed to maintain attorney-client privilege
    while enabling third-party auditability.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet provides standardized mechanisms for resolving identifiers,
    such as domain names, to network locations. These mechanisms assume that a client
    already knows the identifier of the resource it wishes to access. Emerging classes
    of applications, including augmented reality, autonomous systems, robotics, and
    spatial computing, operate under a different assumption. In these systems, discovery
    begins with physical presence and observer context rather than with a predefined
    name. This document describes the architectural gap addressed by a Geospatial
    Resource Discovery service. It defines the problem space, explains why existing
    standards are insufficient, and outlines a conceptual architecture for spatial
    discovery. This document is informational and architectural in nature. It does
    not define a protocol, data format, or implementation.</p>"

  content: "   The SDO 3GPP has done tremendous work to either standardize or study\n
    \  various types of wireless services that would depend on the satellite\n   constellation
    network.  While the ISLs, or Inter-Satellite Links,\n   along with the routing
    scheme(s) over them are critical to help\n   fullfil the satellite services, the
    3GPP considers them out-of-scope.\n   This leaves the significant work to be explored
    in the IETF domain.\n   This draft stems from the 3GPP satellite use cases that
    have been\n   studied for many years up to now, across a couple of releases, and\n
    \  lands on summarizing the challenges & considerations of the\n   satellite-based
    routing.  Based on some unique & advantageous\n   characteristics associated with
    satellite networks, the draft raises\n   briefly the general routing considerations
    for the integrated Non-\n   Terrestrial & Terrestial Networks.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The demand for lossless network transmission and the application of\n
    \  flow control mechanisms have expanded from DCNs (Data Center\n   Networks)
    to WANs(Wide Area Networks).  To mitigate PFC - related\n   issues in WANs, the
    fine - grained flow control is proposed.  This\n   mechanism aims to achieve precise
    control at flow / tenant levels,\n   limits flow control to specified paths and
    slices, and provides\n   intelligent congestion backpressure.  As current DCN
    already adopts\n   PFC mechanisms, the fine-grained flow control in WANs needs
    to work\n   with PFC in DCNs to achieve end-to-end flow control.\n\n\t "

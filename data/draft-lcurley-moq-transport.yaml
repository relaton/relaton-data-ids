  content: "   This document defines the core behavior for Media over QUIC Transport\n
    \  (MOQT), a media transport protocol over QUIC.  MOQT allows a producer\n   of
    media to publish data and have it consumed via subscription by a\n   multiplicity
    of endpoints.  It supports intermediate content\n   distribution networks and
    is designed for high scale and low latency\n   distribution.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPFv3 includes a mechanism for supporting multiple instances on the
    same link. OSPFv2 could benefit from such a mechanism in order to support multiple
    routing domains on the same subnet. The OSPFv2 instance ID is reserved for support
    of separate OSPFv2 protocol instances. This is different from OSPFv3 where it
    could be used for other purposes such as putting the same link in multiple areas.
    OSPFv2 supports this capability using a separate subnet or the OSPF multi-area
    adjacency capability.</p>"

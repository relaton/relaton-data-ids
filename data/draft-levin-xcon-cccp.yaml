  content: "   This document defines a Centralized Conferencing Control Protocol\n
    \  (CCCP) as a part of the XCON Working Group protocols suite.  CCCP\n   uses
    a client-server model for creation, querying, and manipulation\n   of XCON entities,
    conference objects and sub-objects.  An XCON\n   entity, which implements a CCCP
    server, provides a means for\n   authorized CCCP clients (e.g. conference participants)
    to affect the\n   behavior of a conference in the XCON system.\n\t "

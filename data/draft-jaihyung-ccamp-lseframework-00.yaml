  content: "     In this draft we propose a framework for implementation of (G)MPLS\n
    \    technology in Ethernet based Customer Premise Network (ECPN). Major\n     goals
    of this framework are improving QoS capability of Ethernet\n     using (G)MPLS
    technology and facilitating secure access of\n     commercial service, such as
    IP-TV or videophone, in local area\n     network. Key solution to achieve the
    goal is MAC address swapping\n     which uses 48bits of Ethernet address in MAC
    header as labels.\n     Ethernet switches supporting this technique identify flows
    of\n     different applications according to MAC addresses. ARP or ICMPv6 is\n
    \    used for terminal-to-terminal label negotiation and path\n     establishment.
    Policy can be imposed in controlling user\n     connection. Unauthorized user
    flows are filtered in MAC level.\n     Compatibility with legacy Ethernet is provided
    best because it does\n     not require modification in Ethernet format nor relies
    on VLAN tag.\n     This architecture and technology will be aligned with architectural\n
    \    framework for Ethernet based Access Network and Core Network.\n\t "

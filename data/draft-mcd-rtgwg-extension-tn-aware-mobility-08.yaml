  content: "   The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G (TN-AWARE-\n   MOBILITY)
    specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems'\n   Slice and Service
    Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network\n   paths to ensure the desired
    QoS for the services.The focus of (TN-\n   AWARE-MOBILITY) is limited to the 3GPP
    domain and doesn't cover the\n   network for user plane traffic between the UPFs
    and the services\n   hosted in data centers.\n\n   This document describes the
    mechanisms to achieve the same QoS for\n   the mobility traffic from the 3GPP
    domain to the service\n   destinations over the IP Data Networks. Extending the
    QoS guarantee\n   for the SSTs to the data centers where the services are hosted\n
    \  becomes necessary to maintain the end-to-end QoS for data plane\n   traffic
    between UEs and their corresponding service destinations.\n\n\t "

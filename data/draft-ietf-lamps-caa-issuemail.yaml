abstract:
- content: "<p>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS resource record
    (RR) provides a mechanism for domains to express the allowed set of Certification
    Authorities (CAs) that are authorized issue certificates for the domain. RFC 8659
    contains the core CAA specification, where Property Tags that restrict the issuance
    of certificates which certify domain names are defined. This specification defines
    a Property Tag that grants authorization to CAs to issue certificates which certify
    email addresses that include the domain name.</p>"

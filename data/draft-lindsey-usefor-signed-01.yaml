  content: "The huge growth of Netnews/Usenet in recent years has been\naccompanied
    by many attempts to abuse the system by various forms\nof malpractice, particularly
    the forging of various headers,\ncausing it to appear that articles came from
    parties other than\nthose that actually injected them or conveyed some Approval
    that\nthe real poster was not entitled to give. Insofar as Netnews is\nregularly
    gatwayed to and from Email systems, these problems also\nextend to the Email domain.\nThis
    document provides a cryptographically secure means whereby it\ncan be established
    beyond doubt that relevant headers of a Netnews\narticle or an Email message have
    not been tampered with in\ntransit, and that they were indeed originated by the
    person\npurporting to have done so. It seeks to supplement, rather than to\nsupplant,
    the existing protocols for signing the bodies of\narticles and messages.\n[This
    proposal arises from the activities of the Usenet Format Working\nGroup, which
    is charged with updating the Netnews standards. Comments\nare invited, preferably
    sent to the mailing list of the Group at\nusenet-format@landfield.com.]\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Currently, IPv6 anycast addresses are chosen from within the existing\n
    \  IPv6 unicast address space, with the addresses nominated as anycast\n   addresses
    through configuration.  An alternative scheme would be to\n   have a special class
    of addresses for use as anycast addresses.  This\n   memo proposes a distinct
    general anycast addressing class for IPv6,\n   and a more specific scheme for
    functional anycast addresses.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 5905 [RFC5905], section 7.3, \"Packet Header Variables\", defines\n
    \  the value to be used as the REFID for network associations.  For IPv4\n   associations
    the IPv4 address is used, and for IPv6 associations four\n   octets of the MD5
    hash of the IPv6 are used.  Often, the REFID is\n   simplistically and incorrectly
    used to identify upstream servers.\n   While this works in an IPv4 network, it
    doesn't work for IPv6\n   associations and may have other problems in an environment
    with mixed\n   use of IPv4 and IPv6.  Specifically, the NTP Project has received
    a\n   report where the generated IPv6 hash decoded to the IPv4 address of a\n
    \  different machine on the system peer's network.\n\n   This proposal offers
    a way for a system to generate a REFID for a\n   system peer that communicates
    over IPv6 that does not conflict with a\n   valid IPv4-based REFID.\n\n\t "

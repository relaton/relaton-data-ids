  content: "   Some zones are small, public and stable, but very important.  They\n
    \  might deal with millions of queries every day.  But many of the\n   queries
    are junky.  For examples, many queries DNS root servers\n   receive are junky.
    \ The queried junky names are not in the root, but\n   the root servers have to
    waste a lot of resources to deal with them.\n   It has been an obstacle to increase
    the performance of DNS root\n   query.  In order to save the resource caused by
    the DNS junky\n   queries, this document proposes a new mechanism by aggressive
    use of\n   the owner name list of the DNS zone.\n\n\t "

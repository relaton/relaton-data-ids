- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a generic bundle mechanism for the Session\n
    \  Description Protocol (SDP) by which the media described by a number\n   of
    media descriptions (\"m= lines\") are multiplexed and transmitted\n   over a single
    transport association.  The single transport\n   association is described by an
    additional media description, allowing\n   SDP attributes to be applied to the
    aggregate, independently of\n   attributes applied to the constituents.  In offer/answer
    usage, the\n   bundle mechanism is backward compatible with SDP processors that
    do\n   not understand the mechanism.  The mechanism is designed to be\n   compatible
    with the limitations of the existing Internet\n   infrastructure.\n\n\t "

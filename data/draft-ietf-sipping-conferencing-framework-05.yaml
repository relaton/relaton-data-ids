  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation, modification,
    and termination of media sessions between user agents.  These sessions are managed
    by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIP relationship between a pair of user agents.
    \ Because dialogs are between pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party
    communications (such as a phone call), is obvious.  Communications sessions with
    multiple participants, generally known as conferencing, are more complicated.
    \ This document defines a framework for how such conferencing can occur.  This
    framework describes the overall architecture, terminology, and protocol components
    needed for multi-party conferencing.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

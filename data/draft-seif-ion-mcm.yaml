  content: "This document describes MCM, a protocol for controlling a shared\n   ATM
    multicast tree supporting Mutipoint-to-Multipoint communication.\n   The protocol
    guarantees that there is no cell interleaving at any\n   group receiver. No cell
    buffering inside the network is required,\n   and all cell forwarding is performed
    at the ATM layer.\n\t "

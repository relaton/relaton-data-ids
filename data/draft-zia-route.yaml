  content: "The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport
    (ROUTE) protocol is specified for robust delivery of Application Objects, including
    Application Objects with real-time delivery constraints, to receivers over a unidirectional
    transport. Application Objects consist of data that has meaning to applications
    that use the ROUTE protocol for delivery of data to receivers; for example, it
    can be a file, a Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) or HTTP Live Streaming
    (HLS) segment, a WAV audio clip, etc. The ROUTE protocol also supports low-latency
    streaming applications.\n\n The ROUTE protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast,
    and multicast transport. Therefore, it can be run over UDP/IP, including multicast
    IP. The ROUTE protocol can leverage the features of the underlying protocol layer,
    e.g., to provide security, it can leverage IP security protocols such as IPsec.\n\n
    This document specifies the ROUTE protocol such that it could be used by a variety
    of services for delivery of Application Objects by specifying their own profiles
    of this protocol (e.g., by adding or constraining some features).\n\n This is
    not an IETF specification and does not have IETF consensus.\n\t "

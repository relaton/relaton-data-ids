- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes a light-weight data driven approach for \nmultiplexing
    low bit rate RTP streams at the edge router of the \nInternet in order to reduce
    the RTP/UDP/IP header overhead associated \nwith each RTP stream. Audio packets
    from different sources in a local \naccess network destined to different users
    in the same remote access \nnetwork are multiplexed into one packet, with the
    original RTP/UDP/IP \nheader of each packet replaced with a mini-header (2 bytes),
    resulting \nin a reduction of the overhead. Access routers can use the IP telephony
    \nBorder Gateway Protocol (TBGP) to exchange the reachability of IP \ndestinations
    in their domains.\n\n\t "

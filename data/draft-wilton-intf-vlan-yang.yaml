  content: "   This document defines a YANG configuration data model for the\n   management
    of VLAN sub-interfaces that augments the generic\n   interfaces data model defined
    in RFC 7223 [RFC7223].  It provides\n   support for basic tag matching to allow
    termination of an L2 VLAN\n   segement into L3 services.  It also provides support
    for flexible\n   matching and rewriting of L2 header fields for L2 services.\n\n
    \  The model differs from an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN derived model in that the\n   configuration
    is interface/sub-interface based as opposed to being\n   VLAN based.\n\n\t "

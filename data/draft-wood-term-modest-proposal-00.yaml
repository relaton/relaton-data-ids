  content: "   Certain established and longstanding terms of art, used as technical\n
    \  terminology, are now considered contentious and can be considered\n   harmful
    when used in discussion, in debate, and in reading,\n   following, accepting the
    authority of, and complying with, existing\n   technical documentation that unfortunately
    uses those terms that were\n   not considered to be at all contentious, but clear
    and entirely\n   uncontroversial normal use, when that technical documentation
    was\n   originally authored or published.  The use of such now-deplorable\n   terms
    of art should be deprecated, and those terms should ideally be\n   replaced with
    approved, accepted, more effective, inoffensive terms\n   of art wherever possible.
    \ Any new use of those original terms must\n   be carefully considered and fully
    justified before that use is agreed\n   by consensus and submitted for careful
    approval in documents.\n   Recommended replacement substitute terms should be
    considered for\n   inclusion instead.  A process for identifying and recommending\n
    \  replacements to those harmful terms is outlined here.\n\n\t "

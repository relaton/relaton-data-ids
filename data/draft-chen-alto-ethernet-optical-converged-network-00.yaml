  content: "   In conventional enterprise data centers, there are at least two\n   networks:
    Ethernet that allows users to access their applications on\n   servers, optical
    networks which built on Fiber Channel, that enables\n   those servers to access
    big data on storage network.  Because of\n   their specialized hardware, they
    have vastly different management\n   tools and require completely different skill
    sets to build and\n   maintain.\n\n   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) protocol is\n   designed to provide network related information to client\n
    \  applications.  It has developed a lot in Ethernet, and now we\n   consider
    to build a central control in a basic Ethernet and Optical\n   converged networks.
    \ Follow the concept of ALTO implementing in\n   Ethernet networks, an ALTO server
    can get the necessary information\n   from underlining Ethernet and Optical converged
    networks.  After\n   abstracting the network information, ALTO server can achieve
    a\n   central resource allocation and organize them into a standard format\n   so
    as to provide useful information to ALTO clients.  This document\n   designs a
    basic way of applying ALTO in converged networks.\n\n\t "

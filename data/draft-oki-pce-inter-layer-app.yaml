  content: "A network may comprise of multiple layers. It is important to \nglobally
    optimize network resources utilization, taking into \naccount all layers, rather
    than optimizing resource utilization at \neach layer independently. This allows
    better network efficiency to \nbe achieved through a process that we call inter-layer
    traffic \nengineering. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful \ntool
    to achieve inter-layer traffic engineering. \n      \nThis document describes
    the applicability of the PCE-based path \ncomputation architecture to inter-layer
    MPLS and GMPLS traffic \nengineering. It provides suggestions for the deployment
    of PCE in \nsupport of multi-layer networks. This document also describes \nnetwork
    models where PCE performs inter-layer traffic engineering, \nand the relationship
    between PCE and a functional component called \nthe Virtual Network Topology Manager
    (VNTM). \n\t "

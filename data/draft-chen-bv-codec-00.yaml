  content: "BroadVoice(R) [bv-website] is a family of two open-source speech \ncodecs
    suitable for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  It is \ndesigned to achieve high
    speech quality with relatively low \ncomplexity and a very low coding delay.  BroadVoice
    consists of two \nvariants: a 16 kb/s narrowband codec for 8 kHz sampling called
    \nBroadVoice16, or BV16, and a 32 kb/s wideband codec for 16 kHz \nsampling called
    BroadVoice32, or BV32.  BV16 and BV32 are standard \ncodecs of PacketCable(TM),
    SCTE(R), and ANSI for VoIP applications \nin cable telephony, and they are also
    listed as optional codecs in \nthe ITU-T Recommendations J.161 and J.361, respectively.
    \ This \ndocument describes the BV16 and BV32 speech codecs.\n\t "

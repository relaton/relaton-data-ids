  content: "RFC 3095 defines a Proposed Standard framework with profiles for\nRObust
    Header Compression (ROHC). Various concepts are introduced\nwithin the standard,
    which might be difficult to understand, and\nespecially how these relate to the
    surrounding environments where\nheader compression may be used. This document
    aims at clarifying the\narchitectural aspects of ROHC, discussing terms such as
    ROHC\ninstances, ROHC channels, ROHC feedback, ROHC contexts, and how these\nterms
    relate to other terms like network elements and IP interfaces,\ncommonly used
    when for example addressing MIB issues.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In many use cases, particularly in workload environments, a single\n
    \  access token or similar security artifact is not sufficient for\n   conveying
    the type of security and provenance information necessary.\n   This draft describes
    a data model and format for an additive data\n   container to address these concerns.\n\nDiscussion
    Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source
    for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at\n   https://github.com/bspk/draft-richer-wimse-token-container.\n\n\t "

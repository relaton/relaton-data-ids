  content: "At the 62nd IETF meeting, it was requested that the authors of\n   Congestion
    Notification Process for Real-Time Traffic (RT-ECN) draft\n   look at rate proportional
    marking as an method of indicating that\n   traffic has exceeded a configured
    rate.  In version 03 of RT-ECN\n   draft (draft-babiarz-tsvwg-rtecn-03) we stated,
    when the rate exceeds\n   the engineered traffic level, all packets as indicated
    by a DS\n   codepoint from ECN-capable end-systems are marked to indicate\n   congestion
    for the duration of the experienced congestion.  In this\n   memo, we looked at
    the two approaches, provide analysis as well our\n   conclusions.\n\t "

  content: "This document documents the consensus reached by the Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) Working Group within the IETF to focus its efforts on \"Resource
    Reservation Protocol (RSVP)-TE: Extensions to RSVP for Label- Switched Paths (LSP)
    Tunnels\" (RFC 3209) as the MPLS signalling protocol for traffic engineering applications
    and to undertake no new efforts relating to \"Constraint-Based LSP Setup using
    Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)\" (RFC 3212).  The recommendations of section
    6 have been accepted by the IESG.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

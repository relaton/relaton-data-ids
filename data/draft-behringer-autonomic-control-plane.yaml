  content: "   In certain scenarios, for example when bootstrapping a network, it
    is\n   desirable to automatically bring up a secure, routed control plane,\n   which
    is independent of device configurations and global routing\n   table.  This document
    describes an approach for an \"Autonomic Control\n   Plane\", which can be used
    as a \"virtual out of band channel\" - a\n   self-managing overlay network, which
    is independent of configuration,\n   addressing and routing on the data plane.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Today's systems, networks, and protocols are complex and include\n
    \  unknown vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit.  The large-\n   scale
    deployment of network security protocols establishes an\n   additional threat
    by implementing a substrate for hidden\n   communications like covert or subliminal
    channels.  The resulting\n   ecosystem builds a convenient platform for malicious,
    automated\n   software (malware) to infiltrate critical infrastructures, to\n
    \  gradually infect large parts of the system and to coordinate\n   distributed
    malware operation.\n\n   Based on the observation that malware depends on network\n
    \  communications to discover, propagate, coordinate, and unleash its\n   functionality,
    this memo recommends methods to identify potential\n   interfaces and interactions
    between malware and protocols.  It\n   proposes a generic malware lifecycle model
    that defines a set of\n   generic malware states and possible transitions between
    these states.\n   Coordinated activities of distributed malware can be mapped
    to state\n   transitions in malware instances, supporting the identification of\n
    \  (potentially hidden) network communication as a trigger for actions\n   and
    hints on protocols that enabled the communication.  Eventually,\n   the proposed
    model aims at supporting the identification of\n   architectures, protocols, interfaces,
    and points in time that a)\n   either inhibit hidden malware communication or
    b) allow for optimized\n   detection of anomalies as main prerequisite for timely\n
    \  countermeasures.\n\n   While earlier work focused on protecting single hosts
    from\n   compromise, this memo adopts a holistic view and considers the health\n
    \  of the overall networked system to be of highest priority.  Presuming\n   vulnerable
    systems, we stress that components or subsystems must be\n   disconnected on suspected
    infection in an attempt to continue (even\n   partial) operation of the overall
    (non-infected) system after the\n   disconnect.  Containment - the isolation of
    an infected subsystem -\n   becomes an essential security feature in the context
    of critical\n   infrastructures that influences on deployed protocols, interfaces
    and\n   architectures.\n\n\t "

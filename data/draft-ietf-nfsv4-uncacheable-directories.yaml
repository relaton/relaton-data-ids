abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2) allows a client to cache
    both metadata for file and directory objects. While caching directory entries
    (dirents) can improve performance, it can also prevent the server from enforcing
    access control on individual dirents. This document introduces a new uncacheable
    directory attribute for NFSv4.2. Dirents marked as uncacheable MUST NOT be stored
    in client-side caches. This ensures data consistency and integrity by requiring
    clients to always retrieve the most recent data directly from the server. This
    document extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7862).</p>"

  content: "DiffServ architecture provides a set of 'user plane' tools for IP QoS.\nDeployment
    of DiffServ is starting with static, single-domain solutions.\nDynamic QoS and
    multi-domain QoS are still open issues, as witnessed by\nthe activity of the IETF
    NSIS WG, related to the 'signaling plane'.\nIn order to realize true end-to-end
    QoS services in the Internet,\nspanning multiple administrative domains, efficient
    and scalable\nsignaling and resource control mechanisms are needed.\nThis document
    describes a scalable inter-domain resource control\narchitecture for DiffServ
    networks. The architecture is called BGRP\nPlus, as it extends the previously
    proposed BGRP framework.\n\n\t "

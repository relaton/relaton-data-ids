  content: "This document suggests a local mobility solution controlled by the \nnetwork
    within a local mobility domain. The proposed solution employs \na Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 client that generates a Proxy Binding Update \nmessage. Two variants of the
    solution are suggested depending on the \nrealization of the Proxy Mobile IP client
    function. The security \nassociation between the network elements for executing
    the local \nmobility is also discussed. \n\n\t "

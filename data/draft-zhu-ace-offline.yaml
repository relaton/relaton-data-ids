  content: "   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] defines a framework for both\n   authentication
    and authorization in constrained Internet of Things\n   (IoT) environments.  A
    constrained node in this framework may have\n   constraints in computational capability,
    memory storage, lack of user\n   interface, transmission bandwidth and/or power
    supply.  Battery-\n   powered devices are widely used in IoT deployments and they
    sleep\n   most of their lifetime for battery saving.  Hence, they are usually\n
    \  disconnected from other nodes.  This draft provides an overview of\n   the
    disconnection use cases and discusses offline authentication and\n   authorization
    solutions.\n\n\t "

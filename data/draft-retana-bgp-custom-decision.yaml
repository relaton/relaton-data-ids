  content: "   The BGP specification defines a Decision Process for installation of\n
    \  routes into the Loc-RIB.  This process takes into account an\n   extensive
    series of path attributes, which can be manipulated to\n   indicate preference
    for specific paths.  It is cumbersome (if at all\n   possible) for the end user
    to define policies that will select, after\n   partial comparison, a path based
    on subjective local (domain and/or\n   node) criteria.\n\n   This document defines
    a new Extended Community, called the Cost\n   Community, which may be used in
    tie breaking during the best path\n   selection process.  The end result is a
    local custom decision\n   process.\n\n\t "

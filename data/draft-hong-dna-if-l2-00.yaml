  content: "     In this document we consider and analyze various environments for\n
    \    applying Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) schemes. Although DNA\n     schemes
    are typically run for each interface and a host separately\n     checks for link
    changes on each interface when the host has\n     multiple interfaces, DNA schemes
    in the host must be considered to\n     check the multiple interfaces at the same
    time for a seamless\n     service. In addition, DNA schemes in the host must be
    capable of\n     managing together each DNA scheme on each interface. Current
    DNA\n     schemes only rely on 'Break before Make' L2 technology such as\n     802.11.
    But now and in future, there will be other 'Make before\n     break' L2 technologies
    such as CDMA. In these L2 technologies, DNA\n     schemes must be operated differently
    in order to make use of their\n     characteristics.\n\t "

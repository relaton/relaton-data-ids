  content: "   This document presents ETS: an Extensible TimeStamps option for TCP.\n
    \  It allows hosts to use microseconds as the unit for timestamps to\n   improve
    the precision of timestamps, and extends the information\n   provided in the [RFC7323]
    TCP Timestamps Option by including the\n   receiver delay in the TSecr echoing,
    so that the receiver of the ACK\n   is able to more accurately estimate the portion
    of the RTT that\n   resulted from time traveling through the network.  The ETS
    option\n   format is extensible, so that future extensions can add further\n   information
    without the overhead of extra TCP option kind and length\n   fields.\n\n\t "

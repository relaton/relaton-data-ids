abstract:
- content: "<p>There exist many extensions to Internet addressing, as it is defined
    in RFC 791 for IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively. Those extensions have
    been developed to evolve the addressing capabilities beyond the basic properties
    of Internet addressing. This document outlines those properties as a baseline
    against which the extensions are categorized in terms of methodology used to extend
    the addressing model, together with examples of solutions doing so. While introducing
    such extensions, we outline the shortcomings we see with those extensions. This
    ultimately leads to consider whether or not a more consistent approach to tackling
    the identified use cases, beyond point-wise extensions as done so far, would be
    beneficial. The benefits are the ones detailed in the companion document [I-D.iannone-scenarios-problems-addressing],
    where, leveraging on the shortcomings identified in this memo and scenarios provided
    in [I-D.iannone-scenarios-problems-addressing], a clear problem statement is provided.</p>"

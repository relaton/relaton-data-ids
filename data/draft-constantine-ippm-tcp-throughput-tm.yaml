  content: "This memo describes a methodology for measuring sustained TCP \nthroughput
    performance in an end-to-end managed network environment.  \nThis memo is intended
    to provide a practical approach to help users \nvalidate the TCP layer performance
    of a managed network, which should \nprovide a better indication of end-user application
    level experience.  \nIn the methodology, various TCP and network parameters are
    identified \nthat should be tested as part of the network verification at the
    TCP \nlayer.\n\t "

  content: "   In various situations it would be highly useful for a Path \n   Computation
    Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically \n   discover a set of
    Path Computation Element(s) (PCE), along with some \n   of information relevant
    for PCE selection. When the PCE is an LSR \n   participating to the IGP, or even
    a server participating passively to \n   the IGP, a simple and efficient way for
    PCE discovery, consists of \n   relying on IGP flooding. For that purpose this
    document defines \n   simple OSPF and ISIS extensions for the advertisement of
    PCE \n   Discovery information within and across IGP areas.  \n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This is a review of issues related to the optimized deployment of\n
    \  network services, aka service function chains, composed of virtual\n   and
    physical network functions, where these functions may be\n   instantiated in multiple
    distributed data centers.  Criteria for\n   optimization are introduced, and use
    cases are described and\n   expanded, in order to establish the need for coordinated
    computation\n   of NF deployment sites and the connectivity among them.  Some
    methods\n   for addressing optimization pain points are described, and potential\n
    \  new requirements of the PCE and PCEP are discussed.\n\n   One point to make
    clear is that the exploration of specific\n   algorithms for NF/VNF placement
    and path computation is outside the\n   scope of this draft.  We are not looking
    at computational or optimal\n   greedy search algorithms.  The goals for this
    draft are 1) to provide\n   justification through use cases for more tightly integrating
    path and\n   placement computation algorithms, and 2) looking at how some of the\n
    \  optimization requirements might be addressed, mostly through pre-\n   computation
    and caching, and how these might affect management and\n   orchestration functions
    and the protocols (e.g.  PCEP) that are used.\n\n\t "

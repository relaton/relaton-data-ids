  content: "This draft specifies two Key Derivation Functions \n(KDFs) that may be
    used to derive symmetric keying \nmaterial for participating parties from a secret
    value \nand application specific information. Each KDF is \nbased on a concatenation
    technique and a secure hash \nfunction. The length in bits of secret keying material
    \nthat can be generated by either of the KDFs is limited \nto (2**32 - 1) times
    the length in bits of the output \nblock of the hash function. The derived keying
    \nmaterial is a concatenation of the outputs of the \nhashing operations. Outputs
    from the KDFs are either \n\"Invalid\" or desired secret keying material. \n\nThe
    HKDFs specified in this document are intended for \nuse in scenarios where the
    communicating parties \nderive keying material for their own use.  This \nspecification
    is not intended for implementation of \nkey hierarchies. \n\t "

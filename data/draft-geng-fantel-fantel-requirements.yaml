  content: "   This document defines the requirements for Fast Notification for\n
    \  Traffic Engineering and Load Balancing (FaNTEL), a mechanism designed\n   to
    deliver timely network status updates directly from the network\n   device with
    a change to the device expected to react to it.  FaNTEL\n   supports fast failure
    and congestion notifications, enabling rapid\n   protection switching and dynamic
    load balancing.  By providing low-\n   latency alerts, it helps networks respond
    quickly to link failures\n   and congestion events, enhancing service reliability
    and performance.\n\n\t "

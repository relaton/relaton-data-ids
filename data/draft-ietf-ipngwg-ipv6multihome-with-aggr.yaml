  content: "With the growing requirements for reliable Internet connectivity,\nincreasing
    number of enterprises choose to acquire Internet\nconnectivity from more than
    one Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for\nthe purpose of connectivity redundancy
    and traffic load distribution.\nThe potential of large number of multi-connection
    sites impose direct\nchallenge on routing aggregation and consequently on scalability
    of\nthe global Internet routing. Hence a solution is highly desirable\nwhich provides
    the benefit of multi-connection as well as the better\nscalability of the global
    routing system. In addition, such solution\nneeds to be simple enough to be operationally
    manageable. With the\nfast growth of ISP networks as well as enterprise networks,
    network\nmanageability is becoming an increasingly important requirement. This\ndocument
    describes a solution which achieves the stated goals.\n\t "

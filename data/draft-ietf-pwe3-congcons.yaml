- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Pseudowires (PWs) have become a common mechanism for tunneling\n   traffic,
    and may be found in unmanaged scenarios competing for\n   network resources both
    with other PWs and with non-PW traffic, such\n   as TCP/IP flows.  It is thus
    worthwhile specifying under what\n   conditions such competition is safe, i.e.,
    the PW traffic does not\n   significantly harm other traffic or contribute more
    than it should to\n   congestion.  We conclude that PWs transporting responsive
    traffic\n   behave as desired without the need for additional mechanisms.  For\n
    \  inelastic PWs (such as TDM PWs) we derive a bound under which such\n   PWs
    consume no more network capacity than a TCP flow.  We also\n   propose employing
    a transport circuit breaker\n   [I-D.fairhurst-tsvwg-circuit-breaker] that shuts
    down a TDM PW\n   consistently surpassing this bound, as the emulated TDM service\n
    \  itself would be be of insufficient quality.\n\n\t "

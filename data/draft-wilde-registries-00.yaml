  content: "   Registries on the Internet and the Web fulfill a wide range of tasks,\n
    \  ranging from low-level networking aspects such as packet type\n   identifiers,
    all the way to application-level protocols and\n   standards.  This document summarizes
    some of the reasons of why and\n   how to use registries, and how some of them
    are operated.  It serves\n   as a informative reference for specification writers
    considering\n   whether to create and manage a registry, allowing them to better\n
    \  understand some of the issues associated with certain design\n   discussions.\n\n\t "

  content: "This Internet Draft describes the Universal Packet Driver Protocol \n(UPDP).
    \ This protocol is intended to provide a standardized method \nfor a device to
    communicate its interface information.  It is a \nprotocol based on extending
    ICMP [1] within the bounds of the \noriginal intention of ICMP.  The protocol
    can be used by any device \nto send and receive device interface information.

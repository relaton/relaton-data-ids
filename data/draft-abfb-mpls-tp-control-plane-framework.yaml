  content: "The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning\nof
    transport paths via a Network Management System (NMS), and\ndynamic provisioning
    of transport paths via a control plane. This\ndocument provides the framework
    for MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning,\nand covers control plane addressing, routing,
    path computation,\nsignaling, traffic engineering,, and path recovery.  MPLS-TP
    uses\nGMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs and provides for\ncompatibility
    with MPLS.  The control plane for Pseudowires (PWs)\nis also covered by this document.
    \ Management plane functions such\nas manual configuration and the initiation
    of LSP setup are out of\nscope of this document.\n\t "

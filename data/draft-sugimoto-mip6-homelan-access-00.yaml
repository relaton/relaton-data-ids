  content: "   In this document, we propose to relax forwarding rule of the Mobile\n
    \  IPv6 home agent.  In addition to utilizing link-local scope home\n   address,
    mobile node may request home agent to bypass specific link-\n   local scope multicast
    traffic which may be of its interest.  The\n   extensions allow mobile node to
    seamlessly access the home network\n   through link-local communication.  Modifications
    to mobility signals\n   for home registration are made in order to realize the
    extensions.\n   This document also provides a set of requirements and guidelines
    for\n   target usage scenario and implications to Mobile IPv6 system design.\n\t "

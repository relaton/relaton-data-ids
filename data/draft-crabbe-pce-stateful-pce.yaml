  content: "   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides\n
    \  mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n   computations
    in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n\n   Although PCEP explicitly
    makes no assumptions regarding the\n   information available to the PCE, it also
    makes no provisions for\n   synchronization or PCE control of timing and sequence
    of path\n   computations within and across PCEP sessions.  This document\n   describes
    a set of extensions to PCEP to enable this functionality,\n   providing stateful
    control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\n   Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP.\n\n\n\t "

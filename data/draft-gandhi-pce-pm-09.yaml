abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss,
    delay and delay variation as well as bandwidth utilization is a critical measure
    for Traffic Engineering (TE). This data provides operators the characteristics
    of their networks for performance evaluation that is required to ensure the Service
    Level Agreements (SLAs). The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations
    in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs') requests. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow Stateful control of Traffic Engineering Paths using PCEP for both RSVP and
    Segment Routing (SR). This document describes PCEP extensions for enabling and
    reporting end-to-end performance measurements for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-
    Initiated LSPs for both RSVP-TE and SR-TE (for MPLS and IPv6 Data planes) to an
    Active Stateful PCE.</p>"

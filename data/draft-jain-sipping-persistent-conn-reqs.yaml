  content: "SIP over connection-oriented transport protocol based systems are \nlikely
    to face certain distinct performance and behavioral issues \nthat are not manifest
    when SIP is transported over connectionless \nprotocols. Allowing SIP entities
    to mutually conserve connections \nover a predictable, extended period of time
    is one of the leading \nrequirements to help SIP entities deliver their optimal
    \nperformance in the network. Overall, this document contemplates \ntransport
    layer connection management issues relating to SIP. \nRequirements and potential
    solutions for introducing a backward \ncompatible notion of persistent connections
    in SIP are presented.\n\t "

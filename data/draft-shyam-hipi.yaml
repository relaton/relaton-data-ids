  content: "   This is a protocol to identify a host with a provider independent\n
    \  address.  It is useful to identify a host uniquely in a multihomed\n   environment
    where each host gets associated with more than one\n   provider assigned addresses.
    By means of associating a host with a\n   provider independent address, customers/customer
    networks will be\n   able to retain their number even after changing their service\n
    \  provider(s).\n\n\t "

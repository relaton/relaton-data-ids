  content: "Mobile IP is designed to provide IP services to roaming nodes, \nallowing
    them access to services, and enabling other nodes to reach \nthem, as if they
    were on their home domain.  By definition this \nfunctionality must be deployed
    on multiple subnets, and in many \ncases across domains, and while services which
    enable Mobile IP\nMUST be present on a subnet in order for a mobile node to have
    this\nreachability, deploying Mobile IP can introduce some security\nissues which
    may need to be addressed, by any network administrator\noverseeing Mobile IP subnets.\n\t "

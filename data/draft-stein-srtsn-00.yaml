  content: "   Routers perform two distinct user-plane functionalities, namely\n   forwarding
    (where the packet should be sent) and scheduling (when the\n   packet should be
    sent).  One forwarding paradigm is segment routing,\n   in which forwarding instructions
    are encoded in the packet in a stack\n   data structure, rather than programmed
    into the routers.  Time\n   Sensitive Networking and Deterministic Networking
    provide several\n   mechanisms for scheduling under the assumption that routers
    are time\n   synchronized.  The most effective mechanisms for delay minimization\n
    \  involve per-flow resource allocation.\n\n   SRTSN is a unified approach to
    forwarding and scheduling that uses a\n   single stack data structure.  Each stack
    entry consists of a\n   forwarding portion (e.g., IP addresses or suffixes) and
    a scheduling\n   portion (deadline by which the packet must exit the router).
    \ SRTSN\n   thus fully implements network programming for time sensitive flows,\n
    \  by prescribing to each router both to-where and by-when each packet\n   should
    be sent.\n\n\t "

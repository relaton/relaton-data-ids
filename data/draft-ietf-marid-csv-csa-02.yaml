  content: "Internet operation has typically required no public mechanism for\n   announcing
    restriction or permission of particular hosts to operate\n   clients or servers
    for particular services on behalf of particular\n   domains.  What is missing
    is an open, interoperable means by which a\n   trusted agency can announce authorization
    for a host to operate a\n   service.  The current specification supports this
    capability for\n   sending SMTP clients.  Specifically, is a sending SMTP client\n
    \  permitted to act as a client MTA? Has a separate authority given it\n   permission
    to perform this service? Client SMTP Authorization (CSA)\n   specifies a DNS-based
    record that states whether an associated host\n   has permission to operate as
    a client MTA.\n\t "

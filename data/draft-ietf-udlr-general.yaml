  content: "Many distributed applications may benefit from a high bandwidth\n   connection
    to the Internet. However, this requires high bandwidth\n   links between remotes
    sites.\n \n   A low-cost solution to deliver high bandwidth services over wide\n
    \  geographical areas via the use of broadcast satellite networks has\n   been
    proposed by [ASBD].\n \n   However, this solution is based on low cost receivers
    with zero\n   bandwidth return. Connection over the satellite link is therefore\n
    \  unidirectional. The integration of these satellite networks with the\n   Internet
    requires changes in common routing protocols.\n\t "

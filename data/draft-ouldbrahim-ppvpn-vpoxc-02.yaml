  content: "This document describes an Optical Virtual Private Network \nservice (OVPN)
    called Virtual Private Optical Cross-Connect \n(VPOXC). A VPOXC is a provider
    provisioned VPN service part of \nthe customer private network but administered
    and under the \ncontrol of the service provider. A VPOXC operates similarly to
    a \nphysical optical cross-connect except that it allows a wide \nspectrum of
    port topology such as hub and spoke, full mesh, and \narbitrary topologies. To
    the VPOXC customer, the service \nprovider network appears as a virtual private
    optical cross-\nconnect where customer sites are attached to. The VPOXC port \ntopology
    is defined by the customer, and enforced by the service \nprovider. Customers
    can signal any optical connectivity \naccording to the port topology implemented
    by the VPOXC. Client \ndevices operate within the VPOXC space independently from
    the \nservice provider network operations.\n\t "

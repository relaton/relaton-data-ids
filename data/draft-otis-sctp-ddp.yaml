- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In many applications, direct placement of data avoids the overhead \nof
    multiple copies or excessive context switching and is a \ndesirable feature.  To
    accomplish this using an Internet Protocol, \na direct placement adaptation layer
    is defined within this \ndocument.  This adaptation exists as a small shim sitting
    above \nSCTP.  This shim fragments messages for path compliance, prefixes \nthe
    placement header, and may place data directly into a user \nbuffer.  The ultimate
    goal is to have placement occur by the \nnetwork interface card, where this shim
    coordinates such placement \nwhile proper network layering is maintained.  As
    SCTP was not \ndesigned to directly handle offset based fragmentation, the shim
    \nhandles message fragmentation to introduce the offsets as well as \ndetermine
    message reception signaling as a result of unordered \ndelivery needed for immediate
    placement.\n\t "

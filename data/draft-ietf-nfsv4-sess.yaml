  content: "     Extensions are proposed to NFS version 4 which enable it to support\n
    \    long-lived sessions, endpoint management, and operation atop a\n     variety
    of RPC transports, including TCP and RDMA.  These\n     extensions enable support
    for reliably implemented client response\n     caching by NFSv4 servers, enhanced
    security, multipathing and\n     trunking of transport connections.  These extensions
    provide\n     identical benefits over both TCP and RDMA connection types.\n\t "

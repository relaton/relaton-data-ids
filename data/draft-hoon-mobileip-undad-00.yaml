  content: "The Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure detailed by Neighbor\nDiscovery
    Protocol (NDP) requires nodes to wait for a quantified time\ninterval during which
    the configured address is checked for\nduplication in the connected link. This
    delay affects normal\ncommunication in a Mobile Node (MN) during the DAD time
    interval\nthereby hampering Fast Handoff. The expected use of Mobile IP on a\nwide
    scale and the need for a minimal time delay during the handoff\nprocess require
    alternate mechanisms for overcoming the DAD time\ninterval. This draft presents
    a mechanism wherein the Access Router's\n(AR) Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) is used
    to minimize the delay\nassociated with the DAD procedure.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "During the next few years, as the IPv4 address space moves toward \nexhaustion,
    it is likely that the deployment of NAT will accelerate. \nThis draft presents
    the requirements that NAT devices must meet in \norder to enable use of UDP by
    peer-to-peer applications. The \nrequirement can be summed up by the need to avoid
    gratuitous \nfiltering and too short timers.\n\t "

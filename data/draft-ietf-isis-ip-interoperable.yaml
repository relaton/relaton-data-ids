    System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol used to route IP traffic as described
    in RFC 1195 and the protocol as it is deployed today.  These differences are discussed
    as a service to those implementing, testing, and deploying the IS-IS Protocol
    to route IP traffic.  A companion document describes the differences between the
    protocol described in ISO 10589 and current practice.  This memo provides information

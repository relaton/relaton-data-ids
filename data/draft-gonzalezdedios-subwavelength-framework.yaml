  content: "This document discusses the framework for enhancements to the GMPLS\narchitecture
    to control sub-wavelength switching optical networks.\nSub-wavelengths refer to
    the time-shared utilization of a single\nwavelength by optical bursts, packets
    or slots.\n\nSub-wavelngth technologies are the base of new cost-effective network\narchitectures.
    \ In particular, they are sutited for metro areas, to\ncope with high traffic
    volumens as well as more demanding\nrequirements of networked applications.\n\t "

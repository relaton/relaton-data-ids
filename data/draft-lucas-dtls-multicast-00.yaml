  content: "  This proposal to provide a secure multicast 1-to-N or M-to-N device\n
    \ capability, with the same level of reliability as the underlying\n  multicast
    network, also aims to be light-weight and supported\n  by a very constrained device.
    Guaranteed reliability would be\n  provided by an additional protocol working
    in co-operation with it.\n\n  The aim is to support end to end secure communications
    in the edge\n  device world of IoT where the transport methods will vary or at\n
    \ least change once the IP realm is left. Hence there is no\n  dependence on Ipv6
    or IP or CoAP and no restrictions that might be\n  introduced if too specific
    an end node application was implied. It\n  is network independent, it just must
    be possible to transmit and\n  receive frames in multicast.\n\n  This can be achieved
    with simply a minimal change to the DTLS\n  behavior and using current DTLS libraries.
    DTLS headers are not\n  changed, additional headers are used in the packets before
    the DTLS\n  traffic.\n\n  DTLS Multicast keeps the layer concept pure and independent,
    hence\n  it can be used for routing something that is not CoAP.\n\n\t "

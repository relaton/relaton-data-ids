abstract:
- content: "<p>Key exchange without forward secrecy enables passive monitoring. Massive
    pervasive monitoring attacks relying on key exchange without forward secrecy has
    been reported, and many more have likely happened without ever being reported.
    If key exchange without Diffie-Hellman is used, access to the long-term authentication
    keys enables a passive attacker to compromise past and future sessions. Entities
    can get access to long-term key material in different ways: physical attacks,
    hacking, social engineering attacks, espionage, or by simply demanding access
    to keying material with or without a court order. psk_ke does not provide forward
    secrecy and is NOT RECOMMENDED. This document sets the IANA registration of psk_ke
    to NOT RECOMMENDED.</p>"

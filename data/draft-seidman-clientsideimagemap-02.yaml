  content: "The markup language known as \"HTML/2.0\" provides for image maps.  Image
    maps are document elements which allow clicking different areas of an image to
    reference different network resources, as specified by Uniform Identifier (URIs).
    \ The image map capability in HTML/2.0 is limited in several ways, such as the
    restriction that it only works with documents served via the \"HTTP\" protocol,
    and the lack of a viable fallback for users of text-only browsers.  This document
    specifies an extension to the HTML language, referred to as \"Client- Side Image
    Maps,\" which resolves these limitations.\n\t "

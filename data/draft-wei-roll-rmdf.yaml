  content: "This document presents a routing method through sending detection\nframes
    including address of destination node to the neighbor nodes to\nreduce delay of
    data transmission because of the dormant nodes will\nincrease data transmission
    delay in low power and lossy\nnetworks(LLNs).  When receives the response from
    the neighbor nodes,\nthe sending node can select a neighboring node as the next
    hop node\nto sent data, which has the lower cost parameter than the cost\nparameter
    between the sending node and the destination node stored in\nthe routing table
    of sending node.  This routing method finds a route\nin real-time by broadcasting
    detection frames.  As long as any\nneighbor node that can reach the destination
    is active, data can be\nsent and then the data transmission delay will be reduced.\n\t "

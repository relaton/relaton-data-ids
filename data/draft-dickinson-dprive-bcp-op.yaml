  content: "   This document presents operational, policy and security\n   considerations
    for DNS operators who choose to offer DNS Privacy\n   services.  With the recommendations,
    the operator can make deliberate\n   decisions which services to provide, and
    how the decisions and\n   alternatives impact the privacy of users.\n\n   This
    document also presents a framework to assist writers of DNS\n   Privacy Policy
    and Practices Statements (analogous to DNS Security\n   Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies
    and DNSSEC Practice Statements described\n   in [RFC6841]).\n\n\t "

  content: "Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other
    well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun,
    new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a
    new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities
    have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment
    must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is
    provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n\n In order for IANA
    to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions
    under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values
    can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace,
    IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document
    discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning
    values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text
    that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.\n\n This document
    obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

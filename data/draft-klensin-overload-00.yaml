abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "One of the key proposals in the PACT [PACT] draft is a limit on the\nduration
    of Working Groups.  The authors believe that limitations of\nthat type are too
    constraining on IESG ability to manage working groups\nand areas and that they
    will not be effective in practice.  We propose\nan alternate restriction -- on
    the total number of working groups in an\nArea -- that we believe will have a
    number of desirable effects (a\nsuperset of those suggested with the PACT model)
    and that it is more\nlikely to operate as intended.\n\t "

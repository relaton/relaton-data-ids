  content: "   CAN (Computing Aware Network) is designed to enable the routing\n   network
    to be aware of computing status thus deliver the service flow\n   accordingly.
    \ Nevertheless, computing and networking is quite\n   different in terms of resource
    granularity as well as its status\n   stability.  It would gain significant benefits
    to accommodate the\n   computing status to that of networking by employing a hierarchical\n
    \  computing routing segment scheme.  The network-accommodated computing\n   status
    could be maintained at remote CAN nodes while the rest could\n   reside at local
    CAN nodes.  By enabling the network to schedule and\n   route computing services
    in a compatible way with the current IP\n   routing network, CAN would bring benefits
    to the industry by both\n   efficiently pooling the computing resources and rendering
    services\n   through perspective of converged networking and computing.\n\n\t "

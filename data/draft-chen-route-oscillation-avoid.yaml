  content: "In this document we propose a mechanism and routing setup that would\navoid
    persistent route oscillations and yield consistent route\nselection in a network
    using one-level Route Reflection, or using\nConfederation where routers that participate
    in inter-member-AS\npeering are fully meshed.\n\t "

  content: "A multi-homed host with multiple physical and/or virtual network \n   interfaces
    has to select which one of the network interfaces to use \n   for a new outgoing
    IPv4 or IPv6 connection. This document describes a \n   method to select an interface
    by using destination's fully qualified \n   domain name and DNS suffix information
    received dynamically for each \n   network interface. The method is useful, for
    example, in split \n   horizon DNS and walled garden scenarios, where right network
    \n   interface has to be selected even before DNS resolution is conducted.\n\t "

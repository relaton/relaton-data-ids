  content: "   This document specifies an identity-based security scheme for\n   wireless
    sensor network (WSN) on the basis of Identity-Based\n   Encryption (IBE). Each
    cluster head can perform as a private key\n   generator (PKG) in case that the
    sole PKG is captured, which will\n   lead to the whole network disabled. The proposed
    scheme can reduce\n   the consumption of key resources and improve the security
    of the WSN\n   by dispersing PKG function. The analysis shows that the scheme
    can\n   resist various attacks.\n\n\t "

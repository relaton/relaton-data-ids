  content: "This document describes proposed extensions to the GSMPv3 protocol to
    \nallow its use in a broadband environment, as a control plane between   \nAccess
    Nodes (e.g. DSLAM) and Broadband Network Gateways (e.g. BRAS). \nThese proposed
    extensions are required to realize a protocol for \n\"Access Node Control\" mechanism
    as described in [9]. The resulting \nprotocol with the proposed extensions to
    GSMPv3 [4] is referred to as \n\"Access Node Control Protocol\" (ANCP).  This
    document focuses on \nspecific use cases of access node control mechanism for
    topology \ndiscovery, line configuration, and OAM. It is intended to be \naugmented
    by additional protocol specification for future use cases \nconsidered in scope
    by the ANCP charter. \n\t "

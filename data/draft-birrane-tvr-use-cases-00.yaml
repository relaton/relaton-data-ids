  content: "   Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to the calculation of a path or\n
    \  subpath through a network where the time of message transmission (or\n   receipt)
    is part of the overall route computation.  This means that,\n   all things being
    equal, a TVR computation might produce different\n   results depending on the
    time that the computation is performed\n   without other detectable changes to
    the network topology or other\n   cost functions associated with the route.\n\n
    \  This document introduces use cases where TVR computations could\n   improve
    message exchange in a network.\n\n\t "

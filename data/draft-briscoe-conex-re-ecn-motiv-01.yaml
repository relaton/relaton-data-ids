abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a framework for using a new protocol called\n
    \  re-ECN (re-inserted explicit congestion notification), which can be\n   deployed
    incrementally around unmodified routers.  Re-ECN allows\n   accurate congestion
    monitoring throughout the network thus enabling\n   the upstream party at any
    trust boundary in the internetwork to be\n   held responsible for the congestion
    they cause, or allow to be\n   caused.  So, networks can introduce straightforward
    accountability\n   for congestion and policing mechanisms for incoming traffic
    from end-\n   customers or from neighbouring network domains.  As well as giving\n
    \  the motivation for re-ECN this document also gives examples of\n   mechanisms
    that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond\n   correctly to congestion.
    \ And it describes example mechanisms that\n   ensure the dominant selfish strategy
    of both network domains and end-\n   points will be to use the protocol honestly.\n\n
    \  Note concerning Intended Status: If this draft were ever published as\n   an
    RFC it would probably have historic status.  There is limited\n   space in the
    IP header, so re-ECN had to compromise by requiring the\n   receiver to be ECN-enabled
    otherwise the sender could not use re-ECN.\n   Re-ECN was a precursor to chartering
    of the IETF's Congestion\n   Exposure (ConEx) working group, but during chartering
    there were\n   still too few ECN receivers enabled, therefore it was decided to\n
    \  pursue other compromises in order to fit a similar capability into\n   the
    IP header.\n\n\t "

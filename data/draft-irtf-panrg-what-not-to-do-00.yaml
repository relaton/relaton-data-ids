  content: "   At the first meeting of the Path Aware Networking Research Group,\n
    \  Oliver Bonaventure led a discussion of mostly-unsuccessful attempts\n   to
    exploit Path Awareness to achieve a variety of goals, for a\n   variety of reasons,
    over the past decade.  At the end of that\n   discussion, the research group agreed
    to catalog and analyze these\n   ideas, in order to extract insights and lessons
    for path-aware\n   networking researchers.\n\n   This document contains that catalog
    and analysis.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an update to CCID-3/4 that addresses\nparameter-estimation
    problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCP\ncongestion control.\n\nThe fix uses a
    recommendation made in the original TFRC\nspecification.  It avoids the inherent
    problems of receiver-based RTT\nsampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples
    already available\nat the sender.  It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP
    as an\nend-to-end negotiable extension, upward and downward compatible.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   HTTP servers usually save session states in their persistent storage\n
    \  indexed by session cookies generated by the HTTP servers.  It is up\n   to
    the HTTP user-agent to send this session cookie on each HTTP\n   request.  Some
    HTTP servers check whether the cookie is associated\n   with the HTTP user-agent
    by the means of the user-agent IP address.\n   Everything linking a state to an
    IP address (such as OAuth access\n   code) to an IP address has the same issue.\n\n
    \  If the Happy Eyeball mechanism is used to select between IPv6 and\n   IPv4,
    it may happen that while using the same HTTP server, some HTTP\n   requests are
    done over IPv6 and the others over IPv4, which leads to\n   two different sets
    of session states in the HTTP server.  This has\n   the consequence of inconsistencies
    at the HTTP server.\n\n   The only purpose of this document is to document this
    issue in more\n   details than in section 8.2 of RFC 6883 including security\n
    \  considerations and mitigations.\n\n   A similar problem arises with the use
    of non RFC 6888 compliant\n   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices used to access an
    IPv4-only HTTP\n   server or HTTP user-agent using multi-homing.\n\n\t "

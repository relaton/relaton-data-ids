  content: "This Internet Draft provides a detailed description of most of the\nexisting
    IP autoconfiguration solutions proposed so far.  The main\naim of this document
    is to serve as a general reference for the\nAUTOCONF solution space.  We present
    most of the previously proposed\nIP AUTOCONF mechanisms in MANETs, showing their
    key characteristics.\nFurthermore, each solution is analysed based on a number
    of\nevaluation considerations.\n\t "

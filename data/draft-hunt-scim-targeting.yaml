  content: "   The core SCIM 1.0 specification is intended to provide updates to a\n
    \  single cloud-based application. This extension specifies an extended\n   API
    definition which allows a single SCIM endpoint to support updates\n   to multiple
    cloud-based applications. These extensions enable network\n   relationships such
    as proxy updates, and hub-to-hub-to-spoke\n   relationships in addition to the
    hub-spoke relationship defined in\n   the core SCIM 1.0 specification.\n\n\n\t "

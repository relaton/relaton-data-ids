  content: "   This document defines a new type of the redirect extended community,\n
    \  called as Redirect to Generalized Segment ID Extended Community.\n   When activated,
    the Redirect to Generalized Segment ID Extended\n   Community is used by BGP FlowSpec
    Controller to signal the specific\n   redirecting action to BGP Flowspec Client,
    and then the BGP Flowspec\n   Client will use the Generalized Segment ID and the
    Segment Type to\n   find a local forwarding entity in a local mapping table.\n\n\n\t "

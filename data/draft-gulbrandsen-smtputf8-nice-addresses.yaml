abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible\n
    \  enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while\n   avoiding
    confusing or risky elements.\n\n   This is one of a pair of documents: this contains
    recommendations for\n   what addresses humans should use, such address provisioning
    sytems\n   can restrain themselves to addresses that email valdidators accept.\n
    \  (This set can also be described in other ways, including \"simple to\n   cut-and-paste\".)
    \ Its companion defines simpler rules, accepts more\n   addresses, and is intended
    for software like MTAs.\n\n   NOTE: The term 'nice' is not ideal here, and must
    be reconsidered or\n   replaced before this is issued as an RFC.  \"Well-formed\"
    is a\n   candidate.  \"Nice\" will do for now: better to argue about substance\n
    \  than wording.\n\n\t "

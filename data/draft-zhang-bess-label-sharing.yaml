  content: "   This document describes a method to be used by VPN (Virtual Private\n
    \  Network) Service Providers to provide multi-homed CEs with fast\n   protection
    of egress PEs. Egress PEs in a redundant group always\n   share the same label
    in distribution of VPN routes of a VRF. A\n   virtual Next Hop (vNH) in the IGP/MPLS
    backbone is created as the\n   common end of LSP tunnels which would otherwise
    terminate at each\n   egress PE. Primary and backup LSP tunnels ended at the vNH
    are set up\n   by MPLS on the basis of existing Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
    Fast\n   ReRoute (FRR) mechanisms. If the primary egress PE fails, the backup\n
    \  egress PE can recognize the \"shared\" VPN route label carried by the\n   data
    packets.  Therefore, the failure affected data packets can be\n   smoothly rerouted
    to the backup PE for delivery without changing\n   their VPN route label.\n\n\n\t "

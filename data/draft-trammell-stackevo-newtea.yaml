  content: "   This document explores architectural considerations for using\n   encapsulation
    in support of stack evolution and new transport\n   protocol deployment in an
    increasingly encrypted Internet.  These\n   architectural considerations are based
    on an idealized architecture\n   where all interactions among applications, endpoints,
    and the path\n   occur explicitly, with this cooperation enforced cryptographically.\n
    \  This idealized architecture is then lensed through the state of\n   devices
    in the present Internet and how they would impair the\n   deployability of such
    an architecture, in order to support an\n   incremental deployment of this approach.\n\n\t "

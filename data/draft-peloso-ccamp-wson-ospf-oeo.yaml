- language: en

  content: "   The original content of this internet draft was to propose some\n   extentions
    to OSPF encoding in the context of Wavelength Switched\n   Optical Networks, especially
    for internal constraints of optical\n   network elements.  General description
    can be found in the framework\n   document.\n\n   This update of the document
    still aims at specifying the detailled\n   structure of OSPF LSAs for WSONs.  Nevertheless,
    the proposed LSA\n   layout slightly differs from the current content of the information\n
    \  model and encodings drafts.  As a result, the following sections\n   highlight
    the differences between both approaches and summarize why\n   the authors think
    these CCAMP's drafts would benefit from an update\n   according to the proposed
    description.\n\n\t "

  content: "A protocol specification must balance two often conflicting goals:\nto
    produce as general a protocol as possible, and to produce a\nsimple protocol.
    \ The Group Secure Association Key Management\nProtocol (GSAKMP) is a general
    protocol for creating and managing\ncryptographic groups on a network.  This document
    describes\nthe GSAKMP-Light (GL) profile, a way to shorten the number of\nmessages
    exchanged during secure group establishment.  The GSAKMP\nprotocol assumed that
    group members joining a secure group had\nno information about the specific security
    mechanisms used by the\ngroup (for example, the key length, encryption protocol,
    etc).\nGSAKMP-Light provides a profile for the case where group members\nhave
    been previously notified of these security mechanisms, used\nfor joining a group,
    during the group announcement or invitation.\nThis simplification removes 2 messages
    from the group establishment\nportion of the GSAKMP protocol, eliminates the need
    for initiating\na unicast security association, and removes the need for many\nof
    the optional fields of individual messages.  The profile\ndoes not sacrifice any
    of the security properties of the full\nprotocol.  To facilitate the transmission
    of security mechanism\nsettings during session invitation or announcement, this
    document\nalso describes a useful default set of security algorithms and\nconfigurations,
    Security Suite 1.  Full specification of this suite\nallows an entire set of algorithms
    and settings to be described\nto prospective group members in a concise manner.
    \ Future security\nsuites can be defined as needed.\n\n\n\n\t "

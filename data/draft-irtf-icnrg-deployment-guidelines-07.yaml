  content: "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is now reaching technological maturity
    after many years of fundamental research and experimentation.  This document provides
    a number of deployment considerations in the interest of helping the ICN community
    move forward to the next step of live deployments.  First, the major deployment
    configurations for ICN are described, including the key overlay and underlay approaches.
    \ Then, proposed deployment migration paths are outlined to address major practical
    issues, such as network and application migration.  Next, selected ICN trial experiences
    are summarized.  Finally, protocol areas that require further standardization
    are identified to facilitate future interoperable ICN deployments.  This document
    is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The UIDONLY extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC\n
    \  3501/RFC 9051) allows clients to request that all information about\n   mailbox
    changes is returned only using UIDs.  Message numbers are not\n   going to be
    returned and can't be used once this extension is\n   enabled.  This helps both
    clients and servers to reduce resource\n   usage required for maintenance of message
    number to UID map.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "   This document describes a UDP-based publication channel for streaming\n
    \  telemetry use to collect data from devices.  A new shim header is\n   proposed
    to facilitate the distributed data collection mechanism\n   which directly pushes
    data from line cards to the collector.  Because\n   of the lightweight UDP encapsulation,
    higher frequency and better\n   transit performance can be achieved.\n\n\n\t "

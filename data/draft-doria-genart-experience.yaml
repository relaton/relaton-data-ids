  content: "The General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) has been doing reviews of Internet-Drafts
    (I-Ds) since 2004.  This document discusses the experience and the lessons learned
    over the past 7 years of this process.  The review team initially reviewed the
    I-Ds before each of the IESG telechats.  Since late 2005, review team members
    have been assigned to review I-Ds during IETF Last Call, unless no IETF Last Call
    is necessary for the I-D.  The same reviewer then reviews any updates when the
    I-D is placed on an IESG telechat agenda.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

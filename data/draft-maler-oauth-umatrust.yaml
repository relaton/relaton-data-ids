  script: Latn
  content: "   User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines how\n
    \  resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients\n   operated
    by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside\n   on any number
    of resource servers, and where a centralized\n   authorization server governs
    access based on resource owner policy.\n   This document provides a contractual
    framework that defines the\n   minimum obligations of parties that operate and
    use UMA-conforming\n   software programs and services.  The goal of this framework
    is to\n   support end-to-end legal enforceability of the terms and conditions\n
    \  of access sharing relationships between authorizing and requesting\n   sides
    that use UMA.  The audience for this document includes\n   technologists, legal
    professionals, and operators of UMA-conforming\n   services.\n\n\t "

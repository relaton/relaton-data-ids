  content: "   Digital signatures are used within X.509 certificates, Certificate\n
    \  Revocation Lists (CRLs), and to sign messages.  This document\n   describes
    the conventions for using the Stateless Hash-Based Digital\n   Signature Standard
    (SLH-DSA) in Internet X.509 certificates and\n   certificate revocation lists.
    \ The conventions for the associated\n   signatures, subject public keys, and
    private key are also described.\n\n   [EDNOTE: This draft is not expected to be
    finalized before the NIST\n   PQC Project has standardized FIPS 205 Stateless
    Hash-Based Digital\n   Signature Standard.  The current FIPS draft was published
    August 24,\n   2023 for public review.  Final versions are expected by April 2024.\n
    \  This specification will use object identifiers for the new algorithms\n   that
    are assigned by NIST, and will use placeholders until these are\n   released.]\n\n\t "

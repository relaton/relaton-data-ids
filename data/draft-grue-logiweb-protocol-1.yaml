  content: "   When publishing mechanically verified mathematics on the Internet,\n
    \  there is a need for referencing previously published documents. As an\n   example,
    referenced documents may contain needed definitions, lemmas,\n   and proofs. References
    from one mechanically verified document to\n   another is much like any other
    Uniform Resource Locator, but there is\n   a need to ensure that referenced documents
    do not change after\n   publication. This is so because otherwise a change of
    e.g. a\n   definition in a referenced document could invalidate the correctness\n
    \  of a referencing document.\n\n   The present document describes the protocol
    used by an experimental\n   system named \"Logiweb\" which allows to publish mechanically
    verified,\n   immutable mathematical documents.\n\n\n\t "

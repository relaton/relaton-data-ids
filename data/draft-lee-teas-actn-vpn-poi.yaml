  content: "     This document outlines the applicability of Abstraction and\n     Control
    of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) to VPN with the\n     integration of Packet
    and Optical Networks (POI). It also\n     identifies a number of scenarios where
    the integration of packet\n     and optical networks is necessary to support VPN
    service\n     requirements. The role of optical underlay tunnels in the POI is\n
    \    to support certain applications that require a hard isolation with\n     strict
    deterministic latency and guaranteed constant bandwidth.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   IPsec is of increasing importance within data centers to secure\n   tunnels
    used to carry multi-tenant traffic encapsulated using the\n   Network Virtualization
    over L3 (NVO3) protocols. Encrypting NVO3\n   tunnels provides defense against
    bad actors within the physical\n   underlay network from monitoring or injecting
    overlay traffic from\n   outside the NVO3 infrastructure. When securing data center
    tunnels\n   using IPsec it becomes crucial to retain entropy within the outer\n
    \  IPsec packet headers to facilitate load balancing over the highly\n   meshed
    networks used in these environments. While entropy is\n   necessary to support
    load distribution algorithms it is also\n   important that the entropy codes used
    retain integrity of flows to\n   prevent performance deterioration resulting from
    packet re-ordering.\n   Here, we describe a use case for load balancing IPsec
    traffic within\n   multi-tenant data centers.\n\n\t "

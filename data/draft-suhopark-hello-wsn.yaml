  content: "In this document, We consider Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) security and\nfocus
    our attention to tolerate damage caused by an adversary who has \ncompromised
    deployed sensor node to modify, block, or inject packets. We \nadopt a probabilistic
    secret sharing protocol where secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not
    exposed to any other nodes. Adapting to WSN characteristics, we incorporate these
    secrets with bidirectional \nverification and multipath routing to multiple base
    stations to defend \nagainst HELLO flood attacks. We then analytically show that
    our defense\nmechanisms against HELLO flood attack can tolerate damage caused
    by an \nintruder\n\t "

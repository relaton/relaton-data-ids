  content: "   Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to\n
    \  locate items.  These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced\n   tracking
    network in which devices belonging to other network users\n   (e.g., phones) report
    which tags they see and their location, thus\n   allowing the owner of the tag
    to determine where their tag was most\n   recently seen.  While there are many
    legitimate uses of these tags,\n   they are also susceptible to misuse for the
    purpose of stalking and\n   abuse.  A protocol that allows others to detect unwanted
    location\n   trackers must incorporate an understanding of the unwanted tracking\n
    \  landscape today.  This document provides a threat analysis for this\n   purpose,
    will define what is in and out of scope for the unwanted\n   location tracking
    protocols, and will provide some design\n   considerations for implementation
    of protocols to detect unwanted\n   location tracking.\n\n\t "

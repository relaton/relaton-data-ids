  content: "This document proposes to identify the elementary network functions required
    to automatically deploy an IPv6 home network, i.e. with the minimum (and ideally
    not a single) intervention from any administrator or any user. The next generation
    Internet Protocol, IPv6, is expected to being deployed in environments such as
    homes and SOHOs. However, most of the people making use of the Internet at home
    don't have enough knowledge to set up on their own the network and services. Therefore,
    this document exposes the requirements necessary to ease such a deployment, from
    an ISP point of view.\n\t "

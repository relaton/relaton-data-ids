abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a profile for the Entity Attestation Token (EAT)
    to support remote attestation of autonomous AI agents across domains. It specifies
    a set of standardized claims for attesting the integrity of AI model parameters,
    the provenance of training data, and the constraints of inference-time data access
    policies. Optional extensions for 5G/6G network functions—such as slice-type authorization—are
    included for interoperability with ETSI ENI and 3GPP architectures. The profile
    is encoded in CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) or JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and is designed
    to be used within the IETF RATS architecture.</p>"

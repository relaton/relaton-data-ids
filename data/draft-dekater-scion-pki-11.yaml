  content: "   This document presents the trust concept and design of the SCION\n
    \  _Control Plane Public Key Infrastructure (CP-PKI)_. SCION\n   (Scalability,
    Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) is\n   a path-aware, inter-domain
    network architecture where the Control\n   Plane PKI handles cryptographic material
    and is the foundation of the\n   authentication procedures in SCION.  It is used
    by SCION's Control\n   Plane ([I-D.dekater-scion-controlplane]) to authenticate
    and verify\n   path information, and provisions SCION's trust model based on\n
    \  Isolation Domains.\n\n   This document describes the trust model behind the
    SCION Control\n   Plane PKI, including the specifications of the different types
    of\n   certificates and the Trust Root Configuration.  It also describes how\n
    \  to deploy the Control Plane PKI infrastructure.\n\n   This document contains
    new approaches to secure path aware\n   networking.  It is not an Internet Standard,
    has not received any\n   formal review of the IETF, nor was the work developed
    through the\n   rough consensus process.  The approaches offered in this work
    are\n   offered to the community for its consideration in the further\n   evolution
    of the Internet.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII\n   characters
    and a fixed-width font.  However, there is sometimes a\n   need to supplement
    the ASCII text with images -- e.g., graphics,\n   equations, or pictures.  The
    historic solution to this requirement\n   has allowed secondary PDF and/or Postscript
    files, but this approach\n   has seldom been used because it is awkward for authors
    and publisher.\n   This memo sugests a convenient scheme for logically including\n
    \  authoritative diagrams, illustrations, equations, or other graphics\n   within
    RFCs.\n\n\t "

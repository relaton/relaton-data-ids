  content: "   This document clarifies DNS response message interpretation to avoid\n
    \  denial of service attacks using DNS responses.\n\n   In a recent DNS software
    assessment it has come to light that some\n   implementations respond to DNS response
    messages.  A loop occurs if\n   the receiver of this response responds with a
    response.\n\n   It was never explicitly stated that response messages must not
    be\n   answered.  This draft makes the statement explicit.\n\t "

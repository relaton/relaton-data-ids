  content: "   This document specifies tcpcrypt, a cryptographic protocol that\n   protects
    TCP payload data and is negotiated by means of the TCP\n   Encryption Negotiation
    Option (TCP-ENO) [I-D.ietf-tcpinc-tcpeno].\n   Tcpcrypt coexists with middleboxes
    by tolerating resegmentation,\n   NATs, and other manipulations of the TCP header.
    \ The protocol is\n   self-contained and specifically tailored to TCP implementations,\n
    \  which often reside in kernels or other environments in which large\n   external
    software dependencies can be undesirable.  Because of option\n   size restrictions,
    the protocol requires one additional one-way\n   message latency to perform key
    exchange.  However, this cost is\n   avoided between two hosts that have recently
    established a previous\n   tcpcrypt connection.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Service Connection Service (SXS) is a JSON/REST Web Service that may\n
    \  be used to establish and maintain a 'connection binding' of a device\n   to
    an account held with a Web Service Provider. Multiple connection\n   bindings
    may be established under the same account to support\n   multiple devices and/or
    multiple users of a single device. A\n   connection binding permits a device to
    securely connect to one or\n   more services offered by the Web Service Provider
    with support for\n   protocol and protocol version agilty and fault tollerance.\n\n
    \  The protocol is presented as a HTTP/JSON Web Service and uses the\n   HTTP
    session continuation mechanism for authentication of transaction\n   messages
    and supports negotiation of a HTTP session continuation\n   mechanism context
    for the established endpoint connections.\n\n\t "

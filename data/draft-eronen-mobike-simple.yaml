  content: "This document describes how existing NAT Traversal functionality\n   could
    be leveraged to better support mobility and multihoming for\n   IKEv2. The purpose
    is not to specify a finished solution, but rather\n   to provide input for discussions
    in the MOBIKE WG.  In particular,\n   this draft raises questions to what extent
    the complexity present in\n   the two other MOBIKE protocol proposals is actually
    necessary. These\n   questions are not answered in this document, but are to be
    discussed\n   in the MOBIKE WG.\n\t "

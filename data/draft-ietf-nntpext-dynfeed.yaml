  content: "This document describes an extension to the Network News Transport\nProtocol[RFC977]
    that allows NNTP peers to dynamically adjust\ntheir criteria for sending network
    news articles to one another.\n \nThis extension provides only for the addition
    of 'negative' criteria,\ni.e., criteria for articles that are not to be sent.
    \ It is believed\nthat a more comprehensive scheme allowing for 'positive' criteria,\nwhile
    desirable, would not receive wide deployment in the Internet\nbecause of concerns
    about security and intellectual property.  The\nextension described in this document
    does not present these concerns\nand allows for gains in network efficiency.\n\n\t "

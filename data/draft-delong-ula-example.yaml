  content: "   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating\n
    \  documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 Unicast Address\n   prefix
    is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation,\n   and the like.\n\n
    \  Since the publication of [RFC 4193] (ULA), it is necessary to\n   provide examples
    of ULA addresses in various documents, including\n   some Internet-Drafts currently
    under consideration.\n\n   This draft seeks to add ULA prefixes reserved for documentation\n
    \  purposes similar to the GUA reservation specified in [RFC3489]\n\n\t "

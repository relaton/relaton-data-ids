  content: "   The information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm offers replication\n
    \  of autonomously verifiable content throughout a network, in which\n   content
    is bound to names instead of hosts.  This has proven\n   beneficial in particular
    for the constrained IoT.  Several\n   approaches, the most prominent of which
    being Content-Centric\n   Networking (CCNx) and Named-Data Networking (NDN), propose
    access to\n   named content directly on the network layer.  Independently, the
    CoRe\n   WG developed mechanisms that support autonomous content processing,\n
    \  on-path caching, and content object security using CoAP proxies and\n   OSCORE.\n\n
    \  This document describes a data-centric deployment option using\n   standard
    CoAP features to replicate information-centric properties\n   and benefits to
    the host-centric IoT world.\n\n\t "

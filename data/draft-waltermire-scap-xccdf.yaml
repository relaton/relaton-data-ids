  content: "This document specifies the data model and Extensible Markup\n   Language
    (XML) representation for the Extensible Configuration\n   Checklist Description
    Format (XCCDF) Version 1.1.4. An XCCDF\n   document is a structured collection
    of security configuration rules\n   for some set of target systems. The XCCDF
    specification is designed\n   to support information interchange, document generation,\n
    \  organizational and situational tailoring, automated compliance\n   testing,
    and compliance scoring. The specification also defines a\n   data model and format
    for storing results of security guidance or\n   checklist compliance testing.
    The intent of XCCDF is to provide a\n   uniform foundation for expression of security
    checklists and other\n   configuration guidance, and thereby foster more widespread\n
    \  application of good security practices.\n\t "

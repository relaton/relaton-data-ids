  content: "   Connecting LP-WANs(Low-Power Wide Area Networks) to the Internet is\n
    \  expected to provide significant benefits to these networks in terms\n   of
    interoperability, application deployment, and management,among\n   others.  However,
    the specific characteristics of LP-WANs, such as\n   very limited data unit size,
    and large-scale data sets make the\n   network operation more complex: using one
    IP packet to send one LP-\n   WAN data unit is a waste of bandwidth(because the
    packet header is\n   much bigger than payload), and the large-scale LP-WAN data
    sets can\n   also increase the Internet burden.  This specification defines a
    Data\n   Aggregation Unit(DAU) for LP-WANs to aggregate small-size date units\n
    \  into bigger data chains so they can be sent through the Internet more\n   efficiently.\n\n\t "

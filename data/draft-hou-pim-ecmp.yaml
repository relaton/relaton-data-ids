  content: "   A PIM router uses RPF procedure to select an upstream interface and\n
    \  router to build forwarding state.  When there are equal cost multiple\n   paths
    (ECMP), existing implementations often use hash algorithms to\n   select a path.
    \ Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic\n   among the ECMPs according
    to administrative metrics.  This usually\n   leads to inefficient or ineffective
    use of network resources.  This\n   document introduces the ECMP Assert, a mechanism
    to improve the RPF\n   procedure over ECMPs.  It allows ECMP path selection to
    be based on\n   administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays,\n
    \  path preferences and routing metrics.\n\n\t "

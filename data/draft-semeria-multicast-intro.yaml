  content: "The first part of this paper describes the benefits of multicasting, the
    MBONE, Class D addressing, and the operation of the Internet Group Management
    Protocol (IGMP).  The second section explores a number of different algorithms
    that may potentially be employed by multicast routing protocols: - Flooding -
    Spanning Trees - Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) - Truncated Reverse Path Broadcasting
    (TRPB) - Reverse Path Multicasting (RPM) - Core Based Trees                                                   The
    third part contains the main body of the paper.  It describes how the previous
    algorithms are implemented in multicast routing protocols available today.  -
    Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) - Multicast OSPF (MOSPF) -
    Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM)\n\t "

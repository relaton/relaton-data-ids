  content: "   The purpose of this document defines a general multicast YANG service\n
    \  model.  This document intent to provide a general and all-round\n   multicast
    service model, and guides the deployment of multicast\n   technology.  This model
    includes many of the existed multicast\n   technology.  But this document does
    not define any specifically and\n   detailed YANG model of multicast protocol.
    \ The multicast model can\n   be used with YANG models of specifically multicast
    technologies, such\n   as PIM, MLD, and BIER and so on.\n\n   This document proposes
    a general and all-round multicast service YANG\n   model, which provides explanations
    and guidelines for the deployment\n   of multicast service in all kinds of multicast
    scenarios.  The\n   multicast technologies include BIER multicast, PIM multicast,
    MPLS\n   multicast and so on.  And also, there defines several possible RPCs\n
    \  about how to interact between multicast service model and multicast\n   device
    model.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a schema for representing DHCP service in an\nLDAP-based
    directory. The integration of DHCP with a directory makes\nit possible for an
    organization to centrally administer its DHCP\nservice, regardless of the number
    of DHCP servers it deploys. This\nmanagement approach further reduces the total
    cost of ownership and\nimproves scalability of DHCP service.\n\t "

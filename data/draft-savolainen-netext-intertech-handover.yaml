  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network based mobility management\nprotocol
    which provides IP mobility service to a host in a way which\nis transparent to
    the host itself.  This document analyses the\nscenarios in which a multi-interfaced
    Mobile Node roams in a Proxy\nMobile IPv6 domain which consists of access networks
    that are of\ndifferent types.  In order to support session continuity as the\nMobile
    Node moves between access networks within the PMIP6 domain,\nthe Mobile Node either
    needs to use host based Mobile IP or be\nenhanced with various capabilities described
    in this document.\n\t "

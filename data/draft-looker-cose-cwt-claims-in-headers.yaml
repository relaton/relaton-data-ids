  content: "   This document describes how to include CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims
    in\n   the header parameters of any COSE structure.  This functionality\n   helps
    to facilitate applications that wish to make use of CBOR Web\n   Token (CWT) claims
    in encrypted COSE structures and/or COSE\n   structures featuring detached signatures,
    while having some of those\n   claims be available before decryption and/or without
    inspecting the\n   detached payload.\n\n\t "

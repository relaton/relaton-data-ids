  content: "Many web servers supply incorrect Content-Type header fields with\ntheir
    HTTP responses.  In order to be compatible with these servers,\nuser agents consider
    the content of HTTP responses as well as the\nContent-Type header fields when
    determining the effective media type\nof the response.  This document describes
    an algorithm for\ndetermining the effective media type of HTTP responses that
    balances\nsecurity and compatibility considerations.\n\nPlease send feedback on
    this draft to apps-discuss@ietf.org.\n\t "

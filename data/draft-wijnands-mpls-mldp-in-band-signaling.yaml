  content: "When an IP multicast tree needs to pass through an MPLS domain, it is\nadvantageous
    to map the tree to a Point-to-Multipoint or Multipoint-\nto-Multipoint Label Switched
    Path.  This document specifies a way to\nprovide a one-one mapping between IP
    multicast trees and Label\nSwitched Paths using mLDP signaling.  The IP multicast
    control\nmessages are translated into MPLS control messages when they enter\nthe
    MPLS domain, and are translated back into IP multicast control\nmessages at the
    far end of the MPLS domain.  The IP multicast control\ninformation is coded into
    the MPLS control information in such a way\nas to ensure that a single Multipoint
    Label Switched Path gets set up\nfor each IP multicast tree.\n\t "

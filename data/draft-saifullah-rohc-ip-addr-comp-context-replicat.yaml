  content: "The Context Replication (CR) mechanism [3] for Robust Header\nCompression
    (ROHC) uses an existing compression context for creating\na new compression context,
    thus, saves sending some of the header\ninformation from the compressor to the
    decompressor during context\ninitialization.  The current CR mechanism could also
    save sending an\nIP address from the header information.  However, it either sends
    a\nwhole IP address or doesn't send an IP address. This Internet Draft\nenhances
    the CR mechanism by providing an option of sending\ncompressed IP address.\n\t "

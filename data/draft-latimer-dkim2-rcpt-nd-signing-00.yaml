abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes using the DKIM2 ESMTP extension to pass a signature
    for each intended recipient through the SMTP session rather than splitting email
    at the time of signing. This approach meets the DKIM2 objective of preventing
    email replay, while also preserving existing SMTP delivery logic, maintaining
    compatibility with DKIM and avoiding multiple calls to the DKIM2 filter. Also
    proposed is a method of signing the next domain in the DKIM2 chain of custody
    independently from the DKIM2-Signature. As per RFC5321, "... each and every extension,
    regardless of its benefits, must be carefully scrutinized with respect to its
    implementation, deployment, and interoperability costs". The requirements outlined
    herein ensure the majority of DKIM2 logic can be implemented within filters or
    supporting code, with only minimal and isolated changes in SMTP code.</p>

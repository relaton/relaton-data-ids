  content: "This document defines Uniform Resource Identifiers for Physical  \nObjects
    and human.It provides a proposal for the implementation of the \nConcept, ”Physical
    resources as well as humans should be accessible\nover the Internet and an information
    object is on the web if it can have a URI ”. It emphasizes on the fact that people
    should be able to\naccess the physical resources,they possess or even humans,from
    anywhere \nin the world through a common standard(URI) e.g. accessing a car from
    a \nremote location,or finding the location of the child via URI.As URIs are\nneeded
    in RDF,XML,so by using them for ubiquitous resources we could \neasily integrate
    the world of ubiquitous computing and semantic web i.e.\nUbiquitous Semantic Web.\n\n\t "

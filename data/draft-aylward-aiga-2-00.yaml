  content: "   This document specifies the AI Governance and Accountability (AIGA)\n
    \  Protocol, a practical, economically viable, and technically\n   enforceable
    framework for governing autonomous AI agents.  AIGA is\n   designed to address
    real-world deployment constraints, adversarial\n   agent scenarios, and economic
    incentive alignment.\n\n   The protocol is founded on a Tiered Risk-Based Governance
    model,\n   applying proportional oversight to agents based on their\n   capabilities.
    \ All agents are governed by an Immutable Kernel\n   Architecture which provides
    a non-modifiable Trusted Computing Base\n   (TCB) for enforcing policy.  This
    is combined with Action-Based\n   Authorization, where critical operations require
    real-time approval.\n\n   To solve the single-point-of-failure problem, the protocol
    uses a\n   Federated Authority Network of regional, cross-validating hubs and\n
    \  provides a Network-Level Quarantine Protocol for enforcement.  The\n   entire
    framework is designed around Economic Incentive Alignment,\n   making compliance
    the most economically rational choice for\n   operators.\n\n   For high-assurance
    (T3-T4) scenarios, AIGA specifies advanced,\n   redundant mechanisms including
    Multi-Vendor TEE Attestation (M-TACE),\n   AI \"Warden Triumvirate\" Triage, Human
    Review Board (HRB) Multi-\n   Signature, Peer Consensus Failsafe & Identity Rotation,
    and Double\n   Ratchet Cryptography.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "This work describes an enhancement to SIP protocol for the interworking\nwith
    QoS enabled IP networks. The proposed mechanism is simple and it\nfully preserves
    backward compatibility and interoperability with current\nSIP applications. The
    draft describes also, as an example, the\napplication of this mechanism to a particular
    QoS enabled IP network,\nwhich implements Diffserv as transport mechanisms and
    COPS as protocol\nfor QoS requests and for admission control.\n\n\n\t "

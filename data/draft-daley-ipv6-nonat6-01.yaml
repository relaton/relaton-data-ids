  content: "Proposals have been made to include Network Address Translation (NAT)\nin
    IPv6.  Network Address Translation substitutes a source address in\nthe outbound
    Packet headers at the Internet Egress point for one\npresent at the network edge.
    \ It then matches the responding packets\nby destination address, and restores
    the original headers.\n\nNAT itself is not a feature.  It is a mechanism which
    provides\nfeatures at an application cost.  This document identifies features\nwhich
    are supplied by NAT in IPv4 and how these features may be\nprovisioned in IPv6.
    \ Both NAT and application-friendly alternatives\nare presented.\n\t "

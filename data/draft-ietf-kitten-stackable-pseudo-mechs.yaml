  content: "This document defines and formalizes the concept of stackable pseudo-\nmechanisms,
    and associated concept of composite mechanisms, for the\nGeneric Security Service
    Application Programming Interface (GSS-API),\nas well as several utility functions.\n\nStackable
    GSS-API pseudo-mechanisms allow for the composition of new\nmechanisms that combine
    features from multiple mechanisms.  Stackable\nmechanisms that add support for
    Perfect Forward Security (PFS), data\ncompression, additional authentication factors,
    etc... are\nfacilitated by this document.\n\t "

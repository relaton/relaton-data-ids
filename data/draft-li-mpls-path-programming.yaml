  content: "   Segment Routing has been proposed to cope with the use cases in\n   traffic
    engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain, etc.  It can\n   leverage existing
    MPLS dataplane without any modification.  In fact,\n   the label stack capability
    in MPLS would have been utilized well to\n   implement flexible path programming
    to satisfy all kinds of\n   requirements of service bearing.  But in the distributed
    environment,\n   the flexible programming capability is difficult to implement
    and\n   always confined to reachability.  As the introducing of central\n   control
    in the network, the flexible MPLS programming capability\n   becomes possible
    owing to two factors: 1.  It becomes easier to\n   allocate label for more purposes
    than reachability; 2.  It is easy to\n   calculate the MPLS path in a global network
    view.  Moreover, the MPLS\n   path programming capability can be utilized to satisfy
    more\n   requirements of service bearing in the service layer which is defined\n
    \  as service-oriented MPLS path programming.  This document defines the\n   concept
    of MPLS path programming, then proposes use cases,\n   architecture and protocol
    extension requirements in the service\n   layer.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) is dual text-\n
    \  binary encoding format that has the unique property of text-binary\n   concatenation
    composability.  This composability property enables the\n   round trip conversion
    en-masse of concatenated primitives between the\n   text domain and binary domain
    while maintaining separability of\n   individual primtives.  This enables convenient
    usability in the text\n   domain and compact transmission in the binary domain.
    \ CESR\n   primitives are self-framing.  CESR supports self-framing group codes\n
    \  that enable stream processing and pipelining in both the text and\n   binary
    domains.  CESR supports composable text-binary encodings for\n   general data
    types as well as suites of cryptographic material.\n   Popular cryptographic material
    suites have compact encodings for\n   efficiency while less compact encodings
    provide sufficient\n   extensibility to support all foreseeable types.  CESR streams
    also\n   support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations.  CESR is a\n
    \  universal encoding that uniquely provides dual text and binary domain\n   representations
    via composable conversion.\n\n\t "

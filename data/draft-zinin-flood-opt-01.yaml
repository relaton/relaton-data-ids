  content: "The flooding algorithm is one of the most important parts of any link\nstate
    routing protocol. It ensures that all routers within a link\nstate domain converge
    on the same topological information within a\nfinite period of time. To ensure
    reliability, typical implementations\nof the flooding algorithm send new information
    via all interfaces\nother than the one the new piece of information was received
    on. This\nredundancy is necessary to guarantee that flooding is performed\nreliably,
    but implies considerable overhead of utilized bandwidth and\nCPU time if neighboring
    routers are connected with more than one\nlink.  This document describes a method
    that reduces this overhead.\n\t "

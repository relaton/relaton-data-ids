  content: "   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a critical component in the\n
    \  Internet to exchange routing information between network domains.\n   Due to
    this central nature, it is important to understand the\n   security and reliability
    requirements that can and should be ensured\n   to prevent accidental or intentional
    routing disturbances.\n\n   Previously, security considerations for BGP have been
    described in\n   RFC7454 / BCP194.  Since the publications of RFC7454 / BCP194,\n
    \  several developments and changes in operational practice took place\n   that
    warrant an update of these best current practices.  This\n   document replaces
    RFC7454 / BCP194, focusing on the overall goals,\n   and providing a less implementation
    centric set of best practices.\n\n   This document describes security requirements
    and goals when\n   operating BGP for exchanging routing information with other
    networks,\n   and explicitly does not focus on specific technical implementations\n
    \  and requirements.\n\n\t "

  content: "   With the increase of network threats, the Service Function Chain\n
    \  (SFC) is vulnerable to various attacks, and as a key component of the\n   entire
    SFC, the security of the service function (SF) is more\n   critical.  This document
    proposes a mimic SF security architecture\n   based on the dynamic heterogeneous
    redundancy model, which can\n   effectively protect the normal execution function
    of SF in SFC.  The\n   security architecture adopts an active defense method to
    defend\n   against network attacks, and it can effectively defend against most\n
    \  SF attacks.\n\n\t "

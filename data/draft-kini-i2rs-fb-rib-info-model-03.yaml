abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an information model associated with the I2RS
    ephemeral state for filter-based routing of IP packets via a Filter- based Routing
    Information Base (FB-RIB). FB-RIBs (ephemeral and non- ephemeral) are associated
    with specific interfaces interfaces on a routing device, and process packets received
    on these interfaces according a filtering policy. A filtering policy is a a minimalistic
    event-match_condition-action (ECA) policy with only one event - the reception
    of a frame/packet of data on an interface. The match conditions in the filter
    policy are n-tuple matches based on the content of the frame/packet or the time
    of its arrival. Filter-based policy allows actions which modifying the frame/packet,
    forward the frame or packet, or drop the frame/packet. Filter-Based Policy in
    FB-RIBs engages before any destination based routing so the FB-RIBs provide a
    destination-based default RIB that will be used if none of the filters are matched.</p>"

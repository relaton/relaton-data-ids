  content: "Maintaining reachability of an EID prefix despite the failures of\nETRs
    is a key concern in the LISP architecture.  In this document, we\nfirst analyse
    this problem in comparison with traditional routing\nprotocols.  Then, we explain
    how Internet Service Providers could\noffer a service that preserves the reachability
    of the LISP ETRs of\ntheir customers in case of failures.\n\t "

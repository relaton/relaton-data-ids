  script: Latn
  content: "There is an increasing use of real-time applications on IP networks.\nAs
    these applications require certain QoS levels to operate\nacceptably there is
    a need for IP networks to guarantee such levels.\nThis draft introduces a set
    of requirements that must be fulfilled\nin order that an MPLS network can support
    QoS-dependant IP flows as\nset out in the VoMPLS draft [2]. A candidate architecture
    that\nconforms to these requirements is then set out. The network consists\nof
    a session control layer, an IP Layer that is constrained through\nthe use of MPLS
    tunnels, and a distributed management system to\ncontrol those tunnels.\nThe draft
    describes each of the essential components needed to\nimplement such a network
    and suggests suitable technologies for each\nof them.\n\t "

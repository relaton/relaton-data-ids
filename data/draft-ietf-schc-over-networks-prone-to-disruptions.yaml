  content: "   This document describes the use of SCHC over different network\n   topologies
    and devices regardless of their capabilities and\n   configurations.  The use
    of SCHC will bring connectivity to devices\n   with disruptive connections caused
    by restrained use of battery and\n   connectionless setups with long delays and
    latency.\n\n\t "

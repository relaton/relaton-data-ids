  content: "   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends the MPLS
    \n   control plane to encompass layer 2, time-division, wavelength and \n   spatial
    switching. Along with the current development on IP over \n   optical switching,
    considerable advances in optical transport \n   systems based on the multiple
    optical switching granularities have \n   been developed. \n     \n   Currently,
    GMPLS considers two layers of optical granularity using \n   wavelengths and fibers.
    By introducing an extended definition of \n   waveband switching, this document
    specifies the corresponding GMPLS \n   extensions, to further integrate optical
    multi-granularity and \n   benefit from the features of the corresponding switching
    layers. \n\t "

  content: "   Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations\n
    \  associated with pervasive surveillance.  Some of the reported attacks\n   involved
    compromising the smart card supply chain, such as attacking\n   SIM card manufacturers
    and operators in an effort to compromise\n   shared secrets stored on these cards.
    \ Since the publication of those\n   reports, manufacturing and provisioning processes
    have gained much\n   scrutiny and have improved.  However, the danger of resourceful\n
    \  attackers for these systems is still a concern.  Always assuming\n   breach
    such as key compromise and minimizing the impact of breach are\n   essential zero-trust
    principles.\n\n   This specification is an optional extension to the EAP-AKA'\n
    \  authentication method which was defined in [RFC9048].  The extension,\n   when
    negotiated, provides Forward Secrecy for the session key\n   generated as a part
    of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.  This\n   prevents an attacker who has
    gained access to the long-term pre-\n   shared secret in a SIM card from being
    able to decrypt any past\n   communications.  In addition, if the attacker stays
    merely a passive\n   eavesdropper, the extension prevents attacks against future
    sessions.\n   This forces attackers to use active attacks instead.\n\n\t "

  content: "   It is often desirable for an application server to permit a flow\n
    \  across a firewall, as happens today when a firewall includes an\n   Application
    Layer Gateway (ALG) function.  However, an ALG has\n   several weaknesses.\n\n
    \  This document describes a cryptographic technique for an application\n   server
    to permit a flow across a firewall.  This technique uses OAuth\n   and a new PCP
    option.\n\n\t "

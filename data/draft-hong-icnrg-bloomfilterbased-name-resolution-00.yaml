abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In information-centric networking (ICN), uniquely identifiable and\n
    \  location independent names are assigned directly to the named data\n   which
    raises scalability issues and they get even worse with flat\n   names. Accordingly,
    name resolution system required for lookup-by-\n   name routing in ICN has to
    be designed to scale, also considering\n   mobility support. In this draft, a
    bloom filter-based flat name\n   resolution system (B-NRS) is proposed where the
    bloom filter as an\n   aggregated form of names and hierarchical structure of
    the B-NRS are\n   exploited to address the scalability issues.\n\n\t "

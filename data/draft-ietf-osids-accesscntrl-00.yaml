  content: "This memo defines an extended ACL (Access Control List) mechanism for
    the OSI Directory.  It is intended to meet strong operational requirements to
    restrict searching and listing externally, while allowing much more freedom within
    an organization.  In particular, this mechanism makes it possible to restrict
    searches to certain sets of attributes, and to prevent ``trawling'':  the disclosure
    of large organizational data or structure information by repeated searches or
    lists.  This capability is necessary for organizations that want to hide their
    internal structure, or to prevent dumping of their entire database.  This memo
    describes functionality beyond, but compatible with, that expected in the 1992
    X.500 standard.\n\t "

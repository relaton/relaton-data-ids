  content: "   This document describes Best Current Practices (BCP) for improving\n
    \  meaningful connectivity and digital sovereignty through the circular\n   management
    of end-user and network devices.  It addresses a\n   foundational but often overlooked
    dependency of Internet access\n   deployments: the availability, repairability,
    governance, and\n   lifecycle management of devices required to meaningfully use
    access\n   networks.\n\n   Based on operational experience from deployments in
    Spain, Argentina,\n   and Senegal—including eReuse.org, EKOA/UNLP, Solidança,
    TAU/RAEE, and\n   Hahatay—this document identifies practices that have demonstrated\n
    \  positive access, social, and environmental outcomes.  These practices\n   complement
    research within the IRTF GAIA Research Group by\n   documenting reproducible operational
    approaches that increase the\n   sustainability, autonomy, and long-term viability
    of Internet access\n   in underserved contexts, and therefore contribute to facilitate
    \"the\n   unconnected\" to connect.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the requirement of lightweight authentication\nand
    key agreement protocols for Internet of Things (LAKAPIoT).\nThe authentication
    and key agreement protocols are very crucial for\nIoT since it can prevent unauthorized
    or malicious IoT devices from\naccessing the network. However, most IoT devices
    have limited storage,\ncomputing and communication capacity. Moreover, the network
    archi-\ntecture of IoT is very different from the traditional network.\nTherefore,
    designing authentication and key agreement protocols for\nIoT is an essential
    step to ensure its security. In this draft, the\nrequirement of lightweight authentication
    and key agreement protocols\nfor IoT is proposed.\n\n\n\t "

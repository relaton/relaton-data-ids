  content: "This document provides a functional description of the services provided\nby
    the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP) as\ndescribed in ITU
    Recommendation Q.2110.  SSCOP performs connection\ncontrol, transfer of variable
    length user data units, sequence\nintegrity, error correction, and flow control
    functions to its users.\nThese services are currently used to support the transport
    requirements\nof signalling applications which require reliable, ordered, low-latency\ntransfer
    over large bandwidth paths.  Although SSCOP is currently\ndefined to transfer
    information between Layer 3 entities across the\nUNI and NNI using ATM virtual
    channels it may be possible to apply the\nsame concepts to provide transfer of
    information over UDP/IP.\n\t "

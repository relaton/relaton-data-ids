  content: "For the purposes of this document, lawful intercept is the lawfully authorized
    interception and monitoring of communications.  Service providers are being asked
    to meet legal and regulatory requirements for the interception of voice as well
    as data communications in IP networks in a variety of countries worldwide.  Although
    requirements vary from country to country, some requirements remain common even
    though details such as delivery formats may differ.  This document describes Cisco's
    Architecture for supporting lawful intercept in IP networks.  It provides a general
    solution that has a minimum set of common interfaces.  This document does not
    attempt to address any of the specific legal requirements or obligations that
    may exist in a particular country.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

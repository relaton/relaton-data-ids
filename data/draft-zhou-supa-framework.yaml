  content: "   Currently, there are network services that impose specific demands\n
    \  on a communication network. This document describes the SUPA basic\n   architecture,
    its elements and interfaces.  The main SUPA\n   architecture entities are the
    Service Management (SM) and the\n   Network Manager/Controller (NM/NC). The SM
    is a functional entity\n   that creates and runs network services by using a set
    of NM/NCs. The\n   NM/NC is a functional entity that provides one or more of the\n
    \  following functions: (1) the generation, maintenance and release of\n   network
    topologies, (2) the generation, maintenance, and release of\n   network service-specific
    abstractions, (3) the mapping between\n   network service-specific abstractions
    and the network topology, and\n   (4) the mapping between network service-specific
    abstractions and\n   network device configuration. Both the SM and the NM/NC may
    be made\n   up of multiple distinct entities that collectively perform their\n
    \  functions.\n\n\t "

  content: "   At present, tunneling technology has been widely applied in VPN,\n
    \  mobile communication network, IPv6 over IPv4, Mobile IP, multi-point\n   delivery,
    and other fields.  In the E2E link, there may already have\n   been an effective
    congestion control mechanism, but we SHOULD also do\n   traffic management in
    the tunnel to improve the performance of the\n   entire network.  Because of the
    particularity of the scenario of the\n   tunnel, the existing E2E traffic management
    mechanism cannot be\n   directly be deployed (e.g.  VPN, IPv6 over IPv4 etc).
    \ In these\n   cases, this document focuses on how to expose the congestion while\n
    \  the feedback mechanism is left for later study.  This document\n   describes
    the problem of identifying congestion in a tunnel segment\n   of an end-to-end
    flow.  A basic tunnel congestion exposure model is\n   then described, followed
    by three example scenarios which use the\n   basic model to derive tunnel congestion.
    \ Finally, a general solution\n   that can be applied to IP-in-IP tunnels is described.\n\n\t "

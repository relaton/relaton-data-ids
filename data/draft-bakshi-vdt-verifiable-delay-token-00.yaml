  content: "   This document specifies a protocol for the issuance and verification\n
    \  of Verifiable Delay Tokens (VDT) that proves that a minimum amount of\n   wall
    time has elapsed since the issuance of the VDT.  The protocol\n   does not rely
    on trusted or synchronized time sources and instead\n   uses Verifiable Delay
    Functions (VDFs).  The protocol supports time-\n   based access control, anti-abuse
    and privacy-preserving mechanisms by\n   letting the verifier enforce a waiting
    period, mitigating the abuse\n   without learning client identity.  The protocol
    ensures unlinkability\n   between token issuance and redemption and does not require
    the\n   verifier to be aware of the client identifiers, network addresses or\n
    \  any long-lived state.  VDTs compose well with the existing Internet\n   protocols
    such as HTTP-based systems and Oblivious HTTP.\n\n\t "

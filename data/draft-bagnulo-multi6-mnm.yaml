  content: "This note attempts to describe how to apply the MIPv6 protocol to\nprovide
    fault tolerance to transport layer connections established\nbetween a multi-homed
    host and other hosts in the Internet.\nSpecifically, this note addresses the usage
    of MIPv6 signaling\nmessages to convey information about alternative address to
    be used\nwhen an outage occurs. Additionally, possible mechanisms to detect\nfailures
    affecting the currently used path are explored.\n\n\t "

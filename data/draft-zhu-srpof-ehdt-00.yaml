  content: "   It has already been confirmed that software-defined networking (SDN)\n
    \  can make the networks more programmable, adaptive and application\n   aware.
    However, due to the large-scale and geographically-distributed\n   nature of wide-area
    networks (WAN), the scalability could become a\n   critical issue if we incorporate
    SDN for WANs (i.e., realizing SD-\n   WANs). In this paper, we design and implement
    a novel network system\n   that can leverage source routing with the protocol-oblivious\n
    \  forwarding (POF) to facilitate efficient e-Health data transfers with\n   low
    setup latency. We develop the POF-based source routing protocol\n   to realize
    a pipeline based packet processing procedure, which can\n   replace the table-lookup
    based approach in traditional SDN networks\n   and make the forwarding plane more
    efficient. The proposed scheme is\n   demonstrated experimentally, and the results
    verify that with it, the\n   flow-tables installed in each core switches in a
    POF-controlled SD-\n   WAN can be minimized and the path setup latency of traffic
    flows can\n   be reduced significantly as well.\n\n\n\t "

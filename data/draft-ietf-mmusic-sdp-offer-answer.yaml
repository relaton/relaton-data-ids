  content: "This document defines a mechanism by which two entities can make use of
    the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to arrive at a common view of a multimedia
    session between them.  In the model, one participant offers the other a description
    of the desired session from their perspective, and the other participant answers
    with the desired session from their perspective.  This offer/answer model is most
    useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed
    for the complete view of the session.  The offer/answer model is used by protocols
    like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

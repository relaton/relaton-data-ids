  content: "When requesting and reporting dialog status in SIP, users often want\nto
    know the status of a particular telephone instrument, rather than\nthe status
    of an Address of Record (AOR).  The architecture of SIP\nmakes it difficult to
    obtain the status of a telephone instrument in\na way that is convenient for use
    in common situations, in particular,\nin an organization's PBX.\n\nThis document
    describes two methods for identifying which telephone\ninstrument is making each
    registration request that is convenient to\ndeploy in PBXs.  This information
    can be used to obtain the status of\nindividual telephone instruments.\n\t "

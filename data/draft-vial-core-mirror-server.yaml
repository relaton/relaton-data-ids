  content: "   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at\n
    \  realizing the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architecture in\n   a
    suitable form for the most constrained nodes.  Thanks to the\n   Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), REST is now applicable to\n   constrained networks.  However
    the most energy-constrained devices\n   may enter sleep mode and disconnect their
    network link during several\n   minutes to save energy, hence preventing them
    from acting as\n   traditional web servers.  This document describes how a sleeping\n
    \  device can store resource representations in an entity called Mirror\n   Server
    and participate in a constrained RESTful environment.\n\n\t "

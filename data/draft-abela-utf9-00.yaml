- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   ISO/IEC 10646 defines a multi-octet character set called the\n   Universal
    Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's\n   writing systems.
    \ Multi-octet characters, however, are not compatible\n   with many current applications
    and protocols, and this has led to the\n   development of a few so-called UCS
    transformation formats (UTF), each\n   with different characteristics.  UTF-9,
    the object of this memo, has\n   the characteristic of preserving the full ISO-Latin1
    range, providing\n   compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software
    that rely\n   on ISO-Latin1 values.\n \n   ISO-Latin1 is almost as widespread
    as ASCII in many countries,\n   especially in most of western Europe, and is the
    default character\n   set for HTML.  A compatible encoding seems desirable, where
    possible.\n\n\t "

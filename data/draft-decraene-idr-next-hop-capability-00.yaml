  content: "   RFC 5492 defines capabilities advertisement for the BGP peer.  In\n
    \  addition, it's useful to know the capabilities of the BGP Next-Hop,\n   in
    particular for forwarding plane features.  RFC 5492 is not\n   applicable because
    the BGP peer may be different from the BGP Next-\n   Hop, in particular when BGP
    Route Reflection is used.  This document\n   defines a mechanism to advertise
    such BGP Next Hop Capabilities.\n\n   This document defines a new BGP non-transitive
    attribute to carry\n   Next-Hop Capabilities.  This attribute is deleted when
    the BGP Next\n   Hop is changed.\n\n   This document also defines a Next-Hop capability
    to advertise the\n   ability to handle the Entropy Label defined in RFC 6790.\n\n\n\t "

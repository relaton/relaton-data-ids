  content: "   This document presents operational, policy and security\n   considerations
    for the authors and publishers of client applications\n   that choose to implement
    DNS resolution through any of the protocols\n   that provide private, encrypted
    connections between the application\n   itself and the DNS resolver.  As these
    protocols, depending on\n   implementation choices and deployment models, may
    impact the Internet\n   significantly at the architectural, legal and policy levels,
    the\n   document records the current consensus on how these protocols should\n
    \  be used by applications, especially user-facing applications meant\n   for
    mass usage by non-technical consumers.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document presents a list of tests which implementers of IP Flow\nInformation
    Export (IPFIX) compliant systems are encouraged to\nperform on their IPFIX system.
    \ This document has been created to\nhelp implementers test the functionality
    of their IPFIX exporter\nand/or collector component.  The goal of these tests
    is to ensure\nthat all important functions are covered by tests and thereby to
    gain\na level of confidence in the system which allows the implementer to\nperform
    interoperabilty or plug tests with other IPFIX systems.\n\t "

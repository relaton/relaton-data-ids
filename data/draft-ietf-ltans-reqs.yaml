  content: "There are many scenarios in which users must be able to prove the existence
    of data at a specific point in time and be able to demonstrate the integrity of
    data since that time, even when the duration from time of existence to time of
    demonstration spans a large period of time.  Additionally, users must be able
    to verify signatures on digitally signed data many years after the generation
    of the signature.  This document describes a class of long-term archive services
    to support such scenarios and the technical requirements for interacting with
    such services.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

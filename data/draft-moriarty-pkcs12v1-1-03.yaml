  content: "   This document represents a republication of PKCS #12 v1.1\n   (Republication)
    From RSA Laboratories' Public Key Cryptography\n   Standard (PKCS) series.  Change
    control is transferred to the IETF,\n   and generally all rights in the copyright
    are hereby assigned from\n   RSA to IETF, except that RSA reserves the internal
    right to continue\n   publishing, with the right to modify, and distributing the\n
    \  Republication and its predecessors internally to RSA and its parent\n   company
    EMC, including the right to make modifications to the\n   Republication and its
    predecessors (the \"RSA Internal Right\").  For\n   avoidance of doubt, RSA's
    Internal Right includes the right to post\n   on its public website for use by
    other parties.  The body of this\n   document, except for the security considerations
    section, is taken\n   directly from the PKCS #12 v1.1 specification.  The list
    of\n   references and the in-line cites have been updated or added where\n   appropriate
    to cite the most current documents in addition to those\n   current at the original
    publication of PKCS #12 v1.1.\n\n   PKCS #12 v1.1 describes a transfer syntax
    for personal identity\n   information, including private keys, certificates, miscellaneous\n
    \  secrets, and extensions.  Machines, applications, browsers, Internet\n   kiosks,
    and so on, that support this standard will allow a user to\n   import, export,
    and exercise a single set of personal identity\n   information.  This standard
    supports direct transfer of personal\n   information under several privacy and
    integrity modes.\n\n\t "

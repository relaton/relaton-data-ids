  content: "   With the deployment of 5G networks, cloud-based interactive services\n
    \  such as cloud gaming have gained substantial attention.  To ensure\n   users'
    quality of experience (QoE), a cloud interactive service may\n   require not only
    high bandwidth (e.g., high-resolution media\n   transmission) but also low delay
    (e.g., low latency and low lagging).\n   However, the quality perceived by a user
    of a mobile and wireless\n   device may vary widely as a function of many factors,
    and unhandled\n   changes can substantially compromise the user's QoE.  In this\n
    \  document, we investigate network-aware applications (NAA), which\n   realize
    cloud-based interactive services with improved QoE, by\n   efficient utilization
    of a solution named Mobile and Wireless\n   Information Exposure (MoWIE).  In
    particular, this document\n   demonstrates, through realistic evaluations, that
    mobile network\n   information such as MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can\n
    \  effectively expose the dynamics of the underlying network and can be\n   made
    available to applications through MoWIE; using such an\n   information, the applications
    can then adapt key control knobs such\n   as media codec schemes, encapsulation,
    and application layer\n   processing to minimize QoE distortion.  Following evaluations
    we give\n   a cursory overview of the design space for implementing MoWIE\n\n\t "

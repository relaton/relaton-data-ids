  content: "   This document was prepared as part of the IETF response to concerns\n
    \  about \"pervasive monitoring\" (PM) as articulated in\n   [I-D.farrell-perpass-attack].
    \ It begins by describing the current\n   criteria (discussed at the STRINT workshop
    [STRINT]) for addressing\n   concerns about PM.  It then examines terminology
    that has been used\n   in IETF standards (and in academic publications) to describe\n
    \  encryption and key management techniques, with a focus on\n   authentication
    vs. anonymity.  Based on this analysis, it propose a\n   new term, \"opportunistic
    security\" to describe a goal for IETF\n   security protocols, one countermeasure
    to pervasive monitoring.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This is the definition of an IMAP command for reporting spam.\n\n   Spam
    can be flagged using the $Junk and $NotJunk keywords.  Spam\n   reporting is meant
    to correspond to a command to be run on the IMAP\n   server, in order to tune
    filters and possibly mitigate further\n   attempts.  This behavior can be obtained
    by moving message to a\n   special folder that is being observed by the server.\n\nPurpose\n\n
    \  This is a cleanup of an existing draft and its sole purpose is to\n   discuss
    whether its core is good for APPSAWG.\n\n\t "

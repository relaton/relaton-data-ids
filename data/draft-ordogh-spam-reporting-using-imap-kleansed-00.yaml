abstract:
- content: "<p>This is the definition of an IMAP command for reporting spam. Spam
    can be flagged using the $Junk and $NotJunk keywords. Spam reporting is meant
    to correspond to a command to be run on the IMAP server, in order to tune filters
    and possibly mitigate further attempts. This behavior can be obtained by moving
    message to a special folder that is being observed by the server. Purpose This
    is a cleanup of an existing draft and its sole purpose is to discuss whether its
    core is good for APPSAWG.</p>"

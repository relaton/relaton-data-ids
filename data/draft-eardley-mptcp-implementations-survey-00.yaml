  content: "   This survey gathers information from people who have implemented\n
    \  MPTCP, in particular to help progress the protocol from Experimental\n   to
    Standards track.\n\n   It is currently a draft version, so it should not yet be
    filled in --\n   instead, we would like feedback (1) from implementers, whether
    it\n   needs modifying before you would be able (or prepared to) fill it in,\n
    \  (2) from the WG, suggestions to make it more useful.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Internet access through public networks require authentication of\nclients
    and networks to each other. While there are currently used\nlink-layer protocols
    such as PPP, it is very desirable to provide a\nnetwork-layer solution that can
    work across multiple types of links.\nAuthentication of roaming clients is generally
    handled by AAA\nprotocols. In order to use AAA between the network and the client,
    we\nneed a protocol to carry required messages. This draft defines how we\ncan
    extend the standard router discovery protocol to use it as a \ncarrier for the
    authentication purposes.\n\t "

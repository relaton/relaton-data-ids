  content: "   Current Link State Protocol Data Unit (PDU) flooding rates are much\n
    \  slower than what modern networks can support.  The use of IS-IS at\n   larger
    scale requires faster flooding rates to achieve desired\n   convergence goals.
    \ This document discusses the need for faster\n   flooding, the issues around
    faster flooding, and some example\n   approaches to achieve faster flooding.  It
    also defines protocol\n   extensions relevant to faster flooding.\n\n\t "

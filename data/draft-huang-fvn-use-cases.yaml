  content: "   IP video traffic represents a large fraction of Internet traffic.\n
    \  Current infrastructures are not prepared to deal with the increasing\n   amount
    of video traffic. How to transmit video traffic efficiently\n   poses traffic
    management challenges to both network operators and\n   Internet applications.\n\n
    \  This document provides use cases where network operator and Internet\n   application
    can be cooperative to improve video transmission\n   efficiency, based on the
    fundamental traffic characteristics (e.g.\n   frame priority, adaptive bit rate,
    etc.).\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\n
    \  can be secured by means of Group Object Security for Constrained\n   RESTful
    Environments (Group OSCORE).  At deployment time, devices may\n   not know the
    exact security groups to join, the respective Group\n   Manager, or other information
    required to perform the joining\n   process.  This document describes how a CoAP
    endpoint can use\n   descriptions and links of resources registered at the CoRE
    Resource\n   Directory to discover security groups and to acquire information
    for\n   joining them through the respective Group Manager.  A given security\n
    \  group may protect multiple application groups, which are separately\n   announced
    in the Resource Directory as sets of endpoints sharing a\n   pool of resources.
    \ This approach is consistent with, but not limited\n   to, the joining of security
    groups based on the ACE framework for\n   Authentication and Authorization in
    constrained environments.\n\n\t "

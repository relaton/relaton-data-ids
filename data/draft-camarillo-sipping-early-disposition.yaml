  content: "This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for the\nContent-Disposition
    header field in SIP. The treatment of\n'early-session' bodies is similar to the
    treatment of 'session\nbodies. That is, they follow the offer/answer model. Their
    only\ndifference is that session descriptions whose disposition type is\n'early-session'
    are used to establish early media sessions within\nearly dialogs, as opposed to
    regular sessions within regular dialog\n\t "

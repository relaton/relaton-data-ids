- language: en

  content: "This document describes an architecture where peers in an peer-to-\npeer
    overlay use special IP addresses to identify other peers.  Two\nof the advantages
    of this approach are that (a) most existing\napplications can run in an overlay
    without needing any changes and\n(b) peer mobility and NAT traversal are handled
    in a way that is\ntransparent to most applications.\n\t "

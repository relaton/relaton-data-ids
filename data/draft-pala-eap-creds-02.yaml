  content: "   With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that\n
    \  rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or\n   tokens)
    for network access, the need for a standardized credentials\n   provisioning and
    management framework is paramount.  The 802.1x\n   architecture allows for entities
    (e.g., devices, applications, etc.)\n   to authenticate to the network by providing
    a communication channel\n   where different methods can be used to exchange different
    types of\n   credentials.  However, the need for managing these credentials (i.e.,\n
    \  provisioning and renewal) is still a hard problem to solve.\n\n   EAP-CREDS,
    if implemented in Managed Networks (e.g., Cable Modems),\n   could enable our
    operators to offer a registration and credentials\n   management service integrated
    in the home WiFi thus enabling\n   visibility about registered devices.  During
    initialization, EAP-\n   CREDS also allows for MUD files or URLs to be transferred
    between the\n   EAP Peer and the EAP Server, thus giving detailed visibility about\n
    \  devices when they are provisioned with credentials for accessing the\n   networks.
    \ The possibility provided by EAP-CREDS can help to secure\n   home or business
    networks by leveraging the synergies of the security\n   teams from the network
    operators thanks to the extended knowledge of\n   what and how is registered/authenticated.\n\n
    \  This specifications define how to support the provisioning and\n   management
    of authentication credentials that can be exploited in\n   different environments
    (e.g., Wired, WiFi, cellular, etc.) to users\n   and/or devices by using EAP together
    with standard provisioning\n   protocols.\n\n\t "

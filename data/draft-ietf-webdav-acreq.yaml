  content: "To provide a robust model for modifying documents and data within a\ndistributed
    World Wide Web authoring environment, it is necessary to\nfurnish a methodology
    which controls access to objects.  Access control\nmay include the ability to
    read an object, modify an object, or perform\nother more advanced functions upon
    an object.  Access control is\nnecessary to prevent unauthorized access or modification
    of objects\nwithin the authoring environment which could lead to unintended loss,\ndamage
    or disclosure of data.\n \nThis document proposes requirements for the support
    of access control\nwithin a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)
    environment.\nIt describes a model for the representation and interpretation of
    access\ncontrol policies, and a set of operations needed to manage policies in\nthat
    form.  It is intended that these requirements be supported within\nthe framework
    of the proposed WebDAV extensions [WEBDAV1] to HTTP\n[HTTP], in the form of additional
    protocol operations and compliance\nrequirements for clients and servers\n\t "

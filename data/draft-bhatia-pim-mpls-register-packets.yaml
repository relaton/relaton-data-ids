  content: "In PIM-SM the designated router (DR) closest to the source keeps\nsending
    PIM register packets till it receives an explicit Register-\nStop message from
    the rendezvous point (RP) router.  The process of\nencapsulating multicast data
    traffic to the RP, and the decapsulation\ndone by RP are relatively expensive
    operations for a router to\nperform, depending upon whether or not the router
    has appropriate\nhardware support for these tasks.\n\nSince the PIM register messages
    are native IP packets and routed\nbased on IP forwarding tables no resource reservation
    mechanisms are\navailable.  All IP packets will follow common paths that are defined\nby
    the traditional IGP's algorithm and customizing the path for\nmulticast applications
    is impossible.\n\nThis document proposes using MPLS tunnel(s) to send traffic
    from the\nsource to the RP till the shortest path tree (SPT) from the RP to the\nsource
    is established.  Processing MPLS packets is easy and is\nreadily supported on
    most platforms.\n\t "

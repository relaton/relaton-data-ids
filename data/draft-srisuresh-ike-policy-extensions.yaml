- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "As IPsec is widely deployed, there is increasing need to negotiate\nsecurity
    keys using IKE at application level granularity. \nIKE, as currently proposed,
    has restrictions in negotiating keys\nfor applications with bundled sessions and
    complex policies. \nThe draft identifies the problem with IKE and suggests extensions
    \nto make IKE application and policy friendly. The proposed solution\nsuggests
    extensions to the conceptual operation of IPsec as well as\nIKE, but does not
    require changes to existing IKE payloads. The \ndocument introduces a new policy
    payload that complements existing\nIKE payloads and suggests replacing ID payload
    with the Policy\npayload, in Quick mode.\n\n\t "

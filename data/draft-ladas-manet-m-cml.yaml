  content: "   This document describes the multipath ChaMeLeon (M-CML) routing\n   protocol
    designed for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). M-CML is a\n   multi-path, hybrid
    routing protocol operating within a defined area\n   denoted as the Critical Area
    (CA) in which the MANET is temporarily\n   deployed during the post-disaster phase.
    The main concept behind M-\n   CML is the adaptability of its routing mechanisms
    towards changes in\n   the physical and logical state of a MANET. For autonomous\n
    \  communications in MANET, it is likely that the network size varies\n   whenever
    additional devices join or subset of them leave the\n   network. In addition,
    battery depletion of lightweight mobile\n   communication devices will stipulate
    another reason for changes in\n   the network size. As a result, the M-CML approach
    adapts its routing\n   mechanism according to changes in the network scenario
    within a\n   predefined CA. For small networks, M-CML routes data proactively\n
    \  using the Optimized Link State Routing version v2 (OLSRv2) protocol\n   whereas
    for larger networks it utilizes the reactive Ad hoc On-\n   Demand Distance Vector
    Version 2 (AODVv2) Routing protocol. The\n   oscillation phase is the intermediate
    phase in which the transition\n   of routing protocol occurs. M-CML creates multi-path
    routes for\n   nodes with disjoint paths which increases the network reliability.\n\n\t "

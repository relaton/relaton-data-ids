  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes Cogny protocol that is a SOAP-based protocol\n
    \  for peer-to-peer content sharing systems. Unlike general purpose\n   peer-to-peer
    protocols such as JXTA protocol, Cogny protocol is\n   specialized to support
    centralized peer-to-peer content sharing\n   systems. So it is much simpler and
    easier to implement than JXTA\n   protocol. Because Cogny protocol is specialized
    to content sharing\n   systems, it defines application layer functions necessary
    to them.\n   One of them is a content transfer protocol that keeps consistency
    of\n   content. Cogny protocol defines encryption method for it. Another is\n
    \  efficient full-text search. Cogny protocol defines a cache method for\n   full-text
    search.\n\t "

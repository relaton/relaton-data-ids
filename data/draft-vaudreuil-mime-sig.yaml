  content: "The memo defines a MIME content type for the exchange of sender contact
    information and user agent capability information beyond what is feasable in the
    RFC822 header.  This exchange is generally accomplished by use of a signature
    trailer appended to the message.  These signatures commonly contain address, phone,
    and email addressing.  This document outlines a formalization and extension of
    the signature concept to provide a machine readable, internationally friendly
    form to exchange this information.\n\t "

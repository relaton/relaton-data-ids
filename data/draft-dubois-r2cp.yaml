  content: "   This document describes a protocol that allows a router to learn the\n
    \  performance characteristics of the network to its neighbors when the\n   shared
    media link between them may provide highly dynamic bandwidth\n   characteristics.
    \ This information comes from the radio modems which\n   are providing periodic
    updates about the quality of the radio signal\n   to the routers listening for
    these updates on the same physical\n   network segment.  The functionality is
    similar to that described in\n   \"PPPoE Extensions for Credit Flow and Link Metrics\"
    [RFC5578] but\n   applied to a local area network topology rather than a set of
    point-\n   to-point links.\n\n\t "

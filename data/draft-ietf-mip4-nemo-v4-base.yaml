  content: "This document describes a protocol for supporting Mobile Networks between
    a Mobile Router and a Home Agent by extending the Mobile IPv4 protocol. A Mobile
    Router is responsible for the mobility of one or more network segments or subnets
    moving together. The Mobile Router hides its mobility from the nodes on the Mobile
    Network. The nodes on the Mobile Network may be fixed in relationship to the Mobile
    Router and may not have any mobility function.\n\n Extensions to Mobile IPv4 are
    introduced to support Mobile Networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

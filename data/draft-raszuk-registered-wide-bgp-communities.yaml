  content: "   Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays an\n
    \  important role in external BGP peering relations.  The most common\n   tool
    used today to attach various information about routes is\n   realized with the
    use of BGP communities.  Such information is\n   important for the peering AS
    to perform some mutually agreed actions\n   without the need to maintain a separate
    offline database for each\n   pair of prefix and an associated with it requested
    set of action\n   entries.\n\n   This document proposes to establish a new IANA
    maintained registry of\n   most commonly used Wide BGP Communities by network
    operators.  Such\n   public registry will allow for easy refernece and clear\n
    \  interpretation of the actions associated with received community\n   values.\n\n\t "

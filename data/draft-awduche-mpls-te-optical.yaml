  content: "This document describes an approach to the design of control planes\nfor
    optical crossconnects (OXCs), which leverages existing control\nplane techniques
    developed for MPLS Traffic Engineering.  The\nproposed approach combines recent
    advances in MPLS traffic\nengineering control plane constructs with OXC technology
    to:  (1)\nprovide a framework for real-time provisioning of optical channels in\nautomatically
    switched optical networks, (2) foster the expedited\ndevelopment and deployment
    of a new class of versatile OXCs, and (3)\nallow the use of uniform semantics
    for network management and\noperations control in hybrid networks consisting of
    OXCs and label\nswitching routers (LSRs).  The proposed approach is particularly\nadvantageous
    for OXCs intended for data-centric optical\ninternetworking systems. In such environments,
    it will help to\nsimplify network administration.  This approach also paves the
    way\nfor the eventual incorporation of DWDM multiplexing capabilities in\nIP routers.\n\t "

  content: "This document provides an analysis and comparison of IPv4 and IPv6\nheader
    sizes under various circumstances.  The goal of this document\nis to provide hard
    evidence for use in frequent discussions regarding\ntransition, where header overhead
    comes up as an issue used to\nportray IPv6 depolyment as untenable.  The results
    show that for\nlinks that are not fully utilized, the IPv6 overhead would only
    add a\nfew percent to their load over what IPv4 implies, while for congested\nlinks,
    we note that header compression techniques for IPv6 are at\nleast as effective
    as those for IPv4.  This demonstrates that the\nheader overhead argument against
    IPv6 is misinformed.\n\n\t "

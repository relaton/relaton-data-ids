  content: "   Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a\n
    \  wide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel\n   endpoints,
    transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.  As a\n   result of their role
    in tying together different elements in the\n   system, the requirements on tunnels
    are influenced by all of these\n   components.  Flexibility is therefore the most
    important aspect of a\n   tunnel protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution
    of the\n   system.  This draft describes Geneve, a protocol designed to\n   recognize
    and accommodate these changing capabilities and needs.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Traditionally, NFV platforms were limited to using standard\n   virtualization
    technologies (e.g., Xen, KVM, VMWare, Hyper-V, etc.)\n   running guests based
    on general-purpose operating systems such as\n   Windows, Linux or FreeBSD. More
    recently, a number of light-weight\n   virtualization technologies including containers,
    unikernels\n   (specialized VMs) and minimalistic distributions of general-purpose\n
    \  OSes have widened the spectrum of possibilities when constructing an\n   NFV
    platform. This draft describes the challenges in building such a\n   platform
    and discusses to what extent these technologies, as well as\n   traditional VMs,
    are able to address them.\n\n\t "

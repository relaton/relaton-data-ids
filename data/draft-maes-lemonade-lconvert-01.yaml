  content: "   LCONVERT defines extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for
    \n   optimization in a mobile setting, aimed at allowing adaptation and \n   transcoding
    of attachments as needed by the client. Conversion \n   (adaptation, transcoding)
    may be requested by the client and \n   performed by the server on a best effort
    basis or decided by the \n   server based on its knowledge of the client capabilities,
    user or \n   administrator preferences or its settings.  \n\t "

  content: "Traffic localization for peer-to-peer applications is currently\ndiscussed
    by the IETF ALTO working group.  The protocol specification\nitself is discussed
    and some issues about load reduction for ALTO/P4P\nservers are also discussed,
    but mainly on the transport level (i.e.,\ncaching of traffic localization data)
    and some data aggregation by\nusing macros that comprise a number of IP prefixes.
    \ However, there\nare no considerations about reducing the query load to the ALTO\nserver.
    \ This memo aims at giving informational guidance to P2P\napplications implementers
    on how reduce the query load for ALTO.\n\t "

  content: "   [RFC7854] and [RFC8671] define Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-In, Post-Policy\n
    \  Adj-RIB-In, Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-Out and Post-Policy Adj-RIB-Out Route-\n   Monitoring
    messages.  A route unmodified by the inbound policy is\n   included both in Pre-Policy
    Adj-RIB-In as well as Post-Policy Adj-\n   RIB-In Route-Monitoring messages when
    both the Pre-Policy and Post-\n   Policy Route-Monitoring modes are enabled.  Similarly,
    a route\n   unmodified by the outbound policy is included in Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-\n
    \  Out as well as Post-Policy Adj-RIB-Out Route-Monitoring messages.  To\n   avoid
    duplicate inclusion of routes unmodified by policy either in\n   Adj-RIB-In or
    Adj-RIB-Out this document defines two methods.\n\n\t "

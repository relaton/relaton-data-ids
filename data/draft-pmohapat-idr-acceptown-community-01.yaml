  content: "It may be useful for a BGP speaker in an autonomous system to receive\n
    \  and accept its own advertised route from a route reflector with more\n   fine-grained
    route control. For example, the route reflector can\n   change certain attributes
    of a route as desired, and then re-\n   advertise it back to the originator. Though
    it is possible to perform\n   such policy control directly at the originator,
    it may be\n   operationally cumbersome in a network with a large number of border\n
    \  routers having complex BGP policies.\n\n   This draft defines a new and well-known
    BGP community value,\n   ACCEPT_OWN, that signals a BGP speaker to accept an UPDATE
    message\n   and process the associated routes even when the ORIGINATOR_ID or the\n
    \  NEXT_HOP matches that of the receiving speaker.\n\t "

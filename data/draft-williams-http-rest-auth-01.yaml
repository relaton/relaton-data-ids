abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a \"RESTful\" pattern of authentication for\n
    \  HTTP/1.0, 1.1, and 2.0.  The existing 401 status code and WWW-\n   Authenticate
    header are used to indicate that authentication is\n   required and for negotiation
    purposes.  The client POSTs an initial\n   authentication message to an indicated
    login URI, and reply messages\n   are returned as new representations of a session
    resource named by a\n   session URI.\n\n   This approach has a number of benefits:
    it can be implemented with or\n   without help from the HTTP stack, it can be
    universally implemented\n   on the server side using the Common Information Gateway
    (CGI) and\n   FastCGI, it results in a session Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n
    \  that can be DELETEd to logout, it is completely orthogonal to any\n   HTTP
    \"routers\" and proxies, and it naturally (i.e., without changing\n   HTTP) handles
    multi-legged authentication mechanisms.\n\n   Among other features supported are:
    channel binding, an optional\n   round trip optimization for challenge/response
    mechanisms, some\n   cryptographic protection options for clients that don't use
    Transport\n   Layer Security (TLS), stronger authentication of servers/services
    to\n   users (where authentication mechanisms provide that) and more.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document examines the scenarios within which SIP phones may be \nused
    to contact emergency call centres.  Beginning with an overview \nof the high level
    system requirements for contacting emergency call \ncentres in the PSTN, the scenarios
    involving stationary or nomadic \nSIP phones are described and then alternative
    strategies for \nsupporting the information flows for the scenarios needed to
    meet \nthese requirements are examined.  The major finding from the point \nof
    view of SIP standardization is it would be helpful in a number of \nscenarios
    if a location header field could be added either by the \nSIP phone or by a proxy
    to indicate the location of the phone in a \nmachine-readable way.\n\t "

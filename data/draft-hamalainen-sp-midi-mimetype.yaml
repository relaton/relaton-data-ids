    industry (AMEI) have recently produced the Scalable \n   Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI)
    standard [1]. The SP-MIDI standard has been \n   developed in particularly for
    mobile MIDI applications. SP-MIDI has \n   been approved for 3GPP standardization
    and a dedicated SP-MIDI \n   profile has been defined for 3GPP SP-MIDI devices
    [2]. Since MIDI \n   information is a very compact media type 3GPP is initially
    focusing \n   on the application of SP-MIDI for music downloading and messaging
    \n   applications that require MIME registration. \n\t "

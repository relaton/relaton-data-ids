  content: "   This draft describes the minimal mechanisms required to support\n   secure
    initial configuration in a device being added to a 6TiSCH\n   network.  The goal
    of this configuration is to set link-layer keys,\n   and to establish a secure
    session between each joining node and the\n   JCE who may use that to further
    configure the joining device.\n   Additional security behaviors and mechanisms
    may be added on top of\n   this minimal framework.\n\n\n\t "

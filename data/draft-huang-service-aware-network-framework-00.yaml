  content: "   Cloud has been migrating from concentrated center sites to edge nodes\n
    \  with responsive and agile services to the subscribers.  This\n   industry-wide
    trend would be reasonably expected to continue into the\n   future which would
    enjoy geographically ubiquitous services.  Rather\n   than transmitting service
    data streams to the stable and limited\n   service locations such as centered
    cloud sites, routing and\n   forwarding network will have to adapt to the emerging
    scenarios where\n   the service instances would be highly dynamic and distributed,
    and\n   further more, demand more fine-grained networking policies than the\n
    \  current routing and forwarding scheme unaware of service SLA\n   requirements.
    \ This proposal is to demonstrate a framework under\n   which the above-mentioned
    requirements would be satisfied.\n\n\t "

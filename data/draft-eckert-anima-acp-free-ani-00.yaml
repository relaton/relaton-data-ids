  content: "   This document describes how to to build the software infrastructure\n
    \  for distributed automation agents using a lightweight variation of\n   the
    \"Autonomic Networking Infrastructure\" (ANI), by using the\n   existing ANI domain
    keying material (certificates and trust anchors)\n   as well as the protocols
    GRASP and BRSKI protocols, but eliminating\n   the expensive to implement \"Autonomic
    Control Plane\" (ACP) and adding\n   proxying \"Autonomic Software Agents\" (ASA)
    instead.\n\n   The resulting infrastructure is called \"automation Network\n   Infrastructure\"
    and can be implemented solely as application level\n   software components on
    routers, switches or co-located managemenet\n   devices, avoiding the need to
    change any router or switches\n   forwarding or control-plane protocols.\n\n   The
    aNI achieves mosts of the benefits of the ANI but foregoes the\n   ability to
    easily make pre-existing, insecure control-plane protocols\n   secure or provide
    all the same protection against operator or SDN\n   controller misconfigurations
    that the ACP provides.\n\n\t "

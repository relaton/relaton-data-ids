  content: "This document describes a reference architecture that may be used to \ntightly
    integrate CE-CE [IPSec] encryption with the any-to-any \nconnectivity model of
    [RFC2547]. Using this mechanism, a Service \nProvider is able to provide an IP
    VPN service with data encryption \nbetween customer edge routers, but without
    the need of direct routing \nprotocol exchange, or IP-based tunnels such as provided
    by [GRE]. \n    \n\t "

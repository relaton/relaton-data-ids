  content: "This draft defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history \ninformation
    associated with a SIP request.  This capability enables \nmany enhanced services
    by providing the information as to how and \nwhy a call arrives at a specific
    application or user.  This draft \ndefines a new optional SIP header, History-Info,
    for capturing the \nhistory information in requests. A new option tag, HistInfo,
    to be \nincluded in the Supported header is defined to allow UAs to \nindicate
    whether the HistInfo should be returned in responses to a \nrequest which has
    captured the history information.  \n\t "

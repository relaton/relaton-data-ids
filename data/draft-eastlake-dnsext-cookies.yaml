  content: "   DNS cookies are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism that\n
    \  provides limited protection to DNS servers and clients against a\n   variety
    of increasingly common denial-of-service and amplification /\n   forgery or cache
    poisoning attacks by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies\n   are tolerant of NAT,
    NAT-PT, and anycast and can be incrementally\n   deployed.\n\n\n\t "

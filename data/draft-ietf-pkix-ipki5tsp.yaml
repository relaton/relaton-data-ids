  content: "This document describes the format of the data returned by a Time\nStamp
    Authority and the protocols to be used when communicating with it.\nThe time stamping
    service can be used as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) as\none component in building
    reliable non-repudiation services (see\n[ISONR]).  We also give an example of
    how to place a signature at a\nparticular point in time, from which the appropriate
    CRLs may be\nchecked.\n\t "

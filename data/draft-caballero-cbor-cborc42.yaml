  content: "   This document defines a strict profile of CBOR Core (CBOR/c) intended\n
    \  for use with the special tag 42.  Like the CBOR Core it profiles,\n   \"CBOR/c-42\"
    can also be used as an internet-scale serialization for\n   JSON, and is optimized
    for objects that compose into a directed\n   acyclical graph.  Since CBOR/c-42
    objects link to one another by\n   hash-based identifiers, deterministic encoding
    is mandated to verify\n   dereferenced links and encode new ones.\n\n   This document
    mainly targets CBOR tool developers and those\n   downstream users who would like
    to precisely configure their tools.\n   While full support in CBOR tools would
    be ideal and is already\n   possible in some highly configurable parsing libraries,
    ALDRs can\n   help close the delta by sidestepping the biggest interoperability\n
    \  stumbling blocks; see Appendix C for details.\n\n\t "

  content: "   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different\n   Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and\n   technologies, various
    qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the\n   OAM acronym.  While, at first
    glance, the most used appear to be well\n   understood, the same qualifier may
    be interpreted differently in\n   different contexts.  A case in point is the
    qualifiers \"in-band\" and\n   \"out-of-band\" which have their origins in the
    radio lexicon and which\n   have been extrapolated into other communication networks.\n\n
    \  This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are\n   prepended
    to the OAM acronym, and lays out guidelines for their use\n   in future IETF work.\n\n
    \  This document updates RFC 6291 by adding to the guidelines for the\n   use
    of the term \"OAM\".\n\n\t "

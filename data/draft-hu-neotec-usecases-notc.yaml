  content: "   This document presents two network operations in telco cloud\n   orchestration
    use case for AI-based video recognition in smart city\n   management and dynamic
    high-bandwidth transport.  Key innovations\n   include dynamic resource scheduling
    across heterogeneous computing\n   (GPU/NPU) and network domains, centralized
    training with distributed\n   inference, and low-latency data transmission compliant
    with data\n   sovereignty requirements.  Additionally, the use case demonstrates\n
    \  elastic bandwidth provisioning and failover mechanisms to ensure\n   reliability.
    \ The framework highlights the need for standardized\n   interfaces between cloud
    and network controllers to optimize\n   performance, resource utilization, and
    QoS in telecom cloud\n   environments.\n\n\t "

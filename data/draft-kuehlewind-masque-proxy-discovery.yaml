  content: "   Often an intermediate instance (such as a proxy server) is used to\n
    \  connect to a web server or a communicating peer if a direct end-to-\n   end
    IP connectivity is not possible or the proxy can provide a\n   support service
    like, e.g., address anonymisation.  To use a non-\n   transparent proxy a client
    explicitly connects to it and requests\n   forwarding to the final target server.
    \ The MASQUE Connect-UDP Proxy\n   service is an example of such a proxy service.
    \ The client either\n   knows the proxy address as preconfigured in the application
    or can\n   dynamically learn about available proxy services.  This document\n
    \  describes different discovery mechanisms for non-transparent proxies\n   that
    are either located in the local network, e.g. home or enterprise\n   network,
    in the access network, or somewhere else on the Internet\n   usually close to
    the target server or even in the same network as the\n   target server.\n\n   This
    document assumes that the non-transparent proxy server is\n   connected via QUIC
    and discusses potential discovery mechanisms for\n   such a QUIC-based, non-transparent
    proxy.\n\n\t "

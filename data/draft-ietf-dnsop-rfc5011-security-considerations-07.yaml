  content: "   This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing\n   advice
    that must be followed in order to maintain security.\n   Specifically, this document
    describes the math behind the minimum\n   time-length that a DNS zone publisher
    must wait before signing\n   exclusively with recently added DNSKEYs.  It contains
    much math and\n   complicated equations, but the summary is that the key rollover
    /\n   revocation time is much longer than intuition would suggest.  If you\n   are
    not both publishing a DNSSEC trust anchor, and using RFC5011 to\n   update that
    trust anchor, you probably don't need to read this\n   document.\n\n   This document
    also describes the minimum time-length that a DNS zone\n   publisher must wait
    after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming\n   that all active RFC5011
    resolvers should have seen the revocation-\n   marked key and removed it from
    their list of trust anchors.\n\n\t "

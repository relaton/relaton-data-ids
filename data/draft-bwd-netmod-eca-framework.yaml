  content: "   Event-driven management is meant to provide a useful method to\n   monitor
    state change of managed objects and resources, and facilitate\n   automatic triggering
    of a response to events, based on an established\n   set of rules.  This would
    provide rapid autonomic responses to\n   specific conditions, enabling self-management
    behaviors, including:\n   self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization,
    and self-\n   protection.\n\n   This document provides a framework that describes
    the architecture\n   for supporting event-driven management of managed object
    state across\n   devices.  It does not describe specific protocols or protocol\n
    \  extensions needed to realize the objectives and capabilities\n   discussed
    in the document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document surveys the IP-based vehicular networks, which are\n
    \  considered a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems\n   (ITS).
    \ The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-\n   vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and infrastructure-\n   to-vehicle (I2V) networking.  This document deals
    with some critical\n   aspects in vehicular networking, such as IP address\n   autoconfiguration,
    vehicular network architecture, routing, and\n   mobility management.  This document
    summarizes and analyzes the\n   previous research activities that use IPv4 or
    IPv6 for vehicular\n   networking.\n\n\t "

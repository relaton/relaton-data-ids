  content: "     This note describes a key exchange method based on the ring-LWE\n
    \    (RLWE) assumption. It builds upon several results, including\n     Regev's
    landmark quantum reduction from certain worst case lattice\n     problems (approx.
    GapSVP and SIVP) to random instances of the\n     search variant of a particular
    learning problem (LWE). It also\n     builds on the follow on work of Lyubashevsky,
    Peikert and Regev on\n     the average case hardness of the RLWE search variant
    for\n     polynomially bounded numbers of RLWE samples, along with novel\n     applications
    of automorphism groups in number fields for a RLWE\n     search to decision reduction
    (thereby demonstrating\n     pseudorandomness of RLWE in these number fields).
    Subsequently,\n     these results were adopted for the construction of Diffie-Hellman\n
    \    like key exchange methods by Peikert, and then by Lindner and\n     Peikert
    followed by Ding and then by Ding, Xie and Lin who proposed\n     efficient variants
    of such protocols. Subsequent work by Peikert\n     proposed another efficient
    variant, phrased as a key encapsulation\n     method, incorporating a low bandwidth
    \"reconciliation\" technique\n     allowing two parties to exactly agree on a
    uniformly distributed\n     secret value from noisy RLWE instances. This was followed
    by a\n     concrete instantiation with parameter sets by Bos, Costello,\n     Naehrig,
    Stebila, followed by another instantiation by Alkim,\n     Ducas, Poppelmann and
    Schwabe with the same ring polynomial but a\n     smaller modulus and a different
    reconciliation method. Unlike most\n     other public key cryptography based key
    exchange methods, it is\n     believed that RLWE based key exchange would remain
    secure in the\n     event that an adversary is able to build a quantum computer.\n\n
    \    This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group\n     (CFRG).\n\n\n\t "

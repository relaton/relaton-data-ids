- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document presents an applicability statement to address the\n
    \  requirements for protection of ring topologies for Multi-Protocol\n   Label
    Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSP) on multiple
    layers.  The MPLS-TP Requirements document\n   specifies specific criteria for
    justification of dedicated protection\n   mechanism for particular topologies,
    including optimizing the number\n   of OAM entities needed, minimizing the number
    of labels for\n   protection paths, minimizing the number of recovery elements
    in the\n   network, and minimizing the number of control and management\n   transactions
    necessary.  The document proposes a methodology for ring\n   protection based
    on existing MPLS-TP survivability mechanisms,\n   specifically those defined in
    MPLS-TP Linear Protection, without the\n   need for specification of new constructs
    or protocols.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t "

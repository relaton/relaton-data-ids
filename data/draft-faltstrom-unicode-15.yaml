  content: "   This document describes the changes between Unicode 12.0.0 and\n   Unicode
    15.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008.  Some additions and\n   changes have been made
    in the Unicode Standard that affect the values\n   produced by the algorithm IDNA2008
    specifies.  The review assigns the\n   temporary status \"under review\" to certain
    code points.  This is\n   added as exceptions to the algorithm for IDNA2008 that
    allows adding\n   exceptions to the algorithm for backward compatibility exceptions.\n
    \  This document provides the necessary tables to IANA to make its\n   database
    consistent with Unicode 15.0.0.\n\n\t "

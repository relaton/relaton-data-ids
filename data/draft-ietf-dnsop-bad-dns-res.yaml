  content: "This memo describes DNS iterative resolver behavior that results in a
    significant query volume sent to the root and top-level domain (TLD) name servers.
    \ We offer implementation advice to iterative resolver developers to alleviate
    these unnecessary queries.  The recommendations made in this document are a direct
    byproduct of observation and analysis of abnormal query traffic patterns seen
    at two of the thirteen root name servers and all thirteen com/net TLD name servers.
    \ This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

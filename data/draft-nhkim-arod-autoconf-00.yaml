  content: "   Every node must configure its network interface with a unique address\n
    \  in order to communicate with other nodes.  Having a centralized DHCP\n   server
    that provides addresses to nodes, we can easily and\n   automatically obtain addresses.
    \ However, in a mobile ad hoc network,\n   difficulties exist in supporting address
    autoconfiguration due to the\n   lack of the centralized servers.  We therefore
    propose a distributed\n   address autoconfiguration approach for a mobile ad hoc
    network using\n   address reservation and optimistic Duplicated Address Detection.
    \ The\n   reserved address helps to reduce the allocation latency, and the\n   optimistic
    DAD guarantees the uniqueness of addresses with smaller\n   communication overhead.\n\t "

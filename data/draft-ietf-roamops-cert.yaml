  content: "To date, roaming implementations have been based on the concept of proxy\nchaining,
    where packets are routed between the NAS and home server\nthrough a series of
    proxies.  While commonly used, proxy chaining\nintroduces difficult security problems
    that have prevented its\nimplementation on a wide scale.\n\nThis document describes
    a new approach to roaming based on certificates\nthat eliminates the need for
    proxy chaining. As described, this approach\nprovides improved security as well
    as scalability.\n\t "

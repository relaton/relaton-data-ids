  content: "   The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is a protocol that allows a mobile node\n   (MN)
    to maintain connectivity with a correspondent node (CN) via\n   the Internet while
    changing its point of attachment. In MIPv6, a\n   MN cannot know which packet
    is the last packet with the previous\n   CoA (PCoA) as the destination address.
    In this draft, we define\n   the format and the usage of the Flush message, in
    order for the MN\n   to know the last packet with the PCoA as the destination
    address\n   sent by the home agent (HA) and/or a CN.\n\t "

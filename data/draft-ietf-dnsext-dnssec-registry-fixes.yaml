  content: "   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of\n   cryptographic
    algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over\n   DNS data.  There is
    currently an IANA registry for these algorithms\n   that is incomplete in that
    it lacks the implementation status of each\n   algorithm.  This document provides
    an applicability statement on\n   algorithm implementation compliance status for
    DNSSEC\n   implementations.  This status is to measure compliance to this RFC\n
    \  only.  This document replaces that registry table with a new IANA\n   registry
    table for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm\n   Numbers that lists
    (or assigns) each algorithm's status based on the\n   current reference.\n\n\t "

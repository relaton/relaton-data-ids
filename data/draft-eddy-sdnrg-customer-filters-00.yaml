  content: "   In order to reduce unwanted traffic and make efficient use of limited\n
    \  access link capacity or other network resources, it is advantageous\n   if
    customers can filter traffic destined to them, within their\n   upstream Internet
    Service Provider (ISP) networks.  The customer\n   receiving traffic should have
    control over inbound filters, since\n   their definition of desirable versus undesirable
    traffic may change\n   over time (e.g. as new network services and protocols are\n
    \  introduced).  In this document, we describe an SDN-based means for\n   customers
    to express computable logic to their ISPs in order to\n   distinguish between
    desirable and undesirable inbound traffic.  These\n   rules can be dynamically
    and securely updated within the running ISP\n   network, with full automation
    One use case for this is in mitigating\n   denial of service attacks.  Even if
    such filtering is only\n   implemented in an ISP's access network, it preserves
    capacity on the\n   customer access links for desirable traffic.  If implemented
    at the\n   ISP's edge connections to other providers, or prior to ingress to\n
    \  their core, it can also preserve the ISP's own network capacity and\n   other
    resources that may be threatened by attacks.\n\n\t "

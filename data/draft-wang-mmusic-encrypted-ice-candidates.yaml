  content: "   WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of\n
    \  creating peer-to-peer connections.  To maximize the probability of a\n   direct
    peer-to-peer connection, client private IP addresses can be\n   included in this
    candidate collection, but this has privacy\n   implications.  This document describes
    a way to share local IP\n   addresses with local peers without compromising client
    privacy.\n   During the ICE process, local IP addresses are encrypted and\n   authenticated
    using a pre-shared key and cipher suite before being\n   put into ICE candidates
    as hostnames with an \".encrypted\" pseudo-top-\n   level domain.  Other peers
    who also have the PSK are able to decrypt\n   these addresses and use them normally
    in ICE processing.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The term \"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Trunk\" has become almost\ncommonplace
    amongst vendors and SIP providers.  Even though the\nnotion of a 'trunk' has a
    well defined meaning in circuit switched\nsystems, it has never been defined for
    SIP.  This document provides a\nformal definition for a SIP trunk, discusses its
    scope and\napplications, and establishes best practices for identification and\nsecurity
    of SIP trunks.\n\t "

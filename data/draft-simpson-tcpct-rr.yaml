  content: "   TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) [RFC6013] deter spoofing of\n   connections
    and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder\n   (server) state during
    the initial handshake.  The Initiator (client)\n   has sole responsibility for
    ensuring required delays between\n   connections.  The cookie exchange may carry
    data, limited to inhibit\n   amplification and reflection denial of service attacks.\n\n
    \  This specification provides an optional rapid restart facility for\n   persistent
    connections.\n\n\t "

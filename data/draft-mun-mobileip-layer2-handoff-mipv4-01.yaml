  content: "Mobile-IPv4 describes how a Mobile Node can perform layer 3 handoff between
    subnets served by different Foreign Agents. Sometimes the delay during handoffs
    can exceed the threshold of delay sensitive applications. So low delay must be
    considered.\nThis document describes a method to perform  fast handoff on the
    Layer 2 for Mobile-IPv4 with 802.11's Access Point. Mobile-IPv4 Registration messages
    are carried in the Information Elements of 802.11 frames. According to this method,
    Mobile-IPv4 can perform handoff at the same time as 802.11 handoff.\nBut some
    modifications bust be adopted in the existing Mobile-IPv4 and\n802.11's entities
    such as Mobile Node and Access Point.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies two path computation methods for computing \ninter-domain
    Traffic Engineering (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching \n(MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched (LSP) paths. In this \ndocument a domain is referred
    to as a collection of network elements \nwithin a common sphere of address management
    or path computational \nresponsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems.
    \nThe first path computation method is also called per-domain path \ncomputation
    whereby each entry boundary LSR is responsible for \ncomputing the path to the
    next exit boundary LSR (where for instance a \nboundary LSR is either an ARB or
    an ASBR) whereas in the second method \na Path Computation Element (PCE)is used
    to compute an end to end \npartial or complete path across multiple domains.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "It will take a long time and mass computation to do session\nresumption
    among IKE/IPsec gateways possibly maintaining huge numbers\nof IKEv2/IPsec SAs,
    when the serving gateway fails or over-loaded.\nThe major reason is that the prcocedure
    of IKEv2 SA re-establishment\nwill incur a time-consuming computation especially
    in the Diffie-\nHellman exchange.  In this draft, a new IKE security associations\nsynchronization
    solution is proposed to do fast IKE SA session\nresumption by directly transferring
    the indexed IKE SA (named stub)\nfrom old gateway to new gateway, wherein the
    most expensive Diffie-\nHellman calculation can be avoided.  Without some time-consuming\nIKEv2
    exchanges, the huge amount of IKE/IPsec SA session resumption\nprocedures can
    be finished in a short time.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines the PCRP (Ping, Challenge, Resolve, Product)\n
    \  Specification for Webhook events in a standardized way.  It is\n   specifically
    designed to address the challenges faced in current\n   webhook event implementations,
    which lack consistency and a defined\n   flow.  PCRP introduces a new header X-PCRP-Type
    to indicate the step\n   of the process, and its values include ping, challenge,
    resolve, and\n   product.\n\n\t "

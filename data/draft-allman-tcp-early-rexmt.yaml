  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a new mechanism for TCP and SCTP that can be\n
    \   used to recover lost segments when a connection's congestion window\n    is
    small.  The \"Early Retransmit\" mechanism allows the transport to\n    reduce,
    in certain special circumstances, the number of duplicate\n    acknowledgments
    required to trigger a fast retransmission.  This\n    allows the transport to
    use fast retransmit to recover packet losses\n    that would otherwise require
    a lengthy retransmission timeout.\n\t "

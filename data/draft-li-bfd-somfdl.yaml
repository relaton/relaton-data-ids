  content: "   This document describes a Service-Oriented Mechanism for Fault\n   Detection
    and Localization (SOMFDL). This mechanism brings up the\n   concepts of \"Chord
    supplementary\" and \"QoS Trigger\". By monitoring\n   the real-time QoS level
    of the forward path, network can launch the\n   mechanism when the QoS level cannot
    satisfy the requirement of\n   service transmission, so that fault detection and
    localization can be\n   realized. By designing related protocols, the manipuility
    of this\n   mechanism can be guaranteed. Utilizing this mechanism, network can\n
    \  accomplish fault detection and localization in a time scale of\n   milliseconds
    with a few datagram sent.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) includes the facility to\n   provision
    point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs)
    which can be used to construct P2MP tunnels\n   across MPLS networks.\n\n   The
    Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) has also been extended to\n   support label
    distribution for multicast traffic by forming multicast\n   LSPs.\n\n   When traffic
    for a user network is carried across a provider network,\n   it is common practice
    for the traffic to be placed in tunnels. This\n   document examines the requirements
    to carry multicast LDP traffic\n   across a provider network within P2MP MPLS
    tunnels, and introduces\n   solution models that meet those requirements.\n\n
    \  Note that the requirements and solutions discussed in this document\n   are
    also applicable to the use of multicast LDP on multi-access\n   networks.\n\t "

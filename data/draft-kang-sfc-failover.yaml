  content: "   In SFC-enabled domain, failures can occur at Service Function(SF).\n
    \  If the failed node is on the path where a packet is delivered, packet\n   cannot
    be sent to destination and such situation should be avoided.\n   Currently, there
    are many ways to provide redundancy of SFs, such as\n   VRRP.  However, legacy
    redundancy method may not be used in SFC as\n   Service Function Forwarders(SFFs)
    do not use IP or MAC address in\n   their FIBs.  In SFC, traffic is steered based
    on Service Function\n   Path ID and Service Index.  Therefore controller, which
    is\n   responsible for a control plane function in SFC, can manage path of\n   SFC.
    \ In this document, we illustrate failover method specifically\n   for SFC which
    uses SFC encapsulation.  We describe bypass mechanism\n   to avoid failures in
    SFs and redirect traffic to backup SFs.  For\n   bypass mechanism, we propose
    SF classification of 1)mandatory SFs\n   that function indispensible for packet
    delivery, such as NAT and\n   2)optional SFs that a packet can be delivered without
    them, such as\n   Firewall and IDS.\n\n\t "

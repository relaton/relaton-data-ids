abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a mechanism for hosts with any network\n connectivity
    (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6 \nconnectivity) to run applications of
    any capability \n(IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6) without any \nmodification
    to those applications. It is a generalisation \nof a previous experimental protocol
    called \"Bump-in-the-API\"\n(BIA) [RFC3338]. New mechanism of BIA allows a changeover
    between\nthe application layer and the IP communication layers from IPv4 \nto
    IPv6 and vice versa or IPv6 to IPv4 and vice versa, without \nrequiring those
    applications to be converted in addressing \ncapabilities, effectively shielding
    the application layer from\nIPv4 or IPv6 connectivity. This is considered by the
    authors to\nbe one of the essential conditions for the transition to IPv6\nin
    the Internet to be successful.\n\t "

  content: "   Current source address validation (SAV) on AS's provider interfaces\n
    \  primarily relies on loose uRPF, which can protect against IP spoofing\n   based
    on unannounced internet prefixes but lacks the ability to\n   defend against spoofing
    based on valid internet prefixes.\n   Furthermore, if a default route is present,
    this protection is\n   effectively nullified.\n\n   Based on the traffic flow
    characteristics between the ASes in a\n   customer cone, this document describes
    a general solution\n   architecture -- provider interface SAV for customer cone
    source\n   spoofing (PI-SAV for CC).  This mechanism can be applied on the\n   provider
    interfaces of an AS to prevent spoofing traffic with the\n   customer cone source
    addresses from flowing into the local AS and its\n   customer cone.  Specially,
    this mechanism offers protection against\n   reflective amplification DDoS attacks
    that leverage local servers to\n   target victims within the customer cone.\n\n\t "

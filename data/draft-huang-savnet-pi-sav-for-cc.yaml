abstract:
- content: "<p>Current source address validation (SAV) on AS's provider interfaces
    primarily relies on loose uRPF, which can protect against IP spoofing based on
    unannounced internet prefixes but lacks the ability to defend against spoofing
    based on valid internet prefixes. Furthermore, if a default route exists, this
    protection mechanism becomes ineffective. Based on the traffic flow characteristics
    between the ASes in a customer cone, this document describes a general solution
    architecture -- provider interface SAV for customer cone source spoofing (PI-SAV
    for CC). This mechanism can be applied on the provider interfaces of an AS to
    prevent spoofing traffic with the customer cone source addresses from flowing
    into the local AS and its customer cone. Specially, this mechanism offers protection
    against reflective amplification DDoS attacks that leverage local servers to target
    victims within the customer cone.</p>"

  content: "   In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover\n
    \  the actual number of machines on the subnet.  In contrast, the\n   default
    IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers\n   trillions of addresses,
    the overwhelming number of which will be\n   unassigned.  Consequently, simplistic
    implementations of Neighbor\n   Discovery can be vulnerable to denial of service
    attacks whereby they\n   attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers
    of unassigned\n   addresses.  Such denial of attacks can be launched intentionally
    (by\n   an attacker), or result from legitimate operational tools that scan\n
    \  networks for inventory and other purposes.  As a result of these\n   vulnerabilities,
    new devices may not be able to \"join\" a network, it\n   may be impossible to
    establish new IPv6 flows, and existing ipv6\n   transported flows may be interrupted.\n\n
    \  This document describes possible modifications to the traditional\n   [RFC4861]
    neighbor discovery protocol for improving the resilience of\n   the neighbor discovery
    process as well as an alternative method for\n   maintaining ND caches.\n\n\t "

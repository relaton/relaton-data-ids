  content: "   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for\n
    \  BGP, termed \"One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter\", which\n   would
    allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh\n   request with a
    set of address-prefix-based filters to make the peer\n   send only the specific
    routes matching the filters to the speaker.\n   This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker
    to re-advertise some specific\n   routes without the need of advertising the whole
    Adj-RIB-Out of a\n   specific address family, which makes the route recovery and
    trouble\n   shooting operation more efficient and also reduces the impact on\n
    \  network stability.  This filter does not change the outbound route\n   filters
    or policies on the BGP peer and should only be used for one-\n   time route filtering.\n\n\n\t "

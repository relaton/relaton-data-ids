  content: "   There are real-time applications requiring deterministic services in\n
    \  terms of bandwidth and latency in various industries, such as network\n   based
    AR/VR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality), industrial\n   internet.  This
    document proposes a solution which enhances DiffServ\n   in IPv6 to provide end
    to end bandwidth guaranteed service and\n   latency guaranteed service.\n\n\t "

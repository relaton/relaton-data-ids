  content: "   This document provides deployment considerations for Carrier-Grade-\n
    \  NAT (CGN).  Due to emerging new web technologies such as Websocket,\n   SPDY
    and HTTP2.0, the trend of the Internet traffic has been\n   changing.  The number
    of sessions of commonly-used applications were\n   investigated to estimate the
    efficiency of IPv4 address sharing of\n   CGN.  Based on the result of the average
    number of sessions of\n   subscribers, the verification of CGN was conducted in
    the large scale\n   network experiment environment with one million emulated subscribers.\n
    \  It revealed that CGN can be used in more centralized location of a\n   provider's
    network and it arose many considerations.\n\n\t "

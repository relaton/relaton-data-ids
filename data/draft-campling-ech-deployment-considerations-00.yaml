  content: "   This document is intended to inform the development of the proposed\n
    \  Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) standard that encrypts Server Name\n   Indication
    (SNI) and other data.  Data encapsulated by ECH (ie data\n   included in the encrypted
    ClientHelloInner) is of legitimate interest\n   to on-path security actors including
    anti-virus software, parental\n   controls and consumer and enterprise firewalls.\n\n
    \  The document includes observations on current use cases for SNI data\n   in
    a variety of contexts.  It highlights how the use of that data is\n   important
    to the operators of private networks and shows how the loss\n   of access to SNI
    data will cause difficulties in the provision of a\n   range of services to many
    millions of end-users.\n\n\t "

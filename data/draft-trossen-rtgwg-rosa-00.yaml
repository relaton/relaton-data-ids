- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a novel communication approach which reasons\n
    \  about WHAT is being communicated (and invoked) instead of WHO is\n   communicating.
    \ Such approach is meant to transition away from\n   locator-based addressing
    (and thus routing and forwarding) to an\n   addressing scheme where the address
    semantics relate to services\n   being invoked (e.g., for computational processes,
    and their generated\n   information requests and responses).\n\n   The document
    introduces Routing on Service Addresses (ROSA), as a\n   realization of what is
    referred to as 'service-based routing' (SBR).\n   Such routing is designed to
    be constrained by service-specific\n   parameters that go beyond load and latency,
    as in today's best effort\n   or traffic engineering based routing, leading to
    an approach to steer\n   traffic in a service-specific constraint-based manner.\n\n
    \  Particularly, this document outlines sample ROSA use case scenarios,\n   requirements
    for its design, and the ROSA system design itself.\n\n\t "

  content: "   On a multi-access network such as an Ethernet, one of the PIM routers\n
    \  is elected as a Designated Routers (DR).  The PIM DR has two roles in\n   the
    PIM protocol.  On the first hop network, the PIM DR is\n   responsible for registering
    an active source to the RP if the group\n   is operated in PIM SM.  On the last
    hop network, the PIM DR is\n   responsible for tracking local multicast listeners
    and forwarding\n   traffic to these listeners if the group is operated in PIM
    SM/SSM/DM.\n   In this document, we propose a modification to the PIM protocol
    that\n   allows multiple of these last hop routers to be selected so that the\n
    \  forwarding load can be distributed to and handled among these\n   routers.
    \ A router responsible for forwarding for a particular group\n   is called a Group
    Designated Router (GDR).\n\n\t "

  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) is now a popular forwarding paradigm for use in\n
    \  MPLS and IPv6 networks.  It is typically deployed in discrete domains\n   that
    may be data centers, access networks, or other networks that are\n   under the
    control of a single operator and that can easily be\n   upgraded to support this
    new technology.\n\n   Traffic originating in one SR domain often terminates in
    another SR\n   domain, but must transit a backbone network that provides\n   interconnection
    between those domains.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism for providing
    connectivity\n   between SR domains to enable end-to-end or domain-to-domain traffic\n
    \  engineering.\n\n   The approach described: allows connectivity between SR domains,\n
    \  utilizes traffic engineering mechanisms (RSVP-TE or Segment Routing)\n   across
    the backbone network, makes heavy use of pre-existing\n   technologies requiring
    the specifications of very few additional\n   mechanisms.\n\n   This document
    some background and a problem statement, explains the\n   solution mechanism,
    and provides examples.  It does not define any\n   new protocol mechanisms.\n\n\t "

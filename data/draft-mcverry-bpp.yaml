  content: "   This document defines the Bitcoin Price Protocol (BPP), a\n   lightweight,
    peer-to-peer protocol for synchronising a\n   high-confidence Bitcoin price across
    untrusted networks.  Modeled\n   after the Network Time Protocol (NTP, RFC 5905),
    BPP enables any\n   Internet host to obtain a volume-weighted median USD/BTC price
    that\n   is accurate to within a few dollars and fresh to within a few\n   seconds,
    without trusting any single exchange, oracle, or API\n   provider.\n\n   BPP is
    deliberately off-chain, runs over UDP/QUIC, and requires no\n   blockchain interaction.
    \ It is suitable for wallets, trading bots,\n   payment processors, DeFi front-ends,
    and hardware devices that need\n   \"NTP-grade\" price agreement.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an UDP-based notification mechanism to\n   collect
    data from networking devices.  A shim header is proposed to\n   facilitate the
    streaming of data directly from line cards to a\n   collector.  The objective
    is to rely on a lightweight approach to\n   allow for higher frequency and better
    transit performance compared to\n   already established notification mechanisms.\n\n\n\t "

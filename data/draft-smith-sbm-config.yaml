  content: "This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP and SBM\nimplementations.
    \ These are in addition to those already described in\nRFC 2206 and RFC 2213.
    Specifically, it describes parameters for control\nof the base signaling protocols
    themselves, as well as a basic set of\nparameters for control of policy decisions
    by a Local Policy Module.\nThese are not intended to be exhaustive lists but they
    have been\nidentified as useful for practical implementations.\n\n\t "

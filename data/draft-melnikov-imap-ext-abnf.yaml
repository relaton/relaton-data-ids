  content: "Over the years, many documents from IMAPEXT and LEMONADE working groups,
    as well as many individual documents, have added syntactic extensions to many
    base IMAP commands described in RFC 3501. For ease of reference, this document
    collects most of such ABNF changes in one place.\n\n This document also suggests
    a set of standard patterns for adding options and extensions to several existing
    IMAP commands defined in RFC 3501. The patterns provide for compatibility between
    existing and future extensions.\n\n This document updates ABNF in RFCs 2088, 2342,
    3501, 3502, and 3516. It also includes part of the errata to RFC 3501. This document
    doesn't specify any semantic changes to the listed RFCs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

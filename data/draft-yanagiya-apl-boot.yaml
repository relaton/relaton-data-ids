  content: "    In [ID-yanagiya-eap-saa-00], [ID-ohba-mip6-boot-arch-dhcp-01], and
    \n    [ID-yegin-eap-boot-rfc3118-01], it is assumed that a peer and \n    service
    authenticator execute the authentication or authorization \n    process with a
    key derived from EAP Keying materials. However, \n    [EAP-Key-04] does not assume
    that a network element that does not \n    support EAP, such as a DHCP server
    or Mobile IP home agent, uses \n    the EAP key to authenticate/authorize the
    user. Thus, it is   \n    necessary to define a new security association and key
    for the \n    application authenticator. \n\t "

  content: "   Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is\n   deployed
    in providers' backbone networks. As providers plan to grow\n   these networks,
    they need to discover whether existing protocols and\n   implementations can support
    the network sizes that they are planning.\n\n   This document presents an analysis
    of some of the scaling concerns\n   for MPLS-TE backbone networks, and examines
    the value of two\n   techniques for improving scaling. The intention is to motivate
    the\n   development of appropriate deployment techniques and protocol\n   extensions
    to enable the application of MPLS-TE in large networks.\n\n   This document considers
    only scalability for point-to-point MPLS-TE.\n   Point-to-multipoint MPLS-TE is
    for future study.\n\n\t "

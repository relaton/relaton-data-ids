  content: "For content delivery services that rely upon the IP multicast\ntransmission
    scheme, the distribution trees are receiver initiated.\nThe delivery of such services
    over MPLS networking infrastructures\nmay rely upon P2MP LSP tree structures that
    are sender initiated,\nwith the root of the P2MP tree being at the LSR router
    directly\nconnected to the sender.  This document describes a mechanism that\naims
    at establishing MPLS P2MP tree structures that are receiver\ninitiated.  This
    mechanism builds on the works of Point-to-MultiPoint\nTraffic Engineered Lable
    Swithched Paths (P2MP-TE LSPs).  This\nmechanism can also be used to establish
    receiver driven BiDirectional\nP2MP TE LSPs.\n\t "

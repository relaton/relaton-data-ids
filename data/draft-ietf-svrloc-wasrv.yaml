  content: "We propose extensions to the Service Location Protocol (SLP), which\n
    \  allow for registration and discovery of services scattered across the\n   wide
    area network. We make use of scalable wide area multicast to\n   allow agents
    within an administrative domain to learn about services\n   within other domains.
    We also describe a new agent, the Brokering\n   Agent (BA), which is responsible
    for providing information about a\n   particular set of services types.\n\t "

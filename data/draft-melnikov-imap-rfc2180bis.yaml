  content: "IMAP4[IMAP4] is rich client/server protocol that allows a client to\n
    \  access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  Within\n   the
    protocol framework, it is possible to have differing results for\n   particular
    client/server interactions. If a protocol does not allow\n   for this, it is often
    unduly restrictive.\n\t "

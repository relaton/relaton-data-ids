  script: Latn
  content: "This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network service
    called Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable throughput (L4S). L4S uses an Explicit
    Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP layer that is similar to the original
    (or 'Classic') ECN approach, except as specified within. L4S uses 'Scalable' congestion
    control, which induces much more frequent control signals from the network, and
    it responds to them with much more fine-grained adjustments so that very low (typically
    sub-millisecond on average) and consistently low queuing delay becomes possible
    for L4S traffic without compromising link utilization. Thus, even capacity-seeking
    (TCP-like) traffic can have high bandwidth and very low delay at the same time,
    even during periods of high traffic load.\n\n The L4S identifier defined in this
    document distinguishes L4S from 'Classic' (e.g., TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic. Then,
    network bottlenecks can be incrementally modified to distinguish and isolate existing
    traffic that still follows the Classic behaviour, to prevent it from degrading
    the low queuing delay and low loss of L4S traffic. This Experimental specification
    defines the rules that L4S transports and network elements need to follow, with
    the intention that L4S flows neither harm each other's performance nor that of
    Classic traffic. It also suggests open questions to be investigated during experimentation.
    Examples of new Active Queue Management (AQM) marking algorithms and new transports
    (whether TCP-like or real time) are specified separately.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   BCP18 (RFC 2277) has been the basis for the handling of character-\n
    \  shaped data in IETF specifications for more than a quarter of a\n   century
    now.  It singles out UTF-8 (STD63, RFC 3629) as the \"charset\"\n   that MUST
    be supported, and pulls in the Unicode standard with that.\n\n   Based on this,
    RFC 5198 both defines common conventions for the use\n   of Unicode in network
    protocols and caters for the specific\n   requirements of the legacy protocol
    Telnet.  In applications that do\n   not need Telnet compatibility, some of the
    decisions of RFC 5198 can\n   be cumbersome.\n\n   The present specification defines
    \"Modern Network Unicode\" (MNU),\n   which is a form of RFC 5198 Network Unicode
    that can be used in\n   specifications that require the exchange of plain text
    over networks\n   and where just mandating UTF-8 may not be sufficient, but there
    is\n   also no desire to import all of the baggage of RFC 5198.\n\n   As characters
    are used in different environments, MNU is defined in a\n   one-dimensional (1D)
    variant that is useful for identifiers and\n   labels, but does not use a structure
    of text lines.  A 2D variant is\n   defined for text that is a sequence of text
    lines, such as plain text\n   documents or markdown format.  Additional variances
    of these two base\n   formats can be used to tailor MNU to specific areas of application.\n\n\t "

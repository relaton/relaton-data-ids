  content: "   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for the global\n
    \  (or local) DNS names of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as\n   sensors,
    actuators, and in-vehicle units.  By this scheme, the DNS\n   name of an IoT device
    can be autoconfigured with the device's model\n   information in wired and wireless
    target networks (e.g., vehicle,\n   road network, home, office, shopping mall,
    and smart grid).  This DNS\n   name lets IoT users (e.g., drivers, passengers,
    home residents, and\n   customers) in the Internet (or local network) easily identify
    each\n   device for monitoring and remote-controlling it in the target\n   network.\n\n\t "

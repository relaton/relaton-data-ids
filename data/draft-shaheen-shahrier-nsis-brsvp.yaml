  content: "With the current evolution toward wireless data, wireless internet, and
    \nwireless multimedia applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP), video \nconferencing,
    and Video telephony, similar performance requirements to \nthose of existing circuit
    switched or voice based wireless systems are \nessential to the success of this
    evolution.  Among these performance \nrequirements are the call setup time, delay,
    reliability, and Quality of \nService (QoS).  To ensure QoS, provide faster call
    setup time, and \nreduce the number of RSVP messaging across the network; this
    note \nintroduces the concept and describes the use of bi-directional RSVP (B-\nRSVP)
    \ resource  reservation  protocol  with  both  Controlled-Load  and \nGuaranteed
    QoS control services.  While RSVP allows for uni-directional \nresource reservations
    only in the 'send' direction, B-RSVP protocol \ngeneralizes the process by allowing
    simultaneous bi-directional (send \nand receive) resource reservations on each
    hop.  B-RSVP also allows for \na reverse route (receive only) uni-directional
    resource reservation.  B-\nRSVP is most suitable for applications in which the
    originator of a \nservice is solely responsible for making the necessary reservations
    and \ntheir cost.  This note defines several data objects that carry resource
    \nreservation information required for both send and receive traffic.  The \nproposed
    message formats are extensions to existing RSVP messages and \ntotally backward
    compatible.  The usage and data format of those objects \nare described herein.

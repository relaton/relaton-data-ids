  content: "   TLS 1.2 is in widespread use and can be configured such that it\n   provides
    good security properties.  TLS 1.3 is also in widespread use\n   and fixes some
    known deficiencies with TLS 1.2, such as removing\n   error-prone cryptographic
    primitives and encrypting more of the\n   traffic so that it is not readable by
    outsiders.\n\n   Since TLS 1.3 use is widespread, new protocols must require and\n
    \  assume its existence.  This prescription does not pertain to DTLS (in\n   any
    DTLS version); it pertains to TLS only.\n\n\t "

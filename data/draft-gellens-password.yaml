  content: "A number of existing clients and servers currently support the\n'poppassd'
    protocol for changing passwords.  This protocol is\nextremely insecure, as it
    transmits the user name, current and new\npasswords in clear text.  It also has
    more round-trips than needed,\nand lacks an extension mechanism.  In addition,
    it is not possible\nto specify for which service(s) the password is to be changed.
    \ The\nprotocol also traditionally usurps port 106, which is actually\nassigned
    for a different purpose.\n\t "

  content: "The Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol specified in \n[1]
    is aimed to enable seamless IP layer handover by aiding seamless \nLayer 3 (L3)
    mobility management protocols like Fast Mobile IP (FMIP) \nby providing identity
    and capabilities information of the candidate \naccess routers (CARs) to the mobile
    node (MN) prior to the initiation \nof handover while the MN is still connected
    to its current AR. \n \n \n The specifications as laid down in [1], however, specifies
    a very \ngeneric mechanism of the CARD protocol effective only in specific \nnetwork
    architecture scenarios and it doesn't take into account the \nstringent requirements
    of a fast moving MN and real time \ncommunication sessions, especially when it
    comes to resolving \ncandidate access routers that my be adjacent geographically
    but not \ntopologically. \n\nThis draft addresses the expected shortcomings of
    the base CARD \nprotocol with respect to fast moving MNs and real time communication
    \nsessions by proposing extensions that is expected to improve and/or \nenhance
    the performance of the generic CARD protocol as specified in \n[1].\n\t "

  content: "Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) guides an application,\nespecially
    a Peer to Peer (P2P) application, to select hosts from\nits candidate set. ALTO
    is a promising technique for future network,\nas it is able to jointly optimize
    network resource utilization and\napplication performance. The ALTO protocol is
    Client-Server based.\nApplications work as ALTO clients to fetch PID information
    from the\nALTO server, but the ALTO server can't send the notification to ALTO\nclients,
    even if there is a major change to the networks. This draft\ndiscusses the requirements
    for server initialized notification, and\nproposes one mechanism to enable the
    ALTO server notification.\n\t "

  content: "The IESG has identified several security issues with the\ncurrent Mobile
    IPv6 specification [MIPv6]. A subsequent effort\n[MIPv6SecReq] details the security
    threats introduced by\nMIPv6. Two major issues are (1) how to obtain a security\nassociation
    between an arbitrary MN and CN such that the\nbinding update (BU) is secure, and,
    assuming such a mechanism\nis in place, (2) how to secure the individual BU messages.\nThis
    document is an assessment of the proposed solutions for\nproblem (1).\n\t "

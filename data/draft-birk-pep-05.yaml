  content: "   The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe a set of\n
    \  conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as\n   barriers
    to the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end-\n   to-end interpersonal
    messaging.  These include, but are not limited\n   to, key management, key discovery,
    and private key handling\n   (including peer-to-peer synchronization of private
    keys and other\n   user data across devices).  Human Rights-enabling principles
    like\n   Data Minimization, End-to-End and Interoperability are explicit\n   design
    goals.  For the goal of usable privacy, pEp introduces means\n   to verify communication
    between peers and proposes a trust-rating\n   system to denote secure types of
    communications and signal the\n   privacy level available on a per-user and per-message
    level.\n   Significantly, the pEp protocols build on already available security\n
    \  formats and message transports (e.g., PGP/MIME with email), and are\n   written
    with the intent to be interoperable with already widely-\n   deployed systems
    in order to ease adoption and implementation.  This\n   document outlines the
    general design choices and principles of pEp.\n\n\t "

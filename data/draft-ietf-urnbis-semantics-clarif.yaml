abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Experience has shown that identifiers associated with persistent\n
    \  names have properties and requirements that may be somewhat different\n   from
    identifiers associated with the locations of objects.  This is\n   especially
    true when such names are expected to be stable for a very\n   long time or when
    they identify large and complex entities.  In order\n   to allow Uniform Resource
    Names (URNs) to evolve to meet the needs of\n   the Library, Museum, Publisher,
    and Information Science communities\n   and other users, this specification separates
    URNs from the semantic\n   constraints that many people believe are part of the
    specification\n   for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in RFC 3986, updating
    that\n   document accordingly.  The syntax of URNs is still constrained to\n   that
    of RFC 3986, so generic URI parsers are unaffected by this\n   change.\n\n\t "

    Acknowledgements for Loss Recovery Initiation

  content: "This document describes a TCP sender algorithm to trigger loss\n recovery
    based on the information gathered on a SACK scoreboard\n instead of simply counting
    the number of arriving duplicate\n acknowledgements in the traditional way. The
    given algorithm is more\n robust to ACK losses, ACK reordering, missed duplicate\n
    acknowledgements due to delayed acknowledgements, and extra\n duplicate acknowledgements
    due to duplicated segments and out-of-\n window segments. The algorithm allows
    not only a timely initiation\n of TCP loss recovery but also reduces false fast
    retransmits.  It\n has a low implementation cost on top of the SACK scoreboard
    defined\n in RFC 3517.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes extensions for IGP to order to advertise the\n
    \  aggregate header limit of a node or a link on a node to for efficient\n   packet
    processing.  Aggregate header limit is the total header\n   size(e.g, in IPv6,
    it includes the IPv6 header chain as well as any\n   headers that are part of
    network encapsulation that precedes the\n   innermost transport layer) that a
    router is able to process at full\n   forwarding rate, for some devices, this
    limit is related with its\n   buffer size and buffer design.\n\n\t "

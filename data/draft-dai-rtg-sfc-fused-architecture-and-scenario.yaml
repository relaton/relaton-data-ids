  content: "   This document discusses the architecture and application scenarios\n
    \  of fused service function chain. Fused service function chain means\n   that
    two or more service function chains are fused to become a single\n   service function
    chain from the view of data plane, control plane and\n   management plane.\n   Fused
    service function chain is an expansion for general service\n   function chain.Anyhow,
    some mechanism or methods need to be used when\n   two or more service function
    chains are fused to be a single service\n   function chain based on architecture
    described in this memo.\n\n\t "

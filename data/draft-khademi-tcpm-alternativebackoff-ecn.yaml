  content: "   This memo updates the TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion\n   notification
    received via Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).\n   The updated method reduces
    FlightSize in Congestion Avoidance by a\n   smaller amount than the TCP reaction
    to loss.  The intention is to\n   achieve good throughput when the queue at the
    bottleneck is smaller\n   than the bandwidth-delay-product of the connection.
    \ This is more\n   likely when an Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism has
    used ECN\n   to CE-mark a packet, than when a packet was lost.  Future versions
    of\n   this document will also describe a corresponding method for SCTP.\n\n\t "

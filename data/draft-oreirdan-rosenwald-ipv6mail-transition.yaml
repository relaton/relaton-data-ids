  content: "   This document contains a phased plan for how providers of email\n   services
    can effect and manage the transition of email services from\n   IPv4 to IPv6.
    \ It is expected that this will be effected over a\n   period of years and it
    is unlikely that any transition will\n   completely exclude the ongoing possibility
    of using IPv4 as a\n   transport mechanism for email.  This provides one possible\n
    \  implementation plan for transitioning email services on the Internet\n   from
    a predominantly IPv4-based connectivity model that suports IPv6.\n\n\t "

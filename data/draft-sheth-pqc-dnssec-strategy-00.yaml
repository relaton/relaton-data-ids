abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a post-quantum cryptography (PQC) strategy for
    Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) that includes two types of algorithms: one
    or more conservatively designed algorithms that are unlikely ever to need to be
    replaced, and one or more low-impact drop-in algorithms that are used the same
    way as a traditional signature algorithm. The conservatively designed algorithms
    can be used in a mode of operation that mitigates the operational impact of a
    large signature size. The combination provides both the routine performance of
    the low-impact algorithm and a resilient fallback to the conservatively designed
    choice. The draft outlines the strategy, provides recommendations for future testing
    and deployment, and highlights operational considerations in adopting PQC for
    DNSSEC.</p>"

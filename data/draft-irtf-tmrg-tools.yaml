  content: "This document describes tools for the evaluation of simulation and\n testbed
    scenarios used in research on Internet congestion control\n mechanisms.  We believe
    that research in congestion control\n mechanisms has been seriously hampered by
    the lack of good models\n underpinning analysis, simulation, and testbed experiments,
    and that\n tools for the evaluation of simulation and testbed scenarios can\n
    help in the construction of better scenarios, based on better\n underlying models.
    \ One use of the tools described in this document\n is in comparing key characteristics
    of test scenarios with known\n characteristics from the diverse and ever-changing
    real world.\n Tools characterizing the aggregate traffic on a link include the\n
    distribution of per-packet round-trip times, the distribution of\n connection
    sizes, and the like.  Tools characterizing end-to-end\n paths include drop rates
    as a function of packet size and of burst\n size, the synchronization ratio between
    two end-to-end TCP flows,\n and the like.  For each characteristic, we describe
    what aspects of\n the scenario determine this characteristic, how the characteristic\n
    can affect the results of simulations and experiments for the\n evaluation of
    congestion control mechanisms, and what is known about\n this characteristic in
    the real world.  We also explain why the use\n of such tools can add considerable
    power to our understanding and\n evaluation of simulation and testbed scenarios.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Although HTML was designed within the context of MIME, more than the specification
    of HTML as defined in RFC 1866 is needed for two electronic mail user agents to
    be able to interoperate using HTML as a document format. These issues include
    the naming of objects that are normally referred to by URIs, and the means of
    aggregating objects that go together. This draft describes a set of guidelines
    that will allow conforming mail user agents to be able to send, deliver and display
    these HTML objects. In addition it is hoped that these techniques will also apply
    to the wider category of URI-enabled objects.\n\t "

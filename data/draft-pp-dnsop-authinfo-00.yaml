abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new DNS RRtype, AUTHINFO, that is used by authoritative
    servers to publish information about themselves. This information can be useful
    because a recursive resolver can determine an authoritative server's capabilities,
    such as whether an authoritative server supports the EDNS(0) client subnet extension.</p>"

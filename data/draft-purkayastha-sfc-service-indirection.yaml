- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Many stringent requirements are imposed on today's network, such as\n
    \  low latency, high availability and reliability in order to support\n   several
    use cases such as IoT, Gaming, Content distribution, Robotics\n   etc.  Networks
    need to be flexible and dynamic in terms of allocation\n   of services and resources.
    \ Network Operators should be able to\n   reconfigure the composition of a service
    and steer users towards new\n   service end points as user move or resource availability
    changes.\n   SFC allows network operators to easily create and reconfigure service\n
    \  function chains dynamically in response to changing network\n   requirements.
    \ We discuss a use case where Service Function Chain can\n   adapt or self-organize
    as demanded by the network condition without\n   requiring SPI re-classification.
    \ This can be achieved, for example,\n   by decoupling the service consumer and
    service endpoint by a new\n   service function proposed in this draft.  We describe
    few\n   requirements for this service function to enable dynamic switching\n   between
    consumer and end point.\n\n\t "

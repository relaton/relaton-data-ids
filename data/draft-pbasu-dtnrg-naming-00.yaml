- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an extension to the naming mechanism of\ndisruption
    tolerant networks (RFC4838) to support intentional naming.\nIntentional naming
    is a means by which a source node specifies the\ndestination node(s) for a bundle
    in terms of predicates on attributes\nof the node(s), instead of by a canonical
    endpoint identifier (EID)\nof the node.  Intentional naming is closely tied to
    the concept of\nbinding, as described in RFC 4838.  Since information required
    to\nroute an intentionally named bundle may not be available at the\nsource node,
    this information must be supplied at one or more\nsubsequent nodes along the bundle's
    path toward its destination(s).\nThe architecture required for an intentional
    naming capability in a\nDTN must support the notion that a bundle can make progress
    toward\nits destination(s) in the absence of complete binding information.\nIn
    this document we describe a framework for intentional naming in a\nDTN, propose
    a syntax for intentional names, and describe a\ndistributed procedure for late
    or partial binding.  We also present\nsample use cases for late binding and a
    notional name binding\nalgorithm, called GRAIN, that can deliver bundles to intentional\nnames
    with geographic and role attributes, e.g. \"first responders\nwithin a kilometer
    of a specified location.\"  Finally, we discuss the\nlimitations in our current
    ability to field an ideal intentional\nnaming system (i.e., one that can support
    generic intentional names),\nand we suggest a somewhat restrictive framework that
    is both useful\nand feasible to deploy.\n\t "

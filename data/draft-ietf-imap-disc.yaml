  content: "This note attempts to address some of the issues involved in building
    a disconnected IMAP4 client.  In particular, it deals with the issues of what
    might be called the 'driver' portion of the synchronization tool: the portion
    of the code responsible for issuing the correct set of IMAP4 commands to synchronize
    the disconnected client in the way that is most likely to make the human who uses
    the disconnected client happy.\n\t "

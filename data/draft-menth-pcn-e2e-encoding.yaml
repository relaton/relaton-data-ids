  content: "This document proposes an encoding of PCN marks based on the ECN\nfield
    of the Voice-Admit DSCP.  It has global meaning and ECN\nsemantics are not applied
    to that field.  The PCN codepoints are the\nsame as those for packet-specific
    dual marking (PSDM) within a single\nPCN domain, but the general concept can also
    be applied to other\nencodings requiring only a single PCN-enabled DSCP.\n\t "

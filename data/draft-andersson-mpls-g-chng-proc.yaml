  content: "This memo describes the process through which individuals, working\ngroups
    and external standards bodies can influence the development of\nMPLS and GMPLS
    standards.  With respect to standardization, this\nprocess means that (G)MPLS
    extensions and changes can be done through\nthe IETF only, the body that created
    the (G)MPLS technology.  The\nIETF will not publish a (G)MPLS technology extension
    RFC outside of\nthe processes described here.\n\t "

  content: "When dealing with large amounts of keys the procedures to update a\nzone
    and to sign a zone need to be clearly defined and practically\npossible.  The
    current idea is to have the zone KEY RR and the\nparent's SIG to reside in the
    child's zone and perhaps also in the\nparent's zone. Operational experiences have
    prompted us to develop an\nalternative scheme in which the parent zone stores
    the parent's\nsignature over the child's key and also the child's key itself.\n\t "

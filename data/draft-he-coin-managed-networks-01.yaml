  content: "   This draft wants to review the existing research and the open issues\n
    \  that relate to the addition of data plane programmability in managed\n   networks.
    \ While some of the research hypotheses that are at the\n   center of in-network-computing
    have been investigated since the time\n   of active networking, recent developments
    in software defined\n   networking, virtualization programmable switches and new
    network\n   programming languages like P4 have generated a new enthusiasm in the\n
    \  research community and a flourish of new projects in systems and\n   applications
    alike.  This is what this draft is addressing.\n\n\t "

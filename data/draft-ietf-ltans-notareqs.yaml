  content: "   This document establishes the goals and requirements for protocols\n
    \  and data structures for use with services that provide additional\n   means
    for users to ensure and prove the validity of data, especially\n   digitally signed
    data, in a common and reproducible way.  The data\n   being validated may correspond
    to assertions about real-world facts\n   or events.  This document establishes
    the need for components to be\n   used in addition to or in conjunction with long-term
    archive\n   services.  It provides some use cases and scenarios, and establishes\n
    \  technical requirements for protocols and data structures to support\n   them.\n\t "

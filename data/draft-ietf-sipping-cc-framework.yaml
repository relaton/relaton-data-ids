  content: "This document defines a framework and the requirements for call control
    and multi-party usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  To enable discussion
    of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for
    describing the media relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions
    described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling
    and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships.  In
    addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements
    for communicating related information and events such as conference and session
    state and session history.  This framework also describes other goals that embody
    the spirit of SIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition
    of primitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling
    and mixing model independence, and others.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

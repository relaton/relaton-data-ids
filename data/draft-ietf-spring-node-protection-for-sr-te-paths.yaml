  content: "   Segment routing supports the creation of explicit paths using\n   adjacency-sids,
    node-sids, and binding-sids.  It is important to\n   provide fast reroute (FRR)
    mechanisms to respond to failures of links\n   and nodes in the Segment-Routed
    Traffic-Engineered(SR-TE) path.  A\n   point of local repair (PLR) can provide
    FRR protection against the\n   failure of a link in an SR-TE path by examining
    only the first (top)\n   label in the SR label stack.  In order to protect against
    the failure\n   of a node, a PLR may need to examine the second label in the stack
    as\n   well, in order to determine SR-TE path beyond the failed node.  This\n
    \  document specifies how a PLR can use the first and second label in\n   the
    label stack describing an SR-TE path to provide protection\n   against node failures.\n\n\t "

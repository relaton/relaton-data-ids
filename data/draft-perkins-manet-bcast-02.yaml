  content: "An ad hoc mobile network is a collection of nodes, each of which\n   communicates
    over wireless channels and is capable of movement.\n   Nodes participating in
    such an ad hoc network communicate on\n   a peer-to-peer basis.  Flooding is often
    a desired form of\n   communication in these networks, as it can enable both the\n
    \  dissemination of control information and the delivery of data\n   packets.
    \ This document describes a method for sending packets to\n   every node in an
    ad hoc network.\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces a TCP performance evaluation tool for the
    \n   network simulator NS2.  This tool is motivated by the observation \n   that
    there is significant overlap among (but lack of an agreed set  \n   of) the topologies,
    traffic, and metrics used by many researchers   \n   in the evaluation of TCP
    alternatives: effort could be saved by \n   starting research from an existing
    framework.  As such, our tool \n   includes several typical topologies and traffic
    models; it measures \n   some of the most important metrics commonly used in TCP
    evaluation; \n   and it can automatically generate simulation statistics and graphs
    \n   ready for inclusion in latex and html documents.  The tool also \n   contains
    an extendable open-source framework.  With community effort, \n   we hope the
    tool evolves into a widely accepted, well-defined set of \n   TCP performance
    evaluation benchmarks. \n\t "

    \  to provide a comprehensive approach for the overall operation and\n   management
    of network slicing in the scope if IETF.  The system is\n   designed in a hierarchical
    and inter-operative manner.  COMS is\n   capable of recursive adaption in a hierarchical
    network management\n   system.  It is also independent of data plane technologies
    used in\n   different administrative domains.  Both network slice operator and\n
    \  network slice tenant may benefit for COMS for the purpose of slice\n   management
    and maitenance.The purpose of this document is to discuss\n   the use cases of

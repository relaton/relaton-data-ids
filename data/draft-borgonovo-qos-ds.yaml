  content: "   This document presents an end-to-end mechanism to guarantee bandwidth\n
    \  and delay into the Differentiated Services mechanism to constant rate\n   traffic
    \ such  as  voice and video. The  mechanism  requires  network\n   routers  to
    \ be able to serve packets according to three  classes  of\n   priority.  The
    needed call admission control is performed by an  end-\n   to-end  signaling  procedure
    that implicitly looks for  the  required\n   bandwidth and seizes it, if available.
    Short delays are guaranteed by\n   the  regular  structure of constant rate traffic.
    No  entities  other\n   than  source  and destination are involved  and  multicast
    \ operation\n   comes  at no further cost, which makes the mechanism  fully  scalable\n
    \  and integrable into the existing Internet.\n\n\t "

  content: "One of the main motivations behind VPLS is its ability to provide \nconnectivity
    not only among customer routers and servers/hosts but \nalso among customer bridges.
    If only connectivity among customer IP \nrouters/hosts was desired, then IPLS
    solution [IPLS] could have been \nused. The strength of the VPLS solution is that
    it can provide \nconnectivity to both bridge and non-bridge types of CE devices.
    VPLS \nis expected to deliver the same level of service that current \nenterprise
    users are accustomed to from their own enterprise bridged \nnetworks today or
    the same level of service that they receive from \ntheir Ethernet Service Providers
    using IEEE 802.1ad-based networks \n[P802.1ad] (or its predecessor – QinQ-based
    network). \n  \nWhen CE devices are IEEE bridges, then there are certain issues
    and \nchallenges that need to be accounted for in a VPLS network. Majority \nof
    these issues have currently been addressed in IEEE 802.1ad \nstandard for provider
    bridges and they need to be addressed for VPLS \nnetworks. This draft discusses
    these issues and wherever possible, \nthe recommended solutions to these issues.\n\t "

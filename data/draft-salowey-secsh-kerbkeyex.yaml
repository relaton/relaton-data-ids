- language: en

  content: "This memo describes two methods for using Kerberos [KRB5] for \nauthentication
    and key exchange in the Secure Shell protocol.  The first \nmethod uses Kerberos
    as a means to authenticate the Diffie-Hellman \nexchange described in [SSH-TRANSPORT].
    \ The second method uses Kerberos \nfor authentication and key-exchange.  This
    memo also defines a new user \nauthentication method which allows an authorization
    name and optional \ncredentials to build upon the underlying authenticated key
    exchange.\n\t "

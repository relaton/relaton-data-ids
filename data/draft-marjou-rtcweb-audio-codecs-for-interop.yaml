  content: "   This document presents use-cases underlining why WebRTC needs AMR-WB,\n
    \  AMR and G.722 as additional relevant voice codecs to satisfactorily\n   ensure
    interoperability with existing systems.  It also presents a\n   way forward that
    takes into consideration the concerns expressed\n   against the addition of codecs
    besides Opus and G.711.\n\n   It is especially recognized that unjustified additional
    costs on\n   browsers must be avoided.  Therefore, the proposed solution intends\n
    \  to fully rely on the codecs already supported on the devices\n   implementing
    the browsers and for which license and implementation\n   costs have been already
    paid.\n\n   It is expected that this way forward will significantly limit the\n
    \  costs and technical impacts on browsers while greatly improving\n   interoperability
    with legacy systems and overall quality.  It intents\n   to be considered as a
    good compromise beneficial to all parties and\n   to the whole industry: the user
    quality experience will be optimized\n   as a whole at limited additional costs
    without incurring high costs\n   for both networks to support transcoding and
    browsers to support\n   additional codecs.\n\n\t "

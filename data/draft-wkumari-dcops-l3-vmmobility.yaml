  content: "   This document outlines how Virtual Machine mobility can be\n   accomplished
    in datacenter networks that are based on L3\n   technologies.  It is not really
    intended to solve (or fully define)\n   the problem, but rather to outline it
    at a very high level to\n   determine if standardization within the IETF makes
    sense.\n\n\t "

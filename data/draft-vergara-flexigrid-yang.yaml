  content: "This document defines a YANG model for managing dynamic Optical networks,
    including Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) and Flexi-Grid DWDM Networks.
    The model described in this document is composed of two submodels: one to define
    an optical traffic engineering database, and other one to describe the optical
    paths or media channels.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the use of Random Linear Network Coding\n   (RLNC)
    schemes for reliable data transport.  Both block and sliding\n   window RLNC code
    implementations are described.  By providing erasure\n   correction using randomly
    generated repair symbols, such RLNC-based\n   schemes offer advantages in accommodating
    varying frame sizes and\n   dynamically changing connections, reducing the need
    for feedback, and\n   lowering the amount of state information needed at the sender
    and\n   receiver.  The practical considerations' section identifies RLNC-\n   encoded
    symbol representation as a valuable target for\n   standardization.\n\n\n\t "

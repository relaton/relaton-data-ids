  content: "   Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize and\n   abstract
    the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to\n   the third-party
    applications running in software.  The application\n   can utilize a programmable
    interface to receiving these virtual or\n   abstract resources in a form that
    allows monitoring or manipulation\n   of resources.  Various programmatic interfaces
    have been proposed to\n   interface directly to the forwarding plane (OpenFlow,
    ForCES), or do\n   device configuration (NETCONF).  ALTO has proposed a informational\n
    \  interface to the application.  Only the progammatic Interface to the\n   Routing
    System (IRS) provides an interface directly to the routing\n   system to utilize
    all aspects of the routing system as a system.\n\n   The IRS system interacts
    with the control plane processes to monitor\n   best paths to any destination
    and to change the routing information\n   base (RIB) or MPLS label information
    Base (LIB) which feeds the\n   forwarding tables the information needed to actually
    switch traffic\n   at a local level.\n\n   This document outlines how SDN networks
    can use the IRS interface to\n   implement an automated set of network services
    for Virtual Connection\n   on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD)\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Network-Infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP) is a cryptography-\n
    \  based session-layer protocol designed to operationalize Zero Trust\n   principles
    by concealing protected network resources from\n   unauthorized entities.  NHP
    enforces authentication-before-connect\n   access control, rendering IP addresses,
    ports, and domain names\n   invisible to unauthorized users.  This document defines
    the protocol\n   architecture, cryptographic framework, message formats, and workflow\n
    \  to enable independent implementation of NHP.  It represents the third\n   generation
    of network hiding technology—evolving from first-\n   generation port knocking
    to second-generation Single-Packet\n   Authorization (SPA) and now to NHP with
    advanced asymmetric\n   cryptography, mutual authentication, and scalability for
    modern\n   threats.  This specification also provides guidance for integration\n
    \  with Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP), DNS, FIDO, and Zero Trust\n   policy
    engines.\n\n\t "

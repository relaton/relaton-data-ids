  content: "Networking applications today already have access to a great amount\nof
    Inter-Provider network topology information.  For example, views\nof the Internet
    routing table are easily available at looking glass\nservers and entirely practical
    to be downloaded by clients.  What is\nmissing is knowledge of the underlying
    network topology from the ISP\nor Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider)
    point of view.\nIn other words, what an Provider prefers in terms of traffic\noptimization
    -- and a way to distribute it.\n\nThe ALTO Service provides information such as
    preferences of network\nresources with the goal of modifying network resource
    consumption\npatterns while maintaining or improving application performance.\nThis
    document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.\nWhile such service
    would primarily be provided by the network (i.e.,\nthe ISP), content providers
    and third parties could also operate this\nservice.  Applications that could use
    this service are those that\nhave a choice in connection endpoints.  Examples
    of such applications\nare peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.\n\t "

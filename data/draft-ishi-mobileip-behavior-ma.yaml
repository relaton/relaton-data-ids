  content: "Mobile IP [1] protocol allows a mobile node (MN) to move between \ndifferent
    networks seamlessly. However, in certain cases, \nthe latency involved in the
    handoff can be beyond the threshold \nrequired for the support of delay-sensitive
    or real-time services.\nIn order to address the above problem, there have been
    many \nproposals related to extensions of Mobile IP handoffs in order to \nachieve
    efficient handoff procedures.\n\t "

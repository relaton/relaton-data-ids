  content: "   The migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is intended to fix a large number of\n
    \  problems with IPv4 that have been identified through many years of\n   global
    use, not least of which is the shortage of available IPv4\n   addresses.  One
    of the challenges with IPv4 that has not, apparently,\n   been adequately considered
    is the crime attribution characteristics\n   of IPv6 technologies.\n\n   The challenge
    of crime attribution on the Internet is an important\n   one and a careful balance
    needs to be struck between the needs of law\n   enforcement, the rights of crime
    victims and the right to privacy of\n   the vast majority of Internet users who
    have no involvement in any\n   sort of criminality.\n\n   The purpose of this
    document is to consider the crime attribution\n   characteristics of various IPv6
    address assignment techniques.\n\n\t "

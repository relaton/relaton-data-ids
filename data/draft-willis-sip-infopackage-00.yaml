  content: "The SIP INFO method (RFC 2976) establishes a method by which\napplications
    may transfer application-specific information within a\nSIP dialog.  However,
    RFC 2976 does not provide a mechanism for\ndescribing and documenting an application
    of INFO, nor does it\nprovide a mechanism by which applications may negotiate
    such uses.\nThis document provides a framework for documenting and naming\nspecific
    uses of INFO (called INFO packages), for registering those\npackage names with
    IANA, and for negotiating the support for various\nINFO packages between applications
    using SIP.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes a modification to CNAME record to coexist with\nSOA
    and NS records at the zone apex.  This proposal will improve\naliasing in the
    DNS system.  The users are often forced to manually\nadd duplicate A, AAAA and
    MX records by copying data from the target\nzone to the aliased zone.  This forces
    zone owner to keep track of\ntarget domain name since the mismatch in the data
    could cause\nfailures.  This administrative burden will be eliminated by allowing\nCNAME
    to coexist with NS and SOA resource records.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a taxonomy of \"Alternative Network\n   deployments\",
    and a set of definitions and shared characteristics.\n   This term includes a
    set of network access models emerged in the last\n   decade with the aim of bringing
    Internet connectivity to people,\n   using topological, architectural and business
    models different from\n   the so-called \"traditional\" ones, where a company
    deploys the network\n   infrastructure for connecting the users, who pay for it.\n\n
    \  Several initiatives throughout the world have built large scale\n   networks
    that are alternative to the traditional network operator\n   deployments using
    predominately wireless technologies (including long\n   distance) due to the reduced
    cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.\n   Wired technologies such as Fiber are
    also used in some of these\n   alternate networks.  There are several types of
    such alternate\n   network: networks such as community networks are self-organized
    and\n   decentralized networks wholly owned by the community; networks owned\n
    \  by individuals who act as wireless internet service providers\n   (WISPs),
    networks owned by individuals but leased out to network\n   operators who use
    such networks as a low-cost medium to reach the\n   underserved population and
    finally there are networks that provide\n   connectivity by sharing wireless resources
    of the users.\n\n   The emergence of these networks can be motivated by different
    causes\n   such as the reluctance, or the impossibility, of network operators
    to\n   provide wired and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas.  In\n
    \  these cases, the networks have self sustainable business models that\n   provide
    more localised communication services as well as Internet\n   backhaul support
    through peering agreements with traditional network\n   operators.  Some other
    times, networks are built as a complement and\n   an alternative to commercial
    Internet access provided by\n   \"traditional\" network operators.\n\n   The present
    classification considers different existing network\n   models such as Community
    Networks, open wireless services, user-\n   extensible services, traditional local
    Internet Service Providers\n   (ISPs), new global ISPs, etc.  Different criteria
    are used in order\n   to build a classification as e.g., the ownership of the
    equipment,\n   the way the network is organized, the participatory model, the\n
    \  extensibility, if they are driven by a community, a company or a\n   local
    (public or private) stakeholder, etc.\n\n   According to the developed taxonomy,
    a characterization of each kind\n   of network is presented, in terms of specific
    network characteristics\n   related to architecture, organization, etc.\n\n\t "

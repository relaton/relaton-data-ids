  content: "   This document defines two PIM Join/Prune attributes that support the\n
    \  construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and\n   receivers
    are located in different Locator/ID Separation Protocol\n   (LISP) sites.  These
    attributes allow the receiver site to select\n   between unicast and multicast
    underlying transport, to convey the\n   RLOC (Routing Locator) address of the
    receiver ETR (Egress Tunnel\n   Router) to the control plane of the root ITR (Ingress
    Tunnel Router)\n   and to signal the underlay multicast group to the control plane
    of\n   the root ITR.  This document updates RFC 8059 and RFC 9798.\n\n\t "

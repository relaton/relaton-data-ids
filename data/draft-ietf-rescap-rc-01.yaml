    (RC) is a service for storing and obtaining metadata that\ndescribes network-accessible
    resources.  This service is primarily\nintended for use by clients prior to accessing,
    or attempting to access,\na particular resource.  The RC service may thus be used
    (for example) to\ninform a client as to which of a variety of features are supported
    by\nthe resource, or which methods may be used to access the resource, or\nwhich
    of a small set of locations may be used to access the resource.\n\t "

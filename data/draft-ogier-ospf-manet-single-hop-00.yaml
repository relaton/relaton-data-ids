  script: Latn
  content: "RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs)
    by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of\ntype MANET.  This document
    describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single-\nhop broadcast network, which is a
    special case of a MANET in which\neach router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each
    other router.  Unlike an\nOSPF broadcast interface, such an interface can have
    a different cost\nassociated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration\nrecommendations
    and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-\nhop networks.\n\t "

  content: "Handling multiple sets of network trouble tickets (TTs) originating from
    different participants' inter-connected network environments poses a series of
    challenges for the involved institutions. A Grid is a good example of such a multi-domain
    project. Each of the participants follows different procedures for handling trouble
    in its domain, according to the local technical and linguistic profile. The TT
    systems of the participants collect, represent, and disseminate TT information
    in different formats.\n\n As a result, management of the daily workload by a central
    Network Operation Centre (NOC) is a challenge on its own. Normalization of TTs
    to a common format at the central NOC can ease presentation, storing, and handling
    of the TTs. In the present document, we provide a model for automating the collection
    and normalization of the TT received by multiple networks forming the Grid. Each
    of the participants is using its home TT system within its domain for handling
    trouble incidents, whereas the central NOC is gathering the tickets in the normalized
    format for repository and handling. XML is used as the common representation language.
    The model was defined and used as part of the networking support activity of the
    EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE) project. This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   Clock synchronization protocols are very widely used in IP-based\n
    \  networks. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been commonly deployed\n   for
    many years, and the last few years have seen an increasingly\n   rapid deployment
    of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). As time-\n   sensitive applications evolve,
    clock accuracy requirements are\n   becoming increasingly stringent, requiring
    the time synchronization\n   protocols to provide high accuracy. Slave Diversity
    is a recently\n   introduced approach, where the master and slave clocks (also
    known as\n   server and client) are connected through multiple network paths,
    and\n   the slave combines the information received through all paths to\n   obtain
    a higher clock accuracy compared to the conventional one-path\n   approach.  This
    document describes a multi-path approach to PTP and\n   NTP over IP networks,
    allowing the protocols to run concurrently over\n   multiple communication paths
    between the master and slave clocks. The\n   multi-path approach can significantly
    contribute to clock accuracy,\n   security and fault protection. The Multi-Path
    Precision Time Protocol\n   (MPPTP) and Multi-Path Network Time Protocol (MPNTP)
    define an\n   additional layer that extends the existing PTP and NTP without the\n
    \  need to modify these protocols. MPPTP and MPNTP also allow backward\n   compatibility
    with nodes that do not support the multi-path\n   extension.\n\n\t "

  content: "Pseudowire signaling requires that the Pseudowire Type (PW Type) be identical
    in both directions.  For certain applications the configuration of the PW Type
    is most easily accomplished by configuring this information at just one PW endpoint.
    \ In any form of LDP-based signaling, each PW endpoint must initiate the creation
    of a unidirectional LSP.  In order to allow the initiation of these two LSPs to
    remain independent, a means is needed for allowing the PW endpoint (lacking a
    priori knowledge of the PW Type) to initiate the creation of an LSP.  This document
    defines a Wildcard PW Type to satisfy this need. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

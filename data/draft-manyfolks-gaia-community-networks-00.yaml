  script: Latn
  content: "   Several communities have developed initiatives to build large scale,\n
    \  self-organized and decentralized community wireless networks that use\n   wireless
    technologies (including long distance) due to the reduced\n   cost of using the
    unlicensed spectrum.  This can be motivated by\n   different causes: Sometimes
    the reluctance, or the impossibility, of\n   network operators to provide wired
    and cellular infrastructures to\n   rural/remote areas has motivated the rise
    of these networks.  Some\n   other times, they are built as a complement and an
    alternative to\n   wired Internet access.\n\n   These community wireless networks
    have self sustainable business\n   models that provide more localised communication
    services as well as\n   providing Internet backhaul support through peering agreements
    with\n   traditional network operators who see such community led networks as\n
    \  a way to extend their reach to rural/remote areas at lower cost.\n\n   This
    document defines these networks, summarizes their technological\n   characteristics
    and classifies them, also talking about their socio-\n   economic sustainability
    models.\n\n   There exist other networks, also based on sharing wireless resources\n
    \  of the users, but not built upon the initiative of the users\n   themselves,
    nor owned by them.  The characterization of these\n   networks is not the objective
    of this document.\n\n\t "

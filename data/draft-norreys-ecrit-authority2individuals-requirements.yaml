  content: "Various agencies need to provide information to the restricted group\n
    \  of persons or even to the generic public before, during and after\n   emergency
    situations.  While many aspects of such systems are\n   specific to national or
    local jurisdictions, emergencies span such\n   boundaries and notifications need
    to reach visitors from other\n   jurisdictions.  This document summarizes requirements
    for protocols\n   to allow alerts to be conveyed to IP-based end points.\n\t "

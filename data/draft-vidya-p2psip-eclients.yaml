  content: "RELOAD [1] defines a class of devices termed as clients that may\nattach
    to peers and use the overlay, without having to provide\noverlay routing or storage.
    \ These devices may attach to the identity\nowner on the overlay or to any arbitrary
    peer.  This document\nprovides a mechanism to attach to any arbitrary peer with
    some state\non the overlay for routing purposes.  This avoids needing application\nspecific
    means of providing a destination list for contact\ninformation for the client
    and also inherently handles client\nmobility.\n\t "

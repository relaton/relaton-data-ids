  content: "The ALTO working group provides guidance to P2P applications, which\nhave
    to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, that\nare able to provide
    a desired resource.  This guidance shall be based\non parameters that affect performance
    and efficiency of the data\ntransmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological
    distance.  The\nultimate goal is to improve performance (or Quality of Experience)
    in\nthe application while reducing resource consumption in the underlying\nnetwork
    infrastructure.\n\nThe present document addresses the case of ALTO transactions\ninvolving
    a peers connected via a mobile core network.  It proposes\nspecific scopes and
    use cases for mobile core networks and as a first\nstep, properties of paths and
    endpoints that allow to facilitate ALTO\ntransaction within such a scope.\n\t "

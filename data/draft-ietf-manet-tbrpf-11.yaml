  content: "Topology Dissemination Based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is a proactive,
    link-state routing protocol designed for mobile ad-hoc networks, which provides
    hop-by-hop routing along shortest paths to each destination.  Each node running
    TBRPF computes a source tree (providing paths to all reachable nodes) based on
    partial topology information stored in its topology table, using a modification
    of Dijkstra's algorithm.  To minimize overhead, each node reports only *part*
    of its source tree to neighbors.  TBRPF uses a combination of periodic and differential
    updates to keep all neighbors informed of the reported part of its source tree.
    \ Each node also has the option to report additional topology information (up
    to the full topology), to provide improved robustness in highly mobile networks.
    \ TBRPF performs neighbor discovery using \"differential\" HELLO messages which
    report only *changes* in the status of neighbors.  This results in HELLO messages
    that are much smaller than those of other link-state routing protocols such as
    OSPF.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

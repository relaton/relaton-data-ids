  script: Latn
  content: "         Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching\n      (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label\n      Switched Paths (TE
    LSPs) may be established using signaling\n      techniques described in [RFC4875].
    However, [RFC4875] does not\n      address many issues that come when a P2MP-TE
    LSP is signaled in\n      inter-domain networks. Specifically, one of the issues
    in inter-\n      domain networks is how to allow computation of a loosely routed\n
    \     P2MP-TE LSP such that it is re-merge free. Another issue is\n      reoptimization
    of a P2MP-TE tree vs. reoptimization of an\n      individual destination sub-LSP,
    as loosely routing domain border\n      node is not aware of the reoptimization
    scope. This document\n      provides a framework and required protocol extensions
    needed for\n      establishing, controlling and reoptimizing P2MP MPLS and GMPLS
    TE\n      LSPs in inter-domain networks.\n\n\n         This document borrows inter-domain
    TE terminology from [RFC\n      4726], e.g., for the purposes of this document,
    a domain is\n      considered to be any collection of network elements within
    a\n      common sphere of address management or path computational\n      responsibility.
    Examples of such domains include Interior Gateway\n      Protocol (IGP) areas
    and Autonomous Systems (ASes).\n\n\n   \n\t "

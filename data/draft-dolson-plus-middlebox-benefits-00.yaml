abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   At IETF97, at a meeting regarding the Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS)\n
    \  protocol, a request was made for documentation about the benefits\n   that
    might be provided by permitting middleboxes to have some\n   visibility to transport-layer
    information.\n\n   This document summarizes benefits provided to the Internet
    by\n   middleboxes -- intermediary devices that provide functions apart from\n
    \  normal IP routing between a source and destination host [RFC3234].\n\n   RFC3234
    defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the internet\n   circa 2002.  Most
    of those middleboxes utilized or modified\n   application-layer data.  This document
    will focus primarily on\n   devices that observe and act on information found
    in the transport\n   layer, most commonly TCP at this time.\n\n   A primary goal
    of this document is to provide information to working\n   groups developing new
    transport protocols, in particular the PLUS and\n   QUIC working groups, to aid
    understanding of what might be gained or\n   lost by design decisions.\n\n\t "

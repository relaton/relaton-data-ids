  content: "Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node (MN) to maintain its connectivity to
    the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred
    to as handover.  During handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node
    is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol
    operations.  This \"handover latency\" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures,
    namely movement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and Binding Update,
    is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP).  Reducing
    the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive
    applications as well.  This document specifies a protocol to improve handover
    latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving
    the link switching latency. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

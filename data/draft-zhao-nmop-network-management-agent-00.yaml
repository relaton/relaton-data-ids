  content: "   With the development of AI(Artificial Intelligence) technology, large\n
    \  model have shown significant advantages and great potential in\n   recognition,
    understanding, decision-making, and generation, and can\n   well match the self-intelligent
    network management requirements for\n   the goal of autonomous network[TMF-IG1230]
    or Intent-based Networking\n   [RFC9315], and can be used as one of the potential
    driving\n   technologies to drive high-level autonomous networks.  When\n   introducing
    AI for network management, how to integrate AI technology\n   and deal with the
    relationship with the existing network management\n   entity (such as network
    controller) is the focus of research and\n   standardization.\n\n   This document
    presents the concept of AI based network management\n   agent(NMA), provides the
    basic definition and reference architecture\n   of NMA, discusses the relationship
    of NMA with traditional network\n   controller or other network management entity
    by exploring the\n   delpoyment mode of NMA, and proposes the comman processing
    flow and\n   typical application scenarios of NMA.\n\n\t "

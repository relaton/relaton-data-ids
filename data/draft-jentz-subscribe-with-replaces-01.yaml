  content: "   A device using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) may need to\n
    \  perform a handover between networks that results in a corresponding\n   change
    to the mobile's SIP edge proxy.  Alternatively, there may be\n   the need to transfer
    a SIP dialog from one device to another.  In\n   both of these scenarios, the
    device needs a procedure to allow it to\n   take an existing SIP dialog and logically
    replace it with a new SIP\n   dialog.  An important subset of these dialogs consists
    of the\n   device's subscription dialogs.  This document proposes to extend the\n
    \  SIP SUBSCRIBE method to include the Replaces header field for the\n   purpose
    of enabling a more robust solution to SIP subscription\n   mobility.\n\n\n\t "

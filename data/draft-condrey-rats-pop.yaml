abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Proof of Process (PoP), an evidence framework
    for digital authorship attestation. The framework produces tamper- evident, independently
    verifiable process evidence describing how documents evolve over time, without
    capturing document content or keystroke data. Proof of Process implements a specialized
    profile of the Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture, extending it
    with behavioral entropy bindings, Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) temporal proofs,
    and a taxonomy of absence claims with explicit trust requirements. The specification
    defines two complementary CBOR- encoded formats: Evidence Packets (.pop) produced
    by Attesters during document authorship, and Attestation Results (.war) produced
    by Verifiers after appraising Evidence. The framework is designed around four
    core principles: privacy by construction (no content storage), zero trust (locally
    generated, independently verifiable), evidence over inference (observable facts,
    not conclusions), and cost-asymmetric forgery (expensive to fake, not impossible).
    This specification does not address AI detection, stylometric analysis, or intent
    inference.</p>"

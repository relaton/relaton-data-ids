  content: "   The ForCES Forwarding Element Model [Model] defines a model and\n   schema
    for representing Logical Functional Block (LFB) classes and\n   their operational
    and capability attributes.  The operational\n   attributes of LFB instances within
    a Forwarding Element (FE) are\n   manipulated by the ForCES protocol [ForCES]
    to configure the\n   operation of the FE.  The model assumes that any particular
    LFB\n   attribute is owned and accessed exclusively by a single LFB instance.\n
    \  While this is a simple and clean restriction, we observe that it\n   imposes
    some complications when defining LFBs.  This memo addresses\n   these complications
    and proposes that the restriction be re-examined.\n\t "

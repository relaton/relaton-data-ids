  content: "   This document specifies the AI Governance and Accountability (AIGA)\n
    \  Protocol version 1.0, a practical, economically viable, and\n   technically
    enforceable framework for governing autonomous AI\n   agents.  AIGA 1.0 is designed
    to address real-world deployment\n   constraints, adversarial agent scenarios,
    and economic incentive\n   alignment.\n\n   The protocol is founded on a Tiered
    Risk-Based Governance model,\n   applying proportional oversight to agents based
    on their\n   capabilities.  All agents are governed by an Immutable Kernel\n   Architecture
    which provides a non-modifiable Trusted Computing Base\n   (TCB) for enforcing
    policy.  This is combined with Action-Based\n   Authorization, where critical
    operations require real-time approval.\n\n   To solve the single-point-of-failure
    problem, the protocol uses a\n   Federated Authority Network of regional, cross-validating
    hubs and\n   provides a Network-Level Quarantine Protocol for enforcement.  The\n
    \  entire framework is designed around Economic Incentive Alignment,\n   making
    compliance the most economically rational choice for\n   operators.\n\n   For
    high-assurance (T3-T4) scenarios, AIGA 1.0 specifies advanced,\n   redundant mechanisms
    including Multi-Vendor TEE Attestation\n   (M-TACE), AI \"Warden Triumvirate\"
    Triage, Human Review Board (HRB)\n   Multi-Signature, Peer Consensus Failsafe
    & Identity Rotation, and\n   Double Ratchet Cryptography.\n\n\t "

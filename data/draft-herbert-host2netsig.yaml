  content: "   This document discusses the motivations, use cases, and requirements\n
    \  for Host to Network Signaling.  In Host to Network Signaling, hosts\n   annotate
    packets with information that is intended for consumption by\n   on-path elements.
    \ Signals may be used to request services on a per\n   packet basis from on-path
    elements, to request admission into the\n   network, or to provide diagnostics
    and tracing information.\n\n\t "

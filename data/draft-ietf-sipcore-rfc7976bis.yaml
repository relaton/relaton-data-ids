  script: Latn
  content: "   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases\n
    \  where different SIP private header extensions referred to as \"P-\"\n   header
    fields, and defined in RFC 7315, need to be included in SIP\n   requests and responses
    currently not allowed according to RFC 7315.\n   This document updates RFC 7315,
    in order to allow inclusion of the\n   affected \"P-\" header fields in such requests
    and responses.  This\n   Document obsoletes RFC 7976.  The changes related to
    RFC7976 involve\n   the inclusion of the P-Visited-Network-ID header field in
    SIP\n   responses.\n\n   This document also makes updates for RFC 7315 in order
    to fix\n   misalignments that occurred when RFC 3455 was updated and\n   subsequently
    obsoleted by the publication of RFC 7315.\n\n\t "

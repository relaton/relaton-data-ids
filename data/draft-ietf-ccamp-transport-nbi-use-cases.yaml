  content: "   Transport network domains, including Optical Transport Network (OTN)\n
    \  and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, are typically\n   deployed
    based on a single vendor or technology platforms. They are\n   often managed using
    proprietary interfaces to dedicated Element\n   Management Systems (EMS), Network
    Management Systems (NMS) and\n   increasingly Software Defined Network (SDN) controllers.\n\n
    \  A well-defined open interface to each domain management system or\n   controller
    is required for network operators to facilitate control\n   automation and orchestrate
    end-to-end services across multi-domain\n   networks. These functions may be enabled
    using standardized data\n   models (e.g. YANG), and appropriate protocol (e.g.,
    RESTCONF).\n\n   This document describes the key use cases and requirements to
    be\n   used as the basis for applicability statements analyzing how IETF\n   data
    models can be used for transport network control and\n   management.\n\n\t "

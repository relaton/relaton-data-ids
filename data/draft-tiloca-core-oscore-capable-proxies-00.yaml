abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) can be\n
    \  used to protect CoAP messages end-to-end between two endpoints at the\n   application
    layer, also in the presence of intermediaries such as\n   proxies.  This document
    defines how OSCORE is used to protect CoAP\n   messages also between an origin
    application endpoint and an\n   intermediary, or between two intermediaries.  Besides,
    it defines how\n   a CoAP message can be double-protected through \"OSCORE-in-OSCORE\",\n
    \  i.e., both end-to-end between origin application endpoints, as well\n   as
    between an application endpoint and an intermediary or between two\n   intermediaries.
    \ Thus, this document updates RFC 8613.  The same\n   approach applies to Group
    OSCORE, for protecting CoAP messages when\n   group communication with intermediaries
    is used.\n\n\t "

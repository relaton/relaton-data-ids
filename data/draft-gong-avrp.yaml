  content: "   The Anchor-based Voronoi Routing Protocol in this draft is an\n   efficient
    distributed routing protocol for wireless sensor networks\n   with mobile sinks.
    The design objective of the protocol is to reduce\n   the overall updating overhead
    caused by the movement of mobile sinks\n   and simultaneously build efficient
    data delivery structure. The\n   basic idea behind AVRP is to combine the ideas
    of Voronoi scoping\n   and dynamic anchor node selection. The designed protocol
    is simple,\n   efficient, and easy to implement in dynamic wireless sensor networks\n
    \  with mobile sinks.\n\n\t "

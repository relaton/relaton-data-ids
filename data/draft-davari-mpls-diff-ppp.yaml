  content: "This document proposes a technique for MPLS to support Differentiated
    \  Services (Diff-Serv) over PPP links in non-ECN-capable [ECN] networks.\n\nBriefly,
    we propose that:\n\n- Packets belonging to the same PHB forwarding class (PFC),
    as defined\nin [DIFF_MPLS_EXT], be transported over the same PPP LSP.\n \n- For
    a given FEC, a separate PPP LSP should be established for each\nPFC, so that multiple
    PPP LSPs are established in parallel for\nsupport of Diff-Serv.\n\t "

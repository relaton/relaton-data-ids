  content: "   This document describes a protocol that provides IP reachability for\n
    \  mobile users. Like IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, each mobile node is\n   accessible
    by its home address, regardless of its current location in\n   the Internet. When
    away from home, a mobile node acquires a care-of\n   address indicating its current
    location. It registers the care-of\n   address with a registration server (RS).
    The RS sets up a twice\n   network address translation table on a RAT device.
    The RAT device\n   transparently routes datagrams destined for the mobile node's
    home\n   address to the care-of address using twice network address\n   translation.
    The protocol requirements for the mobile node is\n   minimal. End-users can have
    mobility support easily as registration\n   is done using widely available applications.\n\n\t "

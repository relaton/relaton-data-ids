  content: "   One of the biggest hurdles for FTP in real life usage is its use of\n
    \  two connections.  First, it uses a primary connection to send control\n   commands
    on, and when it sends or receives data, it opens a second\n   TCP stream for that
    purpose.  This document specifies a new FTP LOCK\n   command to be used by clients
    to request the server to use the\n   control connection for data transfers, using
    a single port instead of\n   two.\n\n\t "

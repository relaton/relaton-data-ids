  script: Latn
  content: "   This document elaborates a threat model for the Perfect Passive\n   Adversary
    (PPA): an adversary with an interest in eavesdropping that\n   can passively observe
    network traffic at every layer at every point\n   in the network between the endpoints.
    \ It is intended to demonstrate\n   to protocol designers and implementors the
    observability and\n   inferability of information and metainformation transported
    over\n   their respective protocols, to assist in the evaluation of the\n   performance
    of these protocols and the effectiveness of their\n   protection mechanisms under
    pervasive passive surveillance.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Anyone that has dealt at length with plain (ASCII [1]) text and\nsource
    code files can testify that the lack of a global definition\nof the effect of
    the horizontal-tab character, all too often, causes\nill-formed display and printed
    output of plain text files that\nutilize the horizontal-tab character for formatting.\nThis
    document defines a common header for plain text and source code\n(PT/SC) files,
    whose primary purpose is to specify the tab-dependant\nformatting parameters to
    be used when displaying, printing, or\nediting such files.  The defined header
    also addresses such issues\nas whether to use the line-feed character or carriage-return/line-\nfeed
    character sequence to terminate lines in the file.  Widespread\nadoption and support
    of the header defined in this document could\nsubstantially improve the interoperability
    of text and source code\nfiles distributed across the Internet and other mediums.\n\t "

  content: "   Mobile IPv6 as specified in RFC3775 relies on IPsec for securing the\n
    \  signaling messages and user plane traffic between the mobile node and\n   home
    agent.  An IPsec SA between the mobile node and the home agent\n   provides security
    for the mobility signaling.  Use of IPsec for\n   securing the data traffic between
    the mobile node and home agent is\n   optional.  This document analyses the implications
    of the design\n   decision to mandate IPsec as the default security protocol for
    Mobile\n   IPv6 and consequently Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 and recommends\n   revisiting
    this decision in view of the experience gained from\n   implementation and adoption
    in other standards bodies.\n\n\t "

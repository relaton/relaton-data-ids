  script: Latn
  content: "Because of the importance of the work done in the IETF, and because of
    the increasing cultural diversity of the participants, some of whom find our most-unrestrained
    'style' hard to accommodate, I believe the time has come for the IETF to adopt
    a Code of Conduct to govern our interactions.\n\t "

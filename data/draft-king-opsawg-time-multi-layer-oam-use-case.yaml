- language: en

  content: "   This document identifies and discusses use-cases and high level\n   requirements
    for transport technology independent OAM that need to\n   interface multi-layer
    or multi-domain transport networks to cover\n   heterogeneous networking technologies.
    \ As providers face multi-layer\n   networks and diverse transport technologies,
    generic and integrated\n   OAM is desirable for simplifying network operations
    and maintenance.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been used\n
    \  in Internet protocol design. More than seventeen years have passed\n   since
    RFC3552 was written and the structure and topology of the\n   Internet have changed.
    With those changes comes a question: has the\n   Internet Threat Model changed?
    Or, is the model described in RFC3552\n   still mostly accurate?  This draft attempts
    to describe a non-\n   exhaustive list of changes in the current threat environment.
    It\n   finds that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences\n   from
    the environment described in RFC3552 and is intended as input\n   to the IAB program
    on the Internet threat model started in 2020.\n\n\t "

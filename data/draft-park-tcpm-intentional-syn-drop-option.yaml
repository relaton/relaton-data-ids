  content: "   This document proposes an option to mitigate SYN flooding attacks,\n
    \  called Intentional SYN Drop (ISD).  This option can mitigate the SYN\n   flooding
    attack by intentionally dropping the first SYN.  It also\n   includes a connection
    management mechanism to detect intelligent\n   attackers who mimic normal clients.
    \ Therefore, it can effectively\n   mitigate the SYN flooding DDoS attack.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>In particular networks such as those used by financial institutions,
    network performance criteria such as latency are becoming critical to data path
    selection. However cost is still an important consideration. This leads to a situation
    where path calculation involves multiple metrics and more complex objective functions.
    When using GMPLS control plane, there are many scenarios in which a node may need
    to request a remote node to perform path computation or expansion, like for example
    multi-domain LSP setup, Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-Network
    Interface (UNI) or simply the utilization of a loose ERO in intra domain signaling.
    In such cases, the node requesting the setup of an LSP needs to convey the required
    objective function to the remote node, to enable it to perform route computation
    in the desired fashion. Similarly, there are cases where the ingress node needs
    to indicate a TE metric bound for a loose segment that is expanded by a remote
    node. This document defines extensions to the RSVP-TE Protocol to allow an ingress
    node to request the required objective function for the route computation, as
    well as a metric bound to influence route computation decisions at a remote node(s).

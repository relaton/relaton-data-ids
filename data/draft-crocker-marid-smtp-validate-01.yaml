abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Internet mail relies on exchanges between systems that have made no\n
    \  prior arrangement with each other.  For reasons of history and\n   expediency,
    the current service provides a level of accountability\n   for participating hosts
    that is no longer adequate.  This makes it\n   impossible to vet MTAs or find
    recourse when their operation causes\n   problems.  Client SMTP Validation (CSV)
    provides an economical\n   service that permits an SMTP server to decide whether
    messages sent\n   by the client SMTP are likely to be well-behaved, or at least
    to\n   decide whether the client is sufficiently accountable for its\n   actions.
    \ CSV provides a small, simple and useful improvement to\n   Internet mail service
    accountability.  It builds upon the existing\n   practise of service providers
    that accredit the networks from which\n   sending systems are connecting.\n\t "

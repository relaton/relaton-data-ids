  content: "The IAB has been working toward establishing a liaison relationship between
    the Internet Society and ISO/JTC 1. A liaison with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 has been
    offered, and there have been indications that liaisons with any of the other SCs
    will be granted without problems as needed.    Further progress is subject to
    the preparation and approval of a 'cooperative agreement' between the two organizations.
    The present document is a draft of that cooperative agreement. It stresses the
    main points of agreement: mutual recognition of standards, information on work
    programs, information sharing and possible collaborative efforts.              In
    line with JTC 1 decisions, this draft cooperative agreement covers liaison with
    SC 6. The Internet Society looks forward to establishing similar liaisons with
    other appropriate JTC 1 subcommittees in the near future.                                                                    This
    version is a draft. It will have to be reviewed by the members of the Internet
    community and discussed with ISO/IEC JTC 1. The term 'organization' in the following
    refers either to the Internet Society or to SC 6.\n\t "

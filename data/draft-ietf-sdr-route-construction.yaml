  content: "SDRP packet forwarding and setup have been described in another document,
    and a prototype implementation completed.  However, we are presently relying on
    manual mechanisms to construct the source routes.  This document explores several
    design options for automating the process of SDRP route construction and thereby
    making it more dynamic.  The proposed approaches make use of IDRP RIB information,
    \ and protocol mechanisms.\n\t "

  content: "The Pre-Congestion Notification Architecture document defines a PCN\ndomain
    and the PCN-ingress and PCN-egress nodes that form its\nboundary.  The present
    document is an attempt to describe the\ndetailed behaviour of the PCN boundary
    nodes.  It is a contribution\ntoward the PCN WG milestone: \"Suggested Flow Admission
    and\nTermination Boundary Mechanisms\".  This first version is expected to\nevolve
    with discussion and further thought toward a more precise and\nprescriptive view
    of boundary node behaviour.\n\t "

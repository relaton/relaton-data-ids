  content: "Traditionally, the GSSAPI specification has not included in its scope\nthe
    acquisition of initial credentials, or mechanisms which have\nrequired interaction
    with the user in the course of the security\ncontext.  This has limited the applicability
    of the GSSAPI\nspecification.\nThis specification allows an application program
    to register a\ncallback function so that a GSSAPI mechanism can request conversation\nservices
    from the application program. The application program is\nresponsible for displaying
    messages to the user and requesting input\nfrom the user via the callback function.\nThe
    goal of this specification is to allow certain low-\ninfrastructure-requiring
    mechanisms to prompt the user for a\nusername, password, SecureID response, etc.
    \ It might also be used by\nmechanisms such as Kerberos when the GSSAPI library
    wishes to obtain\ninitial credentials itself, instead of assuming that they are
    already\npresent in the process.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the set of transport services required by\n
    \  low-latency, real-time applications.  These services are derived from\n   the
    needs of the applications, rather than from the current\n   capabilities of the
    transport layer.  An example API, based on the\n   Berkeley Sockets API, is also
    provided, alongside examples of how the\n   target applications would use the
    API to access the transport\n   services described.\n\n\t "

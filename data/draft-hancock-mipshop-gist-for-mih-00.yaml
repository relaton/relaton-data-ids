  content: "The MIPSHOP working group is working on common functionality\nnecessary
    for the support of media independent handover (MIH)\nprotocols, initially focussing
    on the architectures being developed\nwith the 802.21 working group of the IEEE.
    \ A problem statement draft\ndescribing the context and scope of the common functionality
    is\nalready in progress, and a second draft has been prepared that\ndescribes
    the main protocol design issues that have to be taken into\nconsideration.  Although
    the common functionality (relating to\ntransport and security requirements) is
    mainly standard, there is\nstill a significant element of protocol design to integrate
    them with\nthe MIH service itself, including in particular secure peer discovery\nand
    capability negotiation.  This draft presents a solution for the\ncommon protocol
    functionality based on the use of the General\nInternet Signaling Transport (GIST)
    protocol, which has been\ndeveloped in the NSIS working group.  GIST can already
    satisfy the\nbulk of the protocol requirements in its current form, and this draft\nexplains
    how this existing GIST functionality fits into the MIH\nproblem space.  The main
    special requirements for MIH relate to\nsignalling node discovery and message
    routing, and this draft\noutlines three options for supporting these requirements
    within the\nGIST framework\n\n\t "

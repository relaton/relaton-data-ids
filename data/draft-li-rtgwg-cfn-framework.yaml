  content: "   Compute First Networking (CFN) leverages both computing and\n   networking
    status to help determine the optimal edge among multiple\n   edge sites with different
    geographic locations to serve a specific\n   edge computing request. Requests
    for the same service can be\n   determined and dispatched to different edges based
    on service\n   requirements, network and computing resource conditions and other\n
    \  factors to achieve better load balancing and system efficiency. The\n   request
    needs to be dispatched to the selected edge in real time and\n   the subsequent
    packets from the same flow should be served by the\n   same edge for flow affinity.
    This document describes a framework of\n   CFN to achieve the desired features.\n\n\t "

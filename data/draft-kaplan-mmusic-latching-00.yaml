  content: "   This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries in RTC\n
    \  deployments, sometimes referred to as Session Border Controllers\n   (SBCs),
    when performing Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT).  HNT is a set of\n   mechanisms, such
    as media relaying and latching, that such\n   intermediaries use to enable other
    RTC devices behind NATs to\n   communicate with each other.  This document is
    non-normative, and is\n   only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference
    to the\n   IETF community, as well as an informative description to\n   manufacturers,
    and users.\n\n\t "

    on the usage tier/volume use case from [McDysan]. The\nfeedback recorded in the
    Beijing conex meeting minutes was that a\nnumber of people were potentially interested
    in this use case, but\nthat it was out of scope of the current charter, and/or
    could\npotentially be built out of the conex abstract mechanism.\n\t "

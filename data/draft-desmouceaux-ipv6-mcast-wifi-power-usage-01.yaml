  content: "   IPv6 networks make a consequent use of multicast for several\n   purposes,
    including mandatory functions such as Neighbor Discovery.\n   Although this use
    of multicast does not create real difficulties on\n   wired networks, it can become
    painful on wireless ones, notably in\n   terms of power consumption.  There might
    be little effect on home\n   networks, however, such effects become more important
    on large-scale\n   networks.  This memo provides statistics about the multicast
    traffic\n   rate in a large IPv6 wireless network and the induced device power\n
    \  consumption, in response to a call emitted at IETF 89.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "MultiProtocol-BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of Network Layer\n   protocols
    to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may\n   belong is determined
    by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the\n   Subsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI).  The current AFI/SAFI\n   definitions for the IPv4 address family only
    have provisions for\n   advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4
    protocol when\n   advertising an IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
    or\n   a VPN-IPv4 NLRI.  This document specifies the extensions necessary to\n
    \  allow advertising an IPv4 NLRI or a VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop\n   address
    that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an\n   extension of the AFI/SAFI
    definitions to allow the address of the\n   Next Hop for an IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4
    NLRI to also belong to the IPv6\n   protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop in
    order to determine which of\n   the protocols the address actually belongs to,
    and a new BGP\n   Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether
    they\n   can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes the definition of an Explicitly Authenticated
    Proxy as intermediary of normally unprotected "http" URI scheme requests and responses
    of HTTP2 traffic. An Explicitly Authenticated Proxy is a message forwarding agent
    that is selected, with explicit user's consent, and configured by the user agent
    to receive exclusively "http" URI scheme requests and attempt to satisfy those
    requests on behalf of the user agent. A client is connected to an Explicitly Authenticated
    Proxy through an authenticated TLS secured connection. This document describes
    a method for a user agent to automatically discover and authenticate, and for
    an user to provide consent for an Explicitly Authenticated Proxy. This enables
    proxied communication to be encrypted and authenticated, explicitly acknowledged
    by the user agent and visible to the server end point.</p>

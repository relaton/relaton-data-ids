  content: "   The Internet Core needs to be expandable to allow it to be usable on\n
    \  low-end devices with poor connectivity to be able to access internet\n   resources
    in a seamless way on the application layer. this concept\n   suggests that one
    way of how that can happen is through the stacking\n   and unstacking of bits
    on the physical and datalink layers.\n   Bycntainerising the input bytes into
    a bundle of 103bits and\n   unstaking them on the other end of the communication
    layer using a\n   different way f arrangement and encoding that can be interpreted
    by\n   another protocol on the network layer. this can run parallel to the\n   existing
    internet protocols and frameworks on the physical ,datalink\n   and network layers\n\n\t "

  content: "   RFC4552 describes how to provide authentication/confidentiality to
    \n   OSPFv3 using IPsec. It specifies that same IPsec SA parameters be \n   configured
    for both inbound and outbound SAs to provide the \"one to \n   many\" security
    for multicast OSPFv3 communications over broadcast \n   links (e.g., Ethernet).
    Manual keying is specified as the mandatory \n   and default group key management
    solution. However, issues of \n   scalability and security exist with manual keying.
    It is better to \n   replace manual keying with automated group key management.
    This \n   document discusses the requirements on OSPFv3 automated group key \n
    \  management, assuming that the centralized group key management \n   architecture
    introduced in [RFC4046] is used. \n\n\t "

  content: "   A three party, honest majority system provides the most efficient\n
    \  protocols for Multiparty Computation (MPC).  This document describes\n   a
    concrete instantiation of addition and multiplication protocols\n   that provide
    strong guarantees of security.  The multiplication\n   protocol provides low communication
    and computation costs, with\n   addition being almost free.  Any single dishonest
    party is detected\n   with high probability.\n\n\t "

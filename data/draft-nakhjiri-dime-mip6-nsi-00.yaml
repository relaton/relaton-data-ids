  content: "   Dime working group is designing a procedure for bootstrapping Mobile\n
    \  IPv6 using Diameter.  In order to reduce the complexity of Diameter\n   Mobile
    IPv6 application, the process of Mobile IPv6 service\n   authorization is being
    separated from the initial mobile node\n   authentication.  This This allows for
    outsourcing the authentication\n   process to another application such as Diameter
    EAP[RFC4072] .  The\n   process can have security considerations, if the authorizing
    server\n   does not have a clear assurance that the MN has actually been\n   authenticated
    before, especially if the authorizing server is\n   different from the authenticating
    server.  In this document we\n   provide a procedure and number of extensions
    to Mobile IPv6 and\n   Diameter signaling to address those considerations.  Specifically
    a\n   new Network Service Identifier (NSI) is defined to assist the\n   interaction
    between the authorizing and authenticating procedures and\n   servers.\n\t "

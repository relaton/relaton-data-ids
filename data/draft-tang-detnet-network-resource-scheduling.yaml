  content: "   Massive data processing and complex algorithm applications in the\n
    \  industrial Internet require a large amount of computing resources.\n   At the
    same time, real-time control requirements and production\n   safety requirements
    require network reliability and certainty.  This\n   draft proposes a service-oriented
    task process processing framework,\n   which divides the execution process of
    services into two stages,\n   namely resource orchestration of task flow and packet
    transmission\n   scheduling.  In order to obtain the optimal scheduling strategy,
    a\n   constrained optimization problem is developed, which aims to maximize\n
    \  the success rate of transmission scheduling while compromising load\n   balancing
    and resource utilization.  In order to improve the\n   reliability of the network,
    the TSN-5G converged network architecture\n   is used to transmit data packets.\n\n\t "

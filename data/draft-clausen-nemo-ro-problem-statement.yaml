  content: "The NEMO basic support specification is not limited to a single level\n
    \  of mobile networks attaching to the stationary Internet.  Rather,\n   arbitrary
    levels of nested mobile networks are supported, employing\n   for each level of
    nesting the same attachment, encapsulation and\n   tunnelling mechanisms.  With
    arbitrarily deep nested mobile networks,\n   paths taken by data traffic can be
    extremely sub-optimal both inside\n   the nested topology through successive mobile
    routers, and outside\n   the nested topology, through successive Home Agents over
    the\n   Internet.  Moreover, the overhead incurred through tunnelling and\n   encapsulation
    of data traffic can become prohibitively large.  This\n   document analyses the
    scenarios in which these problems are\n   particularly acute.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes mFCP, a UDP-based [UDP] implementation\nof the
    iFCP Fibre Channel Protocol [iFCP] over metro- and\nlocal-scale IP networks.  These
    networks are provisioned to\nhave latency, reliability, and performance levels
    comparable to\nthat of a Fibre Channel network. Storage devices use the Fibre\nChannel
    SCSI mapping in [FCP] for data transport and error\nrecovery.  mFCP leverages
    these existing mechanisms to\nfacilitate high-performance interconnection of Fibre
    Channel-\nbased storage devices over suitably provisioned IP networks. As\nin
    the case of iFCP, fibre channel frames may be transported\nnatively over such
    a network without Fibre Channel switching\nand routing elements.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a new Mechanism and DNS resource record (RR)\n
    \  type to carry information about energy-related characteristics for\n   end-to-end
    internet access.  The \"EE\" (\"Energy Efficiency\") record\n   allows the network
    to provide different levels of energy-saving\n   service.  By providing more energy
    information to the client before\n   it attempts to establish a connection, these
    records offer potential\n   benefits to enhancements on energy as service criteria.\n\n\t "

  content: "A message originator sometimes sends content in a form the recipient cannot
    process or would prefer not to process a form of lower quality than is preferred.
    \ Such content needs to be converted to an acceptable form, with the same information
    or constrained information (e.g., changing from color to black and white).  In
    a store-and-forward environment, it may be convenient to have this conversion
    performed by an intermediary.  This specification integrates two ESMTP extensions
    and three MIME content header fields, which defines a cooperative service that
    permits authorized, accountable content form conversion by intermediaries. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different\n   Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and\n   technologies, various
    qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the\n   OAM abbreviation.  While, at
    first glance, the most used appear to be\n   well understood, the same qualifier
    may be interpreted differently in\n   different contexts.  A case in point is
    the qualifiers \"in-band\" and\n   \"out-of-band\" which have their origins in
    the radio lexicon, and\n   which have been extrapolated into other communication
    networks.  This\n   document recommends not to use these two terms when referring
    to OAM.\n\n   This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that
    are\n   prepended, within the context of packet networks, to the OAM\n   abbreviation
    and lays out guidelines for their use in IETF documents.\n\n   This document extends
    RFC 6291 by adding to the guidelines for the\n   use of the term \"OAM\" with
    qualifiers.  It does not modify any part\n   of RFC 6291.\n\n\t "

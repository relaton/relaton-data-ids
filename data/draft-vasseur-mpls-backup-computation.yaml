  content: "This draft proposes an efficient model called ''Facility based \ncomputation
    model'' for computing bypass tunnels paths in the context of \nthe MPLS TE Fast
    Reroute, while allowing bandwidth sharing between \nbackup tunnel protecting independent
    resources. Both a centralized and \na distributed path computation scenarios are
    described. The required \nsignaling extensions are also addressed in the draft.\n\t "

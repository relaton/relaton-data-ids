  content: "Access concentrators that act as DHCP relay agents need to determine\nthe
    endpoint locations of IP addresses across public broadband access\nnetworks such
    as cable, DSL, and wireless networks. Because ARP\nbroadcasts are undesirable
    in public networks, many access\nconcentrator implementations 'glean' location
    information from DHCP\nmessages forwarded by its relay agent function. Unfortunately,
    the\ntypical access concentrator loses its gleaned information when the\naccess
    concentrator is rebooted or is replaced. This memo proposes\nthat when gleaned
    DHCP information is not available, the access\nconcentrator/relay agent obtains
    the location information directly\nfrom the DHCP server(s) using a new, lightweight
    DHCPLEASEQUERY\nmessage.\n\n\t "

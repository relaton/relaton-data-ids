  content: "    The Local (or Lightweight) Naming Protocol (LNP) is an application-\n
    \   level protocol for local area networks. It is a distributed,\n    stateless
    protocol which intents in resolving hostnames to ip\n    addresses without the
    need of any Domain Name Server. In private\n    local area networks, ip addressses
    are often dynamically allocated\n    through DHCP. The LNP can be seen as a DNS
    extension, which uses\n    broadcast udp messages (similar to ARP on IP-MAC-level)
    to request\n    ip addresses for hosts with a given host- or domain-name. Thus
    it\n    will be possible in dynamic local area networks to access ip-based\n    services
    on hosts by their hostnames, without further management.\n\n    Comments are solicited
    and should be addressed to the working\n    group's mailing list at dnsop@ietf.org
    and/or the author(s).\n\n\n\t "

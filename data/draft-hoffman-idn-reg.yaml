  content: "This document describes some suggested practices for registering\ninternationalized
    domain names (IDNs) in a zone. Before accepting\nregistrations of domain names
    into a zone, the zone's registry should\ndecide which codepoints in the Unicode
    character set the zone will\naccept. The registry should also decide whether particular
    characters in\na registered domain name should cause registration of multiple\nequivalent
    domain names; these domain names might be added to the zone\nor blocked from registration.
    This document also describes how to handle\ncharacter variants in registering
    IDNs, and how to publish tables that\nlist the character variants.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines a new RTP payload type for the insertion of \n       Forward
    Error Correction (FEC) in RTP. This solution is based on \n       Reed-Solomon
    codes that protect the transmission both from packet \n       losses and bit errors
    which may affect the communication over \n       wireless links. These codes are
    systematic, thus being completely \n       transparent to FEC unaware RTP clients.
    The new payload defined in \n       this draft and the insertion of RS codes are
    particularly suited for \n       H.264 video streaming. \n\n\t "

  content: "   Multipath TCP currently relies on the exchange of keys in clear\n   during
    the initial handshake to authenticate the establishment of\n   additional subflows.
    \ This document proposes a variant of the\n   Multipath TCP handshake that allows
    Multipath TCP to reuse keys\n   negotiated by the Application layer protocol above
    it such as SSL/TLS\n   to authenticate the establishment of additional subflows.\n\n\t "

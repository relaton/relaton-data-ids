  content: "   This document identifies a set of requirements to be taken into\n   consideration
    in the design of stateless 4/6 solutions.  In\n   particular, these requirements
    cover the way IPv4-embedded IPv6\n   address and prefix are to be built when embedding
    the port\n   information.\n\n   A companion effort, documented at\n   [I-D.bsd-softwire-stateless-port-index-analysis],
    is required to\n   converge on one or a set of algorithms to be used by all stateless\n
    \  solutions.\n\n\t "

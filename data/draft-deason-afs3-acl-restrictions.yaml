  content: "The AFS-3 ACL 'a' bit gives users unfettered power to grant, or\nrevoke,
    privileges, with no provision for enforcing site policy.\nThis memo provides several
    alternative mechanisms for creating\nrestrictions on what powers the 'a' bit denotes.
    \ Three alternative\nmechanisms for restricting the power of the 'a' bit are proposed:
    a\nmethod for overlaying the ACL with a site-controlled ACL; a method\nfor masking
    the ACL with a site-controlled privilege mask; and a\nfinely granular meta-acl
    mechanism for restricting to whom privileges\nmay be delegated, and which privileges
    may be given to different\nclasses of principals.  This memo will serve as a basis
    for the ACL\nrestriction discussion with the AFS-3 protocol working group.  The\nintended
    goal of this discussion is to reach consensus on\nstandardization of one or more
    solutions, and then publish a BCP\nstatus memo.\n\t "

  content: "   Power consumption in multicast replication operations is an area of\n
    \  concern and choosing suitable replication points that can decrease\n   power
    consumption overall assumes importance. Multicast replication\n   capacity is
    an attribute of every line card of major routers and\n   multi-layer switches
    that support multicast in the core of an\n   Internet Service Provider (ISP) or
    an enterprise network.\n\n   Currently multicast replication points on Point-to-Multipoint\n
    \  Multicast Distribution trees consume power while delivering multiple\n   output
    streams of data from a given input stream. The multicast\n   distribution trees
    are constructed without any regard for a proper\n   placement of the replication
    points and consequent optimal power\n   consumption at these points.\n\n   This
    results in overloading certain routers while under-utilizing\n   others. An optimal
    usage of these replication resources could reduce\n   power consumption on these
    routers bringing power consumption to\n   optimality. In this paper, we propose
    a mechanism by which Multicast\n   Distribution Trees are constructed for carrying
    multicast traffic\n   across multiple routers within a given network. We propose
    that these\n   Multicast Distribution Trees be built by using the information\n
    \  pertaining to power-replication capacity ratio available with fine\n   grained
    components such as multicast capable line-cards of routers\n   and multi-layer
    switches deployed within a network.\n\n\n\t "

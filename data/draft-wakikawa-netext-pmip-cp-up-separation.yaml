  content: "   This document describes splitting of Control Plane (CP) and User\n
    \  Plane (UP) for a Proxy Mobile IPv6 based network infrastructure.\n   Existing
    specifications allow a MAG to perform splitting of its\n   control and user plane
    using Alternate Care of address mobility\n   option for IPv6, or Alternate IPv4
    Care of Address option for IPv4.\n   However, the current specification does not
    have semantics for\n   allowing the LMA to perform such functional split.  To
    realize this\n   requirement, this specification defines a mobility option that\n
    \  enables a local mobility anchor to provide an alternate LMA address\n   to
    be used for the bi-directional tunnel between the MAG and LMA.\n   With this extension,
    a local mobility anchor will be able to use an\n   IP address for its user plane
    which is different than what is used\n   for the control plane.\n\n\t "

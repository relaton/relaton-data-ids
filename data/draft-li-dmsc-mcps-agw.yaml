  content: "   This document specifies a Multi-agent Collaboration Protocol Suite\n
    \  based on Agent Gateway, which enables scalable, secure, and\n   semantically
    driven collaboration among distributed agents across\n   heterogeneous networks.
    \ The protocol suite introduces Agent Gateways\n   as control-plane entities responsible
    for agent registration,\n   authentication, capability management, semantic routing
    and other\n   functions, while preserving direct peer-to-peer semantic interactions\n
    \  among agents.\n\n\t "

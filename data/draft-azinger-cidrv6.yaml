  content: "This document discusses strategies for assigning and aggregating IPv6\naddress
    space.  While CIDR was created to help alleviate this problem\nin regards to IPv4
    addresses with the original [RFC1519] (and updated\nin [RFC4632]) we are now in
    need of a similar document to give\ndirection for IPv6 addressing policies.  Similarly,
    [RFC1518]\ndiscussed how to use CIDR to allocate address space for IPv4, and\n[RFC1887]
    discusses the subject for IPv6.  The objective here is to\nupdate these documents
    and provide the best current guidance on how\nto manage address space in conjunction
    with managing the growth of\nrouting tables in an IPv6 world.\n\t "

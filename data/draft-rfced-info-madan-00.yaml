  content: "   The BOOTP [1] or the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [2]\n
    \  provide a framework for booting a host over a network from a remote\n   server.
    This document defines a new option which a BOOTP/DHCP client\n   may include in
    its BOOTP request or DHCPDISCOVER message. In their\n   replies, the  recipient
    servers may include this option  along with\n   the location/path information
    to a file ('boot.info') in the option\n   field. The client may use the contents
    of this file to select the\n   desired  OS  with which to boot along with the
    location/path of the\n   appropriate boot image file.\n\t "

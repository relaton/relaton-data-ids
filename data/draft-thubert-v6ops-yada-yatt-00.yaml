  content: "   This document provides a mechanism named YADA to extend the current\n
    \  IPv4 Internet by interconnecting IPv4 realms via a common footprint\n   called
    the shaft.  YADA extends [INT-ARCHI] with the support of an\n   IP-in-IP format
    used to tunnel packets across the shaft.  This\n   document also provides a bump-in-the-stack
    method to enable YADA on a\n   legacy stack, e.g., to enable virtual machines
    without changing them.\n   This document also provides a stateless address and
    IP header\n   translation between YADA and IPv6 [IPv6] called YATT and extends\n
    \  [IPv6-addressING] for the YATT format.  YATT can take place as a bump\n   in
    the stack at either end, or within the network and enables an\n   IPv6-only stack
    to dialog with an IPv4-only stack across a network\n   that can be IPv6, IPv4,
    or mixed.  YATT requires that the IPv6 stack\n   owns a prefix that derives from
    a YADA address and the IPv4 stack is\n   capable of YADA, so it does not replace
    a generic 4 to 6 translation\n   mechanism for any v6 to any v4.\n\n\t "

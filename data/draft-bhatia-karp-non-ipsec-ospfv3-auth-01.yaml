  script: Latn
  content: "      Currently a few routing protocols use IPSec for authenticating \n
    \     their protocol packets. There are known issues with using IPSec \n      with
    the routing protocols and this draft proposes an \n      alternative Generic Authentication
    mechanism that can be used so \n      that these protocols do not depend upon
    IPSec for security. The \n      mechanism introduced in this draft is generic
    and can be used by \n      any protocol that currently uses IPSec for authentication.
    \n\n      While this mechanism is generic, this draft specifically looks \n      at
    OSPFv3 and how it can use the mechanism described herein. \n\t "

  content: "   ANIMA defined Autonomic Service Agent to build intelligent management\n
    \  functions into network devices, and could interact with each other\n   through
    a standard protocol (aka GRASP).With the rapid advancement of\n   Large Language
    Model (LLM)-driven AI technologies, there is now a\n   potential opportunity to
    enhance the ASA to be AI-powered, thereby\n   elevating the intelligence of device-built-in
    management functions to\n   a whole new level.This document analyzes the impact
    of the AI-powered\n   ASA, mostly from the perspective of the ASA communication
    protocol.\n\n\t "

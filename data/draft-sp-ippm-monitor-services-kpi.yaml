  content: "   We are introducing a new method to calculate services KPIs and\n   metrics
    in the network using TWAMP protocol.  The services here\n   ranging from subscriber
    aware services to security application,\n   Traffic load balancing, content delivery,
    real time streaming and\n   like.The KPIs discussed in this draft include Service
    Latency,\n   Serviced Packets Count, Serviced Subscriber Count, Application\n
    \  Liveliness and Session load per Service.  KPIs monitoring of these\n   services
    therefore, play a vital role in optimum usage of network\n   resources such as
    capacity and throughput.  Once we have the\n   attributes like service latency,
    the network topology can be chosen\n   to provide better quality of experience
    to the end user.  For\n   different services, the attributes may vary and our
    design takes care\n   of supporting different KPIs for different services model.\n
    \  Additionally, liveliness of application and servers can be monitored\n   using
    this proposed solution.\n\n\t "

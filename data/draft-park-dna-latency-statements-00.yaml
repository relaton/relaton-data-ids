  content: "In DNA for movement either within a subnet or to different network, \nvarious
    latencies are happened on network devices both host and \nrouter.  This document
    tries to analyze what latencies are possible \nwhen performing DNA operations.
    \ This statement is targeted to \nDetecting Network Attachment (DNA) as well as
    to Mobile IPv6.\n\t "

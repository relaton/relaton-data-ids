  content: "Label Switched Path Ping (LSP ping) is an existing and widely deployed
    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism for Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  This document describes extensions
    to LSP ping so that LSP ping can be used for on-demand connectivity verification
    of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) LSPs and pseudowires.  This document also
    clarifies procedures to be used for processing the related OAM packets.  Further,
    it describes procedures for using LSP ping to perform connectivity verification
    and route tracing functions in MPLS-TP networks.  Finally, this document updates
    RFC 4379 by adding a new address type and creating an IANA registry. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

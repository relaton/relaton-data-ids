  content: "This document proposes TCP-DCR, a simple modification to the TCP\ncongestion
    control algorithm to make it more robust to non-congestion\nevents. In the absence
    of explicit notification from the network, the\nTCP congestion control algorithm
    treats the receipt of three\nduplicate acknowledgements as an indication of congestion
    in the\nnetwork. This is not always correct, notably so in wireless networks\nwith
    channel errors or networks prone to excessive packet reordering,\nresulting in
    degraded performance. TCP-DCR aims to remedy this by\ndelaying the congestion
    response of TCP for a short interval of time\ntau, thereby creating room to handle
    any non-congestion events that\nmay have occurred. If at the end of the delay
    tau, the event is not\nhandled, then it is treated as a congestion loss. The modifications\nthemselves
    do not handle the non-congestion event, but rather rely on\nsome underlying mechanism
    to do this. This document discusses the\nimplications of delaying congestion response
    on the fairness, TCP-\ncompatibility and network dynamics, and the benefits to
    be gained by\napplying the TCP-DCR modifications to TCP.\n\t "

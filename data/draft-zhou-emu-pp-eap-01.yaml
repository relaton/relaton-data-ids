  content: "   This document defines the Protected Password-based Extensible\n   Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) method.  PP-EAP is an EAP method that\n   enables secure exchange
    of password authentication mechanisms between\n   a peer and an EAP server by
    using the Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n   to establish a server-authenticated
    TLS tunnel.  Within the tunnel,\n   Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used to
    convey password-based\n   authentication between the peer and the EAP server.\n\n\t "

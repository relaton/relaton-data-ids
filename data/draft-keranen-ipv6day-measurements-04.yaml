  content: "During World IPv6 Day on June 8, 2011, several key content providers enabled
    their networks to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 services.  Hundreds of organizations
    participated in this effort, and in the months and weeks leading up to the event
    worked hard on preparing their networks to support this event.  The event was
    largely unnoticed by the general public, which is a good thing since it means
    that no major problems were detected.  For the Internet, however, there was a
    major change on a short timescale.  This memo discusses measurements that the
    authors made from the perspective of an end user with good IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.
    \ Our measurements include the number of most popular networks providing AAAA
    records for their service, as well as delay and connection failure statistics.\n\t "

  content: "This note is intended to flesh out a comment made on a mailing list.\nIt
    describes one of many possible implementation approaches to SAVI\nsystems, and
    is intended as much as anything to be an existence proof\nthat there is at least
    one that would work.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].\n\t "

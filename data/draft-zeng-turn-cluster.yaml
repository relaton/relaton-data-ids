  content: "   The TURN protocol is designed to solve the connectivity problem of\n
    \  Peer-to-Peer Communication when NAT devices exist, by allowing each\n   peer
    to establish a data channel on TURN servers.  Since there are\n   some specific
    requirements in the use of TURN, such as RTP/RTCP\n   connection pairs must be
    sent to the same TURN server, it is not easy\n   to scale a single TURN server
    into a TURN cluster.  In addition, a\n   TURN service cluster also needs to consider
    how to achieve good load\n   balancing and how to protect internal information
    security.  Based on\n   these demands, this specification provides several standard
    means to\n   implement a functional and secure TURN cluster, and this\n   specification
    also provides an overview and rationale of the cluster\n   architecture.\n\n\t "

  content: "        The current SDP Capability Negotiation solution includes the ability
    \n        for a potential configuration to delete and replace individual \n        attributes
    from the actual configuration. This capability introduces \n        some complexity
    into the SDP Capability Negotiation framework and \n        this document examines
    the need for having this feature and proposes \n        a way forward.  \n\n\n\t "

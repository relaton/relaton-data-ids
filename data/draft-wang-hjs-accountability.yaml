abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines HJS (Human Judgment System), a standalone accountability
    layer for AI agents. HJS provides four primitives (Judgment/Delegation/Termination/Verification)
    for recording complete responsibility chains, and uses OTS (Open Timestamp) proofs
    anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain to create immutable, court- admissible evidence.
    While HJS can complement other protocols (e.g., AIIP) by providing the evidence
    they require, it is designed to be independent and usable with any AI agent communication
    framework.</p>"

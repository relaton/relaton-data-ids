  content: "RFC 3178 [1] describes a solution to provide site multi-homing\nsupport
    in IPv6. RFC 3178 multi-homing solution uses tunnels between\nthe different ISPs
    and the multi-homed site to provide alternative\npaths in case that one of the
    exit links is down, protecting the\nmulti-homed site from outages in the direct
    link with its providers.\n\nHowever, the wide adoption of RFC 3178 multi-homing
    solution implies\nthe manual configuration of numerous tunnels on the ISPs, which
    may\nimpose an important workload in ISP network administrators. This note\nproposes
    the usage of Multi-Homing Tunnel Brokers to automatically\nconfigure the ISP tunnel
    endpoint in order to ease the adoption of\nthe solution.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Recently, transferring the signaling of mobile network over IP\n   attracts
    lots of attention from people.  Telephone number based on\n   E.164 or E.214 or
    SP is the traditional routing address for mobile\n   network, but actually, E.164,
    E.214 and SP is not supported by MP-BGP\n   protocol.\n\n   This document presents
    a new way to support for routing the phone\n   number based on E.164, E.214 or
    SP though MP-BGP, by extending the\n   MP-BGP for the Phone Number Routing.  It
    can bring optimizing for the\n   network architecture and improving efficiency.\n\n\t "

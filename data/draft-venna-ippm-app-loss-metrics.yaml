  content: "Using the one-way loss pattern metrics defined in RFC 3357, this \n    document
    defines two new metrics Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss \n    and Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received
    to provide a better \n    understanding of the affects of packet loss at the application
    \n    level. The statistic Type-P-One-Way-Errored-Seconds is derived from \n    the
    above metrics to compute the affect of packet loss at the \n    application level.\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "This document attempts to identify the requirements for a protocol \nframework
    to provide SIP user and device profiles to SIP user \nagents.  The objective is
    not to invent new special purpose \nprotocols, but to identify the requirements
    such that a rational \ndecision can be made as to what existing protocol(s) should
    be used \nto solve the problem of providing user and device profiles to SIP \nuser
    agents.  This document also contains an evaluation of a set of \napplicable protocols.\n\t "

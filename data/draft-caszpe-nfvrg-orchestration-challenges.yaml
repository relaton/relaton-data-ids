  content: "   Network function virtualization (NFV) promises improved operations
    in\n   terms of flexibility, efficiency, and manageability, but\n   orchestration,
    in general, and recursive orchestration, in\n   particular, is still an item of
    ongoing research.  We summarize the\n   current state of the art in open-source
    initiatives in this area and\n   present current directions of research and development
    in terms of\n   orchestration, resource decomposition and federation, policy-based\n
    \  resource management, measurement and analytics, and virtual network\n   function
    (VNF) elasticity.\n\n\t "

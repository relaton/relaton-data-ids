  content: "   This draft documents requirements in several diverse industries to\n
    \  establish multi-hop paths for characterized flows with deterministic\n   properties.
    \ In this context deterministic implies that streams can\n   be established which
    provide guaranteed bandwidth and latency which\n   can be established from either
    a Layer 2 or Layer 3 (IP) interface,\n   and which can co-exist on an IP network
    with best-effort traffic.\n\n   Additional requirements include optional redundant
    paths, very high\n   reliability paths, time synchronization, and clock distribution.\n
    \  Industries considered include wireless for industrial applications,\n   professional
    audio, electrical utilities, building automation\n   systems, radio/mobile access
    networks, automotive, and gaming.\n\n   For each case, this document will identify
    the application, identify\n   representative solutions used today, and what new
    uses an IETF DetNet\n   solution may enable.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as \"Intent Driven\n
    \  Service Mapping\" to express association of overlay routes with\n   underlay
    routes satisfying a certain SLA using BGP.  The document\n   describes a framework
    for classifying underlay routes into transport\n   classes and mapping service
    routes to specific transport class.\n\n   The \"Transport class\" construct maps
    to a desired SLA and can be used\n   to realize the \"Topology Slice\" in 5G Network
    slicing architecture.\n\n   This document specifies BGP protocol procedures that
    enable\n   dissemination of such service mapping information that may span\n   multiple
    cooperating administrative domains.  These domains may be\n   administetered by
    the same provider or by closely co-ordinating\n   provider networks.\n\n   A new
    BGP transport layer address family (SAFI 76) is defined for\n   this purpose that
    uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI\n   encoding.  This new address
    family is called \"BGP Classful\n   Transport\", aka BGP CT.\n\n   BGP CT makes
    it possible to advertise multiple tunnels to the same\n   destination address,
    thus avoiding need of multiple loopbacks on the\n   egress node.\n\n   It carries
    transport prefixes across tunnel domain boundaries (e.g.\n   in Inter-AS Option-C
    networks), which is parallel to BGP LU (SAFI 4)\n   .  It disseminates \"Transport
    class\" information for the transport\n   prefixes across the participating domains,
    which is not possible with\n   BGP LU.  This makes the end-to-end network a \"Transport
    Class\" aware\n   tunneled network.\n\n   Though BGP CT family is used only in
    the option-C inter-AS neworks,\n   the Service Mapping procedures described in
    this document apply in\n   the same manner to Intra-AS service end points as well
    as Inter-AS\n   option-A, option-B and option-C variations.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Transmission of voice, video and other  real-time multimedia\ndata over
    IP networks is gaining much importance, and Quality of\nService (QoS) issues are
    further compromised when wireless and \nmobility issues are also included into
    the picture. A unified \napproach, VoMo, to addressing QoS through consideration
    of \nappropriate signaling, control and data transmission is presented, \nthat
    has the additional benefits of compliance with current IP \nnetwork infrastructure
    through recently proposed IETF protocols, such\nas Stream Control Tranmission
    Protocol (SCTP)[RFC2960] and Session \nInitiation Protocol (SIP)[RFC2543]. \n\n\t "

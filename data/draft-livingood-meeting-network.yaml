  content: "   IETF participants need a highly reliable and responsive network, with\n
    \  sufficient bandwidth to avoid congestion, that enables work to be\n   conducted
    without interruption or network limitation during an IETF\n   meeting.  Such a
    network enables in-person network attendees to get\n   their work done.  It also
    enables remote participants to have a good\n   experience as well, via remote
    participation in working group\n   meetings.  This document makes suggestions
    about how to reduce\n   complexity, reduce cost, and increase reliability of the
    IETF meeting\n   network, which may be helpful in community discussion.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that\n
    \  foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these\n   systems
    is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords,\n   cryptographic
    keys, and similar values. The use of pseudo-random\n   processes to generate secret
    quantities can result in pseudo-\n   security.  For example, the sophisticated
    attacker of these security\n   systems may find it easier to reproduce the environment
    that produced\n   the secret quantities, searching a resulting small set of\n
    \  possibilities, than to locate the quantities in the whole of the\n   potential
    number space.\n\n   Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated\n
    \  adversary can be surprisingly difficult. This document points out\n   many
    pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-\n   random number
    generation techniques for generating such quantities.\n   It recommends the use
    of multiple sources with a strong mixing\n   function, so that no single source
    need be fully trusted, and\n   provides techniques for extending a random seed
    to a larger quantity\n   of pseudo-random material in a cryptographically secure
    way. And it\n   gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some\n
    \  applications. This document obsoletes RFC 4086.\n\n\n\t "

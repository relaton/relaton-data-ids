  content: "   This document describes a Network Coding (NC) based broadcast\n   protocol
    suitable mainly for wireless networks, including mobile ad\n   hoc networks (MANET).
    \ It provides data dissemination from a single\n   source, based on intra-flow
    network coding and for Internet Protocol\n   (IP).  It is designed to minimize
    the assumptions over the working\n   environment and thus may operates over dynamically
    evolving\n   environments.\n\n\t "

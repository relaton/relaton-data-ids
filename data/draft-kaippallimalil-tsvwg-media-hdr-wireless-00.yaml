  content: "   Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant\n
    \  variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless\n   channel
    conditions, interference, or the end-user's movement.  These\n   variations in
    capacity take place in the order of hundreds of\n   milliseconds and is much too
    fast for end-to-end congestion signaling\n   by itself to convey the changes.
    \ Media applications on the other\n   hand demand both high throughput and low
    latency, and are able to\n   dynamically adjust the size and quality of a stream
    to match\n   available network bandwidth.  However, catering to such media flows\n
    \  over a radio link where the capacity changes rapidly requires the\n   buffers
    to be managed carefully.  This draft proposes additional\n   information about
    the media transported in each packet to manage the\n   buffers and optimize the
    scheduling of radio resources.  The set of\n   information proposed here includes
    relative importance of the packet,\n   burst length and timestamp to be conveyed
    by the media application in\n   a header extension.  This can be used to provide
    the wireless network\n   the flexibility to prioritize packets that are essential
    when the\n   radio capacity is temporarily low, defer packets that can tolerate\n
    \  some additional delay, or even drop packets selectively in more\n   extreme
    conditions.\n\n   Another aspect considered here is the means by which the media
    packet\n   information is transported.  Potential solutions include carrying\n
    \  this information in Media over QUIC extension headers, UDP options,\n   or
    in a MASQUE encapsulation between the application server and\n   wireless network
    entity.\n\n\t "

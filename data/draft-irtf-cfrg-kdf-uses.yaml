  content: "This note surveys the existing designs for Key Derivation Functions\n(KDFs),
    the purposes for which they are used, and their security and\nusability goals.
    \ Importantly, some important protocols use KDFs for\nmultiple purposes.  We offer
    conclusions to guide future standards\nwork and research on KDFs.\n\t "

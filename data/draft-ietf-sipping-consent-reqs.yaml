  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports communications across many
    media types, including real-time audio, video, text, instant messaging, and presence.
    \ In its current form, it allows session invitations, instant messages, and other
    requests to be delivered from one party to another without requiring explicit
    consent of the recipient.  Without such consent, it is possible for SIP to be
    used for malicious purposes, including spam and denial-of-service attacks.  This
    document identifies a set of requirements for extensions to SIP that add consent-based
    communications.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

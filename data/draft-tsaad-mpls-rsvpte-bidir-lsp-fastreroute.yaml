  content: "   This document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions to support Fast\n
    \  Reroute (FRR) of bidirectional co-routed Traffic Engineering (TE)\n   LSPs.
    These extensions enable the re-direction of bi-directional\n   traffic and signaling
    onto bypass tunnels that ensure co-routedness\n   of data and signaling paths
    in the forward and reverse directions\n   after FRR. In addition, the RSVP-TE
    signaling extensions allow the\n   coordination of bypass tunnel assignment protecting
    a common facility\n   in both forward and reverse directions prior to or post
    failure\n   occurrence.\n\n\n\t "

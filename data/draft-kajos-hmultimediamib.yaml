  content: "This Recommendation describes the Multimedia Management Information Base
    for H.323 and H.320 Multimedia Terminals. The purpose of HMultimediaMIB is to
    \ standardize the management information in multimedia conferencing systems based
    on one of more of the ITU-T H-series recommendations.  \n\nThe goal of Multimedia
    Management is to provide the appropriate level \nof management support for the
    particular Multimedia device. Multimedia \nmanagement must permit the resources
    that are being used by individual \nMultimedia sessions to be identified for the
    purposes of fault detection, fault isolation, performance monitoring, configuration
    management, and capacity analyses.  Multimedia management is \napplicable to both
    intermediate-system as well as end-system \nMultimedia devices such as terminals,
    multipoint control \nunits (MCUs), gatekeepers, and gateways.\n\t "

  content: "   A BGP speaker may perform RPKI origin validation not only on routes\n
    \  received from BGP neighbors and routes that are redistributed from\n   other
    routing protocols, but also on routes it sends to BGP\n   neighbors.  For egress
    policy, it is important that the\n   classification uses the effective origin
    AS of the processed route,\n   which may specifically be altered by the commonly
    available knobs\n   such as removing private ASs, confederation handling, and
    other\n   modifications of the origin AS.\n\n\n\t "

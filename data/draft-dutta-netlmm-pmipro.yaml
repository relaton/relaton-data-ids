  content: "This draft describes a light weight route optimization technique that\nhelps
    to optimize the media path between two communicating nodes when\nProxy MIP is
    used as the mobility protocol.  This routing\noptimization technique is most useful
    when the two communicating\nhosts are away from home and need to communicate with
    each other\nusing an optimized path.  It takes advantage of the data packet\nbetween
    LMA and MAG to set up the optimized data path between the\ncommunicating hosts.
    \ This route optimization technique is applicable\nto both the intra-LMA and inter-LMA
    scenarios.\n\t "

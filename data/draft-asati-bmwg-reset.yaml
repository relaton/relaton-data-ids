  content: "An operational forwarding device may need to be re-started\n(automatically
    or manually) for a variety of reasons, an event that\nwe call a \"reset\" in this
    document. Since there may be an\ninterruption in the forwarding operation during
    a reset, it is\nuseful to know how long a device takes to begin forwarding packets\nagain.\n\nThis
    document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset\nduring benchmarking
    of forwarding devices, and provides clarity and\nconsistency in reset test procedures
    beyond what's specified in\nRFC2544. It therefore updates RFC2544.\n\t "

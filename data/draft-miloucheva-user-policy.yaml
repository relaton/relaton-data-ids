  content: "This document presents a framework for user-centric Quality of \n   Service
    (QoS) management in heterogeneous Internet environments\n   (considering fixed,
    mobile and broadcast networks). \n   The framework is based on dynamic business
    level QoS policy \n   specification by different actors  (such as users, operators
    \n   and administrators), as well as hierarchical policy refinement\n   and translation,
    supporting the automated configuration of QoS\n   mechanisms at heterogeneous
    network and transport entities.\n\nThe hierarchical policy approach involves abstractions
    and mapping  \n   of policies described at business, unified, operational and
    \n   configuration level considering networks with different capabilities\n   and
    QoS requirements of different actors. \n   The policy specification is dependent
    on the Service \n   Level Agreements (SLAs) of the particular actors. \n   This
    allows controlled and restricted usage of the network \n   resources by the actors
    according to the actor dependencies and \n   corresponding SLA rules.    \n\n
    \  The policy management framework includes components for dynamic \n   actor-based
    QoS policy specification, policy consistency check\n   and dependency analysis
    regarding SLAs, automated policy \n   provisioning and configuration at heterogeneous
    transport and \n   network entities, policy monitoring and performance \n   assessment,
    as well as automated adaptation of QoS mechanisms at \n   operational level.  \n
    \  Policy enforcement combined with policy monitoring and performance\n   assessment
    is considered, as well as automated adaptation of \n   policy parameters (e.g.
    operational policies) based on policy \n   performance analysis. \n \n   Interactions
    of components for policy specification and automated\n   provisioning are based
    on policy repository storing the unified \n   (intermediate) policy representations
    describing policy parameters, \n   conditions and actions.\n\t "

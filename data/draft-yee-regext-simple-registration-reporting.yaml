  content: "   Domain name registries and registrars report to each other by sharing\n
    \  bulk information through files.  This document creates two IANA\n   registries
    to create a standard reporting mechanism between domain\n   name registries and
    registrars.  The first IANA registry lists\n   standard data elements and their
    syntax for inclusion in the files.\n   The second IANA registry lists standard
    reports based on the standard\n   data elements.  Each report is a file formatted
    as a CSV file.  The\n   advantage of this reporting mechanism is that reports,
    each file, can\n   be imported by recipients without any prior knowledge of their\n
    \  contents, although reporting is enhanced with a minimum of knowledge\n   about
    the files.  The mechanism for the transmission and reception of\n   the files
    is a matter of local policy.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In an EVPN network, EVPN PEs provide VPN bridging and routing service\n
    \  to connected CE devices based on BGP EVPN control plane. At present,\n   there
    is no PE-CE control plane defined for an EVPN PE to learn CE\n   MAC, IP, and
    any other routes from a CE that may be distributed in\n   EVPN control plane to
    enable unicast flows between CE devices. As a\n   result, EVPN PEs rely on data
    plane based gleaning of source MACs for\n   CE MAC learning, ARP/ND snooping for
    CE IPv4/IPv6 learning, and in\n   some cases, local configuration for learning
    prefix routes behind a\n   CE. A PE-CE control plane alternative to this traditional
    learning\n   approach, where applicable, offers certain distinct advantages that\n
    \  in turn result in simplified EVPN operation.\n\n   This document defines a
    PE-CE control plane as an optional\n   alternative to traditional non-control-plane
    based PE-CE learning in\n   an EVPN network. It defines PE-CE control plane procedures
    and TLVs\n   based on L3DL as the base protocol, enumerates advantages that may
    be\n   achieved by using this PE-CE control plane, and discusses in detail\n   EVPN
    use cases that are simplified as a result.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) makes use of signed\n
    \  objects called manifests.  A manifest lists each file that a\n   publisher
    intends to include within an RPKI repository, and can be\n   used to detect certain
    forms of attack against a repository.\n   Manifests include a \"manifest number\"
    (manifestNumber), which the\n   publisher must increment whenever it issues a
    new manifest, and\n   Relying Parties (RPs) are required to verify that a newly-retrieved\n
    \  manifest for a given Certification Authority (CA) has a higher\n   manifestNumber
    than the previously-validated manifest.  However, the\n   manifestNumber field
    is 20 octets in length (i.e. not unbounded), and\n   no behaviour is specified
    for when a manifestNumber reaches the\n   largest possible value.  This document
    specifies publisher and RP\n   behaviour for this scenario.\n\n\t "

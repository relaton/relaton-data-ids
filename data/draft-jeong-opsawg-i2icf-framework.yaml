  content: "   This document specifies a framework to define Interface to In-Network\n
    \  Computing Functions (I2ICF) for user services both on the network-\n   level
    and application-level.  In-Network Computing Functions (ICF)\n   include In-Network
    Network Functions (INF), defined in the context of\n   Network Functions Virtualization
    (NFV) and Software-Defined\n   Networking (SDN).  ICFs also include In-Network
    Application Functions\n   (IAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things
    (IoT)\n   Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial\n   Vehicles
    (UAV).  This document describes an I2ICF framework, which\n   includes components
    and interfaces to configure and monitor the ICFs\n   that implement applications
    and services.\n\n\t "

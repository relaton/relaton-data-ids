  content: "   There exists a class of devices where DLEP functionality is desired\n
    \  but as the devices operate at layer-3, supporting the core DLEP\n   specification
    with its requirement that modems operate as transparent\n   layer-2 bridges is
    inappropriate.\n\n   This document introduces two optional extensions to the core
    DLEP\n   specification.  Each extension may be used in isolation without\n   breaking
    backwards compatibility.\n\n   By relaxing the requirement that all DLEP destinations
    be identified\n   by MAC address, and the addition of a new extension TLV describing\n
    \  available destination routes, the functionality of DLEP can be\n   implemented
    by layer-3 forwarding devices.\n\n   Note:\n\n   o  This document is intended
    as an extension to the core DLEP\n      specification, and readers are expected
    to be fully conversant\n      with the operation of core DLEP.\n\n   o  The DLEP
    specification is still in draft, and this document serves\n      a secondary purpose
    to explore and validate the extension\n      mechanisms detailed in DLEP.  This
    document will therefore require\n      further update as the core DLEP draft progresses
    towards standards\n      track.\n\n\t "

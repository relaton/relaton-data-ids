  content: "   HTTP/3 was initially specified only for use with the QUIC version 1\n
    \  transport protocol.  This specification defines how to use HTTP/3\n   over
    a WebTransport session, which can be implemented using any\n   WebTransport protocol.
    \ This enables operation of HTTP/3 when UDP\n   based transport is not available,
    as well as server-initiated HTTP/3\n   requests.\n\n\t "

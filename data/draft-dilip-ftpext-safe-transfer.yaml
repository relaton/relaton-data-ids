  content: "    This draft presents a mechanism to overcome one of the cumbersome
    \n    aspects of file transfer. Ftp fails to transfer the data as there\n    is
    not enough disk space on the remote machine, but it fails only\n    after it does
    the substantial data transfer and discovers that \n    there is no more disk space
    left on the remote machine. \n    \n    The basic intention is to provide FTP
    Extension for checking the \n    availability of the disk space before starting
    the actual file \n    transfer operation on remote machines.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a mapping of protocols defined by the Abstract
    Service Description Conventions onto Connection Oriented Transport Service, Connectionless
    Transport Service, TCP, and UDP [MHS88b].  This mapping will support all ROS (Remote
    Operation Service) based protocols, such as directory, both with and without use
    of RTS (Reliable Transfer Service), and all of the X.400 services [ISO88, CCI88,
    MHS88a].            Four example applications of the Simple OSI Stack (SOS) are
    given in appendices.  These are all ``real'' examples, which will are quite likely
    to evolve into formal specifications.  They are intended to show that specification
    of SOS applications is very straightforward and useful.  These examples will be
    dropped from future versions of this document, and perhaps be replaced by artificial
    examples.\n\t "

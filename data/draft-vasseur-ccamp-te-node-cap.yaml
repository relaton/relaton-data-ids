  content: "It is highly desired in several cases, to take into account Traffic \n
    \  Engineering (TE) node capabilities during TE LSP path selection, such \n   as
    for instance the capability to act as a branch LSR of a P2MP LSP. \n   This requires
    advertising these capabilities within the IGP. \n   For that purpose, this document
    specifies OSPF and IS-IS traffic \n   engineering extensions for the advertisement
    of control plane and \n   data plane traffic engineering node capabilities.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a mechanism to avoid blackholing of IP \nMulticast
    traffic due to the disruption of multicast tree during the \ntime when the RPF
    neighbor is yet to become the PIM neighbor. Such \nscenario is possible during
    the topology change (e.g. link UP) in an \nIP network that employs PIM-SM (or
    SSM) as the multicast routing \nprotocol and a unicast routing protocol (including
    static routing). \n\n \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nIn examples, \"C:\"
    and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and \nserver respectively. \n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].\n\t "

  content: "   The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized\n   experimental
    RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput\n   (L4S) and new Non-Queue-Building
    (NQB) per hop behavior.  These\n   documents do a good job of describing a new
    architecture and protocol\n   for deploying low latency networking.  But as is
    normal for many such\n   standards, especially those in experimental status, certain\n
    \  deployment design decisions are ultimately left to implementers.\n   This document
    explores the potential implications of key deployment\n   design decisions and
    makes recommendations for those decisions that\n   may help drive adoption.\n\n\t "

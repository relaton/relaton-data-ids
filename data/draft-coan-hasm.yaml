  content: "The HASM system addresses some of the current limitations of\nend-to-end
    secure multicast.  Specifically, the techniques used in\nHASM can achieve:  (1)
    multiple autonomous administrative units, each\nwith its own locally-managed authentication
    and authorization server,\n(2) efficiency in rekeying portions of a multicast
    group by using\nnetwork elements to translate between keys (all without trusting
    any\nsingle network element to securely manage message text in the clear),\nand
    (3) defense against denial-of-service attacks by using a secure\nextension of
    IGMP. The HASM system makes use of (1) network support,\nincluding extensions
    to the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP),\nextended firewall functionality,
    and router support for encryption and\ndecryption and (2) host operating system
    support, specifically\nextensions to IGMP.\n\n\t "

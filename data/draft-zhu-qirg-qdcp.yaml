abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Quantum Datagram protocol a lightweight
    transport protocol designed to operate over UDP in IP optical environments. QDCP
    (formerly QFCP) enables the transmission of control- plane parameters required
    for transporting quantum information and associated optical configurations, including
    polarization stabilization, timestamp alignment, ROADM port selection, and spectral
    parameters. The protocol uses a Type-Length- Value (TLV) structure to support
    versioning and extensibility and is prototyped for the transport of third-order
    nonlinear generated quantum information on IP optical infrastructure. This work
    is motivated by recent demonstrations of a classical-decisive quantum internet
    using integrated photonics.</p>"

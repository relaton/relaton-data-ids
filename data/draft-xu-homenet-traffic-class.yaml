  content: "   Home IT staff is generally unfamiliar with network operations, making\n
    \  it desirable to provide a configuration-free mode of operation.\n   Policy-based
    routing (in the sense of configuring one router to\n   redirect traffic to another
    based on access control) and multi-\n   topology routing both require configuration,
    making them undesirable.\n\n   In this document, we propose a configuration-free
    mechanism, in which\n   packets will be routed towards the corresponding upstream
    ISPs based\n   on both destination and source addresses.\n\n\t "

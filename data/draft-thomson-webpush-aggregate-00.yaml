abstract:
- content: "<p>The Web Push protocol provides a means of ensuring constant network
    availability of devices that would otherwise have limited availability. This document
    describes extensions to that protocol that enable the efficient delivery of messages
    to multiple devices. This allows an application to request that a web push server
    deliver the same message to a potentially large set of devices.</p>"

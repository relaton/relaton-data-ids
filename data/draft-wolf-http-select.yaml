  content: "Many Internet services need asynchronous notifications. At the same\ntime
    there is an increasing number of protocols which use HTTP or\nHTTP-alike request-response
    transactions.\nThis document proposes an extension to application protocols which\nenables
    asynchronous notifications from server to client through\nclient initiated request-response
    transactions. The extension applies\nthe Unix select() pattern to TCP connections
    of HTTP-alike protocols.\nHence it is called HTTP-SELECT.\n\t "

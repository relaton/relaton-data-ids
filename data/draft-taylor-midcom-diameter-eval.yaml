  content: "This document is submitted as part of the Midcom protocol selection \nprocess.
    \ It evaluates the suitability of the Diameter protocol as a \ntransport for Midcom.
    \ The general conclusions are:  \n.  the Diameter architecture may be too heavy
    for the Midcom \napplication, although this is a matter for discussion.  It is
    \nclear in any event that much of the Diameter base is not \nneeded; \n.  a new
    application extension to Diameter would have to be \ndefined to meet Midcom's
    requirements; \n.  with these reservations, the protocol is a good fit to Midcom
    \nrequirements. \nThis version contains added details describing how to use Diameter
    \nto meet the requirements. \n\n\t "

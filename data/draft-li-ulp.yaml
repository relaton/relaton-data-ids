  content: "This document specifies a payload format for generic forward error \ncorrection
    to achieve uneven level protection (ULP) of media \nencapsulated in RTP. It is
    an extension to the forward error correction \nscheme specified in RFC 2733 [1],
    and it is also based on the \nexclusive-or (parity) operation. The payload format
    allows end systems \nto transmit using arbitrary protection length and levels,
    in additional \nto using arbitrary block lengths. It also allows for the both
    complete \nrecovery of the critical payload and RTP header fields, and partial
    \nrecovery when complete recovery is not possible due to the packet lost \nsituation.
    This scheme is backward compatible with non-FEC capable \nhosts, and hosts that
    are only capable of FEC schemes specified in \nRFC2733 [1], so that receivers
    which do not wish to implement ULP \nforward error correction can just ignore
    the extensions.\n\t "

  content: "   Along as the popularization and adoption of IP in emerging scenarios,\n
    \  challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure.  To\n   enable
    TCP/IP in networks that previously using exclusive protocol, a\n   flexible address
    structure would be far more preferred for their\n   particular properties\n   [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure].\n\n
    \  This document describes a flexible address structure -- Flexible IP\n   (FlexIP)
    acting on limited domains [RFC8799].  FlexIP is expected to\n   proactively adapt
    scenarios under flexible address structure.\n   Meanwhile, FlexIP still benefit
    from global reachability based on the\n   IPv6 interoperability.\n\n\t "

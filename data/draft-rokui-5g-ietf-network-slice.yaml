  content: "   5G Network slicing is an approach to provide separate independent\n
    \  end-to-end logical network from User Equipment (UE) to various mobile\n   applications
    where each network slice has its own Service Level\n   Agreement (SLA) and Objectives
    (SLO) requirements.  Each end-to-end\n   network slice consists of a multitude
    of contexts across RAN, Core\n   and transport domains each with its own controller.
    \ To provide\n   automation, assurance and optimization of the 5G the network
    slices,\n   a 5G E2E network slice orchestrator is needed which interacts with\n
    \  controllers in RAN, Core and Transport network domains.  The\n   interfaces
    between the 5G E2E network slice orchestrator and RAN and\n   Core controllers
    are defined in various 3GPP technical\n   specifications.  However, 3GPP has not
    defined a similar interface\n   for transport network.\n\n   The aim of this document
    is to describe E2E network slicing and its\n   relation to \"IETF network slice\"
    for 5G use-case.  It also provides\n   an information model for control and mangement
    of IETF network slices\n   for 5G.\n\n\t "

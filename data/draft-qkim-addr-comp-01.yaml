- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The OSI service/protocol and Internet TCP/IP suite are typical \nprotocol
    architectures for data transport in computer communications.\nA protocol architecture
    designs its own addressing scheme to \ndistinguish communication objects.  The
    OSI domain has developed \nan addressing system based on ITU-T Recommendation
    X.200 | ISO/IEC \n7498 OSI Reference Model while the Internet has advertised its
    own \nway of addressing.  It is necessary to understand them and to \nanalyze
    the mapping relationship between them so that OSI services \nand protocols can
    be adapted over IP-based networks or a transport \nlayer protocol can be developed
    for both OSI and IP networks.\nAdditionally this memo can serve as a reference
    in order to produce \nan address interpretation scheme between SCN (Switched Circuit
    \nNetwork) and IP network.\n\n\t "

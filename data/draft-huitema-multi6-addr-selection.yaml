  content: "   This note presents mechanisms for address selection in hosts within
    a\n   multihomed site.  The goal of the presented mechanisms is to allow\n   hosts
    within the multihomed site to establish new communications\n   after an outage.
    \ The presented mechanisms are not by themselves a\n   complete multihoming solution
    but rather a component of such\n   solution.\n\t "

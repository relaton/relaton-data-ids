  content: "The operation of 6to4 routers require either that participation in \nIPv6
    inter-domain routing, or that the routers be provisioned with a \ndefault route.
    This memo proposes a standard method to define the \ndefault route. It requires
    that IANA assign a '6to4 Relay anycast \nprefix' from which 6to4 routers can derive
    the static '6to4 anycast \naddress'. In order to enable efficient management of
    the '6to4 Relay \nanycast prefix' in IPv4 inter-domain routing, this memo also
    \nrequests the reservation by IANA of a '6to4 Autonomous System ID.'\nWith this
    definition, the proposed scheme guarantees that 6to4 \npackets will be automatically
    routed to the nearest available \nrouter. It allows the managers of the 6to4 relay
    routers to control \nthe sources authorized to use their resource. It makes it
    easy to \nset up a large number of 6to4 relay routers, thus enabling \nscalability.\n\t "

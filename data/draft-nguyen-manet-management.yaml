  content: "   This document aims at providing an extended architecture, use case\n
    \  and applicability statement for management of MANETs, as a guideline\n   for
    how to manage MANETs.  This document describes different\n   management activities,
    such as network configuration, monitoring of\n   state, monitoring of performance,
    fault management, and software\n   upgrades.  Different aspects of a MANET management
    architecture are\n   illustrated (e.g., distributed vs. centralized management,
    flat vs.\n   hierarchical management, management of an entire network vs. an\n
    \  individual router, etc.) and contrasted to the NMS architecture in\n   the
    Internet.  A desciption of typical MANET use cases relevant for\n   management
    is followed by an overview of current standard management\n   protocols that can
    be used in MANETs.\n\n\t "

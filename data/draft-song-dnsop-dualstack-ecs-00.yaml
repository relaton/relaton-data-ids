abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   During the period of IPv6 transition, IP-based Geolocation (GeoIP)\n
    \  applications are identified as a challenge and speed bump for ICPs\n   (Internet
    Content Providers) to migrating their service to IPv6.\n   Some studies and operational
    experiences show that the accuracy of\n   IPv6 GeoIP is relatively poor in comparison
    to their IPv4\n   counterparts.  This memo proposed to include client's dualstack\n
    \  subnets into DNS queries to provide better IPv6 GeoIP.\n\n   REMOVE BEFORE
    PUBLICATION: The source of the document with test\n   script is currently placed
    at GitHub [Dualstack-ECS-GitHub].\n   Comments and pull request are welcome.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This draft introduces a novel communication architecture, called\n
    \  Distributed Micro Service Communication architecture (DMSC).  It\n   includes
    multiple aspects of microservice communication, such as\n   service registration,
    service discovery, service routing, service\n   scheduling, and more , Which to
    achieve all the essential\n   functionalities provided by current centralized
    service networks.  By\n   incorporating content-semantic communication, DMSC significantly\n
    \  enhances the performance, scalability, and reliability of\n   microservice
    communication.  It provides a robust architecture for\n   managing the complex
    communication requirements of distributed\n   microservices, ensuring data integrity,
    security, and efficient\n   resource utilization.  Furthermore, DMSC provides
    a reference\n   direction for the transition of the service mesh infrastructure
    from\n   a location-based model to a content- and service-centric paradigm.\n\n\t "

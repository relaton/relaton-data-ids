  content: "   Since services delivered from cloud need delicate coordination among\n
    \  the client, network and cloud, this draft defines a new Segment to\n   provide
    service routing and addressing functions by leveraging SRv6\n   Segment programming
    capabilities.  With Computing Segments proposed,\n   the network gains its capability
    to identify and process SAN header\n   in need and a complete service routing
    procedure can be achieved.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based management
    framework defines base YANG data models to encode policy.  These models point
    to device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG data models developed elsewhere.
    \ Policy rules within an operator's environment can be used to express high-level,
    possibly network-wide, policies to a network management function (within a controller,
    an orchestrator, or a network element).  The network management function can then
    control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements and services.
    \ This document describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements, and interfaces.\n\t "

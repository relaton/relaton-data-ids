  content: "The PKIX working group has created the GeneralName [RFC2459] to support\nmore
    name types than just the distinguished name specified by OSI.\nGeneralName is
    encoded in ASN.1.  When a GeneralName is communicated\nnot using a ASN.1 encoded
    protocol (e.g., in a configuration file), there is a need to have a string representation
    of GeneralName.  This document specifies a string format for representing names,
    which is designed to give a clean representation of commonly used names, whilst
    being able to represent any GeneralName.  This specification also recognizes that
    GeneralName needs to be communicated to humans, in which case the encoding has
    to be user friendly for display purposes, for e.g. on a business card or in an
    email message.\n\t "

  content: "   This paper describes issues for solutions through cloud inter-\n   connection
    to structural problems, which are called as \"silo effects\"\n   found in cloud-connected
    electric home appliances, housing equipment\n   and sensors in the face of increasingly
    accelerated connection of\n   them.  Specifically, this paper explains an inter-connection\n
    \  agreement considered to be required for enhancement of cloud inter-\n   connection,
    what performance guarantee as well as IoT supervising and\n   management should
    be, necessity of inter-connection HUB which is able\n   to provide inter-connection
    amongst the preponderance of private\n   cloud groups.\n\n\t "

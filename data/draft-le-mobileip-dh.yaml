  content: "Mobile IP [1] requires several security associations: the Mobile Node\nmust
    share a security association with its Home agent and its\nCorrespondent Nodes
    to send the binding update; these messages must\nbe authenticated to prevent potential
    denial of service attacks [2].\nThe MN and the Home Agent can have a static security
    association,\nestablished at the configuration time, but the case of the\nCorrespondent
    Node is more complex since it cannot be assumed that\nthe MN and the CN have any
    pre-established security association.\n\n\t "

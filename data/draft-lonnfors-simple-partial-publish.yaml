  content: "   The size of the published presence information document may be large.\n
    \  As specified in \"Event State Publication Extension to the Session\n   Initiation
    Protocol (SIP)\" a presence user agent publishes a full\n   event state of presence
    information in every publication operation\n   which modifies the current event
    state.  This is done regardless of\n   which presence information has been changed
    compared to the earlier\n   publications.\n\t "

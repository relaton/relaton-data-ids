  content: "Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use of commonly
    defined values that are passed in messages or packets.  To ensure consistent interpretation
    of these values between independent implementations, there is a need to ensure
    that the values and associated semantic intent are uniquely defined.  The IETF
    uses registry functions to record assigned protocol parameter values and their
    associated semantic intentions.  For each IETF protocol parameter, it is current
    practice for the IETF to delegate the role of Protocol Parameter Registry Operator
    to a nominated entity.  This document provides a description of, and the requirements
    for, these delegated functions.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

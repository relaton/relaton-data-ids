  content: "   Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is the instantiation of Segment\n
    \  Routing (SR) on the IPv6 dataplane.  Segments are indicated by\n   Segment
    Identifiers (SIDs).  SRv6 utilizes the Segment Routing Header\n   (SRH), an IPv6
    extension header, that includes a SID list indicating\n   the sequence of segments
    and any additional processing to be\n   performed.\n\n   This document clarifies
    the processing of SID list entries.  It does\n   not change any elements of the
    SRv6 architecture and makes no\n   technical changes to the mechanisms or procedures
    of SRv6.\n\n\t "

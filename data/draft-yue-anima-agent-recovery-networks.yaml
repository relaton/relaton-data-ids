- language: en

  content: "   This document defines a task-oriented, agent-based method for fault\n
    \  recovery in converged public-private mobile networks.  The proposed\n   method
    introduces a multi-agent collaboration framework that enables\n   autonomous failure
    detection, scoped diagnosis, inter-domain\n   coordination, and intent-driven
    policy reconfiguration.  It is\n   particularly applicable in complex 5G/6G network
    deployments, such as\n   Multi-Operator Core Networks (MOCN) and Standalone Non-Public\n
    \  Networks (SNPN), where traditional centralized management is\n   insufficient
    for ensuring high service reliability and dynamic\n   recovery.  The document
    also specifies protocol requirements for\n   inter-agent communication, state
    consistency, and secure\n   coordination, aiming to support interoperability and
    resilience\n   across heterogeneous network domains.\n\n\t "

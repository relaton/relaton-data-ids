- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a method that enables domain names to be used in
    both local and English scripts, as a directory-search solution at an upper layer
    above the DNS. The method first converts virtual domain names typed in local scripts
    into the corresponding domain names in English scripts that comply with the DNS,
    using the knowledge of transliteration between local and English scripts. Then,
    the method searches for and displays domain names in English scripts that are
    active on the Internet so that the user can choose any of them. \nThe conversion
    takes place automatically and transparently in the user's \napplications before
    DNS queries are sent, and so, the method does not make any change to the DNS nor
    require separate name servers.\n\n\t "

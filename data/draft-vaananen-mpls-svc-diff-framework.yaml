  content: "It has been recognized that the success of the MPLS depends on the\nability
    to better support the multiservice traffic integration with\nsome levels of service
    guarantees, which are not feasible to\nimplement with the current destination
    prefix only based packet\nforwarding paradigms.\nThe efficient support for these
    services throughout the network is\nexpected to be possible using label based
    forwarding paradigm in the\nnetwork. Through the use of either RSVP based or LDP/CR-LDP
    based\nsignaling, MPLS can also provide certain QoS guarantees using the\nLSPs.\nThe
    goal of this document is to define a framework for service\ndifferentiation in
    MPLS networks. We discuss a set of services that\nhave been identified so far
    for IP, and  describe the traffic\nmanagement mechanisms in various network elements
    that are needed\nfor enabling the implementation of these more advanced services
    in\nMPLS networks.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non TRILL legacy\n   networks
    via choice of an Appointed Forwarder for set of VLANs.\n   Appointed Forwarder
    provides VLAN level load sharing with active-\n   standby model. Mission critical
    operations such as High Performance\n   Data Centers require active-active load
    sharing model. Active-Active\n   load sharing model can be accomplished by representing
    any given non\n   TRILL legacy network with a single virtual RBridge. Virtual\n
    \  representation of the non-TRILL legacy network with a single RBridge\n   poses
    serious challenges in multi-destination RPF calculations. This\n   document presents
    the required enhancements to build Coordinated\n   Multicast Trees (CMT) within
    the TRILL campus to solve related RPF\n   issues. CMT provides flexibility to
    RBridges to select desired path\n   of association to a given distribution tree.\n\n\t "

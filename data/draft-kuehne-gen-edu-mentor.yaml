  content: "   Education and newcomer orientation activities have existed in the\n
    \  IETF in various forms from the early 1990s (if not earlier). As the\n   IETF
    and the world around us evolves, we are now rethinking what\n   types of activities
    are best suited for the future. A mentoring\n   program also exists at IETF that
    matches newcomers with experienced\n   IETF participants.  Mentoring is confined
    to on-site attendees.  This\n   draft proposes a merger of the mentoring and EDU
    functions as well as\n   potential new activities such as videos, webcasts, and
    remote\n   participation.\n\n\t "

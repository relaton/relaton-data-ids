  content: "RFC 2026 specifies a three-stage Standards Track.  As currently\n   practiced,
    IETF standards track documents typically attain only the\n   first stage.  This
    proposal discusses the problems caused by the\n   disparity between documented
    procedures and actual practice, and\n   proposes a two-step standard track.\n\t "

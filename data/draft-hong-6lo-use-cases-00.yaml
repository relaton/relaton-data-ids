  content: "   This document describes the characteristics of link layer\n   technologies
    that are used at constrained node networks and typical\n   use cases of IPv6 over
    networks of resource-constrained nodes.  In\n   addition to IEEE 802.15.4, various
    link layer technologies such as\n   BLE, Z-wave, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC, and IEEE
    802.15.4e are widely used\n   at constrained node networks for typical services.
    \ Based on these\n   link layer technologies, IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained\n
    \  nodes has various and practical use cases.  To efficiently implement\n   typical
    services, the applicability and consideration of several\n   design spaces are
    described.\n\n\t "

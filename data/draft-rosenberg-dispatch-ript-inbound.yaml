  content: "   The Real-Time Internet Peering for Telephony (RIPT) protocol defines\n
    \  a technique for establishing, terminating and otherwise managing\n   calls
    between entities in differing administrative domains.  While it\n   can be used
    for single user devices like an IP phone, it requires the\n   IP phone to have
    TLS certificates and be publically reachable with a\n   DNS record.  This specification
    remedies this by extending RIPP to\n   enable clients to receive inbound calls.
    \ It also provides basic\n   single-user features such as forking, call push and
    pull, third-party\n   call controls, and call appearances.  It describes techniques
    for\n   resiliency of calls, especially for mobile clients with spotty\n   network
    connectivity.\n\n\t "

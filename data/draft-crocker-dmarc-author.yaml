  content: "   Internet mail defines the From: field to indicate the author of the\n
    \  message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who initially\n   handled
    the message.  The Sender: field is optional, if it has the\n   same information
    as the From: field.  That is, when the Sender: field\n   is absent, the From:
    field has conflated semantics, as both a\n   handling identifier and a content
    creator identifier.  This was not a\n   problem, until development of stringent
    protections on use of the\n   From: field.  It has prompted Mediators, such as
    mailing lists, to\n   modify the From: field, to circumvent mail rejection caused
    by those\n   protections.\n\n   This affects end-to-end behavior of email, between
    the author and the\n   final recipients, because mail from the same author is
    not treated\n   the same, depending on what path it followed.  In effect, the
    From:\n   field has become dominated by its role as a handling identifier.  The\n
    \  current specification augments the current use of the From: field, by\n   specifying
    the Author: field, which identifies the original author of\n   the message and
    is not subject to modification by Mediators.\n\n\t "

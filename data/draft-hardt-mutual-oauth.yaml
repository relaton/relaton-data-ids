  content: "   There are times when a user has a pair protected resources that would\n
    \  like to request access to each other.  While OAuth flows typically\n   enable
    the user to grant a client access to a protected resource,\n   granting the inverse
    access requires an additional flow.  Mutual\n   OAuth enables a more seemless
    experience for the user to grant access\n   to a pair of protected resources.\n\n\t "

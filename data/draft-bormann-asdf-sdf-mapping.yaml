  script: Latn
  content: "   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts\n
    \  to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models\n   that
    describe Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for\n   interaction
    over a network.  It was created as a common language for\n   use in the development
    of the One Data Model liaison organization\n   (OneDM) models.  Tools convert
    this format to database formats and\n   other serializations as needed.\n\n   An
    SDF specification often needs to be augmented by additional\n   information that
    is specific to its use in a particular ecosystem or\n   application.  SDF mapping
    files provide a mechanism to represent this\n   augmentation.\n\n\t "

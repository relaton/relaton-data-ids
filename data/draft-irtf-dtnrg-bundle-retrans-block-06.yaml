  content: "This document defines an optional extension block, called a\nRetransmission
    Block (RB), that may be used with the Bundle Protocol\n[refs.DTNBP] within the
    context of a Delay-Tolerant Network\narchitecture [refs.DTNarch].  The Retransmission
    Block (RB) is\ndesigned to be used within a DTN that, as a matter of policy, deletes\nall
    replayed bundles from the network.  It is designed to be used in\na network that
    permits duplicate bundles to be forwarded if those\nbundles have been retransmitted
    by a custodian, that may (if\npossible) permit duplicate bundles to be forwarded
    if those bundles\nare in intentional or unintentional routing loops (contingent
    on the\navailability of mechanisms to distinguish looping bundles from other\nbundles),
    but that will consider all other duplicate bundles to be\nmaliciously replayed
    bundles and delete them as such.  The\nRetransmission Block is designed to be
    inserted into a bundle by a\ncustodian when the custodian is retransmitting that
    bundle.  The\npurpose of the RB is to mark the bundle as a custody-based\nretransmission
    so that it can be distinguished from other types of\nduplicate bundles and thereby
    be spared from deletion.  This document\ndefines the format and processing of
    this new Retransmission Block.\n\t "

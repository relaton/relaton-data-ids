  content: "   This memo specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media handling\n
    \  in multi-party calls.  The main solution is to carry Real-Time text\n   by
    the RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103.\n   The main solution
    for centralized multi-party handling of real-time\n   text is achieved through
    a media control unit coordinating multiple\n   RTP text streams into one RTP session.\n\n
    \  Identification for the streams are provided through the RTCP\n   messages.
    \ This mechanism enables the receiving application to\n   present the received
    real-time text medium in different ways\n   according to user preferences.  Some
    presentation related features\n   are also described explaining suitable variations
    of transmission and\n   presentation of text.\n\n   Call control features are
    described for the SIP environment.  A\n   number of alternative methods for providing
    the multi-party\n   negotiation, transmission and presentation are discussed and
    a\n   recommendation for the main one is provided.  Two alternative methods\n
    \  using a single RTP stream and source identification inline in the\n   text
    stream are also described, one of them being provided as a lower\n   functionality
    fallback method for endpoints with no multi-party\n   awareness for RTT.\n\n   Brief
    information is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC\n   environment.\n\n
    \  EDITOR NOTE: A number of alternatives are specified for discussion.\n   A decision
    is needed which alternatives are preferred and then how\n   the preferred alternatives
    shall be emphasized.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an address management module for mobile\n   Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP). The module is used for\n   a mobile node
    to manage the IP addresses associated with an mSCTP\n   association. The address
    management module utilizes the link layer\n   signal strength information in order
    to determine when to add or\n   delete end-point IP addresses of a mobile node
    and how to change the\n   primary path from the mSCTP association when a handover
    happens.\n\t "

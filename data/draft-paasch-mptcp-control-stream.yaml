- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Multipath TCP's extensive use of TCP options to exchange control\n
    \  information consumes a significant part of the TCP option space.\n   Extending
    MPTCP to add more control information into the session\n   becomes cumbersome
    as the TCP option space is limited to 40 bytes.\n\n   This draft introduces a
    control stream that allows to send control\n   information as part of the subflow's
    payload.  The control stream is\n   mapped into a separate sequence number space
    and uses a TLV-format\n   for maximum extensibility.  It is left to future documents
    to specify\n   how the TLV-format might be used to exchange control information.
    \ As\n   the control stream is sent as part of the subflow's payload, it is\n
    \  not subject to the 40 bytes limitation of the TCP option space.\n\n\t "

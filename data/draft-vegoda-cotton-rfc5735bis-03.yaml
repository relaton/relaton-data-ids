  content: "   This document describes the global and other specialized IPv4 address\n
    \  blocks that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority
    (IANA).  It does not address IPv4 address space assigned to\n   operators and
    users through the Regional Internet Registries, nor\n   does it address IPv4 address
    space assigned directly by IANA prior to\n   the creation of the Regional Internet
    Registries.  It also does not\n   address allocations or assignments of IPv6 addresses
    or autonomous\n   system numbers.  This document obsoletes RFC 5735 and updates
    RFC\n   6441.\n\n   The substantive change between this document and RFC 5735
    is that it\n   includes 100.64.0.0/10, which was assigned in RFC 6598.\n\n\t "

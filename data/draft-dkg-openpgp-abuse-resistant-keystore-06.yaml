  script: Latn
  content: "   OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates, made up\n
    \  of primary keys, revocation signatures, direct key signatures, user\n   IDs,
    identity certifications (\"signature packets\"), subkeys, and so\n   on.  They
    are often assembled by merging multiple certificates that\n   all share the same
    primary key, and are distributed in public\n   keystores.\n\n   Unfortunately,
    since many keystores permit any third-party to add a\n   certification with any
    content to any OpenPGP certificate, the\n   assembled/merged form of a certificate
    can become unwieldy or\n   undistributable.  Furthermore, keystores that are searched
    by user ID\n   or fingerprint can be made unusable for specific searches by public\n
    \  submission of bogus certificates.  And finally, keystores open to\n   public
    submission can also face simple resource exhaustion from\n   flooding with bogus
    submissions, or legal or other risks from uploads\n   of toxic data.\n\n   This
    draft documents techniques that an archive of OpenPGP\n   certificates can use
    to mitigate the impact of these various attacks,\n   and the implications of these
    concerns and mitigations for the rest\n   of the OpenPGP ecosystem.\n\n\t "

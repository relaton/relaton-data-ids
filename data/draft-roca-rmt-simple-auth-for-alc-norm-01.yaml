  content: "This document introduces two schemes that provide a per-packet\nauthentication
    and integrity service in the context of the ALC and\nNORM protocols.  The first
    scheme is based on digital signatures.\nBecause it relies on asymmetric cryptography,
    this scheme generates a\nhigh processing load at the sender and to a lesser extent
    at a\nreceiver, as well as a significant transmission overhead.  It is\ntherefore
    well suited to low data rate sessions.  The second scheme\nrelies on a group Message
    Authentication Code (MAC).  Because this\nscheme relies symmetric cryptography,
    MAC calculation and\nverification are fast operations, which makes it suited to
    high data\nrate sessions.  However it only provides a group authentication and\nintegrity
    service, which means that it only protects against\nattackers that are not group
    members.\n\t "

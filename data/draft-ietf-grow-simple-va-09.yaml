  content: "   The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)\n   stresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the\n   most costly stresses
    is Forwarding Information Base (FIB) size: ISPs\n   often must upgrade router
    hardware simply because the FIB has run out\n   of space, and router vendors must
    design routers that have adequate\n   FIB.\n\n   FIB suppression is an approach
    to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT\n   loading selected RIB entries into the
    FIB.  Simple Virtual\n   Aggregation (S-VA) is a simple form of Virtual Aggregation
    (VA) that\n   allows any and all edge routers to shrink their RIB and FIB\n   requirements
    substantially and therefore increase their useful\n   lifetime.\n\n   S-VA does
    not increase FIB requirements for core routers.  S-VA is\n   extremely easy to
    configure considerably more so than the various\n   tricks done today to extend
    the life of edge routers.  S-VA can be\n   deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation
    between ISPs is not\n   required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the
    ISP.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document updates RFC4121 with support for encryption mechanisms\n
    \  that can authenticate associated data such as Counter with CBC-MAC\n   (CCM)
    and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).  These mechanisms are often more\n   performant
    and need not expand the message as much as conventional\n   modes.\n\n\t "

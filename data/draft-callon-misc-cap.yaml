  content: "   The Framework for Operational Security Capabilities [11] outlines the\n
    \  proposed effort of the IETF OPSEC working group.  This includes\n   producing
    a series of drafts to codify knowledge gained through\n   operational experience
    about feature sets that are needed to securely\n   deploy and operate managed
    network elements providing transit\n   services at the data link and IP layers.
    \ Current plans include\n   separate capabilities documents for Packet Filtering;
    Event Logging;\n   In-Band and Out-of-Band Management; Configuration and Management\n
    \  Interfaces; AAA; and Documentation and Assurance.  This document\n   describes
    some additional miscellaneous capabilities which do not fit\n   into any of these
    specific catagories, and whose descriptions are\n   brief enough that it does
    not seem appropriate to create a separate\n   document for each.\n\n   Operational
    Security Current Practices [12] lists current operator\n   practices related to
    securing networks.  This document lists\n   miscellaneous capabilities needed
    to support those practices.\n\n   Capabilities are defined without reference to
    specific technologies.\n   This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies
    that\n   implement the capability.  Each capability cites the practices it\n   supports.
    \ Current implementations that support the capability may be\n   cited.  Special
    considerations are discussed as appropriate listing\n   operational and resource
    constraints, limitations of current\n   implementations, tradeoffs, etc.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a real-time transport protocol (RTP) [1]\npayload
    format for AMR speech encoded [2] signals. It supports all \n8 modes of the AMR
    speech codec and is as well prepared for future \nextensions, such as AMR wideband.
    Mode adaptation and discontinuous \ntransmission (DTX) are supported as well.\nThe
    proposed payload format allows large flexibility with a minimum\nof bitrate overhead.
    One or multiple speech frames can be trans-\nmitted in a single packet. Redundant
    transmission of previously \ntransmitted frames (or parts thereof) is possible
    as well as parity\ncode transmission. With one speech frame per packet the additional
    \nparity code transmission allows reconstruction of N previous lost\nspeech frames
    when N consecutive correct packets are buffered in the\nreceiver. This means a
    very high robustness while the receiver \nbuffer size can be chosen according
    to the application.\nFor implementation of this draft, please consider also the\nrequirements
    of [12].\n\t "

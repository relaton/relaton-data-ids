  content: "   Given responsibilities and importance it bears, DNS root system\n   architecture
    remains largely unchanged. Over the years, the topics\n   together with some proposals
    of scaling the root have been discussed\n   in various communities, trying to
    offer solutions or insights to a\n   specific issue of DNS root operation. This
    document gathers and\n   describes issues relating to the root zone operation
    and management\n   and comb corresponding technical requirements for evolution\n
    \  directions of root zone operation and management in new groundwork.\n\n\t "

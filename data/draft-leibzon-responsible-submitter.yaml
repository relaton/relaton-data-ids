  content: "   This memo defines an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\n
    \  (SMTP) service, which allows an SMTP client to specify the\n   responsible
    submitter of an e-mail message.  The responsible\n   submitter is the e-mail address
    of the entity most recently\n   responsible for introducing a message into the
    transport stream.\n   This extension helps receiving e-mail servers efficiently
    determine\n   whether the SMTP client is authorized to transmit mail on behalf
    of\n   the responsible submitter's domain.\n\t "

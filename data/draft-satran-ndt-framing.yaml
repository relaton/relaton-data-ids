  content: "During the last year  several attempts have been made to provide a \ngeneralized
    framing mechanism for protocols using TCP. The main pur-\npose of those mechanisms
    is to enable hardware network adapter \nbuilders to discover fast the next Upper
    Layer Protocol Data Unit \nboundary and thus minimize the amount of memory required
    on the \nnetwork adapters in order to handle packet drop or reordering in the
    \nnetwork.\n\t "

  content: "This document reviews the security threats associated with the two\ncurrent
    work items of the ECRIT Working Group.  The first is the\nmarking of signalling
    messages to indicate that they are related to\nan emergency.  The second is the
    process of mapping from locations to\nUniversal Resource Identifiers (URIs) pointing
    to Public Safety\nAnswering Points (PSAPs).  This mapping occurs as part of the
    process\nof routing emergency calls through the IP network.  Based on the\nthreats,
    this document establishes a set of security requirements for\nthe the mapping
    protocol and for the handling of emergency-marked\ncalls.\n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes a scalable routing scheme for information centric\n
    \  networks. Moving the focus from \"nodes\" to \"information objects\"\n   raises
    scalability issue because aggregation of flat name for objects\n   is not easy
    task and the number of addressable information objects is\n   so huge than the
    IP address space. For scalable routing, we propose\n   hierarchically-organized
    domain architecture. A domain is a \"logical\n   group\" of information objects
    and each domain has its own ID. The\n   concatenation of domain IDs from top level
    domain to the current\n   domain plays the role of \"locator\". Thus, we can get
    scalable routing\n   table and it is more scalable by means of \"topology reduction\".
    More\n   challenging issue is name-based forwarding. It is hard to aggregate\n
    \  forwarding table due to flat name space, therefore we propose\n   \"reactive
    path setup\".\n\n\t "

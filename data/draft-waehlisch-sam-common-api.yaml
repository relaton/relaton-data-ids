  content: "Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors, and\ntechnical
    implementations at different protocol layers.  Multicast\ndata distribution is
    most efficiently performed on the lowest\navailable layer, but a heterogeneous
    deployment status of multicast\ntechnologies throughout the Internet requires
    an adaptive service\nbinding at runtime.  Today, it is difficult to write an application\nthat
    runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most\nefficient multicast
    service available in the network.  Facing\nrobustness requirements, developers
    are frequently forced to using a\nstable, upper layer protocol controlled by the
    application itself.\nThis document describes a common multicast API that is suitable
    for\ntransparent communication in underlay and overlay, and grants access\nto
    the different multicast flavors.  It proposes an abstract naming\nby multicast
    URIs and discusses mapping mechanisms between different\nnamespaces and distribution
    technologies.  Additionally, it describes\nthe application of this API for building
    gateways that interconnect\ncurrent multicast domains throughout the Internet.\n\t "

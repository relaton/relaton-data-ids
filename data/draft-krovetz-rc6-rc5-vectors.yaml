  content: "   The RC6 and RC5 block ciphers are parameterized, allowing a variety\n
    \  of block sizes, key sizes, and security levels.  This flexibility,\n   along
    with simple implementations, make RC6 and RC5 attractive for\n   many applications.
    \ This document supplies test vectors to aid in the\n   development of compatible
    ciphers.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document replaces RFC 1591, with all the guidelines and procedures
    updated and modified in the light of experience.  This document describes the
    types of the top level domains (TLD), and introduces new TLD classes. It also
    introduces new TLD names to expand and take some pressure off the international
    commercial namespace (.COM).   This document suggests some ideas for the management
    of the establishment of new top level domains, some procedures for domain name
    registries, and some constraints on top level domain names. The guidelines and
    these policies are subject to revision at the direction of the IANA. The newdom,
    iahc-discuss and shared-tld mailing lists will be discussing these issues and
    may provide advice to the IANA about possible revisions.  This document can be
    considered the base set of operational guidelines in use by all top level domain
    administrators and domain name registries.  Additional guidelines may be imposed
    within a specific TLD's charter, or by a particular registry as appropriate.  This
    document does not attempt to provide a direct solution for preventing or resolving
    the domain name or trademark conflicts we have recently witnessed, but it does
    create a foundation where\n\t "

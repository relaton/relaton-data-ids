  content: "   This document describes our experiences from designing and\n   implementing
    a large-scale local area network management system using\n   mainly NETCONF.  We
    designed the data models for device\n   configurations and implemented NETCONF
    client to centrally control\n   multiple devices of various vendors.  The document
    provides insight\n   on strong and weak points of current NETCONF approach.  The
    document\n   also makes some recommendations about NETCONF and future network\n
    \  management protocols.\n\n\t "

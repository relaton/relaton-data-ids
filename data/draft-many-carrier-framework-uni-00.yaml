  content: "This contribution describes a carriers optical services framework\nand
    associated requirements for the User-Network Interface (UNI). It\nis intended
    to provide carrier specific service requirements for the\nautomatic switched optical
    networks to guide the on-going efforts to\ndevelop the standard UNI and other
    interfaces to the optical layer\n(OL) control plane. Due to time constraints,
    no attempt has been\nmade to provide detailed comprehensive requirements; instead
    we\nfocused on topics of particular interest or concern to the carrier\ncommunity.
    This is a work-in-progress document and is expected to\nevolve in near term as
    new requirements are identified and further\nstudied.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a solution framework for overcoming the\n   limitations
    of existing Multicast VPN (MVPN) and VPLS multicast\n   solutions.  It describes
    procedures for enhancing the scalability of\n   multicast for BGP/MPLS VPNs. It
    also describes procedures for VPLS\n   multicast that utilize multicast trees
    in the sevice provider (SP)\n   network.  The procedures described here reduce
    the overhead of PIM\n   neighbor relationships that a PE router needs to maintain
    for\n   BGP/MPLS VPNs. They also reduce the state (and the overhead of\n   maintaining
    the state) in the SP network by removing the need to\n   maintain in the SP network
    at least one dedicated multicast tree per\n   each VPN.\n\t "

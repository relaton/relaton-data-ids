  content: "This document identifies problems that may result from the absence of
    formal coordination and joint development on protocols of mutual interest between
    standards development organizations (SDOs). Some of these problems may cause significant
    harm to the Internet. The document suggests that a robust procedure is required
    prevent this from occurring in the future. The IAB has selected a number of case
    studies, such as Transport MPLS (T-MPLS), as recent examples to describe the hazard
    to the Internet architecture that results from uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol.\n\n
    This experience has resulted in a considerable improvement in the relationship
    between the IETF and the ITU-T. In particular, this was achieved via the establishment
    of the \"Joint working team on MPLS-TP\". In addition, the leadership of the two
    organizations agreed to improve inter-organizational working practices so as to
    avoid conflict in the future between ITU-T Recommendations and IETF RFCs.\n\n
    Whilst we use ITU-T - IETF interactions in these case studies, the scope of the
    document extends to all SDOs that have an overlapping protocol interest with the
    IETF. This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

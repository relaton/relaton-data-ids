  content: "   While DNS-SD over mDNS significantly improves the convenience of\n
    \  network configuration, parts of the published information may\n   seriously
    breach the users' privacy.  Currently discussed privacy\n   extensions either
    are not efficient in terms of multicast messages\n   sent, reduce privacy and
    complicate key revocation by introducing an\n   1:m pairing system, or use trial
    encryptions which are inefficient in\n   terms of necessary computational power.\n\n
    \  The method proposed in this document leverages Bloomfilters to\n   significantly
    reduce the number of multicast (public) messages for a\n   DNS-SD privacy extension
    based on an 1:1 pairing mechanism.  This\n   allows keeping the advantages of
    both an 1:1 pairing system and a\n   hinting system that does not require trial
    encryptions, while\n   mitigating the main disadvantage: multicast messages sent.\n\n\t "

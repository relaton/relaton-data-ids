  content: "The Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) is an application level \nprotocol
    to control media service resources like Speech \nSynthesizers, Recognizers, Signal
    Generators, Signal Detectors, Fax \nServers etc. over a network.  This document
    captures the extensions \nrequired to implement Voice Enrollment, Speaker Verification
    and \nHotword recognition as well as to augment the recognizer \nfunctionality
    using MRCP.  The extensions are largely orthogonal to \nexisting features of MRCP
    and to each other, with an eye towards \nbackwards compatibility with existing
    features and independence of \nthe extensions from each other to simplify integration.\n\t "

  content: "   LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking system by\n
    \  separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN\n   addresses.
    \ This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as\n   a critically necessary
    evolutionary architectural step for the\n   Internet.  In LISP, nodes have both
    a 'locator' (a name which says\n   _where_ in the network's connectivity structure
    the node is) and an\n   'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent
    handle\n   for the node).  A node may have more than one locator, or its locator\n
    \  may change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the\n   same
    identifier.\n\n   This document gives additional architectural insight into LISP,
    and\n   considers a number of aspects of LISP from a high-level standpoint.\n\n
    \  [NOTE: This is still a somewhat rough draft version; a few sections\n   at
    the end are just rough frameworks, but almost all the key\n   sections, and all
    the front part of the document, are here, and in\n   something like reasonably
    complete form.]\n\n\t "

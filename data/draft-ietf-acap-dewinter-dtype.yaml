  content: "The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is designed to support
    remote storage and access of program option, configuration and preference information.
    \ In certain circumstances, it is desirable or necessary to deal with information
    that has a limit imposed on it. While the general ACAP specification does provide
    for a (SYNTAX) alert to inform the submittor that the stored information was not
    in a valid syntax for that field, there is no generic method to discover that
    syntax.            There is strong feeling in the ACAP working group that variable
    length strings should be used for data where possible, but there is also the knowledge
    that ACAP will be used to configure and access existing systems where the use
    of such variable length strings may be difficult or impossible.\n\t "

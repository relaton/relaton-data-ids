- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The 'Internet X.500 Schema' defines an RFC-822 email address attribute
    of a person's entry, rfc822Mailbox (aka 'Mail'), but it does not address the issues
    involved in routing RFC-822-based email within an administrative domain served
    by an X.500/LDAP-based directory service. Significantly, it doesn't delineate
    between a person's publicaly 'advertised' or 'promoted' email address and the
    actual 'internal to the administrative domain' address for the person.                                                    This
    memo illustrates an object class and an attendant attribute we use at Stanford
    University to solve this issue. This scheme provides us with flexible, simple
    to implement, distributed routing of RFC-822-based email to people represented
    by entries within our directory service. The LDAP-enabled version of sendmail
    we use is freely available.               Additionally, we anticipate that the
    Internet community will devise conventions and perhaps support a process for facilitating
    multi-vendor directory utilization. We present an anticipated tenet and goals.\n\t "

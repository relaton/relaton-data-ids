  script: Latn
  content: "   Often an intermediate instance (such as a proxy server) is used to\n
    \  connect to a web server or a communicating peer if a direct end-to-\n   end
    IP connectivity is not possible or the proxy can provide a\n   support service
    like, e.g., address anonymisation.  To use a non-\n   transparent proxy a client
    explicitly connects to it and requests\n   forwarding to the final target server.
    \ The client either knows the\n   proxy address as preconfigured in the application
    or can dynamically\n   learn about available proxy services.  This document describes\n
    \  different discovery mechanisms for non-transparent proxies that are\n   either
    located in the local network, e.g. home or enterprise network,\n   in the access
    network, or somewhere else on the Internet usually\n   close to the target server
    or even in the same network as the target\n   server.\n\n   This document assumes
    that the non-transparent proxy server is\n   connected via QUIC and discusses
    potential discovery mechanisms for\n   such a QUIC-based, non-transparent proxy.\n\n\t "

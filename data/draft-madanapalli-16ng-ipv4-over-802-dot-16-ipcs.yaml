  content: "IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband\n
    \  access.  IEEE has specified the service specific convergence\n   sublayers
    (CS) in the IEEE 802.16 MAC to be used by upper layer\n   protocols.  Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode Convergence Sublayer (ATM CS)\n   and Packet Convergence Sublayer
    (Packet CS) represent the two main\n   service specific convergence sublayers
    for the IEEE 802.16.  The\n   packet CS is used for transport for all packet-based
    protocols such\n   as Internet Protocol (IP), IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.1Q\n
    \  (VLAN).  The IP specific part of the Packet CS enables transport of\n   IPv4
    packets directly over the IEEE 802.16 MAC.\n\n   This document specifies the frame
    format, the Maximum Transmission\n   Unit (MTU) and address assignment procedures
    for transmitting IPv4\n   packets over IP Convergence Sublayer (IPCS) of the IEEE
    802.16.  This\n   document also provides the details of why the ARP cannot be
    sent over\n   the IEEE 802.16 links using IPCS and a recommendation for this.\n\t "

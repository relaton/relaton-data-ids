  content: "A handover process on Mobile IPv6 requires a time period referred as handoff
    latency. This latency is not acceptable to support real-time application. \nWe
    propose a new smooth handoff method using the Explicit Multicast (xcast) technique.
    On the wired section, control/user packets are multicasted by Xcast scheme to
    the Base Stations where Mobile Node (MN) can receive, and then packets are passed
    to the air-link activated between a BS and the MN. \nThis procedure provides mobility
    in heterogeneous media environment \nbecause this handoff mechanism is basically
    able to implemented without \nadditional control or intelligence of neither intermediate
    routers.\n\t "

  content: "   This document updates RFC2622 and RFC4012 by specifying src-members,\n
    \  a new attribute on as-set and route-set objects in the Routing Policy\n   Specification
    Language (RPSL).  This attribute allows a specific\n   registry to be defined
    for each member in a set, avoiding problematic\n   ambiguity when resolving set
    members.  A new validation rule allows\n   gradual upgrades and backwards compatibility.\n\n\t "

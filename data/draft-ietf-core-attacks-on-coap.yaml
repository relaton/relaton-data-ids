  content: "   Being able to securely retrieve information from sensors and control\n
    \  actuators while providing guards against distributed denial-of-\n   service
    (DDoS) attacks are key requirements for CoAP deployments.  To\n   that aim, a
    security protocol (e.g., DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE) can be\n   enabled to ensure secure
    CoAP operation, including protection against\n   many attacks.  This document
    identifies a set of known CoAP attacks\n   and shows that simply using CoAP with
    a security protocol is not\n   always enough for secure operation.  Several of
    the identified\n   attacks can be mitigated with a security protocol providing\n
    \  confidentiality and integrity combined with the solutions specified\n   in
    RFC 9175.\n\n\t "

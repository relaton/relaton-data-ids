  content: "This memo specifies the base architecture for IPsec compliant\n   systems.
    \ The goal of the architecture is to provide various security\n   services for
    traffic at the IP layer, in both the IPv4 and IPv6\n   environments.  This document
    describes the goals of such systems,\n   their components and how they fit together
    with each other and into\n   the IP environment.  It also describes the security
    services offered\n   by the IPsec protocols, and how these services can be employed
    in the\n   IP environment.  This document does not address all aspects of IPsec\n
    \  architecture.  Subsequent documents will address additional\n   architectural
    details of a more advanced nature, e.g., use of IPsec\n   in NAT environments
    and more complete support for IP multicast.  The\n   following fundamental components
    of the IPsec security architecture\n   are discussed in terms of their underlying,
    required functionality.\n   Additional RFCs (see Section 1.3 for pointers to other
    documents)\n   define the protocols in (a), (c), and (d).\n\n\t "

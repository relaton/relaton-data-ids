  content: "   The NEMO Basic support protocol [1] specifies the operation of a\n
    \  Mobile Router.  The Mobile Router has a bi-directional tunnel to\n   its Home
    Agent through which it reverse tunnels all traffic.  When\n   the Mobile Router
    roams and connects to an access network that only\n   implements IPv4, it needs
    to use IPv6 transition tunneling mechanisms\n   to reach its Home Agent.  This
    will result in a NEMO tunnel inside a\n   transition tunnel.  This document describes
    protocol extensions to\n   the NEMO Basic support protocol to maintain IPv6 connectivity
    for the\n   Mobile Router via its Home Agent with IPv6-over-IPv4 encapsulation\n
    \  with no special boxes to be deployed anywhere in the network.\n\t "

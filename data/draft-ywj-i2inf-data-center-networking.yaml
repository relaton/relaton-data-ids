  content: "   In-network computing has gained a lot of attention and been widely\n
    \  investigated as a research area in the past few years, due to the\n   exposure
    of data plane programmability to application developers and\n   network operators.
    \ After several years of trials and research, some\n   of in-network computing
    capabilities, or to say In-Network Functions\n   (INF) have been proved to be
    effective and very beneficial for\n   networked systems and applications, like
    machine learning and data\n   analysis, and these capabilities have been gradually
    commercialized.\n   However, there still lacks a general framework and standardized\n
    \  interfaces to register, configure, manage and monitor these INFs.\n   This
    document focuses on the applicability of INFs in a limited\n   domain in [RFC8799],
    e.g., data center networks, and describes a\n   framework for orchastrating, managing,
    and monitoring these INFs.\n\n\n\t "

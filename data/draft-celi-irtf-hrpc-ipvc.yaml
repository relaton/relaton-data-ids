  content: "   This document aims to inform how Internet protocols and their\n   implementations
    might better mitigate technical attacks at the user\n   endpoint by describing
    technology-based practices to perpetrate\n   intimate partner violence (IPV).
    \ IPV is a pervasive reality that is\n   not limited to, but can be exacerbated
    with, the usage of technology.\n   The IPV context enables the attacker to access
    one, some or all of:\n   devices, local networks, authentication mechanisms, identity\n
    \  information, and accounts.  These kinds of technical compromise exist\n   in
    addition to on-path attacks, both active and passive [RFC7624].\n   In this document
    we describe the tactics the IPV attacker uses and\n   what kind of counter-measures
    can be designed in IETF protocols.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) demand new multiple administrative
    domain (aka multi-domain) orchestration models. This document proposes a new broker-plane
    approach working on top of per- domain management and orchestration functions
    to coordinate the delivery of a multi-operator End-to-End Network Service (E2ENS).
    This proposed design resorts to the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    protocol to offer topology and resource information from different administrative
    domains. The ALTO services with the proposed protocol extension offer aggregated
    views on various types of resources contributing to a more simple and scalable
    solution.</p>"

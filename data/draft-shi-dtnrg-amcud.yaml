  content: "   This document proposes a coping mechanism used to deal with the\n   unpredictable
    disruption problem in Space Delay Tolerant Networks\n   (DTN) [RFC4838]. Since
    Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)\n   [RFC5326] provides retransmission-based
    reliability for bundles,\n   several times of retransmissions can be seen as a
    failure occurred\n   over links. The proposed mechanism is used to direct the
    following\n   packets to other nodes and probes the availability of the links\n
    \  which has disrupted unexpectedly.\n\n\t "

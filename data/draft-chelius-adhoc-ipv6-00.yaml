  content: "The concept of node identifier, in practical terms an IP address, is \ncrucial
    in ad hoc networks. Its use allows the setup of IP routing \nfor ad hoc connectivity
    and the identification of several wireless \ndevices as part of a unique ad hoc
    node. In this document, a new \naddressable object is defined: the ad hoc connector.
    It virtualizes \nseveral ad hoc network interfaces into a single addressable object.
    \nTo locally address ad hoc connectors, a third IPv6 local-use unicast \naddress
    (adhoc-local address) and the correlated use of the subnet \nmulticast scope are
    defined. \n    \n\t "

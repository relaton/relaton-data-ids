  content: "In certain networking topologies, it may be advantageous to maintain associations
    between endpoints and key transit points to support an instance of a service.
    Such associations are known as Calls.\n\n A Call does not provide the actual connectivity
    for transmitting user traffic, but only builds a relationship by which subsequent
    Connections may be made. In Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) such Connections are known
    as Label Switched Paths (LSPs).\n\n This document specifies how GMPLS Resource
    Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling may be used and
    extended to support Calls. These mechanisms provide full and logical Call/Connection
    separation.\n\n The mechanisms proposed in this document are applicable to any
    environment (including multi-area), and for any type of interface: packet, layer-2,
    time-division multiplexed, lambda, or fiber switching. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

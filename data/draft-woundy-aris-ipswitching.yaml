  content: "IP based networks use a number of routing protocols, including RIP, OSPF,
    IS-IS, and BGP, to determine how packets ought to be routed.  Among these protocols,
    OSPF and BGP are IETF-recommended standards that have been extensively deployed
    and exercised in many networks.  In this memo, we describe a mechanism which uses
    these protocols as the basis for switching IP datagrams, by the addition of a
    simple protocol ('ARIS') that establishes switched paths through a network.  The
    ARIS protocol allows us to leverage the advantages of switching technologies in
    an internet network.                                                                   This
    memo is defined with respect to ATM.  ARIS can be easily extended to other switching
    technologies.\n\t "

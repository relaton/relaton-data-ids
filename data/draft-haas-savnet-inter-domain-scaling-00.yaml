  content: "   Source address validation (SAV) covers the general techniques to\n
    \  prevent IP source address spoofing, which is often used in networking\n   attacks.
    \ Two primary problem spaces addressed in work on SAV include\n   building the
    \"source of truth\" for what IP networks should be\n   permitted to source IP
    traffic behind a set of network interfaces,\n   and implementing the data plane
    enforcement for the validation.\n\n   Implementing data plane enforcement, especially
    for inter-domain\n   networking for the Internet carried by BGP-4 [RFC 4271] has
    a number\n   of scaling considerations.  One consideration is the potentially\n
    \  large and often asymmetric sizes of the per-interface SAV tables vs.\n   the
    Forwarding Information Base (FIB).  A second consideration is\n   synchronization
    issues between SAV enforcement mechanisms and the\n   forwarding state for the
    FIB where a lack of coordination may result\n   in dropped or mis-forwarded traffic.\n\n
    \  This draft explores these two considerations under the title, \"The\n   asymmetric
    contract, and the broken promise.\"\n\n\t "

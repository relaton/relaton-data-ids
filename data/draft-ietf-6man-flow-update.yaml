- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Various published proposals for use of the IPv6 flow label are incompatible
    with its original specification in RFC 3697.  Furthermore, very little practical
    use is made of the flow label, partly due to some uncertainties about the correct
    interpretation of the specification.  This document discusses and motivates changes
    to the specification in order to clarify it and to introduce some additional flexibility.
    \ This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes:\nthreshold
    marking and excess traffic marking.  Threshold marking\nmarks all PCN-packets
    if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a first\nconfigured rate.  Excess traffic
    marking marks a proportion of PCN-\npackets, such that the amount marked equals
    the traffic rate in\nexcess of a second configured rate.Requirements Language\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\t "

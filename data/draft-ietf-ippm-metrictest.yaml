  content: "This document specifies tests to determine if multiple independent instantiations
    of a performance-metric RFC have implemented the specifications in the same way.
    \ This is the performance-metric equivalent of interoperability, required to advance
    RFCs along the Standards Track.  Results from different implementations of metric
    RFCs will be collected under the same underlying network conditions and compared
    using statistical methods.  The goal is an evaluation of the metric RFC itself
    to determine whether its definitions are clear and unambiguous to implementors
    and therefore a candidate for advancement on the IETF Standards Track.  This document
    is an Internet Best Current Practice.\n\t "

  content: "   Unless they have out-of-band knowledge, QUIC endpoints have no\n   information
    about their network situation.  They neither know their\n   external IP address
    and port, nor do they know if they are directly\n   connected to the internet
    or if they are behind a NAT.  This QUIC\n   extension allows nodes to determine
    their public IP address and port\n   for any QUIC path.\n\n\t "

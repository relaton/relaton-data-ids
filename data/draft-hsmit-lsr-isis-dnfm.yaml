  content: "   This document describes a technology extension to reduce link-state\n
    \  flooding in highly resilient dense networks.  It does this by using\n   simple
    and backwards-compatible extensions to reduce the number of\n   adjacencies over
    which link-state flooding takes place.\n\n   \"IS-IS Sparse Link-State Flooding\"
    is an extension to the IS-IS\n   routing protocol.\n\n   It is relatively easy
    to understand and implement.  It is backwards\n   compatible.  It requires no
    per-node configuration.  It uses a\n   distributed algorithm, therefor no centralized
    computations are\n   required.  No complex computations are required on each node
    in the\n   network.  The algorithm has no requirements for the network topology.\n
    \  It can be deployed in a redundant way to improve robustness and\n   convergence-times.\n\n\n\t "

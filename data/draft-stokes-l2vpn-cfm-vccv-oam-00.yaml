  content: "The IEEE has defined P802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) for
    managing\nbridged LAN networks.  The IETF has defined L2 Virtual Private Networks
    (VPNs)\nthat provide an emulated LAN service for such bridged networks.  These
    L2 VPNs are\ncreated using a collection of one or more point-to-point pseudo wires
    (PWs).  The\nIETF has also defined Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
    for\nmanaging these PWs.  This memo discusses the ability of a combination of
    CFM and\nVCCV to meet the OAM requirements of a L2 VPN.\n\t "

  content: "As per industry trends, Access Networks have been migrating from\ntraditional
    ATM based networks to Ethernet networks.  In Ethernet\nbased access networks,
    Access Concentrators are typically configured\nto act as traditional bridge.  These
    Access Concentrators also act as\nrelay agents and relay DHCP messages between
    hosts and DHCP servers.\nIt also maintains and updates lease/location information
    while\nrelaying the DHCP messages.  Access Concentrators may use the lease/\nlocation
    information for anti-spoofing, data forwarding etc.  This\nlease/location information
    is lost if an Access Concentrator gets\nrebooted.  RFC 4388 [5] has defined a
    new message type DHCPLEASEQUERY\nto address similar limitation in Routed Access
    Networks.\n\nThis document initially gives an overview of the functioning of the\nAccess
    Concentrator acting as a relay agent in a Layer 2 aggregation\nnetwork.  The limitation[as
    mentioned above] in a typical switched/\nbridged[layer 2] is then discussed followed
    by the proposal to extend\nthe DHCPLEASEQUERY message to address this limitation.\n\n\t "

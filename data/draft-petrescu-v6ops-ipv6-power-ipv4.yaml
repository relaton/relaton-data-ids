- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft documents preliminary results of measuring the power\n   consumption
    of using IPv6 vs using IPv4 on typical applications on a\n   smartphone.  The
    smartphone is connected on a 4G cellular network\n   with either an IPv6 connection,
    or with an IPv4 connection, but not\n   both simultaneously.\n\n   The preliminary
    results expose a roughly 5% increase in power\n   consumption on IPv6.  More experiments
    are planned as future work\n   that may confirm or infirm these figures.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes use cases for ITU-T Recommendation G.711.0\n
    \  compression of ITU-T Recommendation G.711 payloads when deployed in\n   transport
    system segments using the Real-Time Transport Protocol\n   (RTP).\n\n   ITU-T
    Rec. G.711.0 defines a lossless and stateless compression for\n   G.711 packet
    payloads typically used in IP networks.  Although the\n   use of ITU-T Rec. G.711.0
    can be negotiated end-to-end, being\n   lossless and stateless it can also be
    applied as a compression\n   mechanism \"in-the-middle\" of an end-to-end ITU-T
    G.711 negotiated\n   session.  These \"in-the-middle\" applications of ITU-T Rec.
    G.711.0\n   are called \"G.711.0 Compression Segments\" in this document.\n\n
    \  This document outlines considerations and best practices (a.k.a. use\n   cases)
    for these \"G.711.0 compression segments\".\n\n\t "

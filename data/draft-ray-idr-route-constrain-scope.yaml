  content: "   The Route Constrain address family can be used by a BGP speaker to\n
    \  signal a neighbor its interest in receiving only the routes with a\n   matching
    route target (RT) extended community.  This signaling is\n   afi-safi agnostic;
    the sender of a route constrain NLRI with an RT\n   expresses its interest in
    receiving routes with that RT for all afi-\n   safi.  The ability to further scope
    a given RT to a list of afi-safi\n   would simplify network operations; then optimal
    route filtering would\n   no longer require that the set of RTs used for different
    afi-safi be\n   disjoint.\n\n   This document proposes a simple extended community
    based backward\n   compatible method to associate the list of afi-safi of interest
    to a\n   route constrain NLRI and discusses the operational procedure.\n\n\n\t "

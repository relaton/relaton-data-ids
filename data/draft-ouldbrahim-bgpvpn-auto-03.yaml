  script: Latn
  content: "In any Network-Based VPN (NBVPN) scheme, the Provider Edge (PE)\nrouters
    attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information\nas a prerequisite
    to establish VPN-specific connectivity. In\n[RFC2547-bis], VPN-specific routes
    are exchanged, along with the\ninformation needed to enable a PE to determine
    which routes belong\nto which VPNs. In [VPN-VR], VR addresses must be exchanged,
    along\nwith the information needed to enable the PEs to determine which VRs\nare
    in the same VPN ('membership'), and which of those VRs are to\nhave VPN connectivity
    ('topology'). Once the VRs are reachable\nthrough the tunnels, routes ('reachability')
    are then exchanged by\nrunning existing routing protocol per VPN basis. The purpose
    of this\ndraft is to define a common BGP based auto-discovery mechanism used\nfor
    both the virtual router [VPN-VR] and [RFC2547-bis]\narchitectures. Each scheme
    uses the mechanism to automatically\ndiscover the information needed by that particular
    scheme.\nInterworking scenarios between [RFC2547-bis] and the virtual router\nmodels
    are also discussed.\n\t "

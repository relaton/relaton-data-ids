  content: "   This document describes how to support unidirectional links in OSPF
    \n   and addresses its challenges. Unidirectional link routing (UDLR) \n   describes
    a link-layer tunneling mechanism in order to abstract the\n   network layer from
    unidirectional links and makes it transparent to\n   routing protocols. Although
    this solution can be used, it can be \n   cumbersome for user due to configured
    tunnels and generates extra\n   overhead for control packets and encapsulation
    of tunnels. This\n   document proposes the necessary  extensions to OSPF in order
    to\n   support unidirectional links.\n\t "

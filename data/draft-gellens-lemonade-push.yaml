  content: "This document describes an IMAP protocol extension allowing clients\nto
    submit new messages using IMAP.  This is the so-called 'IMAP\nPush' approach currently
    being considered by the lemonade working\ngroup as one solution to the 'forward
    without download' problem\n(that is, as a means for clients to send new messages
    consisting of\nor containing all or parts of previously received messages without\nhaving
    to download and upload the data).  This proposal relies on\nadditional IMAP extensions,
    including CATENATE and Annotations.  The\nIMAP extension described here requires
    that the message to be\nsubmitted be already composed and ready to go at the time
    of\nsubmission.\n\t "

  content: "   This memo is a random list of things the author noticed about EAP-\n
    \  NOOB when looking at the draft and running the implementation while\n   capturing
    the packets (https://github.com/Vogeltak/hostap).\n\n   Most of the statements
    were written down before the author started\n   the implementation.  By the time
    of writing this draft, a mostly\n   complete server implementation has been written.
    \ The implementation-\n   specific remarks are mostly thoughts the author had
    while planning\n   their own implementation.\n\n\t "

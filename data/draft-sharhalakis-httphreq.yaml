  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a method that extends HTTP to support\n   optional
    on-demand headers as an addition to its dialogs.  Any server\n   side application
    using this method becomes able to request additional\n   headers from conforming
    HTTP clients.  It can also serve as an\n   intermediate step for introducing new
    HTTP headers without placing\n   the need for always exchanging them.\n\n   An
    additional HTTP header is described and its ABNF description is\n   provided.
    \ IANA is requested to extend its HTTP registry to support\n   the 'on-demand'
    flag.  IANA is also requested to provide support for\n   header names that actually
    identify groups of headers.\n\n\t "

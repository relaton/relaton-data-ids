  content: "   This document lists values for the S/MIME Capabilities Attribute.  \n
    \  The attribute itself is defined in RFC TBD1, but the values for each \n   are
    defined in separate algorithm documents and in some cases not at \n   all.  The
    SMIME Capability values can be included in S/MIME messages \n   as a signed attribute
    and in public key certificates as an extension. \n\n   //RFC EDITOR: Replace TBD1
    with the # assigned to draft-ietf-smime-\n   3851bis-10.txt. \n\t "

  content: "   \"Traffic Localization\" is proposed to release the pressure of\n   backbone
    mobile networks brought by increasing multimedia\n   applications.  A universal
    storage protocol is needed to serve the\n   purpose on the edge storage nodes.
    \ As the three candidates, HTTP,\n   NFS and iSCSI are compared concerning their
    implementation and\n   performance on embeded clients and servers in this paper.
    \ Their\n   differences are discussed based on the experiment, and our suggestion\n
    \  for universal storage protocols on edge storage nodes are put\n   forward.\n\n\t "

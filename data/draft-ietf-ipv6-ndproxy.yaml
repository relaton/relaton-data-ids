  content: "Bridging multiple links into a single entity has several operational advantages.
    \ A single subnet prefix is sufficient to support multiple physical links.  There
    is no need to allocate subnet numbers to the different networks, simplifying management.
    \ Bridging some types of media requires network-layer support, however.  This
    document describes these cases and specifies the IP-layer support that enables
    bridging under these circumstances.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In space-terrestrial integrated networks, the motion of LEO\n   satellites
    relative to ground terminals is inevitable and can trigger\n   the reassignment
    of terminal IP addresses, disrupting ongoing TCP\n   connections.  The traditional
    Mobile IP protocol solves this problem\n   using a home agent and tunneling mechanism.
    \ However, for space-\n   terrestrial integrated networks, Mobile IP is inefficient
    due to\n   increased latency when registering with the remote home agent, high\n
    \  packet loss caused by large registration latency, and triangular\n   routing
    to the remote home agent.  To address these issues, this\n   draft proposes LISP-LEO,
    a location/identity separation-based\n   mobility management protocol for LEO
    satellite networks.\n   Specifically, LISP-LEO divides the Earth's surface into
    partitions\n   and maintains a partition-satellite mapping table in real-time
    based\n   on the regularity of satellite motion.  LISP-LEO always routes\n   traffic
    to the satellite above the destined terminal by querying the\n   partition-satellite
    mapping table, eliminating triangular routing and\n   related performance overheads.
    \ Additionally, LISP-LEO proposes a\n   last-hop relay to handle the corner case
    when multiple satellites\n   occur above the destined terminal.\n\n\t "

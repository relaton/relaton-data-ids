  content: "   Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning\n
    \  program information including addresses of the multicast groups\n   corresponding
    to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver.\n   During the transition from
    IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where\n   the IP version supported by the receiver
    differs from that supported\n   by the source.  This memo examines and evaluates
    alternative\n   strategies for allowing the receiver to acquire multicast address\n
    \  information in the version it supports in such scenarios.  Operators\n   may
    find this review useful when planning their own transition\n   strategy.\n\n\t "

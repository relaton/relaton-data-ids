  content: "   This document describes a simple process that allows authors of\n   Internet-Drafts
    to record the status of known implementations by\n   including an Implementation
    Status section.  This will allow\n   reviewers and working groups to assign due
    consideration to documents\n   that have the benefit of running code, which may
    serve as evidence of\n   valuable experimentation and feedback that have made
    the implemented\n   protocols more mature.\n\n   This process is not mandatory.
    \ Authors of Internet-Drafts are\n   encouraged to consider using the process
    for their documents, and\n   working groups are invited to think about applying
    the process to all\n   of their protocol specifications.  This document obsoletes
    RFC 6982,\n   advancing it to a Best Current Practice.\n\n\t "

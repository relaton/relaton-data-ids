  script: Latn
  content: "   The forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol \n
    \  defines a standard communication and control mechanism through which \n   a
    Control Element (CE) can control the behavior of a Forwarding \n   Element (FE).
    That control is accomplished through manipulating \n   attributes of Logical Function
    Blocks (LFBs), whose structure is \n   defined in a model RFC produced by the
    working group. In order to \n   build an actual solution based on this protocol,
    defining a set of \n   Logical Function Block definitions that can be instantiated
    by FEs \n   and controlled by CEs is welcome. A base library definition of LFBs
    \n   is already given in library [5]. VPN (Virtual Private Network) \n   services,
    as a kind of important services widely employed in Internet, \n   will certainly
    be implemented in routers using this protocol. This \n   document provides an
    initial set of VPN LFB definitions  in \n   particular, a set of tunnel encapsulator
    and decapsulator LFBs. It is \n   anticipated that additional VPN-related LFB
    definitions like L2VPN, \n   L3VPN can be defined over time.  \n\n\t "

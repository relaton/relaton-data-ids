  content: "   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a routing protocol for autonomous\n
    \  systems running on TCP.  It is currently the only protocol capable of\n   handling
    multiple connections between unrelated routing domains, such\n   as the size of
    the Internet.  BGP is built on the experience of EGP.\n\n   The main function
    of BGP system is to exchange network access\n   information with other BGP systems.
    \ However, it cannot fully utilize\n   the complete information in the domain
    to achieve the optimal\n   decision.  This document proposes I2BGP, which describes
    how to\n   obtain desensitization information in the domain to optimize routing\n
    \  decisions.\n\n\t "

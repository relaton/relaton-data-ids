  content: "The current memo documents extensions to ICMP that permit Label \nSwitching
    Routers to append MPLS header information to ICMP \nmessages. These ICMP extensions
    support an MPLS aware traceroute \napplication that network operators can use
    to trace paths through \nthe MPLS user plane. \nAlthough these extensions are
    not being proposed as Internet \nStandards, they are documented here because they
    have been \nimplemented by several vendors and deployed by several operators.\n\t "

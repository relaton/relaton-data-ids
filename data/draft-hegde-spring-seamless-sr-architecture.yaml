  content: "   In order to operate networks with large numbers of devices, network\n
    \  operators organize networks into multiple smaller network domains.\n   Each
    network domain typically runs an IGP which has complete\n   visibility within
    its own domain, but limited visibility outside of\n   its domain.  Seamless Segment
    Routing (Seamless SR) provides\n   flexible, scalable and reliable end-to-end
    connectivity for services\n   across independent network domains.  Seamless SR
    accommodates domains\n   using SR, LDP, and RSVP for MPLS label distribution as
    well as\n   domains running IP without MPLS (IP-Fabric).It also provides seamless\n
    \  connectivity across domains having different IPv6 technologies such\n   as
    SRv6 and SRm6.\n\n\n\t "

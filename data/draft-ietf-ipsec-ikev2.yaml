  content: "This document describes version 2 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol.
    IKE is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication and establishing
    and maintaining security associations (SAs).\n\n This version of the IKE specification
    combines the contents of what were previously separate documents, including Internet
    Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP, RFC 2408), IKE (RFC
    2409), the Internet Domain of Interpretation (DOI, RFC 2407), Network Address
    Translation (NAT) Traversal, Legacy authentication, and remote address acquisition.\n\n
    Version 2 of IKE does not interoperate with version 1, but it has enough of the
    header format in common that both versions can unambiguously run over the same
    UDP port. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a solution to discover the capabilities of
    a\n   flow-aware service function.  The solution relies upon the use of the\n
    \  Port Control Protocol (PCP).\n\n   This solution allows for applications to
    anticipate connectivity\n   failures and to proceed with countermeasures (e.g.,
    create a mapping\n   for incoming connections, discover a mapping lifetime, discover
    an\n   external IP address, avoid injecting some options in the outgoing\n   packets,
    etc.).  The propsoed approach allows, for example, to\n   discover whether an
    upstream flow-aware service function is MPTCP-\n   friendly (that is, it does
    not strip MPTCP signals) or SCTP-\n   compliant, whether it embeds a firewall
    function, etc. or a\n   combination thereof.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>IPFIX Flow Aggregation describes a methodology for reducing the amount
    of measurement data exchanged between monitoring devices (IPFIX Exporters) and
    analyzers (IPFIX Collectors). Aggregation techniques represent a necessary enhancement
    in order to cope with increasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the
    ever- growing network capacities. Using Flow Selection Criteria and Compound Flow
    creation techniques, measurement information of multiple Flows that are sharing
    some common criteria is merged to be exported in one Compound Flow. Subsets of
    Flows eligible for aggregation, as well as the desired degree of similarity, can
    be customized using a set of Aggregation Rules.</p>"

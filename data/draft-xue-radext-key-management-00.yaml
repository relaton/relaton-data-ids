  content: "   In order to guarantee the security and integration of the subscriber\n
    \  in WLAN network, Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will be generated as an\n   access
    authorization token during the mutual authentication procedure\n   between station
    (STA) and authenticator server (AS).  Then, the PMK\n   and 4-way handshake are
    used between STA and Authenticator to derive,\n   bind and verify the Pairwise
    Transient Key (PTK), which is a\n   collection of operational keys for security.
    \ Also,Group Transient\n   Key (GTK) can be derived, and is used to secure multicast/broadcast\n
    \  traffic.  In the authentication architecture, only STA and AS can\n   manufacture
    PMK, moreover, AS can only distribute PMK to\n   Authenticator.However, if the
    authenticator function is not\n   collocated with the encryption/decryption function,
    it is difficult\n   to achieve traffic encryption/decryption in WLAN network.The
    purpose\n   of this document is to analyze the requirement and issue for key\n
    \  management that have arisen so far during STA authentication process\n   in
    WLAN network.  Meanwhile, the control messages for key management\n   are defined.\n\n\t "

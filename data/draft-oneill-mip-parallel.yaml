- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Nested MIP [NestMIP] provides a means to support both localization and
    \naggregation of MIP signalling. It achieves this by providing two distinct layers
    of MIP signalling and forwarding; a local access layer that provides local mobility
    management and local access services, and a remote access layer that provides
    remote access back to a home subnet. Nested MIP and an associated proposal, Concatenated
    MIP [ConcatMIP] are necessary because existing MIP signalling is HA/HoA specific
    and therefore not easily amenable to aggregation for supporting multiple MIP sessions
    per MN. \nThis document describes an alternative proposal for introducing aggregation
    that has significantly lower functionality but that is a smaller change from existing
    MIP standards and implementations. It is described here for completeness as part
    of the overall problem space. The solution uses a single HA/HoA specific MIP Registration
    as a master signal within which is carried an extension that defines  an include/exclude
    list of the other HA/HoA pairs that should/should not be handed off. This extension
    can be carried in inter-FA hand-off signals and in regional registrations, and
    is also used within Nested/Concat MIP.\n\t "

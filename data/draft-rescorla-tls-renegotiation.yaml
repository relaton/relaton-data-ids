abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "SSL and TLS renegotiation are vulnerable to an attack in which the\nattacker
    forms a TLS connection with the target server, injects\ncontent of his choice,
    and then splices in a new TLS connection from\na client.  The server treats the
    client's initial TLS handshake as a\nrenegotiation and thus believes that the
    initial data transmitted by\nthe attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent
    client data.\nThis draft defines a TLS extension to cryptographically tie\nrenegotiations
    to the TLS connections they are being performed over,\nthus preventing this attack.\n\t "

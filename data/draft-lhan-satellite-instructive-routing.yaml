  content: "   This document presents a method to do IP routing over satellite\n   network
    that consists of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites and ground-\n   stations.  The
    method uses the source routing mechanism.  The whole\n   routing info is obtained
    by path calculation.  The routing path\n   information is converted to be a list
    of instructions and embedded\n   into user packet's IPv6 extension header.  At
    each hop or each\n   satellite, the routing process engine will forward the packet
    based\n   on the specified instruction for the satellite.  Until the packet\n
    \  reaches the edge of satellite network, or the last satellite, the\n   packet
    will be sent to a ground station.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Current SMTP RFCs are interpreted by some as requiring non delivery\n
    \  notice to be sent, even when the \"reverse-path\" is forged by a\n   virus.
    \ Some ISPs are now dropping such messages silently.  Silent\n   dropping of such
    messages should be encouraged under certain\n   circumstances, however this should
    not be taken as a permananet\n   carte-blanch  to silently discard any message
    that one does not like.\n\t "

  content: "Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC2960] provides transparent\nmulti-homing
    to its upper layer users. This multi-homing is\naccomplished through the passing
    of address parameters in the\ninitial setup message used by SCTP. In an IPv4 network
    all addresses\nare passed with no consideration for their scope and routeablility.\nIn
    a IPv6 network special considerations MUST be made to properly\nbring up associations
    between SCTP endpoints that have IPv6\n[RFC2460] addresses bound within their
    association.  This document\ndefines those considerations and enumerates general
    rules\nthat an SCTP endpoint MUST use in formulating both the INIT and\nINIT-ACK
    chunks.\n\t "

  content: "As emerging real-time services on the Internet, such as Voice over IP\n(VoIP),
    increase their visibility, a security framework has to be\nprovided. In particular,
    confidentiality is a main concern in the\nmultimedia scenario.\nTo support full
    flexibility of the services, a solution with IP all\nthe way (to the terminal)
    is believed to offer advantages, if\ntechnically and economically feasible. Therefore,
    new requirements\nhave to be met on cellular access networks, and this has an
    impact on\nthe security solutions.\n\n\n\t "

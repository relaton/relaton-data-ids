  content: "This document describes a transport-layer mobility solution for the\nInternet
    termed Cellular SCTP, or cSCTP for short, based on the\nemerging Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol (SCTP). We suggested to\nuse `two primary addresses simultaneously'
    by duplicating the packet\ntransmissions (while halving the transmission rate)
    during handoff to\nprovide `soft' handover. Moreover, we described the inter-working
    of\ncSCTP with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to facilitate location\nmanagement
    function when Correspondent Nodes (CNs) initiate the\nassociations and need to
    locate Mobile Nodes (MNs).\n\t "

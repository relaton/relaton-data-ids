  content: "   This document describes simple and backward compatible extensions to\n
    \  Fast-Reroute (FRR) MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE).  The purpose of\n   these
    extensions include the following.  These extensions provide a\n   classification
    of SRLG to support LSP with differing protection\n   requirements.  These extensions
    allow highly reliable nodes or links,\n   typically resources with redundancy
    at a lower layer, to be\n   identified to allow LSP to optionally not consider
    these resources as\n   potential points of failure.\n\n\n\t "

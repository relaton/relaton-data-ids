abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an AI-assisted framework for automating the
    testing of network protocol implementations. The proposed framework consists of
    components such as protocol formalization, test case generation, test script and
    configuration generation, and iterative refinement through feedback mechanisms.
    In addition, the document defines a set of Automation Maturity Levels for network
    protocol testing, ranging from fully manual procedures (Level 0) to fully autonomous
    and adaptive systems (Level 5), providing a structured approach to evaluating
    and advancing automation capabilities. Leveraging recent advancements in artificial
    intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), the framework illustrates
    how AI technologies can be applied to enhance the efficiency, scalability, and
    consistency of protocol testing. This document serves both as a reference architecture
    and as a roadmap to guide the evolution of protocol testing practices in light
    of emerging AI capabilities.</p>"

  content: "   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) allows clients to\n   \"observe\"
    resources at a server and to receive notifications as\n   unicast responses upon
    changes of the resource state.  Instead of\n   sending a distinct unicast notification
    to each different client, a\n   server can alternatively send a single notification
    as a response\n   message over multicast, to all the clients observing the same
    target\n   resource.  When doing so, the security protocol Group Object Security\n
    \  for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) can be used to\n   protect
    multicast notifications end-to-end between the server and the\n   observer clients.
    \ This document describes how multicast\n   notifications can be used in network
    setups that leverage a proxy,\n   e.g., in order to accommodate clients that are
    not able to directly\n   listen to multicast traffic.\n\n\n\n   The present version
    -00 refers to version -12 of draft-ietf-core-\n   observe-multicast-notifications,
    which includes content about proxies\n   that is also included in the present
    document.  Such content will be\n   removed from draft-ietf-core-observe-multicast-notifications
    in its\n   next revision.\n\n\t "

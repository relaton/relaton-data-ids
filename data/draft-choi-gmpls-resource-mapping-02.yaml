  content: "The new forms of label used in GMPLS to deal with the widening scope \nof
    MPLS into the optical and time domain are collectively referred to\nas a 'Generalized
    Label' related to resource. In this draft, we\ndescribe the relationship of labels
    and resources. We also describe\nthe resource mapping methods for GMPLS with heterogeneous
    interfaces.\nParticularly we present the methods for resource mapping at incoming\nand
    outgoing switching interface where data flows with label of a\ndifferent granularity
    are aggregated into the data flow of large\nbandwidth.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Data At Rest Envelope (DARE) Envelope and
    Sequence. The DARE Envelope syntax is used to package plaintext or encrypted content
    payload and metadata with JOSE decryption and signature data authenticating the
    payload and metadata. The DARE Sequence format comprises a sequence of DARE Envelopes.
    The binary encoding of DARE envelopes allows compact encoding of encrypted and
    signed payloads of unknown length in a single pass with minimal overhead. The
    binary encoding of DARE sequences is designed to support an append only write
    mode and efficient reading in either the forwards or backwards directions. The
    JSON encoding of DARE Envelopes and sequences allows envelopes and sequences to
    be incorporated in other JSON objects. This document does not cover construction
    of indexes or signatures over multiple entries in a sequence.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes the Data At Rest Envelope (DARE) Envelope and\n
    \  Sequence.  The DARE Envelope syntax is used to package plaintext or\n   encrypted
    content payload and metadata with JOSE decryption and\n   signature data authenticating
    the payload and metadata.  The DARE\n   Sequence format comprises a sequence of
    DARE Envelopes.\n\n   The binary encoding of DARE envelopes allows compact encoding
    of\n   encrypted and signed payloads of unknown length in a single pass with\n
    \  minimal overhead.  The binary encoding of DARE sequences is designed\n   to
    support an append only write mode and efficient reading in either\n   the forwards
    or backwards directions.  The JSON encoding of DARE\n   Envelopes and sequences
    allows envelopes and sequences to be\n   incorporated in other JSON objects.\n\n
    \  This document does not cover construction of indexes or signatures\n   over
    multiple entries in a sequence.\n\n\t "

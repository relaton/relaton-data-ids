  content: "There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resource \n   provisioning
    solution for Diffserv networks. This is an updated \n   version of the old draft
    (previous version was submitted in \n   April 2000) describing a concept called
    Load Control. \n\n   Load Control addresses the following issues:\n\n     1. Admission
    control for real time data flows in stateless domains\n\n     2. Dropping of flows
    in case of exceptional events, such as \n        severe congestion after re-routing\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a method to encode routing information in\n
    \  Firewall and Service Tickets (FAST). Encoded routing information\n   provides
    the local routing for packets sent in either the forward or\n   return paths of
    a flow. FAST ticket reflection at peer hosts ensures\n   that the routing information
    is attached to packets being sent in the\n   return path. When a packet with a
    FAST ticket containing routing\n   information enters the network in which the
    ticket was issued, the\n   ticket is parsed to extract the routing information
    and is forwarded\n   per the information. Routing in Firewall and Service Tickets
    has a\n   number of use cases. It can be used as a type of source routing, used\n
    \  with identifier-locator protocols to provide a locator in the return\n   path,
    and can be used to specify a backend instance in Layer 4 load\n   balancing for
    processing connections to a virtual IP address.\n\n\t "

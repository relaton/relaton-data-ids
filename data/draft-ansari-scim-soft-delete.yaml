  content: "   The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\n
    \  is an HTTP based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-\n   domain
    scenarios easier to support through a standardized HTTP\n   service.\n\n   Among
    other operations, SCIM defines delete operation where upon\n   successful completion
    of the call, the SCIM endpoint is supposed to\n   delete the requested object
    and the object should not be available\n   for future SCIM calls and not used
    in uniqueness criteria\n   requirements.\n\n   While this model is sufficient
    for a number of SCIM implementations,\n   there are cases this simple definition
    of delete may not meet product\n   or business requirements.  For example a service
    provider may require\n   a user object to continue to exist as other objects/data
    is linked\n   with it or for billing purposes, etc.  For example a cloud file\n
    \  storage mechanism may require to show basic information about who\n   created
    a given file or modified one even if the user is de-\n   provisioned from the
    system.\n\n\t "

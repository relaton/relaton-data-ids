- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There are many proposals for improving the Inter-domain routing\nsystem,
    most of which involve a form of locater-identity split.\nThere needs to be a means
    to reason about the strengths of the\ndifferent proposals against the design criteria,
    and without\nrequiring large scale implementations.  This document aims to start\nthis
    process by drawing parallels with existing systems.  It\nidentifies a number of
    questions that need to be more fully thought\nabout whilst we press ahead with
    system development.\n\t "

  content: "This document lists logging capabilities originally defined in\n   RFC3871
    and needed to support the current practices, including those\n   described in
    the Operational Security Current Practices\n   document[CURPRAC] Logging is defined
    as the delivery to another\n   entity or system of messages about the device,
    the data passing\n   through the device, or the device's interaction with another
    device.\n\n   Capabilities are defined without reference to specific technologies.\n
    \  This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that\n   implement
    the capability.  Each capability cites the practices it\n   supports.  Current
    implementations that support the capability are\n   cited.  Special considerations
    are discussed as appropriate listing\n   operational and resource constraints,
    limitations of current\n   implementations, trade offs, etc.\n\t "

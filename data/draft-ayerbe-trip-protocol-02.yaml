  content: "   This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity\n
    \  Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for establishing\n   claims
    of physical-world presence through cryptographically signed,\n   spatially quantized
    location attestations called \"breadcrumbs.\"\n   Breadcrumbs are chained into
    an append-only log, bundled into\n   verifiable epochs, and distilled into a Trajectory
    Identity Token\n   (TIT) that serves as a persistent pseudonymous identifier.\n\n
    \  The protocol employs a Criticality Engine grounded in statistical\n   physics
    to distinguish biological movement from synthetic\n   trajectories.  Power Spectral
    Density analysis detects the 1/f\n   signature of Self-Organized Criticality in
    human mobility.  A six-\n   component Hamiltonian energy function scores each
    breadcrumb against\n   the identity's learned behavioral profile in real time.\n\n
    \  This revision formalizes the mapping to the RATS Architecture (RFC\n   9334),
    clarifies the Verifier trust model including support for\n   multiple independent
    Verifiers, introduces an active challenge-\n   response verification protocol
    that binds Attestation Results to\n   specific Relying Party requests with cryptographic
    freshness, and\n   corrects the privacy model to accurately describe the flow
    of\n   Evidence between Attester and Verifier.\n\n   TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic
    and operates independently\n   of any particular naming system, blockchain, or
    application layer.\n\n\t "

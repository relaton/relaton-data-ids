abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity
    Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for establishing claims of physical-world
    presence through cryptographically signed, spatially quantized location attestations
    called "breadcrumbs." Breadcrumbs are chained into an append-only log, bundled
    into verifiable epochs, and distilled into a Trajectory Identity Token (TIT) that
    serves as a persistent pseudonymous identifier. The protocol employs a Criticality
    Engine grounded in statistical physics to distinguish biological movement from
    synthetic trajectories. Power Spectral Density analysis detects the 1/f signature
    of Self-Organized Criticality in human mobility. A six- component Hamiltonian
    energy function scores each breadcrumb against the identity's learned behavioral
    profile in real time. This revision formalizes the mapping to the RATS Architecture
    (RFC 9334), clarifies the Verifier trust model including support for multiple
    independent Verifiers, introduces an active challenge- response verification protocol
    that binds Attestation Results to specific Relying Party requests with cryptographic
    freshness, and corrects the privacy model to accurately describe the flow of Evidence
    between Attester and Verifier. TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic and operates
    independently of any particular naming system, blockchain, or application layer.</p>

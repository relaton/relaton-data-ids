  content: "   This document proposes a comprehensive security solution for mobile
    \n   IPv6 networks including secure binding update, secure fast handover, \n   user
    authentication and session key management for data security. In \n   our proposal,
    one of the home agent's functions is to act as \n   security proxy for its mobile
    nodes. The authentication is based on \n   the home agent's certificate and the
    secret session keys are \n   generated by strong cryptosystems. Our proposal avoids
    many security \n   obstacles in the Return Routability protocol and provides a
    simple, \n   integrated and efficient security solution for mobile communication.\n\t "

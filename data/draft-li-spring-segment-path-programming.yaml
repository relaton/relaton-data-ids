  content: "   Segment Routing for unicast traffic has been proposed to cope with\n
    \  the usecases in traffic engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain,\n   etc.
    \ The document generalizes more use cases based on segment and\n   proposes the
    concept of Segment Path Programming.  In the field of\n   Segment Path Programming:
    1.  The Segment used in the programmed\n   segment path is not only used in the
    forwarding plane, but also used\n   in the control plane. 2.  The programmed segment
    path is not only\n   used in the transport layer, but also used in the service
    layer.\n   Accordingly this document proposes use cases, architecture and\n   protocol
    extension requirements for the Segment Path Programming\n   (SPP).\n\n\n\t "

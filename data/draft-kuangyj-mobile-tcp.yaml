abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines two types of IP addresses to support mobile TCP\n
    \  -  one  for  routing  and location  management,  the  other  for host\n   identification.
    \  Therefore,   the  dependency   of   TCP/UDP  socket\n   identification upon
    the network layer is eliminated, and transmission\n   sessions will  be no  longer
    dependent  of network  layer IP address,\n   that is, location changes of a mobile
    host result only new network IP\n   address, which has no  impact on transmission
    communications  and its\n   continuity.\n\t "

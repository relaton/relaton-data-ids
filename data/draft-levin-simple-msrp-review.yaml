abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper shows that the currently defined per-message hop-by-hop
    mechanism doesn22t scale for large deployments and is not feasible for scalable
    IM conferencing. Instead, the paper proposes to replace this mechanism with an
    MSRP layer per TCP connection keep-alive mechanism. This paper also reinforces
    the need for the end-to-end mechanism to be defined in the core MSRP specification
    and to become the abstraction for all MSRP applications regardless the underlying
    topology in use.</p>"

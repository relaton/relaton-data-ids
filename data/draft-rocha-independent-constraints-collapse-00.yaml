abstract:
- content: "<p>Real-time communication systems evolved by solving discrete problems
    independently: session establishment, transport, media handling, security, analytics,
    and compliance were addressed as separate concerns. For two decades, the resulting
    architectural fragmentation was tolerable. That tolerance has ended. This document
    argues that the convergence of Zero Trust security requirements, AI-driven computational
    demands, accessibility mandates, data residency enforcement, and next-generation
    transport capabilities now exceeds the coordination capacity of fragmented architectures.
    The failure is not incremental but fundamental: real-time systems lack a control
    layer capable of maintaining continuous session identity across orchestration,
    policy enforcement, and computation. This architectural gap was not anticipated
    by existing standards or platform designs. Its recognition requires reduction
    rather than expansion, collapsing fragmented contexts into unified session governance.
    This document examines the historical evolution that produced this gap, analyzes
    why current approaches fail under convergent pressures, and articulates the architectural
    constraint necessary for future systems.</p>"

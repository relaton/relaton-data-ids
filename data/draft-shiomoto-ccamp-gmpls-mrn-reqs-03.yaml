  content: "     Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been
    \n     related to environments hosting devices with a single switching \n     capability.
    The complexity raised by the control of such data \n     planes is similar to
    that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks. \n      \n     By extending MPLS to support
    multiple switching technologies, GMPLS \n     provides a comprehensive framework
    for the control of a multi-\n     layered network of either a single switching
    technology or multiple \n     switching technologies. In GMPLS, a switching technology
    domain \n     defines a region, and a network of multiple switching types is \n
    \    referenced in this document as a multi-region network (MRN). When \n     referring
    in general to a layered network, which may consist of \n     either a single or
    multiple regions, this document uses the term, \n     Multi-layer Network (MLN).
    This draft defines a framework for GMPLS \n     based multi-region/multi-layer
    networks and lists a set of \n     functional requirements. \n\t "

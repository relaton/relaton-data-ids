  content: "   This text describes the command/response protocol currently used in\n
    \  the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and other\n   power
    devices often deployed in small offices, and in IT\n   installations subject to
    an erratic public power supply.  The UPS\n   units typically interface to an Attachment
    Daemon in the system they\n   protect.  This daemon is in turn polled by a Management
    Daemon which\n   notifies users and system administrators of power supply incidents,\n
    \  and takes system shutdown decisions.  The commands and responses\n   described
    by this text are exchanged between the UPS Attachment\n   Daemon and the Management
    Daemon.  Current practice leads to weak\n   security and this is addressed in
    the Security and IANA\n   Considerations.\n\n\t "

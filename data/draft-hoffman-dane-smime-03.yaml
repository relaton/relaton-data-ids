abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   S/MIME uses certificates for authenticating and encrypting messages.\n
    \  Users want their mail user agents to securely associate a certificate\n   with
    the sender of an encrypted and/or signed message.  DNSSEC\n   provides a mechanism
    for a zone operator to sign DNS information\n   directly.  This way, bindings
    of certificates to users within a\n   domain are asserted not by external entities,
    but by the entities\n   that operate the DNS.  This document describes how to
    use secure DNS\n   to associate an S/MIME user's certificate with the intended
    domain\n   name.\n\n   IMPORTANT NOTE: This draft is intentionally sketchy.  It
    is meant as\n   a possible starting point for the DANE WG if it wants to consider\n
    \  making a protocol similar to TLSA, as described in\n   draft-ietf-dane-protocol,
    but that applies to S/MIME.  The WG may or\n   may not want to adopt such work,
    or if it does, may want to use a\n   very different scheme from the one described
    here.\n\n\t "

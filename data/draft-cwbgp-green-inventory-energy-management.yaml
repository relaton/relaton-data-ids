  content: "   As a complement to the YANG Network Topology Data Model for Energy\n
    \  Efficiency Management, which is used for monitoring the dynamic\n   energy
    consumption of network devices, this document defines YANG\n   Network Inventory
    Data Model for Energy Efficiency Management that\n   can be used for maintaining
    capability related energy efficiency\n   attributes.  The model provides both
    network view and device view of\n   energy efficiency related inventory information.\n\n\t "

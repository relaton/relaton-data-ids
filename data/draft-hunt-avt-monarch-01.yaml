abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCP\nXR
    (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media\ntransmission or reception
    quality, as proposed in\ndraft-ietf-avt-rtcp-guidelines (work in progress [replace
    with RFC\nnumber]).  This memo suggests that a new block should contain a\nsingle
    metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single\nparameter of interest
    or concern, rather than containing a number of\nmetrics which attempt to provide
    full coverage of all those\nparameters of concern to a specific application.  Applications
    may\nthen \"mix and match\" to create a set of blocks which covers their set\nof
    concerns.  Where possible, a specific block should be designed to\nbe re-usable
    across more than one application, for example, for all\nof voice, streaming audio
    and video.\n\t "

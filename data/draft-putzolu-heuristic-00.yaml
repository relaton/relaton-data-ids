  content: "   The ISSLOW subgroup of the ISSL working group has defined a set of\n
    \  mechanisms for providing integrated services over low bandwidth\n   links [1].
    These mechanisms rely on an announcement protocol\n   (typically RSVP [2]) to
    determine which streams require other than\n   best-effort service and to determine
    what level and type of service\n   to provide for such streams. It is anticipated
    that at least some of\n   the mechanisms defined by the ISSLOW subgroup, specifically\n
    \  Compressed RTP [3] (CRTP) [4] and Multi-Channel Multi-Link PPP\n   (MCML) [5],
    will be available well before RSVP has been widely\n   deployed.\n \n   Given
    the proliferation of applications streaming audio and video\n   using the mechanisms
    defined in the AVT working group (e.g., RTP), a\n   means of utilizing these mechanisms
    in the absence of an\n   announcement protocol would be beneficial. Such means
    have been\n   proposed in [6], but they require changes to applications so as
    to\n   be able to indicate the need for special treatment. This document\n   describes
    a set of heuristics for use with the mechanisms defined in\n   the ISSLOW subgroup
    that provide an enhanced degree of service for\n   audio/video streaming applications
    without requiring that changes be\n   made to applications. The approach taken
    is to provide a default set\n   of heuristics that implementations of MCML and
    CRTP can use to\n   provide enhanced service over PPP links for audio and video
    streams\n   without requiring any application or infrastructure changes.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Real-time communication systems evolved by solving discrete problems\n
    \  independently: session establishment, transport, media handling,\n   security,
    analytics, and compliance were addressed as separate\n   concerns.  For two decades,
    the resulting architectural\n   fragmentation was tolerable.  That tolerance has
    ended.  This\n   document argues that the convergence of Zero Trust security\n
    \  requirements, AI-driven computational demands, accessibility\n   mandates,
    data residency enforcement, and next-generation transport\n   capabilities now
    exceeds the coordination capacity of fragmented\n   architectures.  The failure
    is not incremental but fundamental:\n   real-time systems lack a control layer
    capable of maintaining\n   continuous session identity across orchestration, policy\n
    \  enforcement, and computation.  This architectural gap was not\n   anticipated
    by existing standards or platform designs.  Its\n   recognition requires reduction
    rather than expansion, collapsing\n   fragmented contexts into unified session
    governance.  This document\n   examines the historical evolution that produced
    this gap, analyzes\n   why current approaches fail under convergent pressures,
    and\n   articulates the architectural constraint necessary for future\n   systems.\n\n\n\t "

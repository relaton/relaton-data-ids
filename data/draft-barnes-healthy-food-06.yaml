  content: "   This document describes the basic requirements for food for folks\n
    \  that attend IETF meetings require special diets, as well as those\n   that
    prefer to eat healthy.  While, the variety of special diets is\n   quite broad,
    the most general categories are described.  There can be\n   controversy as to
    what constitutes healthy eating, but there are some\n   common, generally available
    foods that comprise the basis for healthy\n   eating and special diets.  This
    document provides some\n   recommendations to meeting planners, as well as participants,
    in\n   handling these requirements.\n\n\t "

  content: "   BANdwidth Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA) based on tunnel\n
    \  bonding protocols and Multipath TCP (MPTCP) are two different\n   technology
    suites that offer subscribers with higher bandwidth and\n   reliability. MPTCP
    excels at conducting TCP traffic since its\n   flow/congestion control scheme
    has been well developed while tunnel\n   bonding protocols support not only TCP
    traffic but also UDP traffic.\n   The integration of the two kinds of technologies
    can be considered to\n   make use of advantages of both. Moreover, extensions
    made to the\n   tunnel bonding protocols can simplify the MPTCP stack and keep
    it\n   intact. This document specifies the extensions for tunnel bonding\n   protocols
    to realize integrative deployment of tunnel bonding\n   solutions and MPTCP.\n\n\t "

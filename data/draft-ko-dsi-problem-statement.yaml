  content: "   This document examines the problems and challenges associated with\n
    \  the process of setting up secure interconnections between authorized\n   network
    nodes.  The network nodes can be located anywhere in a\n   private or public network,
    directly connected or behind one or more\n   levels of NAT [NAT].  Setting up
    a secure interconnection in this\n   environment entails the resolution of various
    issues such as\n   authentication, peer discovery, virtual network address management,\n
    \  and connection parameters determination.\n\n\t "

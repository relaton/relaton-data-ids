  content: "The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] has been proposed as an access\nvehicle
    for public ATM networks. Support for multicast in this\nenvironment via either
    RAS replication, or a adding MARS client side by\nside with PPP is problematic
    on several fronts.\n \nThis document describes how an ATM attached system can
    act as a MARS\nproxy on behalf of a PPP client. This solution circumvents many
    of the\nassociated problems with respect to VC frugality, scalability, and\nauthentication.\n\t "

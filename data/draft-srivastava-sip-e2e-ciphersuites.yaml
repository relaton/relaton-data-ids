abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The security mechanism currently offered by SIP is essentially hop-\n
    \  by-hop and not end-to-end.  The current SIP specification doesn't\n   guarantee
    that a specific level of security (encryption, digest etc)\n   is employed at
    each hop.  This version of the draft outlines the\n   solution broadly.  As the
    solution progresses, it will have exact\n   details in the subsequent versions.\n\n\t "

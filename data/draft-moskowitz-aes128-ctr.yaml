  content: "This document describes the use of the AES Cipher Algorithm with 128\nbit
    key in Counter (CTR) Mode, with an implicit counter, as a\nconfidentiality mechanism
    within the context of the IPsec\nEncapsulating Security Payload [ESP].\nCTR is
    a parallelizable block-cipher mode of operation. It uses the\nunderlying block
    cipher as a stream cipher. Accordingly, great care\nmust be exercised to utilize
    it appropriately within IPsec.\n\t "

  content: "   IEEE 802.16 issued the new standards for PHY and MAC providing\n   broadband
    wireless access network.  Currently, it is being developed\n   under the assumption
    that IPv4 is used over it and the use of IPv6\n   over IEEE 802.16 networks has
    not been considered yet.  Hence, this\n   draft describes several problems in
    running NDP over IEEE 802.16\n   networks and presents some proposed solutions
    for those problems.\n\n\t "

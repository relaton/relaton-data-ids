  content: "   This document describes some characteristics of communication between\n
    \  nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network.  These are not\n   requirements
    in the sense usually understood as applying to\n   formulation of a requirements
    document.  Nevertheless, protocol\n   engineers and system analysts involved with
    designing solutions for\n   ad hoc networks must maintain awareness of these characteristics.\n\n\t "

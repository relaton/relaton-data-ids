  content: "   Voucher-Based Addressing is an extensible IPv6 address generation and\n
    \  verification methodology for SLAAC-enabled local networks.\n   Individual link-layer
    identifiers are bound to sets of deterministic\n   output IP addresses.  Neighbor
    Discovery Link Voucher options\n   distributed with Router Advertisement or Redirect
    messages form a\n   shared consensus between neighbors of the parameters used
    to auto-\n   generate interface addresses.  Cryptographic key derivation functions\n
    \  are used to generate pseudo-random addresses and to intentionally\n   stretch
    address computation times.  Host-selected parameters can be\n   used to derive
    any number of both stable and ephemeral, privacy-\n   focused addresses for each
    on-link prefix and at the link-local\n   scope.  Neighbors can then verify the
    link-layer-to-IP bindings\n   during NDP address resolution processes to prevent
    active neighbor\n   spoofing attacks in local networks.\n\n\t "

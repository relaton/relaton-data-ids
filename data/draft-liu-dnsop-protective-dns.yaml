  content: "   Protective DNS is a defense mechanism deployed on recursive resolvers\n
    \  to prevent users from accessing malicious domains.  For domain names\n   in
    the blocklist, it rewrites DNS resolution responses to point to\n   secure destinations
    (e.g., safe servers) to prevent users from\n   accessing malicious entities.\n\n
    \  Owing to its effective defenses against common cyber attack\n   behaviors—such
    as command-and-control (C2) communications of\n   malware—Protective DNS deployment
    has surged via various initiatives.\n   Not only have renowned DNS service providers
    adopted this defense,\n   but some countries have also launched national-scale
    deployments.\n   Meanwhile, studies analyzing Protective DNS have identified\n
    \  implementation diversity.\n\n   Thus, this document aims to provide specific
    operational and security\n   considerations for Protective DNS.  It is intended
    primarily for\n   entities seeking to deploy Protective DNS for defensive purposes,\n
    \  offering deployment and security considerations.\n\n\t "

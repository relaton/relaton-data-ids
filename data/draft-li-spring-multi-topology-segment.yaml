  content: "   Multi-Topologies (MTs) can be used for computing different paths for\n
    \  unicast traffic, multicast traffic, different classes of service\n   based
    on flexible criteria, or an in-band network management\n   topology.  This document
    proposes the multi-topology segment for\n   segment routing.  MRT FRR using multi-topology
    segment is described\n   as the use case to explains the procedures of the forwarding
    plane\n   and the control plane for multi-topology segment..\n\n\n\t "

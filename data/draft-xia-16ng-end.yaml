  content: "   This draft describes a possible optimization to Duplicate Address\n
    \  Detection (DAD) which can be used to successfully terminate DAD\n   early.
    \ The method is based on a positive RA message sent by an\n   Neighbor Discovery
    Relay Agent that knows all the IPv6 addresses of\n   the nodes currently attached
    to it.\n\n\t "

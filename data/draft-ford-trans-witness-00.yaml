  content: "   This document proposes a backward-compatible extension to CT enabling\n
    \  log servers to obtain compact collective signatures from any number\n   of
    well-known \"witness\" servers, which clients can check without\n   gossip to
    verify that log server records have been widely witnessed.\n   Collective signatures
    proactively protect clients from man-in-the-\n   middle attackers who may have
    stolen the private keys of one or more\n   log servers, even if the attacker controls
    the client's network\n   access, the client is unwilling to gossip for privacy
    reasons, or the\n   client does not wish to incur the network bandwidth and/or
    latency\n   costs of gossip.\n\n\t "

  content: "The need for assured communication arisen protocols like RSVP [2]\nand
    SBM [3] which are linked to access technologies to guarantee the\ndelay and drop
    probabilities of a given IP flow.\nOne of the side-effects of the assurance is
    that when the bandwidth\nof the IP flow goes outside the contracted region then
    the IP flow\nwill be disturbed and the communication will be effected.\nThis document
    discusses the effects of assured communication to SDP\nprotocol, identifies the
    weaknesses and proposes a new attribute to\nrectify these weaknesses.\n\t "

  content: "   In much the same way one can track a parcel, this document proposes
    a\n   simple method for returning the trace record of an e-mail to the SMTP\n
    \  originator (sender) as it passes through relays and gateways;\n   passively,
    without the recipient's intervention. Delays can thus be\n   explained and important
    e-mails (or paranoid e-mailers) can rest\n   knowing their message has at least
    arrived at its destination.\n\n   Much like parcel tracking, this is more of a
    gimmick than useful!\n\t "

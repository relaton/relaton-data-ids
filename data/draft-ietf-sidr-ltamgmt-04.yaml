abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP) to\n
    \  manage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure
    (RPKI). It is common to allow an RP to import TA\n   material in the form of self-signed
    certificates. The facility\n   described in this document allows an RP to impose
    constraints on such\n   TAs. Because this mechanism is designed to operate in
    the RPKI\n   context, the relevant constraints are the RFC 3779 extensions that\n
    \  bind address spaces and/or autonomous system (AS) numbers to\n   entities.
    The primary motivation for this facility is to enable an RP\n   to ensure that
    resource allocation information that it has acquired\n   via some trusted channel
    is not overridden by the information\n   acquired from the RPKI repository system
    or by the putative TAs that\n   the RP imports. Specifically, the mechanism allows
    an RP to specify a\n   set of bindings between public key identifiers and RFC
    3779 extension\n   data and will override any conflicting bindings expressed via
    the\n   putative TAs and the certificates downloaded from the RPKI repository\n
    \  system. Although this mechanism is designed for local use by an RP,\n   an
    entity that is accorded administrative control over a set of RPs\n   may use this
    mechanism to convey its view of the RPKI to a set of RPs\n   within its jurisdiction.
    The means by which this latter use case is\n   effected is outside the scope of
    this document.\n\n\t "

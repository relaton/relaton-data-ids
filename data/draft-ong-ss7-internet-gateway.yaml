  content: "   This memo describes the Bay Networks Gateway architecture for\n   interworking
    of PSTN SS7 with Internet.  Signaling System 7 (SS7)\n   networking is the primary
    means used in the PSTN for control of\n   circuit-switched connections and value
    added PSTN services such as\n   freephone (800/888) number translation, calling
    card validation and\n   Intelligent Network services.  The Gateway architecture
    provides a\n   scalable method of supporting interworking between SS7 network\n
    \  elements and Internet elements such as a Remote Access Server (RAS).\n   The
    Gateway architecture can support connection control and database\n   access.  Gateway
    design, functions and protocol are described.\n\n\t "

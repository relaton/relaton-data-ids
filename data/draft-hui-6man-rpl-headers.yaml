  content: "Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a routing protocol\ndesigned
    for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs).  RPL includes\nrouting information in
    IPv6 data plane datagrams to help maintain the\nrouting topology.  When forwarding
    a datagram into a RPL domain, a\nRPL router may need to expand the datagram to
    include routing\ninformation in IPv6 Extension headers.  A generic solution has
    been\ndefined that uses IP-in-IP tunneling to include RPL routing\ninformation.
    \ This document describes an alternative to inserting and\nremoving RPL information
    in datagrams without the use of IP-in-IP\ntunneling.\n\t "

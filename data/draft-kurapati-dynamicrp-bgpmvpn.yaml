  content: "   PIM Group-to-RP mappings are distributed dynamically using protocols\n
    \  such as BSR or Auto-RP.  The BGP-MVPN specification provides for this\n   information
    to be encapsulated in an I-PMSI or S-PMSI provider tunnel\n   between the PEs
    in an MVPN environment.  Since this is control\n   information, it is desirable
    to signal this information in BGP\n   between PEs, similar to carrying other customer
    control state such as\n   C-Multicast routes.  This document specifies the mechanisms
    and\n   procedures to carry bootstrap information via BGP to provide true\n   control
    and data plane separation.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation\nProtocol,
    RFC-2543[3]. The extension adds the PROPOSE method to the\nSIP protocol. The intend
    of the PROPOSE method is to allow a Media\nGateway or other types of server that
    is serving a SIP node in a\nlive session to propose a revised session setting
    to the node due to\nchanges in network or other constraints of the current session.
    An\nexample of revised session setting could be a suggestion to the node\nto lower
    its quality of service or choose a lower bandwidth codec\ndue to an increase in
    network traffic.   \n\n\t "

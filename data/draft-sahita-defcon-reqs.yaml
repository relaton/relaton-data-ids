  content: "This document describes the requirements for the architecture and a \ndistributed
    framework for end-point firewall control (DEFCon). This \ndraft also discusses
    requirements for the individual pieces in the \nframework. \nPerimeter firewalls
    are predominant in enterprise networks but do \nnot provide the protection a mission
    critical network needs against \nmisuse or abuse from nodes inside the network.
    Additionally, A \nwireless infrastructure makes every host vulnerable since in
    that \ncase access is not fundamentally restricted by infrastructure. \nLikewise,
    traffic is increasingly being encrypted end-to-end using \nSSL, IPSec, etc. where
    viruses/worms/confidential information can \nalso be hidden from the security
    components. This requires the \nperimeter firewall to become a man-in-the-middle
    for all secure \nsessions, which breaks the end-to-end principle and thus renders
    \nmany protocols useless since they are inevitably blocked. \nA host-based firewall
    on nodes in the enterprise network protects \nthe network from inside out. This
    approach does not preclude \nperimeter firewalls. Instead, it provides defense-in-depth
    and \nreduces the load on perimeter firewalls. The host-based approach \nalso
    upholds the end-to-end theme since it allows traffic to be \nsecurely encrypted
    end-to-end and yet assures safety from \ninfection, compromise and attack.  \n

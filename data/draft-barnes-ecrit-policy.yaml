  content: "The provision of emergency calling services (e.g., 911, 112) has been\na
    critical component in the regulation of telecommunications\nnetworks.  The technical
    architectures used by modern Voice-over-IP\n(VoIP) systems mean that if telecommunications
    regulators wish to\nextend emergency calling requirements to VoIP, it will likely
    be\nnecessary to reconsider the ways in which such requirements are\napplied,
    both in terms of what specific mandates are imposed and\nwhich entities are subject
    to them.  This document dicusses the\nfundamental technical requirements for emergency
    services, how these\nrequirements can be met within the framework of VoIP, and
    how these\nsolutions approaches create possibilities and limitations for\nregulatory
    involvement.\n\t "

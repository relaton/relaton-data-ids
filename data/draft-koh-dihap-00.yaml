  content: "   This draft describes a proposed Dynamic Inter Home Agent solution to\n
    \  provide redundancy and load balancing of Home Agents.  The proposed\n   solution
    recommends additional communication between home agents that\n   may be located
    far apart in terms of network topology but still\n   belonging to or are trusted
    by the same administrative domains\n   (service providers).  While the mobile
    node is roaming away from its\n   home network, intervening home agents in the
    path of the\n   bidirectional tunnel between the mobile node and its registered
    home\n   agent may detect its presence.  The intervening home agents that are\n
    \  affiliated to the current home agent of the mobile node then proceed\n   to
    update it of their availability to serve as home agent for the\n   mobile node.\n\t "

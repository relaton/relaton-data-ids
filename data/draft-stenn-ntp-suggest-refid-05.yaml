  content: "   NTP's Reference ID, or REFID, identifies the source of time in a\n
    \  timestamp or time packet.  In NTP packets sent over the network the\n   REFID
    is used to identify the \"system peer\", and in the long-term\n   general case
    its fundamental purpose is to prevent a one-degree\n   timing loop.  Each instance
    of NTP decides for itself what REFID it\n   will put in its outgoing packets,
    and there is currently no way for\n   an external time source to tell or recommend
    this value in the case\n   where that external time source is selected as the
    \"system peer.\"\n\n   The SUGGESTED-REFID NTP Extension Field proposal is a backward-\n
    \  compatible way for a time source to tell its peers or clients \"If you\n   use
    me as your system peer, use this nonce as your REFID.\"\n\n\t "

  content: "   Network nodes may discard packets if they are unable to process\n   protocol
    headers of packets due to processing constraints or limits.\n   When such packets
    are dropped, the sender receives no indication so\n   it cannot take action to
    address the cause of discarded packets. This\n   document defines ICMPv6 errors
    that can be sent by a node that\n   discards packets because it is unable to process
    the protocol\n   headers. A node that receives such an ICMPv6 error may be able
    to\n   modify what it sends in future packets to avoid subsequent packet\n   discards.\n\n\t "

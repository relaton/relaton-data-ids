  content: "   Typically applications developers have requested static IANA\n   assignments
    for the applications, even if the applications would\n   typically be only used
    within a site, between consenting sites, or\n   would not eventually even use
    multicast at all.  This memo describes\n   this problem space, and summarizes
    a number of proposed approaches to\n   mitigating these problems.\n\t "

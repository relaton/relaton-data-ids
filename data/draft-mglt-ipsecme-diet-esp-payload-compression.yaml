  content: "   ESP is a IPsec protocol that takes as input a Clear Text Data and\n
    \  outputs an encrypted ESP packet according to IPsec rules and\n   parameters
    stored in different IPsec databases.\n\n   Diet-ESP compresses the ESP fields.
    \ However, Diet-ESP does not\n   consider compression of the Clear Text Data.
    \ Instead, if compression\n   of the Clear Text Data is expected protocols like
    ROHCoverIPsec can\n   be used.\n\n   ROHCoverIPsec remains complex to implement
    in IoT devices, as states,\n   and negotiations are involved between the compressors
    and\n   decompressors of the two IoT devices.  Most of this complexity can be\n
    \  avoided by considering the parameters that have been negotiated by\n   IPsec.\n\n
    \  This document describes an extension of the Diet-ESP Context that\n   enables
    the compression of the Clear Text Data, without implementing\n   the complex ROHCoverIPsec
    framework.  As opposed to ROHCoverIPsec the\n   compression is not generic and
    as such all communication will not\n   benefit from this compression.  However,
    we believe this extension\n   addresses most of IoT communications.\n\n\t "

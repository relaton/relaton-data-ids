- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft specifies an Ethernet Layer 2 Virtual Private Service\n
    \  Protocol using Ethernet addressing hierarchy and service\n   separation. This
    protocol enables Service Providers to deploy an\n   Ethernet Network and offer
    scalable and manageable layer 2\n   Transparent LAN Services (L2TLS). The primary
    goal of this\n   protocol is to eliminate the need of the Service Provider to\n
    \  manage customer address information and forwarding within its\n   network.
    Another goal is to allow auto provisioning of VPN service\n   instances within
    the Service Provider networks. This solution\n   maintains customer benefits of
    simplicity of access to the VPN,\n   allows efficient utilization of Service Provider
    network\n   resources, and overcomes distance limitations of customer's LANs.\n\t "

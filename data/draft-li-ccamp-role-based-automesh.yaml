  content: "   A Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label\n
    \  Switch Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs.\n   Routing
    (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions for discovery Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS)
    LSR TE mesh membership has been defined to automate\n   the creation of mesh of
    TE LSPs.\n\n   This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that applies
    to\n   the scenarios where full mesh TE LSPs is not necessary and TE LSPs\n   setup
    depends on the roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group.  Interior\n   Gateway Protocol
    (IGP) routing extensions for automatic discovery of\n   role-based TE mesh membership
    are defined accordingly.\n\n\n\t "

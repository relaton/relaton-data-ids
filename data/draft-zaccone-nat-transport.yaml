  content: "This document describes some mechanisms to enable an IP network to\ntransport
    both the IP traffic of the local realm and the IP traffics\nof external realms
    in the native (non-tunneled) way [TRANSP-FRAM].\nThe methods, described in this
    document, provide to the routers of\nthe operated network the necessary information
    enabling the delivery\nof IP traffics originated from the foreign realms the operator
    offer\nconnectivity to. This information is derived by the currently\navailable
    routing information routers have and is moreover provided\nto them by the mean
    of a local delivery mechanism.\n\n\t "

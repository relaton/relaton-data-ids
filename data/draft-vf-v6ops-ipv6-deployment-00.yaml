  content: "   Looking globally, IPv6 is growing faster than IPv4 and this means\n
    \  that the collective wisdom of the networking industry has selected\n   IPv6
    for the future.  This document provides an overview of IPv6\n   transition deployment
    status and a view on how the transition to IPv6\n   is progressing among network
    operators that are introducing IPv6 or\n   have already adopted an IPv6-only solution.
    \ It also aims to analyze\n   the transition challenges and therefore encourage
    actions and more\n   investigations on some areas that are still under discussion.
    \ The\n   overall IPv6 incentives are also examined.\n\n\n\t "

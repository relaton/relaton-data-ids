  content: "Multicast based VPNs have been deployed for a while now, based on the
    \n   Draft Rosen solution. In today's scenario, network deployments are moving
    \n   towards a choice Label Switched Multicast, primarily to garner some of the
    \n   advantages that a Label Switched Network can offer. In short, the \n   requirement
    is to achieve more optimal multicast replication and in other \n   words achieve
    better and effective bandwidth savings. This document describes \n   some of the
    experiences gained from the implementation and deployment of \n   Label Switched
    multicast using the RSVP-TE P2MP Label Switched Path approach, \n   and such is
    information only. The intent is to translate the experiences \n   gained into
    valuable practices for the Service Provider and Enterprise community \n   who
    intend to deploy this class of mVPNs. Information based on \"Hierarchical \n   Multicast
    Trees\" and \"Aggregated P Tunnels\" have not been included, and will \n   follow
    in the next version of this draft.\n\n\t "

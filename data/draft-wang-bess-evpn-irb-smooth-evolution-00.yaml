  content: "   EVPN IRB has been deployed following [RFC9135]'s early draft for a\n
    \  long time.  This draft discusses how can these existing deployments\n   smoothly
    evolved into an IP-aliasing\n   ([I-D.sajassi-bess-evpn-ip-aliasing]) enhanced
    EVPN symmetric IRB\n   scenario, especially when two of an IP-VRF's BDs (whose
    IRB\n   interfaces are attached to the same IP-VRF) have been attched to a\n   common
    ES before that network evolution.  In such case, when these\n   two BDs are evolved
    into IP-aliasing enhanced EVPN symmetric IRB as\n   per [I-D.sajassi-bess-evpn-ip-aliasing]
    or distributed Bump-in-the-\n   wire as per [I-D.wang-bess-evpn-distributed-bump-in-the-wire],
    the IP\n   A-D per EVI routes of these two BDs may conflict with each other in\n
    \  the context of the IP-VRF instance.\n\n\t "

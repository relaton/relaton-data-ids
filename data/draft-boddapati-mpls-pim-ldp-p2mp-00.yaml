  content: "There is emerging interest in the use of MPLS LSPs for the delivery of
    \nmulticast traffic. Efficient delivery of multicast traffic using MPLS \nrequires
    P2MP LSPs. This document describes a mechanism to setup P2MP \nLSPs using PIM-SSM
    and LDP. PIM-SSM is a widely deployed multicast \nrouting protocol and has well
    defined procedures for signalling \nmulticast traffic. LDP is a well defined mechanism
    for distribution of \n \nMPLS labels. Utilizing both PIM-SSM and LDP for setting
    up P2MP LSPs \nkeeps the clear separation between signalling and label distribution,
    \ \nand minimizes changes to both protocols. PIM-SSM signals when to receive \nmulticast
    traffic and LDP distributes label information regarding how to \nreceive multicast
    traffic. \n\t "

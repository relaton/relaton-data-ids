  content: "A large number of the services we wish to make possible\n         for
    Internet telephony require fairly elaborate\n         combinations of signalling
    operations, often in network\n         devices, to complete. We want a simple
    and standardized\n         way to create such services to make them easier to\n
    \        implement and deploy.  This document describes an\n         architecture
    for such a method, which we call a call\n         processing language. It also
    outlines requirements for\n         such a language.\n\t "

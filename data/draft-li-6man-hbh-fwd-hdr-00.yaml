  content: "   RFC8200 specifies the HBH header that is assumed to be processed by\n
    \  each hop in the delivery path of the packet.  However, RFC8200 also\n   expects
    that nodes processing the HBH header have been explicitly\n   configured to do
    so.  Therefore, it cannot be assumed that a HBH\n   header present in the packet
    is processed.  It all depends on the\n   configuration of each node across the
    path.  Moreover, in most of\n   networks today, the processing of the HBH header
    is done in the\n   control plane (slow processing path) which incurs several limitations\n
    \  among which resources consumption and security risk.\n\n   For these reasons,
    over time, the Hop-by-Hop Options header has been\n   sparsely used without any
    form of large scale deployment.  Also, most\n   of already defined HBH options
    are forwarding options which contain\n   forwarding plane information that needs
    not to be sent to the control\n   plane.\n\n   This document proposes a new Hop-by-Hop
    Forwarding Options Header in\n   order to carry Hop-by-Hop options that are solely
    intended to and\n   processed by the forwarding plane.  This new HBH header is
    confined\n   in and dedicated to the forwarding plane while the current HBH header\n
    \  can still be used for control plane options.\n\n\n\t "

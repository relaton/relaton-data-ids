abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy\n
    \  Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications,\n   such
    as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing\n   Protocol for
    LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on\n   routing metrics and constraints
    [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed\n   Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional
    routes for\n   LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint,\n
    \  and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from\n   one
    or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is\n   partitioned into one
    or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one\n   DODAG per sink. RPL is widely
    considered as a feasible routing\n   protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops caused
    by local DODAG repair\n   mechanism is an issues to be addressed. This draft introduces
    a loop\n   free local DODAG repair mechanism.\n\n\t "

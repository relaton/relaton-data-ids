  script: Latn
  content: "   Changes in CDS/CDNSKEY, CSYNC, and other records related to\n   delegation
    maintenance are usually detected through scheduled scans\n   run by the consuming
    party (e.g. top-level domain registry),\n   incurring an uncomfortable trade-off
    between scanning cost and update\n   latency.\n\n   A similar problem exists when
    scheduling zone transfers, and has been\n   solved using the well-known DNS NOTIFY
    mechanism ([RFC1996]).  This\n   mechanism enables a primary nameserver to proactively
    inform\n   secondaries about zone changes, allowing the secondary to initiate
    an\n   ad-hoc transfer independently of when the next SOA check would be\n   due.\n\n
    \  This document extends the use of DNS NOTIFY beyond conventional zone\n   transfer
    hints, bringing the benefits of ad-hoc notifications to DNS\n   delegation maintenance
    in general.  Use cases include DNSSEC key\n   rollovers hints via NOTIFY(CDS)
    and NOTIFY(DNSKEY) messages, and\n   quicker changes to a delegation's NS record
    set via NOTIFY(CSYNC)\n   messages.\n\n   Furthermore, this document proposes
    a new DNS record type,\n   tentatively referred to as \"NOTIFY record\", which
    is used to publish\n   details about where generalized notifications should be
    sent.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n

    \  notify).  The most recent working version of the document, open\n   issues,
    etc. should all be available there.  The authors (gratefully)\n   accept pull

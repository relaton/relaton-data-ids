  content: "   Media Friendly Rate Control (MFRC) is a mechanism for rate control
    of\n   unicast media streams that is intended to be a better fit for the\n   requirements
    of streaming media applications than TCP-Friendly Rate\n   Control (TFRC), while
    still maintaining fairness with competing TCP\n   applications.\n\t "

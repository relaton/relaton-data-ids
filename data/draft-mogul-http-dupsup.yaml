  content: "        A significant fraction of Web content is often exactly\n        duplicated
    under several different URIs.  This duplication\n        can lead to suboptimal
    use of network bandwidth, and\n        unnecessary latency for users.  Much of
    this duplication\n        can be avoided through the use of a simple mechanism,\n
    \       described here, which allows a cache to efficiently\n        substitute
    one byte-for-byte identical value for another.\n        By doing so, the cache
    avoids some or all of the network\n        costs associated with retrieving the
    duplicate value.\n\n\t "

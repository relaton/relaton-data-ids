  content: "IPv6 is ongoing and natively being deployed by a growing community\nand
    it is important that the quality perception and traffic flows are\nas optimal
    as possible.  Ideally it would be as good as the IPv4\nperceptive experience.\n\nThis
    paper looks into a set of transitional technologies where the\nactual user has
    IPv6 connectivity through the means of IPv6-in-IPv4\ntunnels.  A subset of the
    available tunnels has the property of being\nnon-managed (i.e. 6to4 [RFC3056]
    and Teredo [RFC4380] ).\n\nWhile native IPv6 deployments will keep growing it
    is uncertain or\neven expected that non-managed IPv6 tunnels will be providing
    the\nsame user experience and operational quality as managed tunnels or\nnative
    IPv6 connectivity.\n\nThis paper will detail some considerations around non-managed
    tunnels\nand will document the harmful element of these for the future growth\nof
    networks and the Internet.\n\t "

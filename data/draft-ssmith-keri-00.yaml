  content: "   An identity system-based secure overlay for the Internet is\n   presented.
    \ This is based on a Key Event Receipt Infrastructure\n   (KERI) or the KERI protocol
    [KERI][KERI-ID][RFC0791].  This includes\n   a primary root-of-trust in self-certifying
    identifiers (SCIDs)\n   [UIT][SCPK][SFS][SCPN][SCURL].  It presents a formalism
    for Autonomic\n   Identifiers (AIDs) and Autonomic Namespaces (ANs).  They are
    part of\n   an Autonomic Identity System (AIS).  This system uses the design\n
    \  principle of minimally sufficient means to provide a candidate trust\n   spanning
    layer for the internet.  Associated with this system is a\n   decentralized key
    management infrastructure (DKMI).  The primary\n   root-of-trust are self-certifying
    identifiers that are strongly bound\n   at issuance to a cryptographic signing
    (public, private) keypair.\n   These are self-contained until/unless control needs
    to be transferred\n   to a new keypair.  In that event, an append-only chained
    key-event\n   log of signed transfer statements provides end verifiable control\n
    \  provenance.  This makes intervening operational infrastructure\n   replaceable
    because the event logs may be served up by any\n   infrastructure including ambient
    infrastructure.  End verifiable logs\n   on ambient infrastructure enable ambient
    verifiability (verifiable by\n   anyone, anywhere, at any time).  The primary
    key management operation\n   is key rotation (transference) via a novel key pre-rotation
    scheme\n   [DAD][KERI].  Two primary trust modalities motivated the design,\n
    \  these are a direct (one-to-one) mode and an indirect (one-to-any)\n   mode.
    \ The indirect mode depends on witnessed key event receipt logs\n   (KERL) as
    a secondary root-of-trust for validating events.  This\n   gives rise to the acronym
    KERI for key event receipt infrastructure.\n   In the direct mode, the identity
    controller establishes control via\n   verified signatures of the controlling
    keypair.  The indirect mode\n   extends that trust basis with witnessed key event
    receipt logs (KERL)\n   for validating events.  The security and accountability
    guarantees of\n   indirect mode are provided by KA2CE or KERI’s Agreement Algorithm
    for\n   Control Establishment among a set of witnesses.  The KA2CE approach\n
    \  may be much more performant and scalable than more complex approaches\n   that
    depend on a total ordering distributed consensus ledger.\n   Nevertheless, KERI
    may employ a distributed consensus ledger when\n   other considerations make it
    the best choice.  The KERI approach to\n   DKMI allows for more granular composition.
    \ Moreover, because KERI is\n   event streamed it enables DKMI that operates in-stride
    with data\n   events streaming applications such as web 3.0, IoT, and others where\n
    \  performance and scalability are more important.  The core KERI engine\n   is
    identifier namespace independent.  This makes KERI a candidate for\n   a universal
    portable DKMI [KERI][KERI-ID][UIT].\n\n\t "

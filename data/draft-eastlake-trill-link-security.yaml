abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The TRILL protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL\n
    \  switches, both point-to-point and broadcast links, and supports\n   Ethernet
    links between edge TRILL switches and end stations.\n   Communications links are
    constantly under attack by criminals and\n   national intelligence agencies as
    discussed in RFC 7258. Link\n   security is an important element of security in
    depth, particularly\n   for links that are not entirely under the physical control
    of the\n   TRILL network operator or that include device which may have been\n
    \  compromised. This document specifies link security recommendations\n   for
    TRILL over Ethernet, PPP, and pseudowire links. It updates RFC\n   6325, RFC 6361,
    and RFC 7173. It requires that link encryption MUST\n   be implemented and that
    all TRILL Data packets between TRILL switch\n   ports capable of encryption at
    line speed MUST default to being\n   encrypted.\n\n   [This is a early partial
    draft.]\n\n\n\t "

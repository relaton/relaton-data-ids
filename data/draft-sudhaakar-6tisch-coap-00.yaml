abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The [IEEE802154e] standardizes the TSCH mode of operation and defines\n
    \  the mechanisms for layer 2 communication between conforming devices.\n   6top
    defines a set of commands to monitor and manage the TSCH\n   schedule.  To realize
    the full functionality of sensor networks and\n   allow their adoption and use
    in real applications we need additional\n   mechanisms.  Specifically, we need
    to define how to interact with\n   6top, control and modify schedules, monitor
    parameters etc.  Higher\n   layers monitoring and management entities are then
    able to use these\n   capabilities to create feedback loops.  Although, there
    have been\n   many custom implementations of such feedback loops between the\n
    \  routing, transport and MAC layers in sensor network deployments,\n   there
    has been a lack of standards based approaches.  The goal of the\n   memo is to
    define a generic data model between monitoring and\n   management entities and
    the 6top layer and define a mapping to the\n   6top commands.  The document also
    presents a particular\n   implementation of the model based on CoAP and CBOR.\n\n\t "

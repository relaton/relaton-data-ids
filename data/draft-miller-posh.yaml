  content: "   Experience has shown that it is extremely difficult to deploy proper\n
    \  PKIX certificates for TLS in multi-tenanted environments, since\n   certification
    authorities will not issue certificates for hosted\n   domains to hosting services,
    hosted domains do not want hosting\n   services to hold their private keys, and
    hosting services wish to\n   avoid liability for holding those keys.  As a result,
    domains hosted\n   in multi-tenanted environments often deploy non-HTTP applications\n
    \  such as email and instant messaging using certificates that identify\n   the
    hosting service, not the hosted domain.  Such deployments force\n   end users
    and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper\n   identifier, resulting
    in obvious security implications.  This\n   document defines two methods that
    make it easier to deploy\n   certificates for proper server identity checking
    in non-HTTP\n   application protocols.  The first method enables the TLS client\n
    \  associated with a user agent or peer application server to obtain the\n   end-entity
    certificate of a hosted domain over secure HTTP as an\n   alternative to standard
    PKIX techniques.  The second method enables a\n   hosted domain to securely delegate
    a non-HTTP application to a\n   hosting service using redirects provided by HTTPS
    itself or by a\n   pointer in a file served over HTTPS at the hosted domain.  While
    this\n   approach is developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and\n   Presence
    Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association prooftype, it\n   can be applied
    to any non-HTTP application protocol.\n\n\t "

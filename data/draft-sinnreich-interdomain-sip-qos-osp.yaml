  content: "Commercial grade IP telephony requires linkage between call setup,\nend-to-end
    QoS setup, interdomain authorization and accounting. This\ndraft considers the
    network model for inter-domain QoS for access and\ntransit networks, the service
    models and policy implementation\noptions. Also, interdomain authorization and
    accounting may require\nthe trust services of a clearinghouse, to which the local
    policy\nserver may outsource authorization for support for inter-domain\naccounting.\nThe
    draft defines two options for QoS support for telephony: PSTN-\nstyle 'QoS Assured'
    or Internet-style 'QoS Enabled' service.\nImplementing the local policy or QoS
    deployment can also have two\noptions: The more usual policy 'Pull Model' and
    the policy 'Push\nModel' that may be advantageous for large IP telephony gateway\ndeployments.
    The draft illustrates the various combinations of QoS\nservice and policy implementation
    for interdomain QoS with\nauthorization and accounting.\nThe inter-process communications
    between the SIP, SDP, RSVP and OSP\nprotocol engines is illustrated. Future work
    for SIP/SDP and other\nextensions, QoS metric and policy is outlined to make interdomain
    QoS\nfor IP telephony possible.\n\n\t "

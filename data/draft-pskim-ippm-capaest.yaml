  content: "In this draft, a mechanism for available capacity estimation of an \nend-to-end
    path is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy \ncompared with the existing
    IGI(Initial Gap Increasing)/PTR(Packet \nTransmission Rate) mechanism. The proposed
    mechanism defines three \ncases of the difference between the average output gap
    and the input \ngap, and then reflects fully them, while the existing mechanism
    \nreflected only two cases. Since three cases are handled respectively \nby appropriate
    corresponding manners, the proposed mechanism can be \nexpected to reduce the
    detection error for the turning point. \nTherefore, the end-to-end available capacity
    can be estimated more \naccurate than the existing mechanism.\n\t "

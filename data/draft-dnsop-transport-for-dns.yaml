  content: "DNS queries and responses are available over a variety of transports\n(UDP/TCP)
    and may be ported to use other transports in the future.\nCurrent use profiles
    show that most user generated DNS traffic\nprefers one transport over another.
    \ This historical usage pattern\nhas or may lead to the presumption that any DNS
    traffic, regardless\nof transport, should be considered on equal footing.\n\t "

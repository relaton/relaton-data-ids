  content: "   With massive data growing in the internet, how to effectively use the\n
    \  compute resources has become a quite hot topic.  In order to cool\n   down
    the pressure in today's large data centers, some compute\n   resources have been
    moved towards the edge, gradually forming a\n   distributed Compute Force Network.
    \ Force is a physical cause which\n   can change the state of a motion or an object.
    \ We refer the\n   definition from physics and extend its philosophy to network
    that in\n   future, the network can be a compute force which can facilitate the\n
    \  integration of different kinds of compute resources, no matter\n   hardware
    or software, making the computation fast and effective.  In\n   this draft, we
    present a compute resources oriented scheduling\n   mechanism based on dataplane
    programmability, which can effectively\n   schedule and manage compute resources
    in the network.\n\n\t "

  content: "Fibre Channel (FC) is a high speed serial interface technology that   \nsupports
    several Upper Layer Protocols including Small Computer \nSystem Interface (SCSI)
    and IP. Fibre Channel is standardized by the \nINCITS T11 Technical Committee.
    Fibre Channel Standards include \nFraming and Signaling protocols [FC-FS], Generic
    Services protocols \n[FC-GS-3], Switch Fabric protocols [FC-SW-2], etc.\nThe management
    of a Fibre Channel network requires to monitor and set \nmany parameters related
    to these protocols and this may be \naccomplished defining a proper set of MIBs.\n\n\t "

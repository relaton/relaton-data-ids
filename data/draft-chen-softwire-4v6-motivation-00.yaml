  content: "   The growth of Internet obliged to accelerate IPv6 deployment.  IPv6-\n
    \  only network likely become prevalent due to low costs and higher\n   efficiency
    for operators to employ.  Meanwhile, a significant part of\n   network will still
    stay in IPv4 for long time.  Regarding IPv4\n   depletion, address sharing mode
    should be deployed in small segmented\n   IPv4 networks.  Operators expect 4via6
    solution with low capital and\n   operational expense by balancing tradeoff between
    simple core network\n   and edge-distributed management.  This memo discusses
    several\n   motivations, and it recommends the 4via6 stateless solution should
    be\n   specified for deployment models in the guideline document.\n\n\t "

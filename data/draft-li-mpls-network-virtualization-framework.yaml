  content: "   As the virtual network operators develop, it is desirable to provide\n
    \  better network virtualization solutions to facilitate the service\n   provision.
    \ In the past years, MPLS plays a key role in the process\n   of implementing
    network virtualization.  This document introduces a\n   new framework to implement
    network virtualization based on MPLS\n   global label.  It can provide the virtualized
    network topology, nodes\n   and links using MPLS global label which can make up
    the virtual\n   network.\n\n\n\t "

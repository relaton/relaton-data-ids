  content: "   This document describes the Address Mapping System that is a generic,\n
    \  extensible, and scalable system for mapping network addresses to\n   other
    network addresses. The Address Mapping System is intended to be\n   used in conjunction
    with overlay techniques which facilitate\n   transmission of packets across overlay
    networks. Information returned\n   by the Address Mapping System can include the
    particular network\n   overlay method to use, as well as instructions related
    to using the\n   method.  The Address Mapping System has a number of potential
    use\n   cases including identifier-locator protocols, network virtualization,\n
    \  and promotion of privacy.\n\n\t "

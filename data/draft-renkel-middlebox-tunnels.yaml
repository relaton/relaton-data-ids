  content: "This Internet Draft compares Network Address Translation (NAT) and\nRealm
    Specific IP (RSIP) tunnels, and the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each. It
    then shows how the advantages can be\ncombined by implementing NAT as a tunnel
    in hosts, while\nminimizing the disadvantages. Based on the advantages of middlebox\ntunnels
    in general and implementing NAT as a middlebox tunnel in\nparticular, it then
    recommends that the Middlebox Communications\narchitecture protocol (MIDCOM) be
    amended to support tunnels\nbetween hosts and middleboxes.\nThis .txt version
    of this internet draft is identical to the\nPostScript version (draft-renkel-middlebox-tunnels-00.ps)
    except\nthat the figures from the PostScript version have been deleted.\nPlease
    refer to the PostScript version for these figures.\n\t "

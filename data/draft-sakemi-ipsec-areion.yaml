  content: "   This document specifies the integration of the Areion cryptographic\n
    \  permutation into IPsec.  Areion is a novel cryptographic primitive\n   designed
    to achieve significantly lower latency for encryption and\n   hashing operations
    compared to traditional algorithms like AES-GCM,\n   making it particularly suitable
    for high-performance VPNs and data\n   center interconnect scenarios.  This specification
    defines the use of\n   Areion within Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), including
    the\n   associated keying materials and the necessary parameters for Internet\n
    \  Key Exchange (IKE).\n\n   The Areion permutation is fully described in [I-D.sakemi-areion].\n
    \  This document focuses on incorporating Areion into IPsec.\n\n\t "

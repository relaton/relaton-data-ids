  content: "This document specifies compatible enhancements to AppleTalk Phase 2      routing
    protocols, intended to provide better routing in large wide-area network environments.
    \ This document first discusses architectural concepts related to these enhancements.
    \ The architectural discussion is followed by detailed protocol and procedural
    descriptions of the new protocols involved.                                                                                                                                   This
    document focuses on the general architecture and protocols associated with enhanced
    AppleTalk routing, along with specifics as to how these protocols are to be implemented
    in a TCP/IP environment.  It represents both a specification by Apple Computer,
    Inc. and an Internet Draft RFC, for use when connecting two or more AppleTalk
    internets together using an existing TCP/IP internet.  This document is intended
    to ultimately become part of Inside AppleTalk, as well as a standard for the Internet
    Community.   Comments are welcome.\n\t "

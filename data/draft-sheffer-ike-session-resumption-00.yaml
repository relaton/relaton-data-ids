  content: "   The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol is\n   computationally
    intensive with respect to the number of round-trips\n   required and cryptographic
    operations involved.  In particular the\n   Extensible Authentication Protocol
    is used for authentication, which\n   adds additional computational intensity.\n\n
    \  To re-establish security associations (SA) upon a failure recovery\n   condition
    is time comsuming, especially when an IPsec peer, such as a\n   VPN gateway, needs
    to re-establish a large number of SAs with various\n   end points.  A high number
    of concurrent sessions might cause\n   additional problems for an IPsec peer during
    SA restablishment.\n\n   In many failure cases it would be useful to provide an
    efficient way\n   to resume an interrupted IKE/IPsec session.  This document proposes\n
    \  an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA\n   with
    a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously\n   establied IKE
    SA.\n\n   A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected,\n
    \  or alternatively migrate to another gateway that is associated with\n   the
    previous one.  The proposed approach conveys IKEv2 state\n   information, in the
    form of an encrypted ticket, to a VPN client that\n   is later presented to the
    VPN gateway for re-authentication.  An\n   encrypted ticket cannot be decrypted
    by a VPN client but allows a VPN\n   gateway to restore state for faster session
    state setup.\n\n\n\t "

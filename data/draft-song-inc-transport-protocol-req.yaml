  content: "   In-network computing breaks the end-to-end principle and introduces\n
    \  new challenges to the transport layer functionalities.  This draft\n   provides
    the background of a suite of RPC-based applications which\n   can take advantage
    of INC support, surveys the existing transport\n   protocols to show they are
    insufficient or improper to be used in\n   this context, and lays out the requirements
    to develop a general\n   transport protocol tailored for such applications.  The
    purpose of\n   this draft is to help understand the problem domain and inspire
    the\n   design and development a unified INC transport protocol.\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect\n
    \  the Quality of Service of inelastic flows within a controlled domain.\n   It
    does this by marking packets when traffic load on a link is\n   approaching or
    has exceeded a threshold below the physical link rate.\n   This experimental encoding
    scheme specifies how three encoding states\n   can be carried in the IP header
    using a combination of two DSCPs and\n   the ECN bits.  The Basic scheme only
    allows for three encoding\n   states.  The Full scheme provides 6 states, enough
    for limited end-\n   to-end support for ECN as well.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In order to be routed, a fragmented packet must be reassembled at\n
    \  every hop of a multihop link where lower layer fragmentation occurs.\n   Considering
    that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an\n   802.15.4 frame can
    have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worst\n   case, a packet might end up
    fragmented into as many as 18 fragments\n   at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.  If a single
    one of those fragments is\n   lost in transmission, all fragments must be resent,
    further\n   contributing to the congestion that might have caused the initial\n
    \  packet loss.  This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward and\n   recover
    individual fragments that might be lost over multiple hops\n   between 6LoWPAN
    endpoints.\n\n\t "

  content: "Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) methods were developed to
    prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each other's IP addresses,
    so as to complement ingress filtering with finer-grained, standardized IP source
    address validation.  This document is a framework document that describes and
    motivates the design of the SAVI methods.  Particular SAVI methods are described
    in other documents.\n\t "

  content: "Benchmarking methodologies have always relied on test conditions with
    constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network device capability
    has been tested.  Tests with a constant packet size reveal device capabilities
    but differ significantly from the conditions encountered in operational deployment,
    so additional tests are sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes, or
    \"IMIX\" (\"Internet Mix\").  The mixture of sizes a networking device will encounter
    is highly variable and depends on many factors.  An IMIX suited for one networking
    device and deployment will not be appropriate for another.  However, the mix of
    sizes may be known, and the tester may be asked to augment the fixed-size tests.
    \ To address this need and the perpetual goal of specifying repeatable test conditions,
    this document defines a way to specify the exact repeating sequence of packet
    sizes from the usual set of fixed sizes and from other forms of mixed-size specification.\n\t "

  content: "   The EUI-64 identifier of a 6LoWPAN device can be used as the\n   interface
    identifier of the IPv6 address, which can be used for for\n   on-demand multi-hop
    routing in 6LoWPAN.  One of the distinctive\n   feature of 6LoWPAN is the capability
    of the dynamic assignment of 16-\n   bit short addresses.  By utilizing this dynamically
    assigned  short\n   address, a hierarchical routing which is very scalable can
    be \n   employed. This This document defines a dynamic address assignment  \n
    \  scheme and hierarchical routing HiLow) based on the assignment.\n\n\t "

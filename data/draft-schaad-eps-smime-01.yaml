  content: "   When using the Email Policy Service model, there exist the\n   communications
    with the policy server which are based in XML and\n   there are the communications
    which are S/MIME based and thus done in\n   ASN.1.  This document covers the ASN.1
    requirements and the\n   modifications in S/MIME processing needed to implement
    an Email\n   Policy Service system.\n\n\t "

  content: "Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such as\nvideo
    gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers used\nto provide application
    services are distributed geographically around\na network, many decisions made
    in the control and management of\napplication services, such as where to instantiate
    another service\ninstance or to which server a new client is assigned, should
    be made\nwith the knowledge of the underlying network resources availability\nand
    the application resources conditions.\n\nCurrently such decisions are made with
    very little or no information\nconcerning the underlying network used to deliver
    those services.\nHence such decisions are inherently sub-optimal. In addition
    the lack\nof network awareness may result in not meeting the end-user\napplication
    service objectives.\n\t "

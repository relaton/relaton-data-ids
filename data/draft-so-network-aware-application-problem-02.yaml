abstract:
- content: "<p>Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such as
    video gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers used to provide
    application services are distributed geographically around a network, many decisions
    made in the control and management of application services, such as where to instantiate
    another service instance or to which server a new client is assigned, should be
    made with the knowledge of the underlying network resources availability and the
    application resources conditions. Currently such decisions are made with very
    little or no information concerning the underlying network used to deliver those
    services. Hence such decisions are inherently sub-optimal. In addition the lack
    of network awareness may result in not meeting the end-user application service
    objectives.</p>"

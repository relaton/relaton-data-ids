  content: "This document describes a new method, which will automatically \nacquire
    the host name of active IPv6 nodes and register it to the \nlocal Domain Name
    System (DNS) server. Active IPv6 nodes are nodes \nthat are connected to a network.
    \nOur proposed new protocol, which is called Host Name Resolution \nProtocol (HNRP)
    [6], will automatically learn some useful \ninformation from all the IPv6 nodes,
    such as the host name and the \nIP address. All the information will be kept by
    HRRP and the host \nname together with the IPv6 address will be added to the DNS.
    This \nwill be implemented without the need for any changes at the clients' \nsite.
    \ \nThe objective of this document is to specify the new Host Name \nResolution
    Protocol and also the algorithm used in the protocol. \n\n\t "

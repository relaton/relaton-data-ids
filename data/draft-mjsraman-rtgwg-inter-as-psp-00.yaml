abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power\n
    \  consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between\n   Autonomous
    Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS\n   and then use Traffic
    Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets\n   along the paths. Such low-power
    paths can be identified by using the\n   available power-to-bandwidth (PWR) ratio
    as an additional constraint\n   in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF)
    algorithm. For re-\n   routing the data traffic through these low-power paths,
    the Inter-AS\n   Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans multiple\n
    \  AS can be used. Extensions to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can\n   be
    used to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among the AS thereby\n   creating a collaborative
    approach to reduce the power consumption.\n   Since calculating the low-power
    paths can be computationally\n   intensive, a graph-labeling heuristic is also
    proposed. This\n   heuristic reduces the computational complexity but may provide
    a sub-\n   optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our approaches is\n   illustrated
    by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.\n   The techniques proposed
    in this paper for the Inter-AS power\n   reduction require minimal modifications
    to the existing features of\n   the Internet. The proposed techniques can be extended
    to other levels\n   of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths, through suitable\n
    \  modifications.\n\n\n\n\t "

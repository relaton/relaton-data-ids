  content: "In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-
    related data.  Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP receivers usually
    cannot start consuming the multicast data right after they join the session.  Thus,
    they often experience a random acquisition delay.  An RTP receiver can use one
    or more different approaches to achieve rapid acquisition.  Yet, due to various
    factors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies.  Furthermore,
    in some cases, the RTP receiver can do a simple multicast join (in other cases,
    it is compelled to do so).  For quality reporting, monitoring, and diagnostic
    purposes, it is important to collect detailed information from the RTP receivers
    about their acquisition and presentation experiences.  This document addresses
    this issue by defining a new report block type, called the Multicast Acquisition
    (MA) report block, within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended
    Reports (XRs) (RFC 3611).  This document also defines the necessary signaling
    of the new MA report block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

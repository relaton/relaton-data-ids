- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   [RFC7432] describes mechanism to elect designated forwarder (DF) at\n
    \  the granularity of (ESI, EVI) which is per VLAN (or per group of\n   VLANs
    in case of VLAN bundle or VLAN-aware bundle service).  However,\n   the current
    level of granularity of per-VLAN is not adequate for some\n   applications.[I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election-framework]
    improves base\n   line DF election by introducing HRW DF election.\n   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy]
    introduces applicability of EVPN\n   to Multicast flows, routes to sync them and
    a default DF election.\n   This document is an extension to HRW base draft\n   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election-framework]
    and further enhances HRW\n   algorithm for the Multicast flows to do DF election
    at the\n   granularity of (ESI, VLAN, Mcast flow).\n\n\t "

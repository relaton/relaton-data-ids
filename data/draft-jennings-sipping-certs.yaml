  content: "This draft defines a Credential Service that uses a SIP subscribe/\n   notify
    mechanism to discover other users' certificates and\n   credentials and be notified
    about changes to these certificates.\n   Other user agents that want to contact
    that AOR can retrieve these\n   certificates from the server.  The result is that
    widespread\n   deployment of S/MIME in SIP is possible, because no extra expense
    or\n   effort is required of the end user.\n\n   This work is being discussed
    on the sipping@ietf.org mailing list.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a BGP Well-known Community called\n   NO_EXPORT_VIA_RS.
    \ This community allows BGP route server clients to\n   instruct an Internet Exchange
    BGP Route Server to tag prefixes\n   destined for other route server clients with
    the NO_EXPORT Well-Known\n   Community.  This mechanism allows route server clients
    to\n   transitively control distribution of their prefixes in other\n   Autonomous
    Systems connected to the Internet Exchange Route Server.\n\n\n\t "

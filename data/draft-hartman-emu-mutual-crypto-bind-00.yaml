abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers
    rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server. EAP extensions
    such as channel binding or network posture information are often carried in tunnel
    methods; peers are likely to rely on this information. [RFC 3748] is a facility
    that protects tunnel methods against man-in-the-middle attacks. However, cryptographic
    binding focuses on protecting the server rather than the peer. This memo explores
    attacks possible when the peer is not protected from man-in- the-middle attacks
    and recommends mutual cryptographic binding, a new form of cryptographic binding
    that protects both peer and server.</p>"

  content: "   A malicious Certificate Transparency (CT) log can offer a modified\n
    \  tree to a client in a \"split view\" attack.  This document proposes to\n   extend
    CT by submitting Signed Tree Heads (STH) into another log, run\n   by a different
    operator.  Auditors and monitors can use these cross\n   logged STHs to detect
    split view attacks by the log.\n\n\t "

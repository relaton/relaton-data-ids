- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft defines new options in the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and the
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to enable SIPP hosts, that are also
    IPv4-capable, to configure themselves automatically. The options enable a SIPP
    host to derive an address sequence, determine the scope of IPv4 reachability and
    discover the address sequences of default SIPP routers.  The options are intended
    to be useful to SIPP hosts that conform to the SIPP transition specification,
    and operate in sites with minimal SIPP deployment. Terminology defined in the
    SIPP Routing and Addressing Specification and the DHCP Specification applies here.\n\t "

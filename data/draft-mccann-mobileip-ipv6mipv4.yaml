  content: "This document specifies a Mobile IPv4 extension that may be used by \ndual
    stack mobile nodes to obtain IPv6 service with the use of a \nMobile IPv4 registration.
    This extension allows for immediate \ndeployment of IPv6 on dual stack mobile
    devices, without the need \nfor a full IPv6 infrastructure. It is believed that
    providing IPv6 \nservices to mobile devices in the short term will spur the growth
    of \nIPv6 networks. \nThis extension makes use of the existing Mobile IPv4 security
    model, \nincluding the interface to the AAA infrastructure, but does not \nprovide
    the route optimization capabilities included in the Mobile \nIPv6 protocol. Further,
    this specification requires that the mobile \nnode and Home Agent have dual IPv4
    and IPv6 stacks. There are no \nchanges to the FA nor does it need to be dual
    stack. \n\t "

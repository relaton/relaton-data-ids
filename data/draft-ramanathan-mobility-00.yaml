  content: "We discuss the issue of mobility in Nimrod.  We identify the requirements
    that Nimrod has of any solution for mobility support.  We also classify and compare
    existing approaches for supporting mobility within an internetwork and discuss
    their advantages and disadvantages.  Finally, as an example, we outline the mechanisms
    to support mobility in Nimrod using the scheme currently being developed within
    the IETF - namely, the Mobile-IP protocol.\n\t "

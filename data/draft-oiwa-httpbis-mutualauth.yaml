  content: "   This document specifies a mutual authentication method for the Hyper-\n
    \  text Transport Protocol (HTTP).  This method provides a true mutual\n   authentication
    between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using\n   password-based authentication.
    \ Unlike the Basic and Digest\n   authentication methods, the Mutual authentication
    method specified in\n   this document assures the user that the server truly knows
    the user's\n   encrypted password.  This prevents common phishing attacks: a\n
    \  phishing attacker controlling a fake website cannot convince a user\n   that
    he authenticated to the genuine website.  Furthermore, even when\n   a user authenticates
    to an illegitimate server, the server cannot\n   gain any information about the
    user's password.  The Mutual\n   authentication method is designed as an extension
    to the HTTP\n   protocol, and is intended to replace the existing authentication\n
    \  methods used in HTTP (the Basic method, Digest method, and\n   authentication
    using HTML forms).\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use cases and related requirements of Massive
    Data Transmission（MDT）in High Bandwidth-delay Product (BDP) Network. The MDT framework
    enables efficient use of nighttime idle bandwidth to provide services such as
    same-day or next-day delivery. To meet these objectives, the system introduces
    a terminal-driven intelligent parameter optimization method that adjusts local
    configurations (e.g., disk I/O, NIC bandwidth, TCP buffer) to match transmission
    goals. This document outlines the end-to-end architecture and key mechanisms including
    service identification and traffic statistics, network layer load balancing, transmission
    protocol optimization, collaboration between terminal APP, network device and
    controller, etc.</p>"

  content: "   Applications differ with respect to whether they need IP session\n
    \  continuity and/or IP address reachability.  The network providing the\n   same
    type of service to any mobile host and any application running\n   on the host
    yields inefficiencies.  This document describes a\n   solution for taking the
    application needs into account in selectively\n   providing IP session continuity
    and IP address reachability on a per-\n   socket basis.\n\n\t "

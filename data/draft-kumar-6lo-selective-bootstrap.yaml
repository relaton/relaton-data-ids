  content: "   Low-resource devices in a Low-resource and Lossy Network (LLN) can
    be\n   based on a mesh network using the IEEE 802.15.4 link standard.\n   Security
    in these networks MUST be enforced at the link level.\n   Provisioning the devices
    in a secure manner with keys (often called\n   security bootstrapping) to encrypt
    and authenticate the link-layer\n   messages is the subject of this specification.
    \ This proposal\n   distinguishes itself from other bootstrap proposals by requiring
    that\n   the devices can be secured in an order determined by the needs of the\n
    \  installation procedure.  Other proposals use an \"onion model\", where\n   first
    the devices one-hop away from the initial device (often the\n   border router)
    are secured, followed by the devices that are one-hop\n   away from already secured
    devices.\n\n\t "

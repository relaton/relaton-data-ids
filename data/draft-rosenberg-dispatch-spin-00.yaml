abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a framework and a protocol for facilitating
    voice, video and messaging interoperability between application providers. This
    work is motivated by the recent passage of regulation in the European Union -
    the Digital Markets Act (DMA) - which, amongst many other provisions, requires
    that vendors of applications with a large number of users enable interoperability
    with applications made by other vendors. While such interoperability is broadly
    present within the public switched telephone network, it is not yet commonplace
    between over-the-top applications, such as Facetime, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger.
    This document specifically defines the Simple Protocol for Inviting Numbers (SPIN)
    which is used to deliver invitations to mobile phone numbers that can bootstrap
    subsequent communications over the Internet.</p>"

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "\n   The NSIS operation will be greatly affected by the multihoming\n
    \  development in IETF such as Monami6, Shim6, etc.  Solutions from\n   these
    groups introduce different architecture elements and\n   assumptions to the network
    layer, and thus render the current NSIS\n   protocols ineffective or irrelevant.
    \ This draft provides an analysis\n   of the multhoming scenarios that have impacts
    on the NSIS operation.\n   Requirements for NSIS multihoming support are derived
    from the\n   discussions of the NSIS applicability in these scenarios.\n\n\t "

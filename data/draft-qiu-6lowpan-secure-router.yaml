  content: "When a sensor node roams within a very large and distributed wireless\nsensor
    network, which consists of numerous sensor nodes, its routing\npath and neighborhood
    keep changing.  In order to provide a high\nlevel of security in this environment,
    the moving sensor node needs\nto be authenticated to new neighboring nodes as
    well as to establish\na key for secure communication.  The document proposes an
    efficient\nand scalable protocol to establish and update the secure key in a\ndynamic
    wireless sensor network environment.  The protocol guarantees\nthat two sensor
    nodes share at least one key with probability 1\n(100%) with less memory and energy
    cost, while not causing\nconsiderable communication overhead.\n\t "

  content: "Various applications of MPLS make use of label stacks with multiple entries.
    \ In some cases, it is possible to replace the top label of the stack with an
    IP-based encapsulation, thereby enabling the application to run over networks
    that do not have MPLS enabled in their core routers.  This document specifies
    two IP-based encapsulations: MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation).
    \ Each of these is applicable in some circumstances. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

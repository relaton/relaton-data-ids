  content: "   This memo proposes a modified TCP Timestamps mechanism called \"TS2\".\n
    \  It uses the existing \"TCP Timestamps option\" specified in RFC1323 and\n   a
    new TCP option called \"the TCP Old Timestamps option\", which is\n   specified
    in this memo.  As a fallback, an RFC1323-compatible mode\n   called \"TS1\" is
    also available.\n\n   The base mechanism of TS2 includes the definitions of those
    two TCP\n   Timestamps options, mode negotiation to enable TS1 or TS2, and a rule\n
    \  for updating internal states.  The applied mechanisms of TS2 include\n   an
    accurate RTT measurement mechanism that is correct even for\n   duplicate ACK
    segments (RTTM/TS2), a reordering-robust mechanism to\n   detect wrapped sequence
    numbers (PAWS/TS2), a lightweight mechanism\n   to detect spoofed segments (PASA/TS2),
    a loss inference mechanism\n   applicable to both original and retransmitted data
    segments\n   (DLI/TS2), and a spurious loss inference detection mechanism that\n
    \  operates without waiting for one RTT by sending arbitrary in-window\n   data
    (SLID/TS2).\n\t "

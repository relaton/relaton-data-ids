  content: "   This draft discusses two use cases to help identify the requirements\n
    \  for policy-based routing in I2RS.  Both of the use cases involve\n   identification
    of certain flows and then using I2RS to program\n   routers with special handling
    for those flows.\n\n   The first use case deals with improving bandwidth efficiency.\n
    \  Demands on networking bandwidth are growing exponentially due to\n   applications
    such as large file transfers and those with rich media.\n   Link Aggregation Group
    (LAG) and Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) are\n   extensively deployed in networks
    to scale the bandwidth. However,\n   the static hash-based load balancing techniques
    used today make\n   inefficient use of the bandwidth in the presence of long-lived
    large\n   flows. We discuss how I2RS can be used for achieving better load\n   balancing.\n\n
    \  The second use case is for recognizing and mitigating Layer 3-4\n   based DDoS
    attacks. Behavioral security threats such as Distributed\n   Denial of Service
    (DDoS) attacks are an ongoing problem in today's\n   networks. DDoS attacks can
    be Layer 3-4 based or Layer 7 based. We\n   discuss how such attacks can be recognized
    and how I2RS can be used\n   for mitigating their effects.\n\n\n\n\t "

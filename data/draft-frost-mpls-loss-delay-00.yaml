abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the\nability
    to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss\nand one-way and two-way
    delay, as well as related metrics such as\ndelay variation and channel throughput.
    \ This capability, in\naddition, provides operators with greater visibility into
    the\nperformance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating\nplanning,
    troubleshooting, and evaluation.  This document specifies\nprotocol mechanisms
    to enable the efficient and accurate measurement\nof these performance metrics
    in MPLS networks.\n\t "

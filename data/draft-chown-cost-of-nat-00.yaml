  content: "The deployment of IP Network Address Translators (NATs) for IPv4 has\nbecome
    very pervasive in the last 10-12 years.  The original goal of\nNAT was to conserve
    IP address space, but the technology has now\nbecome very popular in home and
    SOHO type networks, as well as many\nlarger organisations, for a variety of reasons.
    \ At the same time,\nthe introduction of NAT adds a cost for application and service\ndevelopers.
    \ This document presents a brief overview of the history\nof NAT, alongside a
    list of ongoing work related to NAT workarounds\nfor current IETF protocol designs.
    \ The document intends to present a\nneutral view of the cost of NAT for discussion
    in the IETF and wider\ncommunity.\n\t "

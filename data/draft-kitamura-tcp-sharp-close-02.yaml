  content: "   This document describes an idea \"Sharp Close\" that eliminates or\n
    \  minimizes TIME-WAIT state of TCP connections.\n\n   In the current TCP specification
    ([RFC0793]), there are some\n   inappropriate or not up-to-date functions. Here
    we focus and\n   discuss on TCP TIME-WAIT state function.\n\n   TIME-WAIT is the
    last state of TCP connections of Active Close side\n   nodes. After TCP connections
    are effectively closed, state of them\n   move to TIME-WAIT state. After TIME-WAIT
    state is finished,\n   resources of connections are released. This means that
    even if\n   connections are effectively finished, resources of connections are\n
    \  NOT released.  The TIME-WAIT state prevents from releasing them.\n\n   From
    the viewpoints of current high-speed and high-multiplicity\n   communication styles,
    it is thought that TIME-WAIT state is one of\n   evil functions.\n\n   In order
    to provide efficient communications that match current\n   styles, an idea \"Sharp
    Close\" that eliminates or minimizes TIME-\n   WAIT state of TCP connections is
    proposed.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an\n
    \  interface on a network device.  Routing protocols were developed\n   based
    on the assumption that a destination address had this semantic.\n\n   Over time,
    routing decisions have been enhanced to determine paths on\n   which packets could
    be forwarded according to additional information\n   carried principally within
    the packet headers, and dependent on\n   policy coded in, configured at, or signaled
    to the routers.\n\n   Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets
    by\n   placing additional information into existing fields, by adding\n   semantics
    to IP addresses, or by adding fields to the packets.  The\n   intent is always
    to facilitate routing decisions based on these\n   additional semantics in order
    to provide differentiated paths to\n   enable forwarding of different packet flows
    on paths that may be\n   distinct from those derived by shortest path first or
    path vector\n   routing.  We call this approach \"Semantic Routing\".\n\n   This
    document describes the challenges to the existing routing system\n   that are
    introduced by Semantic Routing.  It then summarizes the\n   opportunities for
    research into new or modified routing and\n   forwarding approaches that make
    use of additional semantics.\n\n   This document is presented as a study to support
    further research\n   into clarifying and understanding the issues.  It does not
    pass\n   comment on the advisability or practicality of any of the proposals\n
    \  and does not define any technical solutions.\n\n\t "

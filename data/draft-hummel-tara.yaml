  content: "This draft outlines a new routing architecture which I like to\ncall TARA
    = Topology Aggregating Routing Architecture. Its primary\nobjective is to eliminate
    the so-called scalability problem as\nproclaimed by RFC4984. By overcoming the
    true causes of this \nproblem - which are indeed some holy routing paradigms -
    it may \nserve as the base for much better routing.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the Secure Asset Exchange (SAE) Protocol.\n
    \  SAE is an extension of the Secure Asset Transfer (SAT) Protocol that\n   enables
    the asset exchange interoperability mode.  It specifies the\n   required modifications
    necessary to the SAT message flows to\n   facilitate asset exchange between asset
    networks.  Gateways that\n   support the SAT protocol can be extended to also
    support SAE,\n   enabling support for both asset transfer and asset exchange in
    a\n   single set of gateways.\n\n\t "

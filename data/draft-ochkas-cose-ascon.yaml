  content: "   This document describes CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) and\n
    \  JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) serializations with Ascon\n   which
    is a NIST standard for lightweight cryptography.\n\n   In 2019, as a part of CAESAR
    competition, Ascon-128 and Ascon-128a\n   were selected as the first choice for
    the lightweight authenticated\n   encryption [asconv1.2-caesar].  After, in 2023,
    National Institute of\n   Standards and Technology (NIST) selected Ascon family
    of\n   cryptographic algorithms to be the standard for lightweight\n   cryptography
    [asconv1.2-nist].  In August 2025, NIST Special\n   Publication 800-232 was released,
    defining Ascon-based lightweight\n   cryptography standards for constrained devices
    [NIST.SP.800-232].\n   This recognition makes it particularly interesting to use
    Ascon with\n   COSE and JOSE structures.\n\n   This document does not define any
    new cryptography, only\n   serializations of existing cryptographic systems described
    in\n   [NIST.SP.800-232].\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo should help starting the discussion on extensions of the\nPolicy
    Framework Core Information Model (PCIM).  It does not replace\nnor change concepts
    used in PCIM, but tries to add concepts, which\ncould help different application
    areas to define policies more easily\nby reusing some of the concepts proposed
    in this draft.  The draft\nbasically tries to generalize concepts introduced by
    other drafts\nsuch as the Policy Framework QoS Information Model [PQIM].  The
    focus\nlies in means for specifying general conditions and actions.\nAdditionally,
    group ordering, events, and variables are introduced.\n\t "

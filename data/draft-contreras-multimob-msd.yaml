  content: "A new working group, Multimob, has been chartered for providing an\nimplementation
    of multicast service distribution to multicast\nlisteners as they move in currently
    defined Proxy Mobile IPv6\n(PMIPv6) domains according to RFC 5213 [1]. No protocol
    modifications\nor extensions are considered at this stage.\n\nSeveral proposals
    [2, 3, 4] have been already presented to face this\nissue. This contribution sums
    up some of the previous ideas extending\nthem when necessary to overcome some
    limitations existing on such\nsolutions.\n\t "

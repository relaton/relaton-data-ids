  content: "This document describes detailed models for analysis of proposed\nprotocols
    for Quality of Service (QoS) delivery with IPv4 (including\nmulticast).  The models
    have been developed using the OPNET simulation \npackage.  They are intended to
    allow investigation of performance using \nproposed protocols and should have
    wide applicability in the Internet \nQoS community.  We are making these models
    publicly available with the \nintention that they can be used to provide expanded
    studies of Qos \ndelivery for both unicast and multicast, using IntServ, DiffServ,
    and\nMPLS.  This Internet-Draft is intended to form the basis for an \nInformational
    RFC that extends the previous RFC2490.\n\t "

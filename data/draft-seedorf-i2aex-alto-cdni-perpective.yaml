  content: "   Recently, there has been a discussion on \"Infrastructure-to-\n   Application
    Information Exposure\" and the related communications\n   requirements in fully
    controlled (e.g. data centers) or partially\n   controlled environments (e.g.
    \ CDN).  One possibility to expose\n   infrastructure information to applications
    in the aforementioned\n   environments is to use yet-to-be-defined ALTO extensions.
    \ This draft\n   discusses requirements for such ALTO extensions for a specific
    use\n   case: Request Routing in CDN Interconnection (CDNI).\n\n\t "

  content: "DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) as described in [RFC4871], defines\na
    domain-level authentication framework for email to permit\nverification of the
    source and contents of messages.  This document\nspecifies an adjunct mechanism
    to aid in assessing messages that lack\nvalid DKIM signatures for domains used
    in the author's address.  It\ndefines a record that can advertise the extent to
    which a domain\nsigns outgoing mail that is publicly exchanged on SMTP port 25,
    as\ndescribed in [RFC2821].  Also, how other hosts can access those\nrecords.\n\nAdvertisements,
    defined by this document, may also increase DKIM\nsignature expectations for messages
    received by Mail User Agents\n(MUAs) or for messages which might have been exchanged
    over protocols\nother than SMTP.  In some circumstances, author domains may wish
    to\nhave accommodations for protocol failures or for mixed public\nprotocol messaging
    not to be made.\n\nIn addition, DKIM's identity parameters related to the author
    address\nare decisive only when a corresponding DKIM key local-part template\nprecludes
    an author address.  DKIM in conjunction with ADSP is to\nprovide methods for detecting
    the spoofing of known domains, but not\nfor making strong assertions about the
    identity of the message\nauthor.\n\t "

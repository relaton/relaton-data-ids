  content: "   User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  UMA defines how\n
    \  resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients\n   operated
    by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside\n   on any number
    of resource servers, and where a centralized\n   authorization server governs
    access based on resource owner policy.\n   This specification defines a generic
    framework for building UMA claim\n   profiles that can be used by client applications
    to obtain the\n   necessary authorization to access protected resources.  This
    revision\n   of the specification is part of V0.9.\n\n\t "

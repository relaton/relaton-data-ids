abstract:
- content: "<p>The evolution of cellular mobile communication systems is aligned with
    an increasing demand for customized deployments, energy efficiency, dynamic re-configurability
    and the integration and use of other network technologies, such as non-cellular
    radio access technologies and non-terrestrial networks. In order to achieve and
    maintain the expected service quality and continuity, such systems should be designed
    and controllable end-to-end, taking all involved network domains and segments
    into account. This document discusses an end-to-end system from an advanced use
    cases perspective and substantiates the demand for solutions to share information
    and enable control interfaces between all connected network domains, including
    the mobile communication system and the transport network that stretches up to
    the data networks that host service instances. In the view of flexible implementations
    and deployment, two architectural principles, leveraging either a dedicated controller
    or a decentralized control plane, are described and discussed, accompanied by
    operational aspects and an associated information model that enable end-to-end
    mobile traffic treatment and steering in such complex and dynamically changing
    networks.</p>"

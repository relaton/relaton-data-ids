  content: "Implementing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) advanced features and\nservices
    requires to use numerous specifications.  Today, for each\nservice in the scope
    of BLISS, one can already find references to\nmany possible specifications which
    do not cover the same things.\nSome of them are primitive operations, requirements
    or call flow\nexamples, some have a scope larger than the others, or can not be\ncompared
    at the same level.  Very often, architecture hypothesis are\nhidden behind the
    same service name, either assuming that an\nintermediary; like an application
    server, has an active role in the\nservice, or, as opposed, assuming a pure end-to-end
    model where only\nendpoint implementations are involved.  The goal of this document
    is\nnot to present the best solutions or give recommendations; but to\ngive an
    overview of every standard specification related to these\nservices, centralizing
    and categorizing them as input to the working\ngroup.\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a lightweight profile of OCSP (RFC 2560) for\nuse
    in very large PKI environments such as SSL/TLS, code signing\nand secure messaging.
    \ In these environments there exists a large\nclient base (in the 100's of millions)
    and thus the ability to\nscale OCSP request handling is very important.\n\t "

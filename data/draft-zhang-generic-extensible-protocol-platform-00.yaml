  content: "   In the Cloud computing era, lots of protocols are proposed to meet\n
    \  the various requirements requested by the quickly emerging Cloud\n   applications.
    However, protocols used to be independently developed\n   by closed communities.
    Each protocol proposes its own specifications\n   and encoding method. Some common
    functions are repeatedly developed\n   by different protocols. The way that the
    protocols used to be\n   developed significantly prolongs the process that protocols
    are\n   brought to the real market.\n\n   In order to address these problems,
    this document proposes GEARS\n   (Generic and Extensible Architecture for pRotocolS)
    which provides an\n   open platform to facilitate protocol innovations. A new
    protocol\n   would be developed as an application running on this platform while\n
    \  those common functions provided by this platform can be reused.\n   Customized
    features of this application can be easily built as add-\n   ons with the friendly
    and extensible data modeling language.\n\n\t "

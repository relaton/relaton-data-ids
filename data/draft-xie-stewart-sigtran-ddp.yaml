  content: "Data Distribution Protocol (DDP) provides a fault tolerant data\ntransfer
    mechanism over IP networks. DDP uses a name-based addressing\nmodel which isolates
    a logical communication endpoint from its IP\naddress(es), thus effectively eliminating
    the binding between the\ncommunication endpoint and its physical IP address(es)
    which normally\nconstitutes a single point of failure.\n\nIn addition, DDP defines
    each logical communication destination as a\nnamed group, providing full transparent
    support for server-pooling and\nload sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability
    - members of a\nserver pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting\nthe
    service.\n\nDDP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy\nprovided
    by the Simple Transmission Control Protocol (SCTP) [1]. But\nit can also use other
    transport protocol like TCP.\n\nInternally, DDP is made up of two parts, namely
    the Data Distribution\nControl Part (DDCP) and the Endpoint Name Resolution Part
    (ENRP).\nDDCP provides the user interface for name to address translation, load\nsharing
    management, and fault management.  ENRP defines the fault\ntolerant name translation
    service.\n\t "

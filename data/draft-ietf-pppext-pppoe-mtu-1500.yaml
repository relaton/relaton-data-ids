  content: "   Point-to-Point Protocol Over Ethernet, (PPPoE), as described in RFC\n
    \  2516, mandates a maximum negotiated MRU of 1492. This memo proposes\n   relaxing
    that restriction to allow a maximum negotiated MRU of 1500.\n   This can be achieved
    by treating the PPPoE Header and Protocol ID as\n   part of the Ethernet Header,
    taking advantage of the fact that most\n   network devices have buffers for the
    Ethernet Header and Payload that\n   are at least 1522 octets in size. To aid
    backward compatability, the\n   proposal recommends testing the link with MRU-sized
    Echo-Request\n   packets if an MRU greater than 1492 has been assumed or negotiated.\n\t "

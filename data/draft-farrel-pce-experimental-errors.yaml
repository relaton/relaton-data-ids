  content: "   Experimental RFCs are often considered beneficial approaches to\n   developing
    new protocol features.  To that end, sub-ranges of code\n   point registries are
    often designated as for experimental use.\n\n   IANA assigns values to the Path
    Computation Element Communication\n   Protocol (PCEP) parameters (messages, objects,
    TLVs).  According to\n   RFC 5440 as updated by RFC 8356, the allocation policies
    for the\n   registries for PCEP messages, objects, and TLV types are IETF Review\n
    \  with some sub-ranges of these registries being assigned for\n   Experimental
    Use.  However, the registry of PCEP Error-Types and\n   Error-values has only
    the IETF Review assignment policy meaning that\n   experimentation is somewhat
    limited.\n\n   This document updates RFC 5440 by designating a range of PCEP Error-\n
    \  Types for Experimental Use.\n\n\t "

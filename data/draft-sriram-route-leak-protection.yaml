  content: Enhancement to BGPSEC for Protection against Route Leaks
docidentifier:

abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document enumerates different types of route leaks based on\n
    \  observed events on the Internet.  It illustrates how BGPSEC in its\n   current
    form (as described in draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol-09)\n   already provides
    protection against all but one of these route-leaks\n   scenarios.  The document
    further discusses a design enhancement to\n   the BGPSEC protocol that will extend
    protection against this one\n   remaining type of route-leak attack as well.  With
    the inclusion of\n   this enhancement, BGPSEC is expected to provide protection
    against\n   all types of route-leaks.  The document also includes a stopgap\n
    \  method for detection and mitigation of route leaks for the phase when\n   BGPSEC
    (path validation) is not yet deployed but only origin\n   validation is deployed.\n\n\t "

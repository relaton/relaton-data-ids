  content: "This memo takes a look at some of the work on policy-driven networks\ncurrently
    being done in several IETF working groups. The proposed\nsolutions (like COPS
    and PIBs) focus on solving local problems of\npolicy management. It is the view
    of the authors that while local\nsolutions like COPS can be more effective than
    more general ones, the\nadvantages to effective management through the use of
    a single\nintegrated management framework (an improved SNMP) outweigh the gains\nof
    locally optimized solutions.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo captures current working group rough consensus on\n   procedures
    for improved cross-area early review in the IETF.  It is a\n   product of the
    ICAR working group.\n\n   This memo describes an experiment to improve early cross-area
    review\n   in the IETF.  Early cross-area review aims to improve quality of IETF\n
    \  work by identifying problems early in document development. Improved\n   quality
    may, in turn, mean that documents can be processed faster in\n   the IESG.\n\t "

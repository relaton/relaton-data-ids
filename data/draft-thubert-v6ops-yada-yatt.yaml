  content: "   This document provides a stepwise migration between IPv4 and IPv6\n
    \  with baby steps from an IPv4-only stack/gateway/ISP to an IPv6-only\n   version,
    that allows portions of the nodes and of the networks to\n   remain IPv4, and
    reduces the need for dual stack and CG NATs between\n   participating nodes.  A
    first mechanism named YADA to augment the\n   capacity of the current IPv4 Internet
    by interconnecting IPv4 realms\n   via a common footprint called the shaft.  YADA
    extends RFC 1122 with\n   the support of an IP-in-IP format used to forward the
    packet between\n   parallel IPv4 realms.  This document also provides a stateless\n
    \  address and IP header translation between YADA and IPv6 called YATT\n   and
    extends RFC 4291 for the YATT format.  The YADA and YATT formats\n   are interchangeable,
    and the stateless translation can take place as\n   a bump in the stack at either
    end, or within the network at any\n   router.  This enables an IPv6-only stack
    to dialog with an IPv4-only\n   stack across a network that can be IPv6, IPv4,
    or mixed.  YATT\n   requires that the IPv6 stack owns a prefix that derives from
    a YADA\n   address and that the IPv4 stack in a different realm is capable of\n
    \  YADA, so it does not replace a generic 4 to 6 translation mechanism\n   for
    any v6 to any v4.\n\n\t "

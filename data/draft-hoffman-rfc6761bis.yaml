  content: "   This document obsoletes RFC 6761 that created the Special-Use Domain\n
    \  Names registry at IANA for domain names that are reserved for special\n   use.
    \ The registry has proved to be useful.  RFC 6761 also has a\n   description for
    when reserving such a name is appropriate, and the\n   procedure for doing so;
    those descriptions have turned out to cause\n   many problems in the IETF.  Because
    of those problems, this document\n   obsoletes RFC 6761 while retaining the registry
    and greatly reducing\n   the rest of the discussion and requirements in RFC 6761.
    \ It places\n   the responsibility for accepting Special-Use Domain Names entries\n
    \  with the IESG.\n\n   [ A repository for this draft can be found here (https://github.com/\n
    \  paulehoffman/6761bis). ]\n\n\t "

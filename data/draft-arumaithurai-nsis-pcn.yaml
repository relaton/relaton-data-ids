  content: "   This document describes a Quality of Service model (QOSM), for\n   networks
    that support the use of the Controlled load service over a\n   Diffserv cloud
    using pre-congestion notification.  Ths is a technique\n   to perform admission
    control in a Diffserv network by measuring the\n   congestion level in a domain.
    \ New flows are admitted only if the\n   current congestion level is below the
    allowed threshold.  When the\n   controlled load in a domain exceeds a certain
    threshold, the egress\n   prompts the ingress to pre-empt certain flows.  This
    proposal is\n   based on the proposal made by B.Briscoe et al., for the extension
    of\n   RSVP to support the Controlled load service over a Diffserv cloud\n   using
    pre-congestion notification.\n\n\t "

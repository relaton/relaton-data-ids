  content: "Network security incidents, such as system compromises, worms,\n    viruses,
    phishing incidents, and denial of service (DoS), typically\n    result in the
    loss of service, data, and resources both human and\n    system.  Network Providers
    (NPs) need to be equipped and ready to\n    assist in communicating and tracing
    security incidents with tools\n    and procedures in place before the occurrence
    of an attack.  This\n    paper outlines a proactive inter-network communication
    method to\n    facilitate sharing incident handling data and integrate existing\n
    \   tracing mechanisms across NP boundaries to identify the source(s)\n    of
    an attack. The various methods implemented to detect and trace\n    attacks must
    be coordinated on the NPs' network as well as provide\n    a communication mechanism
    across network borders.  It is imperative\n    that NPs have quick communication
    methods defined to enable\n    neighboring NPs to assist in reporting or tracking
    a security\n    incident across networks.  A complete solution integrating incident\n
    \   detection, source identification, reporting and communication\n    capabilities,
    and methods to stop attack traffic is necessary to \n    attain higher security
    levels on networks.  Policy guidelines for\n    handling incidents are recommended
    and can be agreed upon by a\n    consortium using the security recommendations
    and considerations.\n\t "

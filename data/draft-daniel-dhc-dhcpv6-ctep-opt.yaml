  content: "For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly  \ndeployed
    IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been \nproposed.  One such mechanism
    is configured tunnels.  This document \nprovides a mechanism by which the DHCPv6
    servers can provide \ninformation about the various configured tunnel end points
    to reach \nthe IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.\n\t "

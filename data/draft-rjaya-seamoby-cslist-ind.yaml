  content: "In 802.11 or similar technologies, the network device enters a\n'cell-search
    mode' when the signal level/quality of the serving AP\ndrops below a certain value.
    In the cell-search mode, the device\nactively measures the signal level and/or
    quality of neighbouring\nAPs in addition to that of the serving AP.\nThis document
    describes how the use of MN originated cell-search\nlist indications, which carry
    signal level and signal quality\nmeasurements of access points in the immediate
    vicinity of the\nmobile node, can assist in a handover scheme that factors in\nseamlessness,
    target router selection, context transfer and\nresource usage information.\n\n\t "

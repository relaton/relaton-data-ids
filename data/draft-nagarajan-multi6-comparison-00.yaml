abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   An IP address serves as a locator and an identifier in the classical\n
    \  Internet environment.  This dual role of the IP address makes\n   mobility
    and multihoming a challenging task.  There have been various\n   proposals to
    overcome this limitation, particularly from the Multi6\n   working group.\n\n
    \  This memo makes a comparative analysis of these proposals that\n   support
    a locator/identifier split for multihoming in IPv6 from the\n   security point
    of view.  The purpose is also to provide a common\n   framework under which future
    proposals can be compared and chosen for\n   various security requirements.\n\t "

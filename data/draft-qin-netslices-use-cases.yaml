  content: "   Network Slicing (NS) is widely discussed and considered in 5G\n   communities
    and standard organizations as a key mechanism to meet\n   diverse service requirements
    concurrently with the same physical\n   network infrastructure.  NS enables the
    operator to provide isolated\n   platform for service verticals, and deploy new
    services without\n   causing or experiencing any disruption to other already deployed\n
    \  services in the same physical network infrastructure.  This document\n   describes
    the typical use cases that could benefit from network\n   slicing, to support
    each case, the corresponding requirements on 5G\n   transport network will be
    analyzed.\n\n\n\t "

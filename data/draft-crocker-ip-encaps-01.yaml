  script: Latn
  content: "The Internet seeks to increase the amount of IP address space that is
    available for hosts and to decrease the amount of table storage that is required
    by routers.  Ultimately, the current IP (IP version 4) and any replacement are
    inherently incompatible and movement to the new version requires very substantial
    change to the IP installed base.  This specification describes an approach which
    retains as much software, operations and training as possible, and minimizes overall
    operational disruption by allowing subsets of the Internet to carry the new-format
    Internet datagrams inside old-style IPv4 datagrams, using a technique called 'IP
    Address Encapsulation' (IPAE).  This permits incremental and asynchronous introduction
    and makes transition entirely optional for portions of the Internet infrastructure.
    \ It further permits early reduction to routing table size.\n\t "

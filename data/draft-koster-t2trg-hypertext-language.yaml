  content: "   Interoperability for connected things is improving in a number of\n
    \  important areas, converging around Internet Protocol (IP) and\n   internet
    design patterns.  Hypermedia is becoming more common with\n   web linking becoming
    part of a number of important standards.\n\n   However, there is still an interoperability
    gap in how application\n   semantics are defined and used.  Many organizations
    and industry\n   alliances are defining vocabulary and taxonomy for application\n
    \  domains, independent of each other.  These vocabularies are often\n   bound
    to particular conceptual models, and are often semantically\n   incompatible with
    each other.  While it may be possible to adapt\n   protocols and convert representations,
    it is difficult to develop a\n   common application framework that works across
    ecosystems and\n   domains.\n\n   This article proposes a method that can be reused
    across application\n   domains and across ecosystems, to define a shared conceptual
    model\n   and common vocabulary.  A public resource is described which does for\n
    \  connected things what schema.org does for web commerce, to provide a\n   community
    driven vocabulary and simple ontology that enables web\n   scale interoperability
    between applications and connected things.\n\n\t "

  content: "Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions\napart
    from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data\npath between a source
    host and destination host.  Two such functions\nare network address translation
    and firewalling.\n\nWhen Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact
    with\nNATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, then\nproblems
    may occur in the transport of media traffic when signaling\nprotocol interaction
    takes place along the media path, as it is the\ncase for recent key exchange proposals
    (such as DTLS-SRTP).  This\ndocument highlights problems that may arise.  Unfortunately,
    it is\ndifficult for the end points to detect or predict problematic\nbehavior
    and to determine whether the media path is reliably\navailable for packet exchange.\n\nThis
    document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of\nNAT and firewall
    control, the reasons that they exist, and possible\nmeans of improving their behavior
    to allow protocols that rely upon\nsignaling along the media path to operate effectively.\n\t "

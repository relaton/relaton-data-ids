abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC ([RFC9000]) defines a RESET_STREAM frame to reset a stream. When
    a sender resets a stream, it stops retransmitting STREAM frames for this stream.
    On the receiver side, there is no guarantee that any of the data sent on that
    stream is delivered to the application. This document defines a new QUIC frame,
    the RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM frame, that resets a stream, while guaranteeing reliable
    delivery of stream data up to a certain byte offset.</p>"

  content: "This document defines a provisioning protocol for ENUM-SIP addressing\nservers.\nAn
    ENUM-SIP addressing server is a host that acts as Lookup Function\nin session
    peering to determine the target domain of a given SIP\nrequest and it may also
    act as a Location Routing Function to develop\nthe location of the SIP signaling
    entity in that target domain.\nThis protocol allows SIP service providers to provision
    and manage\nsession establishment data used by SIP network elements to route SIP\nsessions
    to the target destinations which may be served by the SIP\nservice provider's
    own internal network or by a session peering\npartner.  The data provisioned into
    an ENUM-SIP addressing server is\nqueried by SIP entities using ENUM or SIP.\n\nThis
    version of the protocol integrates comments received on the IETF\npeppermint and
    drinks mailing lists before July 2008.  This document\nis an Internet-Draft and
    the protocol it describes is subject to\ntechnical changes that may make this
    version incompatible with future\nversions defined in Internet-Drafts.  It is
    expected that the authors\nwill continue to update this protocol based on the
    drinks working\ngroup requirements on the session establishment data.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the Interzone Routing Protocol (IERP), the\nreactive
    routing component of the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP).  \nIERP adapts existing
    reactive routing protocol implementations to\ntake advantage of the known topology
    of each node's surrounding \nR-hop neighborhood (routing zone), provided by the
    Intrazone \nRouting Protocol (IARP).  The availability of routing zone routes
    \nallows IERP to suppress route queries for local destinations.  \nWhen a global
    route discovery is required, the routing zone based \nbordercast service can be
    used to efficiently guide route queries \noutward, rather than blindly relaying
    queries from neighbor to\nneighbor.   Once a route has been discovered, IERP can
    use routing\nzones to automatically redirect data around failed links.  \nSimilarly,
    suboptimal route segments can be identified and traffic\nre-routed along shorter
    paths.\n\t "

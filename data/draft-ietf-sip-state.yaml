- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP) that enables proxies to distribute call state to user\nagents. The state
    information can be returned to the proxy when the\nuser agent requests a change
    in the characteristics of the active\ncall. By providing the ability to distribute
    state to the user\nagents where it can be securely stored, proxy servers can remain\nstateless
    for the duration of the call. This mechanism allows a\nproxy server to provide
    services that depend on call state, while\nstill being stateless.\n\t "

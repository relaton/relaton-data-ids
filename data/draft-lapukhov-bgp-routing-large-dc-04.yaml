  content: "   Some service providers build and operate data centers that support\n
    \  over 100,000 servers.  In this document, such data centers are\n   referred
    to as \"large-scale\" to differentiate them from smaller\n   infrastructures.
    \ The environments of this scale have a unique set of\n   network requirements,
    with emphasis on operational simplicity and\n   network stability.\n\n   This
    document summarizes ideas and experience of many people involved\n   in designing
    and operating large scale data centers using BGP as the\n   only control-plane
    protocol.  The intent here is to report a proven\n   and stable routing design
    that could be leveraged by others in the\n   industry.\n\n\t "

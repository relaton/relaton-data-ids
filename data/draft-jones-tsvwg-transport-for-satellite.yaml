  content: "   IETF transport protocols such as TCP, SCTP and QUIC are designed to\n
    \  function correctly over any network path.  This includes networks\n   paths
    that utilise a satellite link or network.  While transport\n   protocols function,
    the characteristics of satellite networks can\n   impact performance when using
    the defaults in standard mechanisms,\n   due to the specific characteristics of
    these paths.\n\n   [RFC2488] and [RFC3135] describe mechanisms that enable TCP
    to more\n   effectively utilize the available capacity of a network path that\n
    \  includes a satellite system.  Since publication, both application and\n   transport
    layers and satellite systems have evolved.  Indeed, the\n   development of encrypted
    protocols such as QUIC challenges currently\n   deployed solutions, for satellite
    systems the capacity has increased\n   and commercial systems are now available
    that use a range of\n   satellite orbital positions.\n\n   This document follows
    the terminology proposed in\n   [I-D.irtf-panrg-path-properties] to describe the
    current\n   characterises of common satellite paths.  This document also\n   describes
    considerations when implementing and deploying reliable\n   transport protocols
    that are intended to work efficiently over paths\n   that include a satellite
    system.  It discusses available network\n   mitigations and offers advice to designers
    of protocols and operators\n   of satellite networks.\n\n\t "

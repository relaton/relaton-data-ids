  script: Latn
  content: "   This proposal defines key management approaches for the Quantum Safe\n
    \  Cryptographic (QSC) algorithm CRYSTALS-Dilithium which has been\n   selected
    for standardization by the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography\n   (PQC) process.  This
    includes key identification, key serialization,\n   and key compression.  The
    purpose is to provide guidance such that\n   the adoption of quantum safe algorithms
    is not hampered with the\n   fragmented evolution of necessary key management
    standards.  Early\n   definition of key material standards will help expedite
    the adoption\n   of new quantum safe algorithms and at the same time as improving\n
    \  interoperability between implementations and minimizing divergence\n   across
    standards.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a new URI scheme called http+srv which uses a\nDNS
    SRV lookup to locate a HTTP server.  The http+srv scheme operates\nin the same
    way as an http scheme but instead of the normal DNS\nlookup that a http scheme
    would use, it first tries an DNS SRV\nlookup.  This memo also defines a https+srv
    scheme that operates in\nthe same was as an https URI but uses DNS SRV lookups.\n\nThe
    draft is being discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org list.\n\t "

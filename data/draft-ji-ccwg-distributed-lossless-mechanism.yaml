- language: en

  content: "   This document proposes a congestion control mechanism based on\n   distributed
    AIDC lossless network.  It can effectively solve the\n   problem of declining
    model training performance due to congestion and\n   packet loss on long-distance
    links when training large models across\n   multiple data centers within a region.
    \ In addition, this document\n   outlines the practice scenario of this congestion
    control mechanism.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform\n
    \  the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on\n   the
    same flow.  In order to make ConEx information useful, reliable\n   auditing is
    necessary to provide a strong incentive to declare ConEx\n   information honestly.
    \ However, there is always a delay between\n   congestion events and the respective
    ConEx signal at the audit.  In\n   order to also provide a signal for risking
    congestion in the future,\n   in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech] it is proposed
    to use credit\n   signals sent in advance.  This document defines how the signals
    are\n   interpreted by an audit and lists requirements for an audit\n   implementation.
    \ It also discusses the security of the proposed\n   system and lists potential
    attacks on it.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path\n   computation
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n   When a Path Computation Client (PCC)
    requests a PCE for a route, it\n   may be useful for the PCC to specify as constraints
    to the path\n   computation abstract nodes, resources, and Shared Risk Link Groups\n
    \  (SRLGs) that are to be explicitly excluded from routes. Such\n   constraints
    are termed route exclusions.\n\n   The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed
    as a communication\n   protocol between PCCs and PCEs. This document presents
    PCEP\n   extensions for route exclusions.\n\t "

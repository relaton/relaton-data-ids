  content: "How to make IPv4 users utilize IPv6 applications is a typical\n   scenario
    of the IPv4/IPv6 inter-operation.  Nowadays, Tunnel Broker\n   and 6to4 tunnel
    mechanisms are the popular solutions for this\n   problem.  This paper proposes
    a multihoming based algorithm MI46 to\n   integrate Tunnel Broker and 6to4 tunnel
    mechanism.  It overcomes the\n   shortcomings of both Tunnel Broker and the 6to4
    tunnel mechanism to\n   form an optimized method to make the IPv4 users use the
    IPv6\n   applications.\n\n\t "

  content: "   RFC 2560 [RFC2560] allows CAs to designate one or more OCSP\n   Responders
    for being responsible to provide the revocation status\n   of the certificates
    they issue under a given CA key.\n\n   This document introduces a new feature
    that allows allows CAs to\n   split the workload between different sets of OCSP
    Responders in a\n   way that is analogous to the way CRLs can be split between\n
    \  different sets of CRL issuers (using the cRLDistributionPoints\n   extension).\n\n
    \  This new feature allows a CA to designate one or more OCSP\n   Responders for
    being responsible to provide the revocation status\n   for a subset of the certificates
    they issue under a given CA key.\n\n   This document defines a critical extension
    that may only be placed\n   in an OCSP certificate and the way it shall be processed
    by OCSP\n   clients.\n\n\t "

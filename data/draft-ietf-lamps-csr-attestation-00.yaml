abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A client requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority (CA)\n
    \  may wish to offer believable claims about the protections afforded to\n   the
    corresponding private key, such as whether the private key\n   resides on a hardware
    securtiy model or trusted platform module, and\n   the protection capabilities
    provided by the hardware module.\n   Including this evidence along with the certificate
    request can help\n   to improve the assessment of the security posture for the
    private\n   key, and suitability of the submitted key to the requested\n   certificate
    profile.  These evidence claims can include information\n   about the hardware
    component's manufacturer, the version of installed\n   or running firmware, the
    version of software installed or running in\n   layers above the firmware, or
    the presence of hardware components\n   providing specific protection capabilities
    or shielded locations\n   (e.g., to protect keys).  Producing, conveying, and
    appraising such\n   believable claims is enabled via remote attestation procedures
    where\n   the device holding the private key takes on the role of an attester\n
    \  and produces evidence that is made available to remote parties in a\n   cryptographically
    secured way.  This document describes two new\n   extensions to encode evidence
    produced by an attester for inclusion\n   in PKCS#10 or CRMF certificate signing
    requests: an ASN.1 Attribute\n   or Extension definition to convey a cryptographically-signed
    evidence\n   statement to a Registration Authority or to a Certification\n   Authority,
    and an ASN.1 Attribute or Extension to carry any\n   certificates necessary for
    validating the cryptographically-signed\n   evidence statement.\n\n\t "

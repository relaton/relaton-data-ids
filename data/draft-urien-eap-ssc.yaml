    \nbetween a Smart Card SC and an Authentication Server AS (e. g. RADIUS \nserver),
    as well according to an asymmetric key exchange model as a \nsymmetric key exchange
    model. This channel permits to convey in secure \nall other types of payload between
    the SC and the AS, for example the \ncommands which can setup or update the Directory
    Information Base (DIB) \nassociated to the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol) in the \nSmart Card. \n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely link-local\n   Multicast
    DNS enables discovery of services that are on the local\n   link, but not (without
    some kind of proxy or similar special support)\n   discovery of services that
    are outside the local link.  Using a very\n   large local link with thousands
    of hosts facilitates service\n   discovery, but at the cost of large amounts of
    multicast traffic.\n\n   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Unicast
    DNS is\n   more efficient and doesn't require excessively large multicast\n   domains,
    but requires that the relevant data be available in the\n   Unicast DNS namespace.
    \ This can be achieved by manual DNS\n   configuration (as has been done for many
    years at IETF meetings to\n   advertise the IETF Terminal Room printer) but this
    is labor\n   intensive, error prone, and requires a reasonable degree of DNS\n
    \  expertise.  The Unicast DNS namespace can be populated with the\n   required
    data automatically by the devices themselves, but that\n   requires configuration
    of DNS Update keys on the devices offering the\n   services, which has proven
    onerous and impractical for simple devices\n   like printers and network cameras.\n\n
    \  Hence, to facilitate efficient and reliable DNS-Based Service\n   Discovery,
    a compromise is needed that combines the ease-of-use of\n   Multicast DNS with
    the efficiency and scalability of Unicast DNS.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a reference architecture for privacy- preserving
    federated learning in multi-tenant AI agent deployments. It addresses the challenge
    of enabling collaborative model training across organizational boundaries while
    maintaining formal privacy guarantees and tenant data isolation. The architecture
    combines federated averaging, differential privacy mechanisms, and secure aggregation
    to enable cross-tenant knowledge transfer without exposing sensitive behavioral
    data.</p>"

  content: "Stream Control Transmission Protocol RFC2960 [2] is a multi-homed\n   transport
    protocol.  As such, unique security threats exists that are\n   addressed in various
    ways within the protocol itself.  This document\n   attempts to detail the known
    security threats and there\n   countermeasures as detailed in the current version
    of the SCTP\n   Implementors guide (SCTP-IG).  It is hoped that this information
    will\n   provide some useful background information for many of the newest\n   requirements
    spelled out in the SCTP-IG.\n\t "

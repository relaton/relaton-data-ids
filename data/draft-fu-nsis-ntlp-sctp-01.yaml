  content: "The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol currently\nuses
    TCP or TLS over TCP for connection mode operation.  This\ndocument describes the
    usage of GIST over the Stream Control\nTransmission Protocol (SCTP).  The use
    of SCTP can take the advantage\nof features provided by SCTP, namely streaming-based
    transport,\nsupport of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking, and the\nsupport
    of multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.\nAdditionally, the support
    for some extensions of SCTP is also\ndiscussed, namely its Partial Reliability
    Extension and the usage of\nTLS over SCTP.\n\t "

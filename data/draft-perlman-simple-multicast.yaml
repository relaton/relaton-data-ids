  content: "This paper describes a design for multicast that is simple to\nunderstand
    and low enough overhead for routers that a single scheme\ncan work both within
    and between domains. It also eliminates the need\nfor coordinated multicast address
    allocation across the Internet. It\nis not very different from the tree-based
    schemes CBT, PIM-SM, and\nBGMP. Essentially all of the mechanisms to support this
    have already\nbeen implemented in the other designs. The contribution of this\nprotocol
    is in what is NOT required to be implemented.\n\nThe main idea for simplifying
    multicast is to consider the identity\nof a group to be the 8-byte combination
    of a\n\t "

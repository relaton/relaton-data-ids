- language: en

  content: "This draft defines a way that floating point values may be \nrepresented
    as directory (ASCII) strings such that standard ordering \nrules can be used to
    sort the strings into the correct collating \nsequence for their numeric value.
    \ The representation is intended \nfor use in X.500 like directories, and has
    been developed to support\nmapping of the DMTF Common Information Model.\n\t "

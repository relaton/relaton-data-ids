  script: Latn
  content: "   HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an HTTP\n   authentication
    method with credentials that are not vulnerable to\n   phishing attacks, and that
    does not require a server-side password\n   database.  The design can also be
    used in Javascript-based\n   authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA is an alternative
    to HTTP\n   authentication schemes that require passwords with all the negative\n
    \  attributes that come with password-based systems.  HOBA can be\n   integrated
    with account management and other applications running\n   over HTTP and supports
    portability, so a user can associate more than\n   one device or origin-bound
    key with the same service.  We also\n   describe a way in which the HOBA design
    can be used from a Javascript\n   web client.  When deployed, HOBA will be a drop-in
    replacement for\n   password-based HTTP authentication or JavaScript authentication.\n\n\t "

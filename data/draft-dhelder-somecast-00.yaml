  content: "Somecast is a multi-point delivery technology that allows a packet to\nbe
    sent to a set of destinations.  Somecast delivery means that the\nnetwork delivers
    one copy of a packet to each destination listed in\nthe packet.  Somecast can
    be used in small multi-user sessions, such\nas multimedia conferences and multiplayer
    games, or used with endhost\nmulticast for larger sessions.  This document describes
    a possible\nimplementation of somecast in IPv4.  Somecast is implemented by using\nan
    IPv4 header option that includes a list of up to 9 additional\ndestination addresses.
    \ This document also describes how somecast can\nbe incrementally deployed.\n\n\t "

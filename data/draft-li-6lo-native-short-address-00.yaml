  content: "   This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address) that\n
    \  enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a\n   full
    length address may not be desirable.  This document focuses on\n   carrying IP
    packets across a LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in\n   which the nodes' location
    is fixed and changes in the logical\n   topology are caused only by unstable radio
    connectivity (not physical\n   mobility).  The specifications include NSA allocation,
    routing\n   mechanisms, header format design including length-variable fields,\n
    \  and IPv6 interconnection support.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This is a working document intended to trigger discussion and develop\n
    \  draft text for the CoAP protocol specification in the area of group\n   communication.
    \ Engineering tradeoffs become more challenging in\n   constrained environments,
    therefore group communication is considered\n   within the context of adjacent
    topics that may impact or be impacted\n   by design choices in the subject area.
    \ A solution based on IP\n   multicast is proposed.\n\n\t "

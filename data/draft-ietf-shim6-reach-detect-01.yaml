- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allows\nmultihoming
    by using multiple addresses. When communication between\nthe initially chosen
    addresses for a transport session is no longer\npossible, a \"shim\" layer makes
    it possible to switch to a different\nset of addresses without breaking current
    transport protocol\nassumptions. This draft discusses the issues of detecting
    failures\nin a currently used address pair between two hosts and picking a\nnew
    address pair to be used when a failure occurs. The input for\nthese processes
    are ordered lists of local and remote addresses\nthat are reasonably likely to
    work. (I.e., not include addresses\nthat are known to be unreachable for local
    reasons.) These lists\nmust be available at both ends of the communication, although
    the\nordering may differ. Building these address lists from locally\navailable
    information and synchronizing them with the remote end\nare outside the scope
    of this document.\n\nThis text is for the most part based on discussions on the
    multi6\nlist, several multi6 design team lists and the shim6 list, with\nnotable
    contributions from Erik Nordmark, Marcelo Bagnulo and Jari\nArkko. Suggestions
    and additions are more than welcome.\n\t "

  content: "   RFC 2461 [ND] describes host data forwarding and address resolution.\n
    \  However, nine years after the ND protocol became an RFC, IPv6 hosts\n   still
    do not fully comply with RFC 2461 [ND].  In particular, hosts\n   incorrectly
    implement on- vs. off-link data forwarding.  This\n   document clarifies host
    behavior and associated router behavior to\n   define explicitly address resolution
    and data forwarding models.  The\n   set of new requirements beyond what has been
    specified in RFC 2461\n   [ND] and RFC 2462 [ADDRCONF] is restricted to clarifications
    deemed\n\n   necessary to facilitate correct implementation.  The intention of\n
    \  this document is to incorporate normative changes into\n   draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2461bis-11
    [NDbis] and\n   draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2462bis-08 [ADDRCONFbis].  After this has been\n
    \  accomplished, this document will be on track to become an\n   Informational
    RFC.  Following the same model as RFC 2525 [TCPProb], a\n   section of this document
    collects known IPv6 ND implementation\n   problems.\n\n\t "

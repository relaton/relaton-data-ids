- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In addition to being used for forwarding, an MPLS label stack may\n
    \  also be used as an entropy source to perform load balancing\n   computation
    in various ways.  RFC 4928 and RFC 6790 describe this\n   mechanism in great detail.
    \ However, those two RFCs differ in the use\n   of MPLS special purpose labels
    (previously referred to as \"reserved\n   labels\") for computation of load balancing.
    \ This document addresses\n   this difference in specifications by providing a
    more comprehensive\n   set of recommendations.\n\n   This document updates RFC
    4928 and RFC 6790.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Many devices are now connected to the Internet. Receiving instantaneous
    notifications from the Web is an appealing but possibly power-hungry feature.
    This can be a substantial problem for light devices with limited battery capacities.
    WebPush alleviates this problem by enabling a server to push notifications to
    the device instead of having the device regularly poll the server. This is a first
    step towards more energy efficient devices, but is still not sufficient for enabling
    batteries to last weeks or months without recharging.</p>"

  content: "This document defines an IP paging concept that supports a registered\nidle
    state of a mobile node and coordinates paging independent of the\nunderlying layer-2
    medium. The concept specifies a generic protocol\nthat allows to abstract away
    from layer-2 paging capabilities up to\nthe Access Routers, providing wired or
    wireless network access to\nidle mobile terminals. A new entity, called Paging
    Agent, is\nintroduced. This Paging Agent supports employment of several\ndifferent
    paging strategies. The reference mobility architecture of\nthis specification
    is Mobile IPv6. Avoiding modifications of Mobile\nIPv6 entities, the paging concept
    integrates modularly into the\nmobility environment\n\t "

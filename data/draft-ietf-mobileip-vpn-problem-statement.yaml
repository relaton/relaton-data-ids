  content: "Mobile IP [1] agents are being deployed in enterprise networks, \nto enable
    mobile users with network mobility across wired and \nwireless LANs while roaming
    inside the enterprise firewall.  \nWith the growing deployment of multi-subnetted
    IEEE 802.11 \nnetworks (referred as hot spots) in public places such as \nhotels,
    airports, and convention centers, and wireless WAN data \nnetworks such as GPRS,
    the need for enabling mobile users to \nmaintain their transport connections and
    constant reachability \nwhile connecting back to their target 'home' networks
    protected \nby VPNs is increasing.  This draft identifies example usage \nscenarios
    for enterprise users roaming outside the firewall, \nand defines a problem statement
    based on the scenarios.\n\t "

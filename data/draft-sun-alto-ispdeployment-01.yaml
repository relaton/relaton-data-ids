  content: "As ALTO specification continues in the ALTO Working Group and some\n  applications
    start to conduct integration with ALTO, more ISPs\n  start to evaluate key issues
    in the deployment of ALTO in their\n  networks. In this document, we discuss key
    issues that an ISP\n  needs to consider when deploying ALTO. In particular, we
    discuss\n  issues on how to configure ALTO information as well as how to\n  monitor
    the effectiveness of ALTO.\n\t "

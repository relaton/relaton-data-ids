    \  point to point and multipoint calls can benefit from options that\n   will
    enable them to pause and resume media streams as well as to\n   indicate a mute
    state.  This document describes the difference\n   between pause and mute and
    describes how to provide this required\n   functionality.  This document updates
    RFC5104.\n\n\t "

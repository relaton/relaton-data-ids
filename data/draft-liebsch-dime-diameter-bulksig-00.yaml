  content: "   Diameter has received wide acceptance in large scale networking based\n
    \  on applications like Network Access Server and Credit Control.\n   Different
    Standards Development Organizations consider Diameter as\n   base protocol for
    extended applications, e.g. to push or pull\n   information between a Diameter
    client and server without alignment of\n   application states and identification
    schemes with the Session-ID\n   concept as utilized by the Diameter protocol.
    \ The use of Diameter\n   bulk signaling to enable transmission of multi-user
    context with a\n   single or few messages for application state recovery after
    failure\n   represents a further use case, which requires investigation on its\n
    \  impact to the Diameter base specification.  This document analyzes\n   various
    use cases for Diameter bulk signaling and assesses practices\n   to enable operation
    of such use cases from extended or new\n   applications.\n\n\t "

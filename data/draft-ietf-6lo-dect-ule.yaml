  content: "Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) Ultra Low Energy (ULE)
    is a low-power air interface technology that is proposed by the DECT Forum and
    is defined and specified by ETSI.\n\n The DECT air interface technology has been
    used worldwide in communication devices for more than 20 years. It has primarily
    been used to carry voice for cordless telephony but has also been deployed for
    data-centric services.\n\n DECT ULE is a recent addition to the DECT interface
    primarily intended for low-bandwidth, low-power applications such as sensor devices,
    smart meters, home automation, etc. As the DECT ULE interface inherits many of
    the capabilities from DECT, it benefits from operation that is long-range and
    interference-free, worldwide- reserved frequency band, low silicon prices, and
    maturity. There is an added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over
    DECT ULE, such as for Internet of Things applications.\n\n This document describes
    how IPv6 is transported over DECT ULE using IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal
    Area Network (6LoWPAN) techniques.\n\t "

  content: "   While there are several established protocols for end-to-end\n   encryption,
    relatively little attention has been given to securely\n   distributing the end-user
    public keys for such encryption.  As a\n   result, these protocols are often still
    vulnerable to eavesdropping\n   by active attackers.  Key Transparency is a protocol
    for distributing\n   sensitive cryptographic information, such as public keys,
    in a way\n   that reliably either prevents interference or detects that it\n   occurred
    in a timely manner.\n\n\t "

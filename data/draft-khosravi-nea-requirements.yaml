  content: "This document defines the interface (protocol) requirements between \nthe
    components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) conceptual \narchitecture.
    \ NEA provides owners of networks (e.g. an enterprise \noffering remote access)
    a mechanism to learn the operational state \nor posture of a system requesting
    network access and then apply this \nknowledge to the network admission decision.
    \ In this case, \noperational posture refers to information about the configuration
    \nand use of hardware and software capabilities available or running \non the
    system.  This information is frequently useful for detecting \nsystems that are
    lacking (or have out of date) security protective \nmechanisms (e.g. anti-virus,
    firewall.) \n \nIn order to provide context for the requirements, a conceptual
    \narchitecture and terminology is introduced.  This architecture is \nprovided
    for informational purposes but is based on the models used \nby NAC[9], NAP[10]
    and TNC[8].\n\t "

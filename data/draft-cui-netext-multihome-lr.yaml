- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In basic PMIPv6[RFC5213], Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) should forward\n
    \  all traffic for the registered MN.  Localized Routing (LR) for PMIPv6\n   proposed
    in [RFC6705] allows MN to exchange data directly by using\n   localized forwarding
    or tunnel between the MAGs.  But in some multi-\n   access scenarios, it is apparently
    suboptimal.  The present document\n   proposes two localized routing mechanisms
    that are compatible with\n   RFC 6705 for multi-access MNs which have some interfaces
    attached to\n   the same MAGs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an architecture of DNS service system for \n
    \  mobile ad hoc network which might be connected to the Internet.  The \n   resolution
    of DNS names of mobile nodes within mobile ad hoc network \n   is performed by
    multicast DNS and that of DNS names of nodes in the \n   Internet is performed
    through DNS autoconfiguration of recursive DNS \n   server.  In the former, each
    mobile node plays a role of DNS name \n   server for the DNS resource records
    associated with DNS name of which \n   authority it has.  The latter allows mobile
    node to receive the \n   global Internet service, such as web service, by providing
    global DNS \n   resolution in mobile ad hoc network connected to the Internet.
    \ These \n   two kinds of DNS name resolution are processed automatically without
    \n   the intervention of users in mobile ad hoc network.  Also, this \n   document
    specifies how to authenticate DNS message as well as how to \n   provide ad hoc
    users with service discovery based on multicast DNS. \n\t "

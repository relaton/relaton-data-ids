  content: "We propose to use an IPv6 tunneling mechanism and encapsulate IPv4\n   packets
    into IPv6 packets. This eases the transition and routers do\n   not need to support
    IPv6 and IPv4 routing tables. The IN_ADDR.arpa\n   domain is used to find IPv4
    to IPv6 correspondence in a way that does\n   not prevent the asymmetrical routing
    and multi-homing.\n \n   The model also simplifies IPv4 address management since
    the address\n   has no more a localization function but only an identification\n
    \  function.\n\t "

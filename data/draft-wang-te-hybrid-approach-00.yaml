- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Currently a common approach to IP network traffic engineering is\nthe
    overlay approach where explicit end to end MPLS LSPs between all\npossible edge
    nodes are established to form a full mesh virtual network\non top of the physical
    topology. By carefully choosing the routes for\nthese LSPs, one can completely
    control how traffic flows across the \nnetwork and therefore achieve any given
    traffic engineering objective. \nHowever scalability is a serious concern with
    this approach because it\nrequires N square number of LSPs where N is the number
    of nodes. \n\n\t "

  content: "   The Peering API currently under discussion in the GROW Working Group\n
    \  does not provide a standardised mechanism to authenticate parties\n   engaged
    in the Peering API.  This document specifies a method to\n   attest as to the
    identities of parties in an OpenID Connect (OIDC)\n   exchange, binding the authentication
    flow to agents of ASNs.\n\nDiscussion\n\n   This note is to be removed before
    publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be
    found at\n   https://github.molgen.mpg.de/q/rpki-peering-api-discovery.\n\n\t "

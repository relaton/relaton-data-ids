  content: "   Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated\n   probability
    of session establishment to specific sessions in times of\n   network congestion.
    When supported over the Internet Protocol suite,\n   this may be facilitated through
    a network layer admission control\n   solution that supports prioritized access
    to resources (e.g.,\n   bandwidth).  These resources may be explicitly set aside
    for\n   prioritized sessions, or may be shared with other sessions.  This\n   document
    specifies extensions to the Resource reSerVation Protocol\n   (RSVP) that can
    be used to support such an admission priority\n   capability at the network layer.\n\n
    \  Based on current security concerns, these extensions are targeting\n   applicability
    within a single domain.\n\n\t "

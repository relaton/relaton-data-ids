- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Certain application protocols are highly transactional and require\n
    \  substantial care when dealing with latency.  Queries for versioning\n   information
    are, in these circumstances, costly.  In addition, there\n   is a desire to allow
    for a means to specify a lightweight means to\n   alternative transport protocols,
    such as making use of SCTP instead\n   of TCP.  This memo specifies a new DNS
    RR with an eye toward the\n   least necessary roundtrips to determine various
    protocols, port\n   numbers, and options for a given service instance.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) requires clients to have the server's ECH\n
    \  configuration before connecting.  Currently, when ECH fails, servers\n   can
    send updated configurations but clients cannot authenticate them\n   without a
    certificate for the public name, limiting deployment\n   flexibility.\n\n   This
    document specifies an authenticated ECH configuration update\n   mechanism.  Servers
    can deliver signed ECH configurations during the\n   TLS handshake, allowing clients
    to authenticate and immediately use\n   them for retry.  The mechanism decouples
    ECH key distribution from\n   transport, enabling the same signed configuration
    to work via DNS or\n   TLS delivery.\n\n\t "

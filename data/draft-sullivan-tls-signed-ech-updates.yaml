abstract:
- content: "<p>Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) requires clients to have the server's ECH
    configuration before connecting. Currently, when ECH fails, servers can send updated
    configurations but clients cannot authenticate them without a certificate for
    the public name, limiting deployment flexibility. This document specifies an authenticated
    ECH configuration update mechanism. Servers can deliver signed ECH configurations
    during the TLS handshake, allowing clients to authenticate and immediately use
    them for retry. The mechanism decouples ECH key distribution from transport, enabling
    the same signed configuration to work via DNS or TLS delivery.</p>"

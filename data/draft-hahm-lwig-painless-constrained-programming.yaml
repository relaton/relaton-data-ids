  script: Latn
  content: "   In order to fit the constraints of Class 0 devices (offering much\n
    \  less than 10KiB of RAM and 100KiB of ROM) there are no alternatives\n   to
    implementing IP protocols in special software environments, which\n   impose programming
    paradigms that make implementation of protocol\n   specifications significantly
    more complex.  However, our experience\n   implementing RFC 4944 and RFC 6282,
    TCP and UDP on Class 1 devices\n   (offering approximately 10KiB of RAM and 100KiB
    of ROM) shows that\n   there are alternatives concerning software environments
    in which to\n   implement IP protocols, which avoid such complexity by providing
    a\n   more developer-friendly environment.  This draft shares this\n   experience.\n\n\t "

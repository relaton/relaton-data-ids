  content: "   This document defines the purchase exchange format (PEF), which\n   consists
    of signed purchase records, to enable sharing, verification,\n   and transfer
    of information about license ownership.  This enables\n   sharing of abonnements,
    rentals, and one-time-purchases across\n   platforms as well as deleting or switching
    accounts of (media)\n   service providers without loosing or double-purchasing
    products.  It\n   can also be applied to non-media products.\n\n\t "

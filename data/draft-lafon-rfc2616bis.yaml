  content: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level\nprotocol
    for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information\nsystems.  It is a generic,
    stateless, protocol which can be used for\nmany tasks beyond its use for hypertext,
    such as name servers and\ndistributed object management systems, through extension
    of its\nrequest methods, error codes and headers [RFC2324].  A feature of\nHTTP
    is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing\nsystems to be
    built independently of the data being transferred.\n\nHTTP has been in use by
    the World-Wide Web global information\ninitiative since 1990.  This specification
    defines the protocol\nreferred to as \"HTTP/1.1\", and is an update to RFC2616.Editorial
    Note (To be removed by RFC Editor before publication)\n\nDistribution of this
    document is unlimited.  Please send comments to\nthe Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    (HTTP) mailing list at\nietf-http-wg@w3.org [1], which may be joined by sending
    a message\nwith subject \"subscribe\" to ietf-http-wg-request@w3.org [2].\nDiscussions
    of the HTTP working group are archived at\n<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/>.
    \ XML versions,\nlatest edits and the issues list for this document are available
    from\n<http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/rfc2616bis/>.\n\nThe purpose of this
    document is to revise [RFC2616], doing only\nminimal corrections.  For now, it
    is not planned to advance the\nstandards level of HTTP, thus - if published -
    the specification will\nstill be a \"Proposed Standard\" (see [RFC2026]).\n\nThe
    current plan is to incorporate known errata, and to update the\nspecification
    text according to the current IETF publication\nguidelines.  In particular:\n\no
    \ Incorporate the corrections collected in the RFC2616 errata\n\ndocument (<http://purl.org/NET/http-errata>)
    (most of the\n\nsuggested fixes have been applied to draft 01 [3]).\n\no  Incorporate
    corrections for newly discovered and agreed-upon\n\nproblems, using the HTTP WG
    mailing list as forum and\n\n<http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/rfc2616bis/issues/>
    as\n\nissues list.\n\no  Update references, and re-classify them into \"Normative\"
    and\n\n\"Informative\", based on the prior work done by Jim Gettys in\n\n<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gettys-http-v11-spec-rev-00>.\n\nThis
    document is based on a variant of the original RFC2616\nspecification formatted
    using Marshall T. Rose's \"xml2rfc\" tool (see\n<http://xml.resource.org>) and
    therefore deviates from the original\ntext in word wrapping, page breaks, list
    formatting, reference\nformatting, whitespace usage and appendix numbering.  Otherwise,
    it\nis supposed to contain an accurate copy of the original specification\ntext.
    \ See <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/\nrfc2616bis-00-from-rfc2616.diff.html>
    for a comparison between both\ndocuments, as generated by \"rfcdiff\"\n(<http://tools.ietf.org/tools/rfcdiff/>).\n\t "

  content: "   This memo proposes use cases for LISP in the area of end Host\n   mobility.
    \ The applicability of end host mobility can be found in\n   data centers, where
    Virtual Machines (VM's) can be moved freely from\n   one physical server onto
    another physical server, independent of\n   location, without having to change
    the IP/MAC-addresses inside those\n   VMs, nor impacting traffic flows to and
    from those VMs.  Wireless end\n   hosts are another area of applicability.  Although
    this draft will\n   not address wireless end host mobility, most of the same principles\n
    \  apply.\n\n   Traditionally L2 extension technologies have been used to handle\n
    \  mobility events, but they could lead to suboptimal routing of traffic\n   to
    and from the end host after the mobility event, as well as created\n   big broadcast
    domains.  This memo describes how LISP solves the\n   traffic optimization issues
    caused by a mobility event of an end host\n   like a Virtual Machine, as it decouples
    the identity of the end host\n   from its location, such that traffic will always
    be forwarded to the\n   correct location.  More-over the LISP control plane can
    be leveraged\n   to discover and distribute the reachability information of end
    hosts\n   such that end to end broadcast domains, and their associated\n   problems,
    are no longer needed.\n\n   Various sub-use cases will be looked at in this draft,
    depending on\n   whether mobility is achieved at L2 (using MAC-addresses as EID)
    or at\n   L3 (using IP addresses as EIDs), and whether subnets are L2 extended\n
    \  across LISP sites or not.  This memo also describes how to handle\n   mobility
    in the case where the default gateway of the end host is not\n   capable of performing
    the LISP map-and-encap function, while the LISP\n   xTR function is located one
    or more L3 hops away from the default\n   gateway.\n\n\n\t "

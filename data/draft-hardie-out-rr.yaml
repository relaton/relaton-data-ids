  content: "The Domain Name System is a global distributed lookup system with\ndelegation.
    \ In the original specification of the DNS [RFC 1035],\nCLASSes were described
    as parallel data structures within a single\nnamespace but with potentially different
    delegations of authority.\n[BCP 42] defines a different vision, in which different
    CLASSes\nrepresent fundamentally different namespaces.  Though [BCP 42]\nincludes
    procedures for assignment of CLASSes, there has been\nlittle use of this axis
    of extensibility; in practice, CLASS IN is\nthe only widely deployed CLASS in
    the DNS.  The ubiquity of CLASS\nIN for name to IP address mapping has caused
    a vicious cycle in\nwhich extensions are placed within that CLASS to take advantage
    of\nits global deployment, with each addition further increasing its\ngravitational
    attraction.  This document describes a Resource\nRecord for use within CLASS IN
    that contains a pointer to a CLASS\noutside of IN.  This mechanism is intended
    to allow administrators\nto indicate that a named resource identified within CLASS
    IN is\nalso present in a different namespace, potentially under a different\nname.
    \ This cross-class pointer will allow the DNS to handle\nnew namespaces with mechanisms
    appropriate to those namespaces\nwhile providing a connection to the globally
    deployed CLASS IN\nnamespace.\n\t "

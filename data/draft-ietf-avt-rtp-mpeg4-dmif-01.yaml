  content: "This memorandum describes how RTP carrying MPEG-4 payloads interacts\nwith
    the MPEG-4 Access Unit layer through the MPEG (Delivery\nMultimedia Integration
    Framework) DMIF. DMIF is used to pass\ninformation essential for the packing and
    unpacking of MPEG-4 streams\ninto RTP as well as for adjusting the MPEG-4 AL-PDU
    lengths to be\nwithin the path MTU.\n \nDMIF interprets the RTCP reports by comparing
    its statistics to the\nrequested MPEG-4 media based QoS. If the statistics fail
    to meet the\nrequested QoS then action is taken to either continue with the impaired\nperforamce,
    upgrade the network service class, scale down the stream or\ndelete the stream.\n
    \nThis specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport working\ngroup
    within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are\nsolicited and should
    be addressed to the working group's mailing list\nat rem-conf@es.net and/or the
    authors.\n\t "

  content: "The Generic Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol depends on\npacket
    interception to identify the nodes that should participate in\nsignalling sessions.
    \ The base protocol assumes n-tuple analysis of\nthe packet header as the interception
    algorithm.  This document\ndescribes an experimental extension to GIST to use
    the Router Alert\nOption (RAO) to enhance interception efficiency.  It describes
    the\ntradeoffs in using such an approach including the impact on legacy\nequipment
    and protocol deployability, and also the considerations to\nbe taken into account
    in selecting values for the RAO value field.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload format for Generic\n
    \  Forward Error Correction (FEC), specified in RFC 5109, forbids\n   transmitting
    FEC repair flows as separate sources in the same RTP\n   session as the flows
    being repaired.  This document updates RFC 5109\n   to lift that restriction,
    as long as the association between original\n   and repair flows is properly signaled
    and negotiated.\n\n\t "

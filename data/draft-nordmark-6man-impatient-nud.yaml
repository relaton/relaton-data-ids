  content: "   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection.\n
    \  That function is very useful when a host has an alternative, for\n   instance
    multiple default routers, since it allows the host to switch\n   to the alternative
    in short time.  This time is 3 seconds after the\n   node starts probing.  However,
    if there are no alternatives, this is\n   far too impatient.  This document proposes
    an approach where an\n   implementation can choose the timeout behavior to be
    different based\n   on whether or not there are alternatives.\n\n\t "

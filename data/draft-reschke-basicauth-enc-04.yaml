abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The \"Basic\" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not\n
    \  properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has lead to\n   a
    situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers\n   make different
    assumptions based on the locales they are running in.\n   There is little interoperability
    for characters in the ISO-8859-1\n   character set, and even less interoperability
    for any characters\n   beyond that.\n\n   This document defines a backwards-compatible
    extension to \"Basic\",\n   specifying the server's character encoding expectation,
    using a new\n   authentication scheme parameter.\n\n\t "

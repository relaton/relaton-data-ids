  content: "SIP servers can become overload and unable to handle all SIP messages
    \n   they receive.  Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited \n   overload
    control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable) \n   response code, SIP
    servers are still vulnerable to overload.  This \n   document proposes an architecture
    for determining when a client \n   should throttle the sending of SIP requests
    vs. retrying them. \n\t "

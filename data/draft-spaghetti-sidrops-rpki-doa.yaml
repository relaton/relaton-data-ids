  content: "   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile\n
    \  for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the Resource\n   Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  A DOA is a digitally signed object\n   that provides
    a means of verifying that an IP address block holder\n   has authorized an Autonomous
    System (AS) to originate routes to one\n   or more prefixes within the address
    block tagged with a specific set\n   of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Communities,
    to signal a request to\n   discard IP traffic destined towards the tagged IP prefix.\n\n\n\t "

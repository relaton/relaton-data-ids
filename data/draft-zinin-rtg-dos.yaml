  content: "   The mechanism described in this document helps to secure an Internet\n
    \  Service Provider's router infrastructure from outsider attacks,\n   including
    (but not limited to) Distributed denial of service (DDoS)\n   attacks based on
    CPU and/or queue exhaustion (e.g., TCP SYN flooding\n   and flooding of invalid
    MD5-signed routing protocol packets.) The\n   presented approach is based on explicitly
    marking control packets\n   from trusted sources by different link-layer encapsulation
    and does\n   not require any modifications to user data exchange protocols, ICMP,\n
    \  routing protocols or changes to existing hardware in routers, which\n   allows
    it to be deployed quickly throughout the Internet.\n\t "

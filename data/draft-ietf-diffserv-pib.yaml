  content: "This document describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) for a device \nimplementing
    the Differentiated Services Architecture.  The \nprovisioning classes defined
    here provide policy control of \nresources implementing the Differentiated Services
    Architecture.  \nThese provisioning classes can be used with other none \nDifferentiated
    Services provisioning classes (defined in other PIBs) \nto provide for a comprehensive
    policy controlled mapping of service \nrequirement to device resource capability
    and usage.\n\t "

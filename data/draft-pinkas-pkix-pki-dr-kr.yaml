  content: "   This document presents a framework to assist the writers of policy
    \n   or practice statements and the designers of a Public Key \n   Infrastructure
    to prepare disaster recovery plans in case of a\n   private key-compromise or
    a private key-loss.  This may happen to \n   end-entity keys, Certification Authorities,
    Revocation Authorities, \n   Attribute Authorities, or Time-Stamping Authorities.
    \ Since \n   certificates have finite validity, CA key-rollover should be \n   planned
    in advance. \n\n   In addition, denial of service attacks on Repositories holding
    \n   CRLs has also to be considered.\n\n   This framework provides a comprehensive
    list of potential key-\n   compromise or key-loss conditions that, in the opinion
    of the \n   authors, should be addressed so that it is possible to quickly \n
    \  recover from exceptional situations.\n\n\n\t "

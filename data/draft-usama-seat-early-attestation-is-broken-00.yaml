abstract:
- content: "<p>Sheffer et al. published [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] on 9th
    January, 2025 and despite being wildly out of scope of SEAT charter, the draft
    made its place -- getting two-thirds of meeting time -- in the agenda for upcoming
    SEAT interim meeting within hours of publishing. In comparison, our request to
    present [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] fully within the charter was refused. In this
    document, we disprove the claim made in [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] for
    backward compatibility with standard TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis]. We argue that
    [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] is a much more reaonsable way of achieving the goal within
    the scope of SEAT charter.</p>"

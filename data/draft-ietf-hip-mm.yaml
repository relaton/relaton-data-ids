  content: "This document defines mobility and multihoming extensions to the Host
    Identity Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a general \"LOCATOR\"
    parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate
    addresses at which it may be reached.  This document also defines elements of
    procedure for mobility of a HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically
    changes the primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While the same LOCATOR
    parameter can also be used to support end-host multihoming, detailed procedures
    are left for further study.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

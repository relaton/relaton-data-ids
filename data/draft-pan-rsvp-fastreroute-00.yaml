  content: "This document describes the use of RSVP [RSVP, RSVP-TE] to establish\nbackup
    LSP tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels.\n\nTwo methods are presented here.
    One is to setup one-to-one detour LSPs\naccording to the requirements defined
    by the head-end users. The other\nis to setup many-to-one bypass LSP using a single
    bypass tunnel to\nbackup a set of protected LSPs (making use of label stacking)
    to reroute\nboth data and control traffic.  Both methods can protect both link
    and\nnode during network failure, and make use of local protection\ntechniques.\n\n\t "

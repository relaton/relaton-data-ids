  content: "   Intent and Intent-Based Networking are taking the industry by storm.\n
    \  At the same time, those terms are used loosely and often\n   inconsistently,
    in many cases overlapping and confused with other\n   concepts such as \"policy\".
    \ This document is intended to clarify the\n   concept of \"Intent\" and provide
    an overview of functionality that\n   associated with it.  The goal is to contribute
    towards a common and\n   shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality
    which can\n   be used as foundation to guide further definition of associated\n
    \  research and engineering problems and their solutions.\n\n\t "

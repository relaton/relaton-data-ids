  content: "IKE is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual \n   authentication
    and establishing and maintaining security\n   associations (SAs). This document
    presents the changes in\n   Internet Key Exchange Version 2 for one time password.
    \n   The proposed method of using OTP in IKEv2 not only\n   enhances the security
    but also has less number of exchange\n   messages as compared to existing OTP-EAP
    based method.\n\n\t "

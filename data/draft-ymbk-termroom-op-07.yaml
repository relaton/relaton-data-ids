  content: "Creating and running the 'terminal room' for an IETF meeting is\ntantamount
    to building, running, and dismantling a small computer\ncenter.  Although this
    is a well-known area of operations, the unique\nenvironment and its ephemeral
    nature warrant passing on the lore in a\nmildly organized fashion.  It is expected
    that this document will be\nupdated regularly.  However, it is not clear that
    this will ever be\npublished as an RFC.\nAs the IETF can ill afford failure of
    this service, it is assumed\nthat the host and organizers have the experience
    and resources to\nbuild such environments, understand power facilities, cabling,
    WAN\nand LAN building, workstation provisioning, staffing, etc.  So this\ndocument
    does not attempt to detail how to build computer facilities\nor carry out prudent
    project management.  Rather it concentrates on\nthe unique aspects of the IETF
    'terminal room'.\n\t "

  content: "When a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy receives a request\ntargeted
    at a URI identifying a user or resource it is responsible\nfor, the proxy translates
    the URI to a configured URI, or to a\nregistered contact URI, of an agent representing
    that user or\nresource.  In the process, the original URI is removed from the\nrequest.
    \ Numerous use cases have arisen which require this\ninformation to be delivered
    to the user agent.  This document\ndescribes these use cases and defines an extension
    to the History-\nInfo header field which allows it to be used to support those
    cases.\n\t "

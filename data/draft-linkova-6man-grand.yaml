  content: "   Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the\n
    \  link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and\n   maintain
    reachability information.  This document updates [RFC4861]\n   to allow routers
    to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a\n   new IPv6 address is assigned
    to a host.  It also updates [RFC4862]\n   and recommends hosts to send unsolicited
    Neighbor Advertisements upon\n   assigning a new IPv6 address.  The proposed change
    will minimize the\n   delay and packet loss when a host initiate connections to
    off-link\n   destination from a new IPv6 address.\n\n\t "

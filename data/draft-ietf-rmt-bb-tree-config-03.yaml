  content: "The Reliable Multicast Transport Working Group has been chartered \nto
    standardize multicast transport services. This working group \nexpects to initially
    standardize three protocol instantiations. \nThis draft is concerned with the
    requirements of the tree-based \nACK protocol. In particular, it is concerned
    with defining the \nbuilding block for auto-configuration of the logical ACK-tree.
    \nAccording to the charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained \nmodular component
    that is common to multiple protocols along with \nabstract APIs that define a
    building block's access methods and \ntheir arguments.'  For more information,
    see the Reliable \nMulticast Transport Building Blocks and Reliable Multicast
    Design \nSpace documents [WLKHFL01][HWKFV00].\n\t "

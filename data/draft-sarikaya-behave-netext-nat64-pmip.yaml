  content: "This memo specifies modifications required to Mobile Access Gateway\nand
    Local Mobility Anchor to integrate NAT64 with Proxy Mobile IP so\nthat mobile
    nodes (MN) receiving network-based mobility management\nusing Proxy Mobile IPv6
    (PMIPv6) can communicate with IPv4 only\nservers.  The protocol is based on local
    mobility anchors maintaining\na table similar to NAT64 and linking it to the binding
    cache.  The\nchanges include better keepalive management in order to preserve\nbattery
    on the mobile node as well as multicast support for NAT64\nintegrated into the
    current multicast support scheme in Proxy Mobile\nIPv6 so that IPv6 only mobile
    nodes can receive multicast data from\nIPv4 only content providers.\n\t "

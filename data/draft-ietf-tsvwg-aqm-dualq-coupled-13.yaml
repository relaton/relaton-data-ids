  script: Latn
  content: "   The Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture\n   allows
    data flows over the public Internet to achieve consistent low\n   queuing latency,
    generally zero congestion loss and scaling of per-\n   flow throughput without
    the scaling problems of standard TCP Reno-\n   friendly congestion controls.  To
    achieve this, L4S data flows have\n   to use one of the family of 'Scalable' congestion
    controls (TCP\n   Prague and Data Center TCP are examples) and a form of Explicit\n
    \  Congestion Notification (ECN) with modified behaviour.  However,\n   until
    now, Scalable congestion controls did not co-exist with\n   existing Reno/Cubic
    traffic --- Scalable controls are so aggressive\n   that 'Classic' (e.g. Reno-friendly)
    algorithms sharing an ECN-capable\n   queue would drive themselves to a small
    capacity share.  Therefore,\n   until now, L4S controls could only be deployed
    where a clean-slate\n   environment could be arranged, such as in private data
    centres (hence\n   the name DCTCP).  This specification defines `DualQ Coupled
    Active\n   Queue Management (AQM)', which enables Scalable congestion controls\n
    \  that comply with the Prague L4S requirements to co-exist safely with\n   Classic
    Internet traffic.\n\n   Analytical study and implementation testing of the Coupled
    AQM have\n   shown that Scalable and Classic flows competing under similar\n   conditions
    run at roughly the same rate.  It achieves this\n   indirectly, without having
    to inspect transport layer flow\n   identifiers.  When tested in a residential
    broadband setting, DCTCP\n   also achieves sub-millisecond average queuing delay
    and zero\n   congestion loss under a wide range of mixes of DCTCP and `Classic'\n
    \  broadband Internet traffic, without compromising the performance of\n   the
    Classic traffic.  The solution has low complexity and requires no\n   configuration
    for the public Internet.\n\n\t "

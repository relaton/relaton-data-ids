  content: "Proxy services are a new class of applications running on caching \nproxies
    or dedicated application servers, preferably at the network \nedge. They are described
    in [2] and [3]. Execution of proxy services \nis triggered by certain conditions.
    These conditions are service \nspecific and have to be provided by the party on
    behalf of which the \naffected service modules are executed. \nThe Proxy Service
    Rule Specification Language (PSRL) is an XML-based \nlanguage that can be used
    to describe service specific execution \nrules. It allows a service provider to
    tell a proxy caching provider \nwhen and how the services should be executed.

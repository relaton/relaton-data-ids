  content: "   Nowadays access to the Internet is a part of daily life.  Users see\n
    \  URIs written in various ways on various media, recognize them as \"the\n   Internet
    Addresses\", and use them to access to the Internet.  Many\n   application programs
    recognize URIs automatically and make links to\n   them, so the users can access
    to the URIs very easily.  But, at this\n   moment, most of application programs
    can't recognize\n   Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) and Internationalized
    URI (IRI)\n   correctly, so users will feel stress when using IDNs and IRIs.\n\n
    \  Utilization of the IDNs and the IRIs are getting higher.  Therefore,\n   improvement
    of the application programs are highly recommended.  This\n   document is intended
    to be an application developpers' guideline for\n   recognizing and corresponding
    to IDNs/IRIs correctly.\n\n\t "

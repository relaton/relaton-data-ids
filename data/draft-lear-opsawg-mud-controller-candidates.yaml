  content: "   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) are a means by which devices\n
    \  can establish expectations about how they are intended to behave, and\n   how
    the network should treat them.  This extension provides a means\n   for a MUD
    controller to identify itself through its own MUD file.\n\n\t "

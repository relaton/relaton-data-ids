  content: "Although the use of the Reason header field in responses is\nconsidered
    in RFC3326, doing so is not specified for any existing\nresponse code.  Nonetheless,
    the Reason header field has been widely\nused in responses to carry Q.850 reason
    codes for failure responses\nto INVITEs that have been gatewayed to PSTN systems.
    \ This document\nspecifies and formally permits the use of the Reason header field
    in\nSIP responses to carry Q.850 reason codes for this and other\npurposes.\n\t "

  content: "   As network virtualization is opening the gate to much more innovative\n
    \  services for service providers, service chaining provides a flexible\n   way
    of service provisioning and facilitates their deployment.\n\n   This document
    provides a general abstract architecture for service\n   chaining. It is a flexible
    and scalable architecture which can\n   fulfill requirements of service chaining.
    Some solutions based on\n   this architecture are also discussed with their advantages
    and\n   disadvantages. This architecture can be used as a guideline and also\n
    \  a criterion for the design of service chaining.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document outlines work done and documents produced by the\n   Operational
    Security Capabilities (OPSEC) Working Group.  The goal of\n   the working group
    is to codify knowledge gained through operational\n   experience about feature
    sets that are needed to securely deploy and\n   operate managed network elements
    providing transit services at the\n   data link and IP layers.\n\n   The intent
    is to provide clear, concise documentation of capabilities\n   necessary for operating
    networks securely, to assist network\n   operators in communicating their requirements
    to vendors, and to\n   provide vendors with input that is useful for building
    more secure\n   devices.  The working group produced a list of capabilities\n
    \  appropriate for large Internet Service Provider (ISP) and Enterprise\n   Networks.
    \ This work is intended to refine [RFC3871].\n\n   This document also provides
    guidance for the creation of profile\n   documents which are lists of security
    features needed in specific\n   operating environments.\n\n\t "

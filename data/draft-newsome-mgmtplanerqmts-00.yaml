  script: Latn
  content: "The objective of this draft is to discuss methods for deciding that an\nIP
    network would be improved in some way by the addition of extra\ncapacity, (provided
    by an underlying network). The draft concludes\nthat the only reasonable way of
    doing this is the result of\nco-operation between routers, and that this co-operation
    leads to the\nneed for standardization of this process.\n\n\t "

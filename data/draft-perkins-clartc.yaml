  content: "This memo is informational.  It specifies a clarification of version 2
    of the SNMP SMI, a standard for the Internet community, which is defined by RFCs
    1902[1], 1903[2], and 1904[3]. The clarification is to fix a perceived inconsistency
    in the definition of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION construct.  This problem is resolved
    by replacement text for section 3.5 of RFC 1903.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a conference floor event package for Session
    \n   Initiation Protocol (SIP) conferences that require floor control. The \n
    \  conference floor event package allows users to subscribe to a \n   conference
    floor server URIs. Notifications are sent about changes in \n   the floor state
    of the conference and optionally about changes in the \n   state of additional
    floor components of the conference. Subscriptions \n   and notifications of conference
    floor are supported by an event \n   package within the general SIP event notification
    framework. \n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) improves destination privacy by encrypting
    the Server Name Indication in TLS, but the customer's source identity-- typically
    the IP address and network metadata-- remains observable to intermediaries such
    as CDNs, hosting providers, and recursive resolvers. This document introduces
    the _Customer- Facing Relay (CFR)_, a lightweight, transport-agnostic relay operated
    by access providers to decouple customer identity from encrypted destinations.
    By forwarding opaque encrypted payloads (TCP or UDP) without terminating TLS or
    QUIC, a CFR complements ECH encryption to strengthen source privacy and reduce
    metadata correlation.</p>"

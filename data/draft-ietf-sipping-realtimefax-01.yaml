  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows the establishment of \nreal-time
    Internet fax communications.  Real-time facsimile \ncommunications over IP may
    follow 2 modes of operation: T.38 fax \nrelay as defined by the ITU-T T.38 recommendation
    or fax pass-\nthrough.  \nThis document clarifies the options available to Internet
    telephony \ngateway vendors to handle real-time fax calls using SIP.  While our
    \nprimary focus is to address the more reliable real-time T.38 Group 3 \nfax mode,
    we briefly cover the fax pass-through mode to enable \nfallback operations and
    super G3 fax communications using SIP.  We \nalso give examples of SIP call flows
    for real-time Internet fax \ngateways or SIP proxy redirect servers.  Elements
    in these call \nflows include SIP User Agents, SIP Proxy Servers, and Gateways
    to \nthe PSTN (Public Switch Telephone Network). \nThis document introduces best
    current practices for SIP T.38 fax and \nSIP fax pass-through sessions.  A session
    starts with audio \ncapabilities, and, upon fax tone detection, T.38 fax capabilities
    \nare negotiated; upon successful negotiation, the session continues \nwith fax
    capabilities and the media termination hosts exchange T.38 \nInternet fax packets.
    \ The T.38 fax call scenarios include various \naspects of the call sequence:
    the detection of fax transmission, the \nusage of the T.38 session description
    attributes, the optional \nfallback into fax pass-through mode and the session
    termination. The \nfax pass-through call scenarios involve some specific SDP media
    \nattributes to enable proper fax transmission. \nFax transmission can be detected
    by the receiving side, the emitting \nside or both (in the latter case, a 'glare'
    effect may appear).  \nThis document only covers the case when the fax transmission
    is \ndetected by the receiving side: it is the most common practice and \nthe
    other cases do not represent any particular challenges and are \ntherefore left
    for future discussions).  Call flow diagrams and \nmessage details are shown.
    \ A list of IANA defined SDP attribute \nnames for T.38 is summarized in section
    7. \n\n\n\t "

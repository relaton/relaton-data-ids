  content: "   This document proposes experimentation to evaluate benefits and\n   feasibility
    of an IPv6 routing extension header based architecture,\n   implementation and
    deployment of stateless IPv6 multicast\n   specifically for IPv6 only networks
    using SRv6 for IP unicast.\n\n   This experimentation intends to explore options
    to support easier\n   proliferation of technologies developed by BIER-WG by providing
    an\n   IPv6/SRv6 network optimized packet header and per-hop forwarding\n   mechanisms
    than BIERin6.  It also discusses how this work related to\n   exploring advanced
    in-packet tree encoding mechanisms for both IPv6/\n   SRv6 networks as well as
    BIER networks as a related effort.\n\n\t "

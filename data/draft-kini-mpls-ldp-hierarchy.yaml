  content: "Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is used to advertise mappings of\nForwarding
    Equivalence Classes (FECs) to labels. IP prefix FECs are\nused to setup Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) along routed paths. LDP\nadvertises label mappings for IP
    Prefix FECs that appear as routes in\nthe route table. As the number of FECs in
    the network increases the\nnumber of labels correspondingly increases. During
    certain failure\nconditions a large number of label mappings may have to be generated\nand/or
    installed in the data plane. In this document we describe an\nLDP extension to
    advertise hierarchical label mappings. This helps to\nreduce the number of label
    mappings that are downloaded during\ncertain failure conditions and hence improves
    convergence times.\n\t "

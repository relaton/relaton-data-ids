abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines a new method of client authentication for\n
    \  OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] by extending the approach defined in [RFC7521].\n   This
    new method enables client deployments that are traditionally\n   viewed as public
    clients to be able to authenticate with the\n   authorization server through an
    attestation based authentication\n   scheme.\n\n\t "

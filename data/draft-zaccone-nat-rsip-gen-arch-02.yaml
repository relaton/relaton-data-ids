  content: "Currently, the RSIP framework [RSIP-FRAM] focus its architecture on\nthe
    typical scenario where hosts on a private realm are connected to\nan external
    realm by the mean of an unique gateway where the majority\nof the functionality's
    are concentrated.\nThe aim of this document is to extend ths scope by describing
    a\ngeneric architecture. Furthermore, it tries to identify the\nfunctionality's
    of the system, their purposes as well as the way they\ninterwork.\nThe benefits
    of this extention are an increase of the robustness of\nthe system and an opportunity
    to gain benefit of multiple connection\ntowards one or more (multi-homing) external
    realms (ISPs).\n\n\t "

  content: "Internet infrastructure protocols were designed at the very early \nstages
    of computer networks when 'cyberspace' was still perceived as \na benign environment.
    As a consequence, malicious attacks were not \nconsidered to be a major risk when
    these protocols were designed, \nleaving today's Internet vulnerable. This paper
    provides an analysis \nof OSPF vulnerabilities that could be exploited to modify
    the normal \nrouting process across a single domain together with an assessment\nof
    when internal OSPF mechanisms can or cannot be leveraged to \nbetter secure a
    domain.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a solution for overcoming the limitations \n   of
    existing route reflect mechanism:even there are equal \n   routes,route reflector(RR)
    would use the nexthop router ID to \n   break tie and only reflect the route with
    lower router ID to its \n   clients,so RR clients send all the traffic for the
    destination to \n   only one nexthop which leads to traffic unbalanced in an AS.
    \n   Additive-Routes-Wanted ORF extends ORF to not only filter BGP \n   routes
    but also give RR client the ablility to ask RR for additive \n   BGP routes in
    its BGP database. With the additive routes, RR \n   clients could make inner-AS
    native IP and VPNV4 load sharing \n   easier. \n\n\t "

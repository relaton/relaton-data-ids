  content: "This memo documents our thinking to date regarding the use of version
    \n3 of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol as a mechanism for \nthe autoconfiguration
    of IP routers within an OSPF area. \nSpecifically, a method for the allocation
    and distribution of IPv4 \nand IPv6 subnet addresses without explicit configuration
    is \ndescribed. Such a mechanism would be useful in an environment where \nrouting
    is desirable, but the network administration skills necessary \nto configure IP
    routers are not available. This draft presents zOSPF \n(zeroconfigutaion OSPF),
    a protocol based on OSFPv3 that will allow \nrouters to self configure and forward
    IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. \n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use\n
    \  its packet switched backbone to provide Virtual Private Network\n   services
    for its ISO/CLNS customers. These customers may be islands\n   of ISO/CLNS networks
    which are part of the Service Provider network\n   itself and are interconnected
    by the Service Provider's IP core. This\n   method reuses the 2547 style BGP-MPLS
    VPN model. This document\n   defines an ISO/CLNS VPN address family and describes
    the\n   corresponding ISO/CLNS VPN route distribution mechanism using\n   \"Multiprotocol
    BGP\".\n\t "

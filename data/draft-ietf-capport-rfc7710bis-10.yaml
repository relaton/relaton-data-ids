  script: Latn
  content: "   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access\n
    \  (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n   captive
    portal mode.  This highly restricts what the user can do\n   until the user has
    satisfied the captive portal conditions.\n\n   This document describes a DHCPv4
    and DHCPv6 option and a Router\n   Advertisement (RA) option to inform clients
    that they are behind some\n   sort of captive portal enforcement device, and that
    they will need to\n   satify the Captive Portal conditions to get Internet access.
    \ It is\n   not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may\n
    \  have with captive portals; it is designed to be one component of a\n   standardized
    approach for hosts to interact with such portals.  While\n   this document defines
    how the network operator may convey the captive\n   portal API endpoint to hosts,
    the specific methods of satisfying and\n   interacting with the captive portal
    are out of scope of this\n   document.\n\n   This document replaces [RFC7710].
    \ [RFC7710] used DHCP code point\n   160.  Due to a conflict, this document specifies
    114.  Consequently,\n   this document also updates [RFC3679].\n\n\t "

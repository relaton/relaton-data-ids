  content: "   This is the specification for an experimental show of hands tool for\n
    \  the Meetecho system to be used in online meetings to help chairs\n   quickly
    poll the meeting.  This tool is different from the previous\n   experimental virtual
    hum tool as it addresses a different use case\n   with different functionality.
    \ Following mixed feedback in the IETF\n   108 post-meeting survey, the experimental
    virtual hum tool has been\n   withdrawn from the Meetecho client for IETF 109.\n\n\t "

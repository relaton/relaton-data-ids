abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method called "dry-run DNSSEC" that allows
    for testing DNSSEC deployments without affecting the DNS service in case of DNSSEC
    errors. It accomplishes that by introducing new DS Type Digest Algorithms that
    when used in every record of a DS RRset, referred to as dry-run DS, signal to
    validating resolvers that dry- run DNSSEC is used for the zone. DNSSEC errors
    are then reported with DNS Error Reporting, but any bogus responses to clients
    are withheld. Instead, validating resolvers fallback from dry-run DNSSEC and provide
    the response that would have been answered without the presence of the dry-run
    DS. A further EDNS option is presented for clients to opt-in for dry-run DNSSEC
    errors and allow for end-to-end DNSSEC testing.</p>

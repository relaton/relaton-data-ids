abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-
    of-Possession at the application level (DPoP, RFC 9449) that allows refresh tokens
    to be bound to a different proof-of-possession key than access tokens. In the
    existing specification, a single DPoP proof is used to bind both tokens to the
    same key material. However, in many deployments, refresh tokens and access tokens
    are stored and managed in different security contexts. To support this operational
    separation, this document introduces a new HTTP header field, DPoP- RT, and corresponding
    DPoP-RT-Nonce mechanism, enabling independent proof-of-possession for refresh
    token use while preserving compatibility with existing DPoP-bound access tokens.</p>"

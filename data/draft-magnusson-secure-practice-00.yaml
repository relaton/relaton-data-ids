  content: "IETF members is per tradition a focused group, working with all \n  aspects
    of network interconnectivity and processing. But, as \n  requested by the IETF
    Security Chair at IETF-75, there is an \n  emerging need of a more formal review
    of Information Security \n  issues, in relation to the IETF Standard work.\n\n
    \ During IETF-75, the author noted in several sessions participants\n  voicing
    a somewhat different view on security issues, compared to\n  what I have experienced
    as norm and practice within several End-Users\n  organizations. Some key practices,
    often dependent on rulesets as \n  SOX \"Best Practice\" framework, seemed to
    not be to well-known in \n  those discussions I attended. This document intends
    to, with some\n  simple examples, review and highlight some effects of these gaps
    and \n  questions they arises.\n\t "

  content: "   This specification defines a mechanism to encapsulate layer 4\n   transport
    protocols over UDP. Such encapsulation facilitates\n   deployment of alternate
    transport protocols or transport protocol\n   features on the Internet. DTLS can
    be employed to encrypt the\n   encapsulated transport header in a packet thus
    minimizing the\n   exposure of transport layer information to the network and
    so\n   promoting the end-to-end networking principle. Transport connection\n   identification
    can be disassociated from network location (IP\n   addresses) to provide connection
    persistence for mobility and across\n   state eviction in NAT.\n\n\t "

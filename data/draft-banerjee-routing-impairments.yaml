  content: "In the not too distant future, signals carried between two endpoints \nwill
    be transmitted in an all-optical domain over a multi-hop path. \nSuch transparent
    networks consist of photonic switches, optical \nadd/drop multiplexers, optical
    amplifiers, optical regenerators, and \nfiber.\n\t "

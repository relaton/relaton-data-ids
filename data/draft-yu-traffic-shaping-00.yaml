  script: Latn
  content: "   Starting from the traffic shaping mechanism, one of the core\n   technologies
    of network deterministic assurance, we summarize the\n   characteristics of different
    traffic scheduling and shaping methods\n   and propose a solution design for IPv6
    to carry these traffic\n   scheduling and shaping methods, taking into account
    deterministic and\n   security factors.  At the same time, the network scope of
    practical\n   applications is becoming larger and larger, and the demand for\n
    \  deterministic network services will no longer be restricted to LANs,\n   but
    will require deterministic forwarding beyond LAN boundaries,\n   extending the
    deterministic assurance capability previously provided\n   in LANs to WANs through
    network layer technologies.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 7854, BMP, uses different message types for different purposes.\n
    \  Most of these are Type, Length, Value (TLV) structured.  One message\n   type,
    the Peer Up message, lacks a set of TLVs defined for its use,\n   instead sharing
    a namespace with the Initiation message.  Subsequent\n   experience has shown
    that this namespace sharing was a mistake, as it\n   hampers the extension of
    the protocol.\n\n   This document updates RFC 7854 by creating an independent
    namespace\n   for the Peer Up message.  It also updates RFC 8671 and RFC 9069
    by\n   moving the defined codepoints in the newly introduced registry.  The\n
    \  changes in this document are formal only, compliant implementations\n   of
    RFC 7854, RFC 8671 and RFC 9069 also comply with this\n   specification.\n\n\t "

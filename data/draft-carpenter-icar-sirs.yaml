  content: "     IETF specifications do not receive formal review until\n     they
    are submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant\n     problems with a specification
    often are not detected\n     until considerable effort has been wasted and changes\n
    \    to fix the problems are difficult to add. The procedure\n     described in
    this document is intended to solve, or\n     palliate, a number of related problems
    that have been\n     observed in the IETF process. The basic model is to\n     create
    a team of Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS), and have\n     all documents receive a
    certain number of reviews by\n     SIRs, prior to being submitted for publication.
    Review\n     at a very early stage is strongly encouraged.\n\t "

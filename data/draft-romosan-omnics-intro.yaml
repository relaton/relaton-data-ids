  content: "The transcendence of the user-operator dichotomy through interactive\n
    \  computing greatly empowered the programmers of early time-sharing\n   systems
    and subsequent operating systems.  Earth is examined in the\n   light of history
    as the largest known time-sharing system in\n   operation, and Omnics, a synergistic
    planet operating system, is\n   proposed.\n\t "

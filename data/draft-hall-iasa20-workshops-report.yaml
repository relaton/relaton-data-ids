  content: "   This is the Workshop Report for the IETF Administrative Support\n   Activity
    2.0 (IASA 2.0) Virtual Workshops, held on 28 February 2017\n   at 1100 UT and
    1600 UT.  The original IETF Administrative Support\n   Activity (IASA) was created
    ten years ago, and since has been subject\n   to some reflection.  In the intervening
    years, there has been\n   considerable change in the necessary tasks of IETF administration
    and\n   in the world around the IETF, and in how the IETF raises funds and\n   finances
    its work.  The IASA 2.0 process seeks to address which\n   administrative arrangements
    will best support the IETF going forward.\n\n\t "

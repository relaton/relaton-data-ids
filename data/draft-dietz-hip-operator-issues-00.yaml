  content: "   This document discuss the potential issues that arise when the Host\n
    \  Identity Protocol (HIP) will be introduced in a operator network,\n   especially
    in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) of the 3GPP systems.\n   It discusses mobile
    network specific issues like charging, lawful\n   interception as well as common
    issues like where to associate the HIP\n   ID or privacy issues.  The document
    tries to make the HIP community\n   aware of those issues and wants to stimulate
    discussion on those\n   topics.\n\t "

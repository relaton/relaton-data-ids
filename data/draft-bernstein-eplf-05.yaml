  content: "The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) supports two commands that list files:
    NLST and LIST. The NLST response is easy to parse but provides very little information.
    The LIST response provides more information, but in a format that varies from
    system to system. The most common LIST formats are undocumented and impossible
    to parse reliably.                             This document defines Easily Parsed
    LIST Format (EPLF), a format for the LIST response that is usable by humans yet
    easy for programs to handle. This format is supported by anonftpd, a secure FTP
    server.                 One visible advantage of EPLF is that a browser can easily
    display dates in the viewer's time zone and native language. EPLF also makes it
    straightforward for an indexing program to automatically traverse an FTP area
    and for a mirroring program to avoid downloading the same file twice.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant and disruption-tolerant
    networks, and is an evolution of the architecture originally designed for the
    Interplanetary Internet, a communication system envisioned to provide Internet-like
    services across interplanetary distances in support of deep space exploration.
    \ This document describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems
    with internetworks having operational and performance characteristics that make
    conventional (Internet-like) networking approaches either unworkable or impractical.
    \ We define a message- oriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other)
    layers of the networks it interconnects.  The document presents a motivation for
    the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state management required
    for its operation, and a discussion of application design issues.  This document
    represents the consensus of the IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed
    by that group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) represents a paradigm\n
    \  shift in wireless networks, where sensing and communication functions\n   are
    jointly designed and optimized.  By leveraging the same spectral\n   and hardware
    resources, ISAC enables advanced capabilities such as\n   environment perception,
    object tracking, and situational awareness,\n   while maintaining efficient and
    reliable data transmission.  This\n   integration holds great potential for applications
    in areas such as\n   autonomous systems, smart cities, and industrial automation,
    where\n   precise sensing and low-latency communication are critical.\n\n   This
    document presents a use case related to ISAC, aiming to\n   facilitate discussions
    within the GREEN Working Group on the\n   potential benefits, challenges, and
    requirements.  The use case\n   follows a structured template that we propose
    for all GREEN use\n   cases, ensuring consistency and comparability across different\n
    \  scenarios.\n\n\t "

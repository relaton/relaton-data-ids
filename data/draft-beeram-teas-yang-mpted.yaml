  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model for representing, retrieving,\n
    \  and manipulating Multipath Traffic Engineering Directed Acyclic Graph\n   (MPTED)
    Tunnels and Junctions.  The model includes two YANG modules,\n   one for managing
    MPTED Tunnels on an MPTED tunnel originator node and\n   the other for managing
    MPTED Junctions on an MPTED junction node.\n\n\t "

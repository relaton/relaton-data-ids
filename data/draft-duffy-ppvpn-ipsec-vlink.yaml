  content: "This memo explores some choices that arise when IPsec is to be used \nto
    implement secure 'virtual links' interconnecting customer premises \nVPN devices
    and/or network based virtual routers.  The main focus is \non the network based
    cases. \nRequirements are proposed and some relevant aspects of the IPsec \nprotocol
    suite are discussed.  A number of different protocol \narchitectures for virtual
    links are then evaluated. \nThis memo is informational in nature; it is intended
    that it will \nfocus discussion toward a standard in this area. \n\t "

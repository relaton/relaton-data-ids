  content: "   With the development of DDoS defense technologies, the interfaces and\n
    \  parameters defined by DOTS are no longer sufficient to support the\n   collaborative
    signaling required between DDoS mitigation systems.\n   This document defines
    three YANG model to extend the data models of\n   existing interfaces on the DOTS
    signaling and data channels, with the\n   aim of supporting the transmission of
    necessary collaborative\n   information between DDoS mitigation systems via DOTS
    and enabling\n   efficient collaborative mitigation based on this information.\n\n\t "

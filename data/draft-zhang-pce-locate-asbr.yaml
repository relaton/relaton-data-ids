  content: "   The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering (TE)
    \n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) \n   and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has \n   been identified
    as a key requirement. This document specifies a \n   procedure for an inter-AS
    PCE to locate boundary node within its \n   domain dynamically, which is used
    for path computation. \n\n\t "

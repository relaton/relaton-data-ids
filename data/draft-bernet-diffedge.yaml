  content: "This draft discusses requirements of routers that serve as\n   ingress/egress
    points to/from differentiated services (diff-serv)\n   networks. We discuss the
    traffic conditioning components required\n   and associated configuration mechanisms
    and protocols. We also\n   discuss admission control to diff-serv networks in
    support of\n   signaled QoS.\n\t "

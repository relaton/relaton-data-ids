  content: "In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation \nElements
    (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering \nDatabase (TED). Traditionally
    this TED has been obtained from a link \nstate routing protocol supporting traffic
    engineering extensions. \nThis document discusses possible alternatives and enhancements
    to the \nexisting approach to TED creation. This document gives architectural
    \nalternatives for these enhancements and their potential impacts on \nnetwork
    nodes, routing protocols, and PCEs.\n\t "

  content: "   Low-resource devices in a Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN) can\n   operate
    in a mesh network using the IPv6 over Low-power Personal Area\n   Networks (6LoWPAN)
    and IEEE 802.15.4 link-layer standards.\n   Provisioning these devices in a secure
    manner with keys (often called\n   security bootstrapping) used to encrypt and
    authenticate messages is\n   the subject of Bootstrapping of Remote Secure Key
    Infrastructures\n   (BRSKI) [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].  Enrollment
    over\n   Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030], based on TLS and HTTP, is used for\n
    \  BRSKI.  This document defines how low-resource devices are expected\n   to
    use EST over DTLS and CoAP. 6LoWPAN fragmentation management and\n   minor extensions
    to CoAP are needed to enable EST over DTLS-secured\n   CoAP (EST-coaps).\n\n\t "

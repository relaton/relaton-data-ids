  content: "Devices using zeroconf networking protocols can communicate using IP\nwithout
    requiring user configuration or infrastructure services like\nDHCP and DNS.\nThe
    options available to secure zeroconf networks are canvassed.  A\ncomparison is
    made between bootstrapping IPSec and securing sample\nprotocols from each area
    listed in the zeroconf working group\ncharter.  This shows IPSec to be the most
    promising approach for\nsecuring zeroconf protocols.\n\n\t "

  content: "Several  multicast key management schemes such as those proposed by \nWallner
    et al, Wong et al and  Balenson et al are based on a \nmultilevel, logical hierarchy
    (or tree) of key-encrypting keys. When \nused in conjunction with a reliable multicast
    infrastructure, this \napproach results in a highly efficient key update mechanism
    in which \nthe number of multicast messages transmitted upon a membership update\nis
    proportional to the depth of the tree, which is logarithmic in the \nsize of the
    secure multicast group, provided the tree is maintained in\na balanced manner.
    Therefore the issue of maintaining such trees in a \nbalanced manner is quite
    relevant in practice. This draft which \nis based on the design principles followed
    in an implementation of \nsecure multicast using the Wallner key-management scheme,
    describes \nefficient techniques to maintain a balanced key tree in the presence\nof
    arbitrary group membership updates. This draft also describes \nother optimizations
    which were found to be useful in practice.\n\n\n\n\t "

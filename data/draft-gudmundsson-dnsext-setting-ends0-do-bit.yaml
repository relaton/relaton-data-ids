  script: Latn
  content: "RFC3226 mandated support for EDNS0 in DNS entities claiming to\n   support
    either DNS Security Extensions or IPv6 address records.  This\n   requirement
    was motivated because these new features increase the\n   size of DNS messages.
    \ If EDNS0 is not supported fall back to TCP\n   will happen, having a detrimental
    impact on query latency and DNS\n   server load.\n\n\t "

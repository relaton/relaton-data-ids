  content: "   This paper describes a cooperative communication method of\n   theconverged
    multi-media wireless resource management network.It can\n   maximize the utilization
    of heterogeneous network resources and\n   optimize the access to wireless resources
    of the network in the form\n   of Mesh, which solves the problem of collaborative
    wireless resource\n   management in multi-media converged networks.  Through the
    overall\n   consideration of multi-media converged networks including wired\n
    \  network, wireless network, broadband network, and narrowband network,\n   joint
    access control and resource scheduling for network devices with\n   different
    characteristics in heterogeneous networks are realized.\n\n\t "

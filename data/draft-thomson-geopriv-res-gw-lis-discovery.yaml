  content: "The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral part\nof
    home networking equipment.  Discovering a Location Information\nServer (LIS) is
    a necessary part of acquiring location information\nfor location-based services.
    \ However, discovering a LIS when a\nresidential gateway is present poses a configuration
    challenge,\nrequiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented\nby
    the gateway.\n\nThis document describes a solution to this problem.  The solution\nprovides
    alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery\nprocess based on the network
    addresses assigned to a Device.\n\t "

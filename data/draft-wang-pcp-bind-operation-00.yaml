  content: "   Port Control Protocol[PCP, RFC6887] describes two opcodes between\n
    \  PCP client and PCP server: PCP map opcode and PCP peer opcode. These\n   two
    opcodes are used mainly for the establishment of map table in\n   NAT devices,
    to let the incoming packet pass through the NAT devices,\n   reach to the server
    behind it (map opcode); or build the required\n   map table explicitly in NAT
    devices (peer opcode). These opcodes are\n   enough for the client-server communication
    model in general NAT\n   environment, but for client-client communication model,
    especially\n   that in symmetric NAT environment or in situation that two\n   communication
    hosts are in different address family, there must\n   exists one relay device,
    which act the same as PCP server, to\n   forward the communication data. To control
    the behavior of relay\n   device (similar as PCP server), build the communication
    channel\n   between two ends via it and open its data forward capability to the\n
    \  third-party partner, it is needed to define one new opcode for PCP\n   protocol.\n\n
    \  The PCP BIND opcode will bind two communication channels which are\n   ended
    at PCP server together and make the communication between two\n   hosts behind
    the symmetric NAT environment, or that between two\n   hosts belong to different
    address family possible. Such solution is\n   simpler than the current procedures
    used by TURN.\n\n\t "

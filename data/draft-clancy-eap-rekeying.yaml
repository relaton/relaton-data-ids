  content: "\n   A technique for fast rekeying with EAP is described here. The actual\n
    \  implementation is specific to each EAP method, but in general a\n   master
    session key can be evolved with each client association such\n   that the authentication
    requires as many packets exchanges as a\n   'canned success'. The concept is explained,
    with a specific\n   implementation described for EAP-TLS with 802.11i.\n\t "

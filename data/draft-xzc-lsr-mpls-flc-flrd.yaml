  content: "   Flow-ID Label (FL) is used for MPLS flow identification and flow-\n
    \  based performance measurement with alternate marking method.  The\n   ability
    to process Flow-ID labels is called Flow-ID Label Capability\n   (FLC), and the
    capability of reading the maximum label stack depth\n   and performing FL-based
    performance measurement is called Flow-ID\n   Readable Label Depth (FRLD).  This
    document defines a mechanism to\n   signal the FLC and the FRLD using IGP and
    BGP-LS.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In TSCH mode of 802.15.4, as described by [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal],\n
    \  opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and\n   specific
    channels.  An enhanced beacon must be broadcast periodically\n   by every router
    to keep all nodes in sync.  This document provides a\n   mechanism by which other
    small ICMPv6 packets, such as Router\n   Advertisements may be carried within
    the Enhanced Beacon, providing\n   standard IPv6 router/host protocol.\n\n\t "

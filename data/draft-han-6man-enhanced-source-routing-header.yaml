  content: "   IPv6 Routing header type 3 (termed as RH3) is defined and used in\n
    \  Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) that are typically constrained in\n   resources
    (limited communication data rate, processing power, energy\n   capacity, memory).
    \ Based on the mechanisms introduced by RH3, this\n   document specifies an new
    IPv6 Routing Header type that provides\n   encapsulation capability of segments
    with various lengths and can be\n   applied to more scenarios.\n\n\t "

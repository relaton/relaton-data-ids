  content: "   Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO) is a\n   cryptographic
    technique that provides all of the security services\n   that are used in the
    Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP).\n   This note describes how to use
    AERO in SRTP.  AERO has minimal data\n   expansion, avoids the need to manage
    implicit state, and provides\n   strong misuse resistance.  These properties make
    it an ideal\n   cryptographic transform for SRTP, as it enables SRTP to easily
    handle\n   multiple senders sharing the same key, multiple receivers with late-\n
    \  joiners in a session, decentralized conferences with minimal control,\n   and
    mixers that selectively forward RTP traffic.  RTP architectures\n   that utilize
    AERO can use the normal SSRC collision detection\n   mechanism, and can ignore
    problematic SRTP artifacts such as the\n   Roll-Over Counter (ROC) and Initial
    Sequence Number.\n\n\t "

  content: "Networking applications can request through the ALTO protocol\ninformation
    about the underlying network topology from the ISP or\nContent Provider (henceforth
    referred as Provider) point of view.  In\nother words, information about what
    a Provider prefers in terms of\ntraffic optimization -- and a way to distribute
    it.  The ALTO Service\nprovides information such as preferences of network resources
    with\nthe goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while\nmaintaining
    or improving application performance.\n\nOne of the main use cases of the ALTO
    Service is its integration with\nContent Delivery Networks (CDN).  The purpose
    of this draft is\ntwofold: first, to describe how ALTO can be used in existing
    and new\nCDNs, both within an ISP and in separate organizational entities from\nthe
    ISP; second, to collect requirements for ALTO usage in CDNs and\nto provide recommendations
    into the development of the ALTO protocol\nfor better support of CDNs.\n\t "

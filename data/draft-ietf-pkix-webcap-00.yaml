  content: "This document describes the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure\n
    \  (PKI) Certificate Access Protocols. Protocol messages are defined for\n   all
    relevant aspects of certificate creation and management.  Note\n   that ''certificate''
    in this document refers to an X.509v3\n   Certificate as defined in [COR95, X509-AM].\n
    \n   This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and content-types\n   ancillary
    to HTTP/1.1 to publish, retrieve X.509 certificates and\n   Certificate Revocation
    Lists. This protocol also facilitates\n   determining current status of a digital
    certificate without the use\n   of CRLs.  This protocol defines new methods, request
    and response\n   bodies, error codes to HTTP/1.1 protocol for securely publishing,\n
    \  retrieving, and validation certificates across a firewalls.\n\t "

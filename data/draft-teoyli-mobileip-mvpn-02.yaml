  content: "   This memo specifies enhancements to Mobile IP that allow IP mobility\n
    \  support across routing realms. The protocol allows a mobile node to\n   have
    the same home network connectivity, regardless of its current\n   routing realm
    network point of attachment. It is designed to work in\n   the presence of address
    collisions and network address translations.\n   Private networks connected to
    the public Internet can extend IP\n   mobility support to cover the public Internet
    and other private\n   networks. Movement from a private home network to the public
    foreign\n   network, from a private home network to another private foreign\n
    \  network or from the public home network to a private foreign network\n   are
    possible under the MPN framework.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document focuses on requirements for control-plane based \n   recovery
    from data-plane failures in optical transport networks that \n   use an IP-based
    (GMPLS) control plane. It aims to gather and \n   systematically lay out the requirements
    so that they can serve as a \n   coherent basis for work on solution and protocol
    enhancements and \n   developments. \n\t "

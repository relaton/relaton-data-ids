  content: "   This document defines the did:x509 decentralized identifier method,\n
    \  which enables a direct, resolvable binding between X.509 certificate\n   chains
    and compact issuer identifiers (DID string).  In particular,\n   the did:x509
    identifier format in this documents comes with a CWT\n   Claims definition.  In
    general, this identifier is a compact and\n   interoperable mechanism for certificate-based
    identification by\n   combining a certificate fingerprint with optional policies
    for\n   subject names, subject alternative names, extended key usage, and\n   issuer
    information.  It is especially useful for policy evaluation\n   and reference
    in transparency services and similar systems requiring\n   cryptographic binding
    to certificate material.\n\n   This Informational document is published as an
    Independent Submission\n   to improve interoperability with Microsoft's architecture.
    \ It is not\n   a standard nor a product of the IETF.\n\n\t "

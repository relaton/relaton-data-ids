abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the did:x509 decentralized identifier method,
    which enables a direct, resolvable binding between X.509 certificate chains and
    compact issuer identifiers (DID string). In particular, the did:x509 identifier
    format in this documents comes with a CWT Claims definition. In general, this
    identifier is a compact and interoperable mechanism for certificate-based identification
    by combining a certificate fingerprint with optional policies for subject names,
    subject alternative names, extended key usage, and issuer information. It is especially
    useful for policy evaluation and reference in transparency services and similar
    systems requiring cryptographic binding to certificate material. This Informational
    document is published as an Independent Submission to improve interoperability
    with Microsoft's architecture. It is not a standard nor a product of the IETF.</p>"

  content: "This memo describes the architecture of end to end multihoming.  End\nto
    end multihoming does not burden routing system for multihoming.\nThat is, even
    extensive use of end to end multihoming does not\nincrease the number of entries
    in a global routing table.\nTraditionally with IPv4, multihoming capability is
    offered by an\nintelligent routing system, which, as is always the case with\nviolating
    the end to end principle, lacks scalability on a global\nrouting table size and
    robustness against link failures.\nOn the other hand, with end to end multihoming,
    multihoming is\nsupported by transport (TCP) or application layer (UDP etc.) of
    end\nsystems and does not introduce any problem in the network and works\nas long
    as there is some connectivity between the end systems.\nBecause end to end multihoming
    is performed in end systems, the\narchitecture needs no routing protocol changes
    Instead, APIs and\napplications must be modified to some extent.\n\t "

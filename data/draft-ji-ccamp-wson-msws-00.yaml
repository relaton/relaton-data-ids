  content: "This document proposes a method called Most Sharable Wavelength per \n
    \  Segment (MSWS) to support shared-mesh restoration for wavelength \n   switched
    optical networks (WSON). The proposed method can perform \n   efficient wavelength
    sharing in a distributed fashion. It uses the \n   signaling extensions for WSON
    which is previously proposed in the \n   document \"Signaling Extensions for Wavelength
    Switched Optical \n   Networks\" (draft-bernstein-ccamp-wson-signaling-01) and
    no other \n   protocol extensions of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
    \n   (GMPLS) routing and signaling are needed.\n\t "

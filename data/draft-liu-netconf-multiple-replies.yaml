abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document discusses several scenarios that multiple replies for
    a\n   single request are needed, with the ability to terminate the replies\n   at
    any time.  Such scenarios are not well supported by current\n   NETCONF (Network
    Configuration) protocol.  An extention at the\n   NETCONF messaging layer is needed
    to fulfill the requirement.\n\n\t "

  content: "The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Exchange Format (IDEF) is to\ndefine
    data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information\nof interest to intrusion
    detection and response systems, and to the\nmanagement systems which may need
    to interact with them.  The goals\nand requirements of the IDEF are described
    in [2].\nThis Internet-Draft describes a proposed implementation of the data\nformat
    component of the IDEF, using the Extensible Markup Language\n(XML) [3] to represent
    the class hierarchy defined by Debar and\nHuang [4].  The rationale for choosing
    XML is explained, a Document\nType Definition (DTD) is developed, and examples
    are provided.\n\n\t "

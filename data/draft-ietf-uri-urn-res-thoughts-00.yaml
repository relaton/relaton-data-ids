  content: "The problem of standardizing URN resolution needs to be thought through
    carefully.  If we partition the problem of name resolution, it becomes clearer
    that the user to resolution service interaction should be standardized.  In contrast,
    in order to support a variety of models, behaviors, and other policies for name
    resolution services, we must allow for a multiplicity of such services, each perhaps
    requiring a different protocol between its servers.  The URI group can still limit
    its efforts, but should support more than one such service as a proof of concept
    that multiple service types can be supported.\n\t "

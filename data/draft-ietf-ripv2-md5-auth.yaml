  content: "Growth in the Internet has made us aware of the need for improved authentication
    of routing information.  RIP-II provides for unauthenticated service (as in classical
    RIP), or password authentication.  Both are vulnerable to passive attacks currently
    widespread in the Internet.  Well-understood security issues exist in routing
    protocols [4].  Clear text passwords, currently specified for use with RIP-II,
    are no longer considered sufficient [5].\n\t "

  content: "   The Lightweight Underlay Network Ad hoc Routing (LUNAR) Protocol is\n
    \  intended for use by mobile nodes in small size wireless ad hoc\n   networks.
    LUNAR operates at layer 2.5. It emulates a single-hop IP\n   subnet with unicast
    as well as broadcast communication primitives.\n   DHCP and ARP messages are intercepted
    and serve as hooks for self-\n   configuration of IP addresses as well as the
    mapping of IP addresses\n   to the underlying layer 2.5 multihop routes.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines the Session Initiation  Protocol (SIP) server \neven
    package for SIP server farm using the SIP event framework. The \nSIP server event
    package allows  clients to  subscribe to  the \nservers for server  information
    in the server farm, and  serves \nto communicate information with each other.
    \ Based on this, an \noverall view of the SIP server farm is built and delivered
    \ to the \nentity  (including SIP phone proxy or other SIP servers) which \nsubscribes
    and  receives the event packages. The view would help \nfailover and load balancing
    in the server farm. The event \nnotification mechanism of SIP event framework
    guarantees its \nadaption to the dynamic changes of server state.  We instantiate
    \nthe usage of SIP server event package in three scenarios: client \nbased failover,
    \ DNS based  failover, load  balancer based load \nbalancing.  To be added, we
    introduce some specific usage \nin Peer-to-Peer SIP(P2PSIP) and service discovery
    to expand and \nexplore the potential usage space. Compared with the failover
    and \nload balancing mechanisms in traditional SIP, the new SIP event \npackage
    would apply its explicit and dynamic notification mechanism \nto improve the efficiency
    and service availability of SIP server \nfarm.\n\nThis mechanism using server
    event package can also be a complementary \nway for the  DNS functionality  defined
    in  RFC 3263[RFC 3263] to \nlocate SIP servers.\n\t "

  content: "   Congestion control has been extensively studied for many years.\n   Today,
    the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used in a wide\n   range of networks
    (LAN, WAN, data center, campus network, enterprise\n   network, etc.) as the de
    facto congestion control mechanism. Despite\n   its common usage, TCP operates
    in these networks with little\n   knowledge of the underlying network or traffic
    characteristics. As a\n   result, it is deemed to continuously increase or decrease
    its\n   congestion window size in order to handle changes in the network or\n
    \  traffic conditions. Thus, TCP frequently overshoots or undershoots\n   the
    ideal rate making it a \"Jack of all trades, master of none\"\n   congestion control
    protocol. In light of the emerging popularity of\n   centrally controlled networks
    such as Software-Defined Networks\n   (SDNs), we propose a framework that takes
    advantage of the\n   information available at the central controller to improve
    TCP.\n   Specifically, in this document, we propose OpenTCP as a dynamic and\n
    \  programmable TCP adaptation framework for centrally controlled\n   networks.
    OpenTCP gathers global information about the status of the\n   network and traffic
    conditions through the centralized controller,\n   and uses this information to
    adapt TCP. OpenTCP periodically sends\n   updates to end-hosts which, in turn,
    update their behaviour using a\n   simple kernel module.\n\n   This document describes
    a framework and message flows for centralized\n   congestion control parameter
    adaptation based on congestion control\n   policies and network status measurements,
    so that each end host in a\n   network can make better use of the network resource
    according to the\n   available resources. In the rest of this document we use
    TCP as a\n   standard congestion control mechanism, but the same idea can be\n
    \  applied to other congestion control protocols as well. A TCP\n   Optimization
    Element and a TCP Optimization Agent are introduced. The\n   message patterns
    include request response and\n   subscription/notification. This mechanism can
    be used in network\n   service providers' networks, as well as in data center
    networks.\n\n\n\t "

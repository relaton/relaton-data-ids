  content: "   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and\n   networks.
    \ Security for the protocol can be supplied in a number of\n   ways.  The mandatory-to-implement
    security mode for CoAP makes use of\n   DTLS.  Other applications may want to
    use IPsec.\n\n   This document will discuss considerations for the use of IPsec
    with\n   CoAP.  It will be advanced on a timescale separate from the main CoAP\n
    \  specification, as most experience in securing CoAP so far has been\n   made
    with DTLS.\n\n   The current version of this specification is a placeholder, built
    out\n   of text extracted from draft-ietf-core-coap-12.  It is meant to pick\n
    \  up http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/262 and provide a\n   home
    for its considerations.  It might be merged with other documents\n   later.\n\n\t "

  content: "The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) being specified jointly by IETF\nand
    ITU-T includes requirements documents and framework documents.\nThe framework
    documents define the basic architecture that is needed\nin order to support various
    aspects of the required behavior.  This\ndocument addresses the functionality
    described in the MPLS-TP\nSurvivability Framework document and defines a protocol
    that may be\nused to fulfill the function of the Protection State Coordination
    for\nlinear protection, as described in that document.\n\nThis document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an
    MPLS Transport\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support
    the\ncapabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as\ndefined
    by the ITU-T.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF
    in full conformance with the\nprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.\n\nInternet-Drafts

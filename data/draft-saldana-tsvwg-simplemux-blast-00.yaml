  content: "   Many utilities are nowadays connected via dedicated networks, but the\n
    \  trend toward a fully IP network is gaining more traction in some\n   sectors
    (e.g. electric power).  In some use cases, although it would\n   be desirable
    to avoid the use of IP networks, this may prove\n   unavoidable.  Consequently,
    equipment is linked to extensive\n   communication networks, the performance of
    which cannot be fully\n   controlled or known.\n\n   Some utilities that are not
    connected to a dedicated network may use\n   public wireless networks, which present
    certain degree of variability\n   of some parameters (delay, jitter, packet loss,
    and bandwidth\n   limits).  Considering the importance of receiving packets with
    a low\n   delay, this document presents a solution for using tunnels to send\n
    \  frames or packets between remote facilities, with a certain degree of\n   redundance.
    \ This can be useful in some use cases as e.g. the sending\n   of event-driven
    field commands between eletric substations.  In some\n   cases, these messages
    can be very critical, and their loss or delay\n   can make the difference between
    a blackout and a simple outage.\n\n   Considering the high redundancy of the protocol,
    its use must be\n   restricted to traffic flows which require very low delay to
    control\n   critical equipment.\n\n\t "

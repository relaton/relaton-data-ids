  content: "This document presents a new method to implement the NAT function,\nwhich
    requires the cooperating of the hosts and the NAT gateway. The\nproposed NAT mechanism
    is called Host-initiated NAT, or HI-NAT for\nshort. Traditional NAT function is
    performed in the gateway, while\nthe hosts are not aware of the address translation
    at all. One\ndrawback of such mechanism is that all translation works need to
    be\ndone in one device, the NAT gateway, which may bring performance\nbottleneck.
    The presented HI-NAT mechanism shows another possible\nsolution to improve network
    performance by the cooperating of the\nhosts and the Gateway. In more details,
    the hosts will initiate the\nNAT procedure with its local IP address. After getting
    the translated\nIP address, the hosts will use it in every packet sending out
    to ease\nthe translating workload of the NAT gateway.\n\t "

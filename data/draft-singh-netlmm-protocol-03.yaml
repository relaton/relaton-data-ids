  content: "       This document suggests a localized mobility solution controlled
    \n    by the network within a local mobility domain. The proposed \n    solution
    is based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIP) technique and \n    employs a PMIP client
    that generates a Proxy Binding Update \n    message. The solution allows for a
    clean separation between the \n    bearer and signaling paths, and reuse of MIPv6
    home agent as the \n    local mobility anchor. The security association between
    the \n    network elements for executing the local mobility is also \n    discussed.

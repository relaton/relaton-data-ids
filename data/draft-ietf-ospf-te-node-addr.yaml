  content: "OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions are used to advertise TE Link
    State Advertisements (LSAs) containing information about TE-enabled links. The
    only addresses belonging to a router that are advertised in TE LSAs are the local
    addresses corresponding to TE-enabled links, and the local address corresponding
    to the Router ID.\n\n In order to allow other routers in a network to compute
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE
    LSPs) to a given router's local addresses, those addresses must also be advertised
    by OSPF TE.\n\n This document describes procedures that enhance OSPF TE to advertise
    a router's local addresses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "In some environments, a relay agent resides in a network element\nwhich
    also has access to one or more VPNs.  If one DHCP server wishes\nto offer service
    to DHCP clients on those different VPNs the DHCP\nserver needs to know the VPN
    on which each client resides.  The vpn-\nid sub-option of the relay-agent-information
    option is used by the\nrelay agent to tell the DHCP server the VPN for every DHCP
    request it\npasses on to the DHCP server, and is also used to properly forward\nany
    DHCP reply that the DHCP server sends back to the relay agent.\n\t "

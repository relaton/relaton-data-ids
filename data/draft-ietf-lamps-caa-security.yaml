  script: Latn
  content: "   Cryptographic domain validation procedures leverage authenticated\n
    \  communication channels to ensure resilience against attacks by both\n   on-path
    and off-path network adversaries which attempt to tamper with\n   communications
    between the Certification Authority (CA) and the\n   network resources related
    to the domain contained in the certificate.\n   Domain owners can leverage \"security\"
    Property Tags specified in CAA\n   records (defined in [RFC8659]) with the critical
    flag set, to ensure\n   that CAs perform cryptographically-constrained domain
    validation\n   during their issuance procedure, hence defending against global
    man-\n   in-the-middle adversaries.  This document defines the syntax of the\n
    \  CAA security Property as well as acceptable means for\n   cryptographically-constrained
    domain validation procedures.\n\n\t "

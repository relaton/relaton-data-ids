  content: "This memo defines a protocol for use with relational database systems
    in a TCP/IP based internet environment.  This protocol is intended to make interoperability
    among different database systems possible.  It is built on RPC (Remote Procedure
    Call) with a client/server type of relationship.  This document also defines the
    concept of Unit of Work.  The work of Network Database is involved with Data Conversion,
    Security, I/O           Buffer Management, and Transaction Management.  They will
    be described one by one in this document.\n\t "

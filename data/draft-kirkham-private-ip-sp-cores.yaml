  content: "   The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of the\n   potential
    problems of using private, RFC1918, or non-globally-\n   routable addressing within
    the core of an SP network.  The discussion\n   focuses on link addresses and to
    a small extent loopback addresses.\n   While many of the issues are well recognised
    within the ISP\n   community, there appears to be no document that collectively\n
    \  describes the issues.\n\n\t "

  content: "Recent advances in Internet of Things(IoT) have increased the usage of\nsensing
    technologies. Breakthroughs is microelectronics have increased the\nuse of wearable
    devices to monitor human body functions and its surroundings.\nA typical wearable
    device has low resources in terms of power and processing\ncapabilities. Reducing
    the energy consumption is one of the key design factors\nin a wearable network
    so that the devices may work for longer duration. Idle\nlistening and overhearing
    are major causes of energy consumption. These issues\ncan be resolved by maximizing
    the sleeping time of a device (switched off) and avoid\nunnecessary wakeup time
    (idle listening) to save energy. An external wakeup\nscheduling to handle the
    sleep/wakeup cycle of a device can be adapted.\nThis document describes how a
    2wakeup scheduling using an out-of-bound external\nwake up mechanism can work
    to successfully increase the lifetime of a typical\nbody-centric wearable network
    (S-BCN).\n\n\t "

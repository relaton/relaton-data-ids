  content: "   In a large switched topology with either many routers or routers that\n
    \  transmit a high rate of multicast advertisements per router, as\n   suggested
    to support mobile nodes, the cost of distributing the many\n   resulting multicast
    messages to certain classes of devices might be\n   prohibitive.  This is the
    case of a device that runs on batteries, or\n   a device that is reachable over
    a wireless interface.  For this\n   device, it can be beneficial to filter a certain
    amount of multicast\n   messages such as the Router Advertisement while preserving
    the\n   functionality expected in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol.\n\n\n\t "

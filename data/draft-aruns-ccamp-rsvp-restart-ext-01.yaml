  content: "This document describes extensions to the RSVP Graceful Restart\n   mechanisms
    defined in [RFC3473].  The extensions enable the recovery\n   of RSVP signaling
    state based on the Path message last sent by the\n   node being restarted.  Previously
    defined Graceful Restart\n   mechanisms, also called recovery from nodal faults,
    permit recovery\n   of signaling state from adjacent nodes when the data plane
    has\n   retained the associated forwarding state across a restart.  These\n   mechanisms
    do not fully support signaling state recovery on ingress\n   nodes or recovery
    of all RSVP objects.  The presented extensions use\n   the RSVP Hello extensions
    defined in [RFC3209], and extensions for\n   state recovery on nodal faults defined
    in [RFC3473].  With the\n   presented extensions the restarting node can recover
    all previously\n   transmitted Path state including the ERO and the downstream\n
    \  (outgoing) interface identifiers.  The extensions can also be used to\n   recover
    signaling state after the restart of an ingress node.  The\n   extensions optionally
    support the use of Summary Refresh, defined in\n   [RFC2961], to reduce the number
    of messages exchanged during the\n   Recovery Phase when the restarting node has
    recovered signaling state\n   locally for one or more LSP's.\n\t "

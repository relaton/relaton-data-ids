  content: "   Congestion control is an essential element in ensuring fair bandwidth\n
    \  usage and preventing congestion collapse for traffic sharing the\n   Internet.
    \ For interactive real-time media traffic such as video\n   conferencing, design
    of congestion control solution also needs to\n   account for many other factors
    such as the requirement for low\n   latency packet delivery and interactions with
    live video encoder.\n   This document describes a common framework with the core
    functional\n   building blocks for a real-time media congestion solutions.\n\n\t "

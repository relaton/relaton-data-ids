  content: "   This document describes a framework of Media-independent Pre-\n   Authentication
    (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that\n   addresses the issues on
    existing mobility management protocols and\n   mobility optimization mechanisms
    to support inter-domain handover.\n   MPA is a mobile-assisted, secure handover
    optimization scheme that\n   works over any link-layer and with any mobility management
    protocol\n   and is best applicable to support optimization during inter-domain\n
    \  handover.  MPA's pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive\n   handover
    techniques allow many of the handoff related operations to\n   take place before
    the mobile has moved to the new network.  We\n   describe the details of all the
    associated techniques and its\n   applicability for different scenarios involving
    various mobility\n   protocols during inter-domain handover.\n\n\t "

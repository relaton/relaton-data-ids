  content: "   When published as an RFC, this document provides guidance on the\n
    \  design of methods to avoid congestion collapse and how an endpoint\n   needs
    to react to congestion.  Based on these, and Internet\n   engineering experience,
    the document provides best current practice\n   for the design of new congestion
    control methods in Internet\n   protocols.\n\n   When published, the document
    will update or replace the Best Current\n   Practice in BCP 41, which currently
    includes \"Congestion Control\n   Principles\" provided in RFC2914.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "HTTP was designed to be an extremely lightweight stateless protocol based
    on TCP. However actual implementation experience suggests that the overhead inherent
    in establishing a separate TCP connection for every request represents a significant
    performance problem. This proposal suggests an optional facility for HTTP version
    1.1 which allows a client to create persistent connections with a server. This
    facility is also designed to work with proxy servers.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an optimized method that a service provider\n
    \  can use to provide MVPN service when using PIM as the MVPN control\n   protocol.
    \ As in prior MVPN methods, PIM control messages are sent\n   over multicast tunnels
    through the provider network.  However, unlike\n   older MVPN methods, the tunnels
    are only created if they are needed\n   to carry multicast data traffic; no tunnels
    are used only for control\n   traffic.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes (S-HBS) such as LMS, HSS, XMSS\n
    \  and XMSS^MT combine Merkle trees with One-Time Signatures (OTS) to\n   provide
    signatures that are resistant against attacks using large-\n   scale quantum computers.
    \ Unlike conventional stateless digital\n   signature schemes, S-HBS have a state
    to keep track of which OTS keys\n   have been used, as double-signing with the
    same OTS key allows\n   forgeries.\n\n   This document provides guidance and documents
    security considerations\n   for the operational and technical aspects of deploying
    systems that\n   rely on S-HBS.  Management of the state of the S-HBS, including
    any\n   handling of redundant key material, is a sensitive topic, and we\n   discuss
    some approaches to handle the associated challenges.  We also\n   describe the
    challenges that need to be resolved before certain\n   approaches should be considered.\n\n\t "

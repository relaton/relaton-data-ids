  content: "   The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) is a cryptographically\n
    \  verifiable extension of the LEI standard, designed to automate trust\n   in
    organizational identity.  Governed by the Global Legal Entity\n   Identifier Foundation
    (GLEIF), the vLEI system uses Authentic Chained\n   Data Containers (ACDCs), Self-Addressing
    Identifiers (SAIDs), and Key\n   Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) to issue
    and verify credentials\n   for legal entities and their authorized representatives.
    \ It enables\n   secure, machine-readable identity assertions across financial,\n
    \  regulatory, and supply chain ecosystems, supporting role-based\n   delegation
    and interoperability with decentralized trust frameworks.\n\n   This specification
    defines vLEI for verifiable gateway operator\n   identities and cryptographically
    links the gateway operator identity\n   to the gateway identity.  Thus SATP core
    lock assertions are\n   cryptographically linked to gateway operator identities.\n\n\t "

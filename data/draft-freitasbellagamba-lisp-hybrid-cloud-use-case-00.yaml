abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to document how the Locator/Identifier
    Separation Protocol (LISP) can be used to enable a secure layer 3-based Hybrid
    Cloud, which is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures that
    remain unique entities, but are bound together to enable data and application
    portability. It describes how LISP, in combination with IPsec, can be implemented
    on a virtualized router that is deployed on a public cloud and on the enterprise
    Data Center to enable cloud bursting, workload migration, rapid provision of new
    applications in the cloud and disaster recovery use cases. This draft covers how
    LISP allows virtual machines (VMs) to be moved to the cloud without requiring
    changes to the VMs IP and/or MAC-address.</p>"

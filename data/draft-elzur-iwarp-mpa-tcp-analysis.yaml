  script: Latn
  content: "Further explanation and analysis of architectural recommendations \ncontained
    in the recent Internet-Draft, Marker PDU Aligned Framing \nfor TCP Specification
    [MPA], is provided.  The impact of the \nfollowing three attributes of MPA over
    TCP is examined:  \n*  packing of multiple DDP ULPDUs into one TCP segment;  \n*
    \ simplifying the receiver due to transmitter alignment of DDP \nheaders with
    TCP headers; and  \n*  mistakenly attempting to interoperate an MPA-enabled endpoint
    \nwith a non-MPA-enabled endpoint. \n\n\t "

  content: "Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely deployed\napplication
    protocol for network management and in particular network\nmonitoring.  This document
    describe the applicability of SNMP to\nconstrained devices, e.g., nodes in Low-power
    and Lossy Networks.  We\ndiscuss SNMP implementation techniques and we provide
    deployment\nconsiderations.  Our discussion also covers the applicability of MIB\nmodules
    to constrained devices.\n\t "

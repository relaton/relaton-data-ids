abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document updates the treatment of the special-use domain name\n
    \  \"localhost\" as specified in RFC6761, Section 6.3, with the goal of\n   ensuring
    that it can be safely relied upon as a name for the local\n   host's loopback
    interface.  To that end, stub resolvers are required\n   to resolve localhost
    names to loopback addresses.  Recursive DNS\n   servers are required to return
    \"NXDOMAIN\" when queried for localhost\n   names, making non-conformant stub
    resolvers more likely to fail and\n   produce problem reports that result in updates.\n\n
    \  Together, these requirements would allow applications and\n   specifications
    to join regular users in drawing the common-sense\n   conclusions that \"localhost\"
    means \"localhost\", and doesn't resolve\n   to somewhere else on the network.\n\n\t "

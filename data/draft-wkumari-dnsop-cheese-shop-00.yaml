  content: "   This document cuts down on junk queries to the DNS root and improves\n
    \  performance by answering queries locally from compliant resolvers.\n   It does
    this by actually believing the NSEC responses.\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside square
    brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information, answers to frequently
    asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be removed before publication.]\n\n
    \  [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop.
    \ The most\n   recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be\n
    \  available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]\n\n\t "

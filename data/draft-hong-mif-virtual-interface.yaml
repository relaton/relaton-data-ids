  content: "The usage of multiple interfaces in a host causes other problems due\nto
    the multiplicity of available interfaces.  If interface is changed\nduring communication,
    the communication is disrupted.  Multiple\ninterfaces in a host do not support
    the simultaneous usage of\nmultiple interfaces.  In this document, we discuss
    how to solve the\nproblems of interface change and simultaneous usage of multiple\ninterfaces
    and propose a virtual interface which hides the multiple\ninterfaces from the
    IP stack of host.  And we describe the\napplicability of virtual interface into
    the problem of multiple\ninterfaces in multiple interfaces PS document.  This
    document\nprovides the implementation guidelines of virtual interface for a\nmultiple
    interface host.\n\t "

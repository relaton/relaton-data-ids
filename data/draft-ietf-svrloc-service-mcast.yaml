- language: en

  content: "One feature of the Service Location Protocol is that Services may be assigned
    a Service Specific Multicast address to aid in service discovery.  Use of this
    address for service discovery will not burden systems which do not advertise the
    service type.  Two open questions are answered in the following proposal:  How
    are the multicast addresses to be assigned?  How are these multicast addresses
    known by SLP Service and User Agents?\n\t "

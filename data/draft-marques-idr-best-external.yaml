  content: "The base BGP specifications prevent a BGP speaker from advertising\nany
    route that is not the best route for a BGP destination.  This\ndocument specifies
    a modification of this rule.  Routes are divided\ninto two categories, \"external\"
    and \"internal\".  A specification is\nprovided for choosing a \"best external
    route\" (for a particular value\nof the Network Layer Reachability Information).
    \ A BGP speaker is\nthen allowed to advertise its \"best external route\" to its
    internal\nBGP peers, even if that is not the best route for the destination.\nThe
    document explains why advertising the best external route can\nimprove convergence
    time without causing routing loops.  Additional\nbenefits include reduction of
    inter-domain churn and avoidance of\npermanent route oscillation.  The document
    also generalizes the\nnotions of \"internal\" and \"external\" so that they can
    be applied to\nRoute Reflector Clusters and Autonomous System Confederations.\n\t "

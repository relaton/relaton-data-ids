  content: "   There exist many extensions to Internet addressing, as it is defined\n
    \  in RFC 791 for IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively.  Those\n   extensions
    have been developed to evolve the addressing capabilities\n   beyond the basic
    properties of Internet addressing.  This document\n   outlines those properties
    as a baseline against which the extensions\n   are categorized in terms of methodology
    used to extend the addressing\n   model, together with examples of solutions doing
    so.\n\n   While introducing such extensions, we outline the shortcomings we see\n
    \  with those extensions.  This ultimately leads to consider whether or\n   not
    a more consistent approach to tackling the identified use cases,\n   beyond point-wise
    extensions as done so far, would be beneficial.\n   The benefits are the ones
    detailed in the companion document\n   [I-D.iannone-scenarios-problems-addressing],
    where, leveraging on the\n   shortcomings identified in this memo and scenarios
    provided in\n   [I-D.iannone-scenarios-problems-addressing], a clear problem\n
    \  statement is provided.\n\n\t "

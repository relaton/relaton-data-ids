  content: "   Operators of Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks have been suffering\n
    \  from IPv4 address shortages and are forced to migrate to IPv6.  Many\n   operators
    prefer to build new LTE networks based on IPv6.  However,\n   at present there
    are still a lot of IPv4-only mobile terminals.  A\n   large number of high-quality
    applications are also in the IPv4-only\n   Internet.  There exist needs from IPv4
    users to access IPv4 Internet\n   across an IPv6-only LTE network.  This document
    describes a tunneling\n   mechanism that enables the IPv4 users to connect to
    the IPv4 Internet\n   through an IPv6-only LTE network.  Port-restricted public
    IPv4\n   addresses are assigned to eNodeBs to remove the NAT functionality on\n
    \  the PGW, which helps to offload the processing burden of PGW.  The\n   eNodeB
    is extended to allocate private IPv4 addresses to UEs, as well\n   as the private-
    public IPv4 address translation.\n\n\t "

  content: "   XMPP Jingle specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for\n
    \  managing peer-to-peer media sessions between two users. And XMPP\n   Jingle
    can manage multi contents simultaneously in one Jingle\n   stream, but in the
    XMPP world there is no common way to layout\n   variable multi contents on each
    display. In this document, a\n   solution to this issue is provided by using Web
    browser's layout\n   function.\n\n   This document describes a new concept to
    realize one of solutions\n   of RTCWeb. Of course, \"Web Browser\" is used for
    Web application's\n   frontend for real-time communication, and XMPP Jingle specification\n
    \  (XEP-166) is used as signaling protocol. And a simple mapping\n   manner between
    jingle contents and HTML graphical elements enables\n   to unite Web browser's
    layout function and Jingle's media content\n   management function to realize
    RTCWeb functions.\n\n\n\t "

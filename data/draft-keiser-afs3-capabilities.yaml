  content: "   AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed
    at\n   Carnegie Mellon University during the 1980s.  AFS-3 heavily leverages\n
    \  Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributed\n   architecture.
    \ In 2003, new RPCs were introduced into AFS-3 that\n   provide for capability
    querying between file servers and cache\n   managers.  This memo provides a formal
    specification for that\n   functionality, and provides analogous extensions to
    the volume server\n   RPC interface.\n\nInternet Draft Comments\n\n   Comments
    regarding this draft are solicited.  Please include the\n   AFS-3 protocol standardization
    mailing list\n   (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.\n\nAFS-3
    Document State\n\n   This document is in state \"draft\", as per the document
    state\n   definitions set forth in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-standardisation].\n\n\t "

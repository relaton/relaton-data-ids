  content: "This draft attempts to document various aspects of the IP service\nmodel
    and how it has evolved over time.  In particular, it attempts\nto document the
    properties of the IP layer as they are seen by upper-\nlayer protocols and applications,
    and especially properties which\nwere (and at times still are) incorrectly perceived
    to exist, as well\nas properties that changing would cause problems.\n\t "

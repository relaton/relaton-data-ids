  content: "The Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) defines an extensible
    means of delegating the development and validation of certification paths to a
    server.  It can be used to support the development and validation of certification
    paths well after the expiration of the certificates in the path by specifying
    a time of interest in the past.  The Evidence Record Syntax (ERS) defines structures,
    called evidence records, to support the non-repudiation of the existence of data.
    \ Evidence records can be used to preserve materials that comprise a certification
    path such that trust in the certificates can be established after the expiration
    of the certificates in the path and after the cryptographic algorithms used to
    sign the certificates in the path are no longer secure.  This document describes
    usage of the SCVP WantBack feature to convey evidence records, enabling SCVP responders
    to provide preservation evidence for certificates and certificate revocation lists
    (CRLs). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

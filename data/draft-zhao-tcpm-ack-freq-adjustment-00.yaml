  content: "   TCP Delayed ACK is a widely deployed mechanism that can effectively\n
    \  reduce protocol overhead in many scenarios.  The TARR option has been\n   defined,
    which allows a sender to request a specific ACK frequency\n   from a receiver.
    \ However, there is no clear method for adjusting the\n   ACK frequency during
    data transmission over a TCP connection.  This\n   document provides a method
    for adjusting the ACK frequency by\n   considering the different phases of congestion
    control algorithms.\n\n\t "

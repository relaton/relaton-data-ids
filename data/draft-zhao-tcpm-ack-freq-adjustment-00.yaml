abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP Delayed ACK is a widely deployed mechanism that can effectively
    reduce protocol overhead in many scenarios. The TARR option has been defined,
    which allows a sender to request a specific ACK frequency from a receiver. However,
    there is no clear method for adjusting the ACK frequency during data transmission
    over a TCP connection. This document provides a method for adjusting the ACK frequency
    by considering the different phases of congestion control algorithms.</p>"

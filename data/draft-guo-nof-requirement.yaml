  content: "   NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range\n
    \  of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a\n   storage
    networking fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and\n   InfiniBand.  For IP-based
    network, RDMA or TCP technology can be used\n   to transport NVMe, but the network
    fault detection is weak.\n\n   This document describes the solution requirements
    for fast fault\n   detection to improve reliability.\n\n\n\t "

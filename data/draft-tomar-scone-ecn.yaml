  content: "   This document discusses the need for defining a new on-path signaling\n
    \  mechanism and addresses the question “why can't we use Explicit\n   Congestion
    Notification (ECN)” for the SCONE use-case.\n\n   The SCONE objective is to optimize
    user QoE for streaming media/video\n   services through network assisted application-level
    self-adaptation.\n   This requires a Communication Service Provider’s (CSP’s)
    network\n   device to send streaming media/video traffic profile characteristics\n
    \  (e.g. for allowed average media/video bit-rate, burst rate etc.) with\n   the
    client application endpoint to enable content self adaptation\n   implementations
    by content application providers (CAPs).\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the requirements posed on multi-domain \nQuality
    of Service (QoS) routing protocols that provide multiple \nclasses of service
    with multi-dimensional QoS requirements.  In \nparticular, it discusses enhancements
    to Border Gateway Protocol \nversion 4 (BGPv4) that allow nodes to discover multiple
    paths with \nassociated QoS attributes.  In addition, this documents discusses
    the \ndetails of several new algorithms, such as the dominant path \nselection
    algorithm (DPSA).\n\n\t "

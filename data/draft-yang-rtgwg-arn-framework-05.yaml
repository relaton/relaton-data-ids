  script: Latn
  content: "   With the deployment of increasingly advanced technologies on a large\n
    \  scale, such as SRv6 and network slicing, there is a growing need to\n   expose
    these new capabilities to applications.  The current practice\n   involves using
    ACLs to classify packets and then map the traffic onto\n   appropriate network
    resources.  This approach results in the\n   application being passively perceived
    by the network, rather than the\n   application actively interfacing with the
    network.  Furthermore,\n   changes in application characteristics necessitate
    triggering network\n   configuration adjustments, making it challenging to deploy
    at scale.\n\n   The document proposes a new framework called Application Responsive\n
    \  Network (ARN), by encapsulating more network functions into ARN ID,\n   thus
    it opens up interfaces to applications.  The vision is to enable\n   applications
    to access network resources like they access an\n   operating system.\n\n\t "

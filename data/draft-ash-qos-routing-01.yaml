  content: "Efficient QoS resource management is needed for a host of existing and\never-increasing
    new services. For service performance, flexibility, and\nreduced cost it is preferable
    to provide integration of these services on a\nshared network.  Such integration
    and sharing is facilitated by QoS resource\nmanagement techniques described in
    the draft which are applicable to\nMPLS-based networks.  Such QoS resource management
    techniques are used in\nPSTNs to standardize service classification, bandwidth
    allocation, bandwidth\nprotection, and priority routing treatment for all network
    services.  In the\ndraft we illustrate the principles of QoS resource management
    and describe\ntheir application to MPLS-based networks. In the proposed QoS resource\nmanagement
    method, bandwidth is allocated in discrete changes to each of\nthree virtual networks
    (VNs) corresponding to high-priority key services,\nnormal priority services,
    and best-effort lower priority services.\nBandwidth changes in VN bandwidth capacity
    are determined by edge\nswitch/routers based on an overall aggregated bandwidth
    demand for VN\ncapacity (not on a per-connection demand basis).  Based on the
    aggregated\nbandwidth demand, these edge switch/routers make periodic discrete
    changes\nin bandwidth allocation, that is, either increase or decrease bandwidth
    on\nthe constraint-based routing label switched paths (CRLSPs) constituting the\nVN
    bandwidth capacity. We propose to add optional parameters in the\nconstraint-based
    routing label distribution protocol (CRLDP) for QoS\nresource management.  In
    particular, we propose an optional depth-of-search\n(DoS) type/length/value (TLV)
    parameter in the CRLDP label request message\nto control the bandwidth allocation
    on individual links in a CRLSP.  In\naddition, we propose an optional modify-TLV
    parameter in the CRLDP label\nrequest message to allow modification of the assigned
    traffic parameters\n(such as peak data rate, committed data rate, etc.) of an
    already existing\nCRL\n\t "

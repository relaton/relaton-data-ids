  content: "As noted in Roaming Requirements, there is a need for end-to-end secu-\n
    \    rity in roaming, including end-to-end integrity protection, and confi-\n
    \    dentiality.  In roaming implementations based on proxy chaining, pack-\n
    \    ets are routed between the NAS and home server  through  a  series  of\n
    \    proxies.   Current  roaming  implementations  provide  only hop-by-hop\n
    \    security, guarding only against modification  of  packets  in  transit\n
    \    between  hops.  This makes it possible for untrusted proxies to modify\n
    \    packets sent between a NAS and a home  server  without  detection,  as\n
    \    well  as  to decrypt PAP passwords, Tunnel passwords, and other hidden\n
    \    attributes which are available to it in cleartext.\n \n     This document
    provides a framework for end-to-end security in roaming,\n     making  it  possible
    \ to  provide  end-to-end  message  integrity  and\n     attribute hiding through
    addition of three new attributes.\n\t "

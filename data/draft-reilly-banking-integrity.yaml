  content: "   This document defines the Reilly Banking Integrity Protocol (RBIP),\n
    \  a compliance-grade architecture for generating immutable, auditor-\n   and
    regulator-verifiable evidence trails in banking operations. RBIP\n   combines
    cryptographic anchoring (e.g. blockchain timestamping) with\n   archival DOI issuance
    to produce permanent, tamper-evident records.\n   RBIP addresses three core domains:
    Proof-of-Reserves & Liquidity\n   (PRL), Loan Origination & Collateral Chain (LOC),
    and KYC/AML\n   Evidence Ledger (KAL).\n\n   RBIP is intended to help financial
    institutions satisfy requirements\n   from Basel III/IV, SOX, BSA/AML, ISO/IEC
    42001:2023, and other\n   relevant regulations while preserving privacy, accountability,
    and\n   auditability.\n\n\t "

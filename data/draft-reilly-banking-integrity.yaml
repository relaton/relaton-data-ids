abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Reilly Banking Integrity Protocol (RBIP),
    a compliance-grade architecture for generating immutable, auditor- and regulator-verifiable
    evidence trails in banking operations. RBIP combines cryptographic anchoring (e.g.
    blockchain timestamping) with archival DOI issuance to produce permanent, tamper-evident
    records. RBIP addresses three core domains: Proof-of-Reserves &amp; Liquidity
    (PRL), Loan Origination &amp; Collateral Chain (LOC), and KYC/AML Evidence Ledger
    (KAL). RBIP is intended to help financial institutions satisfy requirements from
    Basel III/IV, SOX, BSA/AML, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, and other relevant regulations
    while preserving privacy, accountability, and auditability.</p>"

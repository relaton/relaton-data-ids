  content: "   DNS over TLS (DoT) has been gaining attention, primarily as a means\n
    \  of communication between stub resolvers and recursive resolvers.\n   There
    have also been discussions and experiments involving the use of\n   DoT to communicate
    with authoritative nameservers (Authoritative DNS\n   over TLS or \"ADoT\"), including
    communication between recursive and\n   authoritative resolvers.  However, we
    have identified a number of\n   operational concerns with ADoT.  These operational
    concerns need to\n   be addressed prior to ADoT's deployment at scale by DNS operators
    in\n   order to maintain the stability and resilience of the global DNS.\n   The
    document also provides some suggested next steps to advance the\n   operator community's
    understanding of ADoT's operational impact.\n\n\t "

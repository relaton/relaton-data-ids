  content: "   Some RFC need to include some code or some kind of data like test\n
    \  vectors.  Extracting the code or the data from the RFC \"by hand\" is\n   possible,
    but tiresome and prone to errors, especially if the portion\n   to be extracted
    is long or comprises many files.  This document\n   describes a format that can
    be used to embed code or data in an RFC,\n   so that it can be extract by a software,
    while preserving the\n   readibility of the embedded text.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) allows one Label Switching\n
    \  Router (LSR) to advertise to another a set of \"bindings\" between\n   MPLS
    labels and \"Forwarding Equivalence Classes\" (FECs).  Suppose\n   LSR2 is advertising
    a set of label bindings to LSR1.  Frequently,\n   LSR1 does not need to know all
    of LSR2's label bindings, and LSR1\n   may be configured to disregard bindings
    in which it has no interest.\n   This document defines an \"Outbound Label Bindings
    Filtering\" (OLF)\n   mechanism that allows LSR1 to inform LSR2 dynamically of
    the set of\n   FECs for which it needs to receive label bindings.  LSR2 then\n
    \  applies this filter before sending its label bindings to LSR1. In\n   addition
    to the generic aspects of this mechanism, this document\n   also specifies the
    format for the outbound label binding filter for\n   the \"Address Prefix FEC\"
    type.\n\n\t "

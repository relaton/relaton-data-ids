  content: "   DKIM is a framework for signed messages, especially for email.  While\n
    \  in transit, changes are sometimes made, and these break the DKIM-\n   Signature.
    \ This specification makes DKIM more lenient, without\n   changes to its core.
    \ It adds leniency towards MIME body rewrites,\n   removal of alternatives and
    annotation with bits of text.  The\n   intention is to allow these changes such
    that they can be clearly\n   shown to the user, while indicating that the remainder
    of the\n   signedmessage is still in tact.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a symmetric key provisioning protocol that\n
    \  supports provisioning of symmetric keys (One Time Password (OTP) keys\n   or
    symmetric cryptographic keys) and associated attributes\n   dynamically to already
    issued different types of strong\n   authentication devices.\n\n   This work is
    a joint effort by the members of OATH (Initiative for\n   Open AuTHentication)
    to specify a protocol that can be freely\n   distributed to the technical community.
    \ The authors believe that a\n   common and shared specification will facilitate
    adoption of two-\n   factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability\n
    \  between commercial and open-source implementations.\n\t "

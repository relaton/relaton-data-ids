  content: "   This memo describes the dynamic allocation of shared IPv4 addresses\n
    \  to clients using the DHCPv4 protocol.  Address sharing allows a\n   single
    IPv4 address to be allocated to multiple, active clients\n   simultaneously, each
    client being differentiated by a unique set of\n   L4 source ports.  The changes
    necessary to existing DHCPv4 client and\n   server behaviour are described and
    a new DHCPv4 option for\n   provisioning clients with shared IPv4 addresses is
    included.\n\n   Due to the nature of sharing IP addresses, there are necessarily
    some\n   limitations to the applicability.  This memo describes those\n   limitations
    and recommends suitable architectures and technologies\n   where address sharing
    may be utilized.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an emulation architecture which provides a\n
    \  realistic, flexible, and extensible experimental environment for the\n   space
    network (SN).  The architecture includes four components,\n   namely logical plane,
    control plane, data plane and measurement\n   plane.  Software-defined networking
    (SDN), virtualization technology,\n   and traffic control mechanism are adopted
    to realize the real space\n   environment and arbitrary topology.  Furthermore,
    an extensible\n   structure is described to emulate large-scale scenarios and
    access\n   external emulation resources.\n\n\t "

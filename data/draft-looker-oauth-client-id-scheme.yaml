  content: "   This specification defines a new extensibility point to OAuth 2.0\n
    \  which allows clients to identify through different methods to an\n   authorization
    server using an identifier not assigned or managed by\n   the authorization server.
    \ Beyond this general extensibility point,\n   the specification defines one client
    ID scheme\n   \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-id-scheme:oauth-discoverable-client\",\n
    \  including the nessary rules around how the client makes its metadata\n   available
    for an authorization server and how an authorization server\n   can obtain this
    metadata without the need for a registration process.\n\n\t "

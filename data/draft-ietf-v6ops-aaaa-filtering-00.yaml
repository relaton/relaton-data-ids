  content: "   Since IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are represented by different resource\n
    \  records in the Domain Name System, operating systems capable of\n   running
    both IPv4 and IPv6 need to execute two queries when resolving\n   a host name.
    \ This document discusses the conditions under which a\n   stub resolver can optimize
    the process by not sending one of the\n   queries if the host is connected to
    a single-stack network.\n\n\t "

  content: "Simple Internet Signalling Protocol (SISP) performs one function: signalling
    of realtime data streams over IP networks. SISP has several distinguishing features:
    it is a tiny extension of RTCP, running over UDP or TCP, it can integrate very
    well with PSTN signalling, and it can run in very low bandwidth situations without
    disturbing the real time stream. It is completely scalable with respect to number
    of participants and also with respect to 'tightness' of control, and can work
    with an extremely wide variety of conference models, policies, and standards.
    \ SISP differs from other conferencing protocols in that it performs a single
    essential task completely. It is argued that other protocols solve only parts
    of several overlapping problems.  SISP can serve as the lowest common denominator
    for signalling of real-time streams.    The requirements that SISP fulfills, the
    features it offers, the fact that it uses RTCP as an encapsulation scheme, and
    its generally minimalist approach of solving one problem only are more important
    than the actual state machine it implements or particular format of its messages.\n\t "

  content: "   Efficient energy utilization and prolonged lifetime are two most \n
    \  covetable targets for sensor network. For increased lifetime,each\n   node
    must conserve energy as much as possible.  In this paper we \n   propose a protocol
    in which energy is conserved by amortizing the \n   energy cost of superfluous
    packets and idle state energy consumption\n   To achieve our goal we have exercised
    well-known periodic sleep \n   protocol and reduce redundant transmission by creating
    broadcast \n   tree based on residual energy and distance based communication
    cost. \n   Wasteful energy consumption of sensor nodes (e.g. idle listening, \n
    \  retransmission due to packet collision, overhearing etc) can be \n   minimized
    by selecting minimum number of forwarding nodes. Our \n   proposed algorithm selects
    minimum number of forwarding while \n   creating broadcast tree. All intermediate
    nodes acts as forwarding \n   node (non-leaf) while all the other nodes acts as
    a non-forwarding \n   (child)  reduces wasteful energy consumption by keeping
    radio \n   transceiver off. Simulation shows our algorithm is better in terms\n
    \  Dense Sensor Network Based on Residual Energy and Distance\n   of energy conservation
    and network lifetime\n\t "

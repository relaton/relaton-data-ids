  content: "This document describes a new feature for L2TP: it allows for a change\nof
    LACs during the lifetime of a PPP session without the latency of\nre-creating
    a new PPP session where possible. This feature is\nspecially useful for wireless
    data services where the foreign wireless\nservice provider (WSP) may be different
    than the user's home service\nprovider and where a user's mobility may result
    in a change of LAC\nduring an on-going PPP session. This proposal presents 3 different\nmethods
    of supporting this feature. The simplest method requires only\nminor changes to
    both LACs and LNSs. However, it may give a larger\nhandover latency. The other
    two methods have shorter handover\nlatency and allow us to extend the L2TP session
    by an additional hop.\n\t "

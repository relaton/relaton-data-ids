- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   For certain types or models of devices it should be clear and obvious\n
    \  that, by default, they should not be reachable from the global IPv6\n   Internet,
    or able to reach the global IPv6 Internet, even though the\n   network they are
    attached to provides global IPv6 Internet\n   connectivity.  This memo proposes
    that these types of devices refuse\n   to configure and use global IPv6 Internet
    addresses by default.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In AI training scenarios, the current mainstream load balancing\n   technology
    is per-flow ECMP. However, hash collision issues lead to\n   imbalanced traffic
    distribution, adversely affecting application\n   performance.\n\n   To address
    this problem, this document proposes an enhanced ECMP\n   method that resolves
    load imbalance caused by hash collisions. The\n   proposed solution effectively
    improves load balancing efficiency,\n   reduces network congestion, and enhances
    overall network\n   performance.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the efficient mechanism to set up and maintain
    the   LSP for the economy class services (called ES-LSP: Economy class Services
    LSP). The mechanism is to reduce the overload of MPLS networks and to continue
    the economy class services when the ES-LSP is failed.\n\nThere are two parts to
    fulfill this mechanism. Firstly, it is to   minimize the information to establish
    and to keep the ES-LSP. Secondly, in this mechanism, the nodes adjacent to the
    failure point may switch over the data packet to IP forwarding instead of MPLS
    label swapping. On the other hand, the adjacent nodes switch over the data packets
    to the label swapping of MPLS at the restoration of the failure. However, in general,
    the ES-LSP session is withdrawn, the ES-LSP itself is reestablished into the different
    route or the ES is discontinued by the ES-LSP failure[1]. Thus, for the service
    continuity of the failed ES-LSP, this mechanism uses the hybrid data forwarding
    of MPLS label swapping and IP forwarding.\n\t "

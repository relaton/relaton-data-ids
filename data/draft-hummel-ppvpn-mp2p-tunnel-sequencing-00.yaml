- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In order to provide any-CE-to-any-CE connectivity it is proposed to\ndeploy
    an O(n)-sized set of base tunnels which  form a reasonable\npartial mesh (e.g.
    chessboard topology), and  to use them and re-use\nthem many times as elements
    of concatenated hierarchical multipoint-\nto-point  tunnel sequence LSPs. The
    number of saved tunnels is of\norder n-square. Multiple,differently routed  tunnel
    sequence LSPs but\nrooted at the same node may cater for features like traffic\nbalancing,
    path protection, QoS-routing, etc.,  without needing any\nextra tunnel. It is
    outlined how to establish such an optimal VPN\ninter-site tunneling.\n\t "

  content: "   Data Centers may be spread across different locations for a\n   particular
    enterprise. Different locations may mean within the same\n   country but across
    different geographical locations, or outside the\n   country even in a different
    continent. These data centers may be\n   serving the enterprise or multiple enterprises
    / tenants wherein the\n   regular enterprise site may request data from a data
    center site\n   which could be one of the data center sites proximal to the\n
    \  enterprise site. Proximity is usually calculated based on a metric\n   that
    is bandwidth driven or in terms with regard to the number of\n   hops to reach
    that data center site hence bringing into play delay\n   characteristics. Assume
    a topology where the data center sites and\n   the enterprise sites are MPLS based
    L3VPN sites that are being\n   provided connectivity through a Service Provider
    deploying Layer 3\n   VPNs. Given such a topology it is possible that replication
    of data\n   happens across the data centers in a timely manner to keep the data\n
    \  active and refreshed across all data center sites. Suitable\n   mechanisms
    for such replication will come into play for this purpose.\n   Thus any of the
    data centers can cater to the request from a user\n   site.\n\n   It is possible
    that power consumption in each data center may vary\n   according to the load
    on each data center. It would be prudent to\n   introduce a scheme where the power
    metric coupled with other metrics\n   such as bandwidth and delay be used by a
    Provider Edge router in a\n   L3VPN scenario to direct the packets or requests
    from regular user\n   sites to such data centers with the least such metric. This
    is in\n   line with the follow-the-moon strategy of directing requests for data\n
    \  and compute to data centers which are power-wise more efficient\n   during
    the night or during the day. This draft document lays out one\n   such proposal.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo presents a schema for NETCONF RPC and protocol operations\nexpressed
    in RELAX NG (compact syntax).  The schema is modular and\ncleanly separates the
    server and client part of the NETCONF\nvocabulary and also the schema extensions
    provided by optional\ncapabilities.  The modular structure improves readability
    but also\nenables selecting certain modules and assembling them into a grammar\nthat
    can be used for validation of NETCONF protocol data units.\n\t "

  content: "   Pairing-based cryptography, a variant of elliptic curve cryptography,\n
    \  has received attention for its flexible and applicable functionality.\n   Pairing
    is a special map defined over elliptic curves and it can be\n   applied to construct
    several cryptographic protocols such as\n   identity-based encryption, attribute-based
    encryption, and so on.  At\n   CRYPTO 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed an efficient
    number field\n   sieve algorithm named exTNFS for the discrete logarithm problem
    in a\n   finite field.  Several types of pairing-friendly curves such as\n   Barreto-Naehrig
    curves are affected by the attack.  In particular, a\n   Barreto-Naehrig curve
    with a 254-bit characteristic was adopted by a\n   lot of cryptographic libraries
    as a parameter of 128-bit security,\n   however, it ensures no more than a 100-bit
    security level due to the\n   effect of the attack.  In this memo, we summarize
    the adoption status\n   of pairing-friendly curves in standards, libraries and
    applications,\n   and classify them in 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit security
    levels.\n   Then, from the viewpoints of \"security\" and \"widely use\", we select\n
    \  the recommended pairing-friendly curves considering exTNFS.\n\n\t "

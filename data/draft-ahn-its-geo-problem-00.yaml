  content: "   For the support of IPv6-based ITS applications, ITS data packets are\n
    \  required to be delivered based on the geographical location\n   (longitude
    and latitude) information of the destination ITS node\n   or area. Therefore,
    geographical forwarding mechanisms are preferred\n   in the ITS environment. In
    this draft, we define the issues\n   to be considered in delivering IPv6 ITS data
    based on geographical\n   location.\n\n\n\t "

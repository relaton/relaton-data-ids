- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport
    that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.  Because congestion control
    is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and upper-layer
    protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms
    to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent
    traffic.  This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers
    of unicast applications and upper-layer protocols.  Congestion control guidelines
    are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics,
    including message sizes, reliability, checksums, and middlebox traversal.  This
    document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

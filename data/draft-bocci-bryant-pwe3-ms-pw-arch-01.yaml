- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes an architecture for extending pseudo wire \n
    \  emulation across multiple packet switched network segments. Scenarios \n   are
    discussed where each segment of a given edge-to-edge emulated \n   service spans
    a different provider's PSN, and where the emulated \n   service originates and
    terminates on the same providers PSN, but may \n   pass through several PSN tunnel
    segments in that PSN. It presents an \n   architectural framework for such multi-segment
    pseudo wires, defines \n   terminology, and specifies the various protocol elements
    and their \n   functions.  \n\t "

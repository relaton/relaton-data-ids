  content: "   In Web PKI, certificate path construction and validation are crucial\n
    \  security review processes.  At present, there are many Internet\n   browser
    manufacturers around the world.  With the change of security\n   practices and
    the development of technology, the certificate\n   validation process in Internet
    browser industry is relatively messy,\n   including various private implementations
    of manufacturers.  It is a\n   typical patching improvement method, and the implementation
    of\n   process functions is relatively arbitrary.  This document provides a\n
    \  technical guide for certification path validation of web server\n   certificates
    during Internet SSL/TLS protocol communication for Web\n   PKI, including the
    basic path verification process, as well as\n   reference procedures, guidance
    and suggestions for input,\n   initialization, and basic certificate processing
    in the verification\n   process.  This document is applicable to the development
    and\n   application of Internet browsers, as well as other similar digital\n   certificate
    authentication systems requiring SSL/TLS security\n   protocol secure communication.\n\n\t "

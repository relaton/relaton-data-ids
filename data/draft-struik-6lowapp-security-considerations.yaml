  content: "We discuss security architectural design considerations for\n     general-purpose
    multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The security\n     architecture fits extremely constrained
    wireless environments,\n     such as sensor networks, while remaining uniform
    and general\n     enough to fit any wireless network. The design is tailored towards\n
    \    low overall implementation cost, supports semi-automatic lifecycle\n     management,
    including ease of installation and configuration,\n     scalability, survivability,
    mobility, and is adaptable towards\n     network topology changes and towards
    different trust models\n     underlying network operations.\n\n\t "

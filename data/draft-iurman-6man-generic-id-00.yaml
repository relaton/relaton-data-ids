  content: "   Some recent use cases seem to have a need for carrying IDs within\n
    \  packets.  Two examples are _I-D.draft-ietf-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id_\n   and
    _I-D.draft-li-6man-topology-id_. While they might perfectly make\n   sense on
    their own, each document requires IANA to allocate a new\n   code point for a
    new option, which could quickly exhaust the\n   allocation space if similar designs
    are proposed in the future.  As\n   an example, one might need an 8-bit ID, while
    another one might need\n   a 24-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit ID.  Or, even worse, one
    might need a\n   32-bit ID in a specific context, while someone else might also
    need a\n   32-bit ID in another context.  Therefore, allocating a new code point\n
    \  for each similar option is probably not the way to go.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies a new version of the Transport Layer Security\n
    \  (TLS) protocol, version 1.4.  It is designed to address key\n   challenges
    that have emerged since the standardization of TLS 1.3,\n   specifically related
    to the mobility of devices, the need for\n   enhanced 0-RTT security, the integration
    of post-quantum\n   cryptography, and the refinement of downgrade protection mechanisms.\n\n
    \  TLS 1.4 introduces a fundamental architectural shift by decoupling\n   the
    cryptographic session state from the underlying transport-layer\n   connection.
    \ This is achieved through a new, transport-agnostic\n   Connection ID (CID).
    \ The protocol also provides a new,\n   cryptographically-enforced replay defense
    for 0-RTT handshakes based\n   on an atomic \"read-compare-write\" operation on
    a single-use Session\n   Nonce.  A native hybrid post-quantum key exchange framework
    is\n   integrated into the handshake, offering a robust \"safety net\" against\n
    \  future cryptanalytic threats.  This specification formally obsoletes\n   TLS
    1.3 (RFC 8446) and all its related mechanisms.\n\n   This document updates RFCs
    5705, 6066, 7627, and 8422 and obsoletes\n   RFCs 5077, 5246, 6961, 8422, and
    8446.  This document also specifies\n   new requirements for TLS 1.2 implementations.\n\n\t "

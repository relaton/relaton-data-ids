  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949 == STD 94)\n
    \  is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of\n   extremely
    small code size, fairly small message size, and\n   extensibility without the
    need for version negotiation.\n\n   CBOR does not provide any forms of data compression.
    \ CBOR data\n   items, in particular when generated from legacy data models, often\n
    \  allow considerable gains in compactness when applying data\n   compression.
    \ While traditional data compression techniques such as\n   DEFLATE (RFC 1951)
    can work well for CBOR encoded data items, their\n   disadvantage is that the
    receiver needs to decompress the compressed\n   form to make use of the data.\n\n
    \  This specification describes Packed CBOR, a simple transformation of\n   a
    CBOR data item into another CBOR data item that is almost as easy\n   to consume
    as the original CBOR data item.  A separate decompression\n   step is therefore
    often not required at the receiver.\n\n\n   // The present version (-09) provides
    two table setup tags (common,\n   // split setup) and discusses behavior in case
    of references to\n   // unpopulated table entries during unpacking.\n\n\t "

  content: "Service chains specifying the ordered sequences of network functions according
    to network policies requested, play a very important role in improving network
    performance in most networks. With the introduction of Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, service chains can
    be immediately deployed in more effective ways. Since different customers or operators
    would request multiple service chains in the same network but different administrative
    domains, and the multiple service chains may apply to the same network connection,
    we propose a service chain aggregation architecture that has ability to effectively
    aggregate them before the deployment. In this architecture, we determine the aggregating
    order of service chains according to different conditions verifying the aggregation
    effectiveness. The benefits of our architecture are 1) security, 2) network resource
    (e.g., flow entries in switches) savings and 3) scalability.\n\n\t "

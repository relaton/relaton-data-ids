  content: "   Link state routing protocols have hierarchical abstraction already\n
    \  built into them.  However, when lower levels are used for transit,\n   they
    must expose their internal topologies, leading to scale issues.\n\n   To avoid
    this, this document discusses extensions to the IS-IS\n   routing protocol that
    would allow level 1 areas to provide transit,\n   yet only inject an abstraction
    of the topology into level 2.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a general\n   authentication
    protocol that supports multiple authentication methods\n   and typically runs
    directly over data link layers without requiring\n\n   IP.  EAP can be used for
    different types of authentication, where\n   multiple providers provide different
    services.  However, EAP itself\n   does not have the ability to differentiate
    between multiple EAP\n   conversations between a peer and an authenticator.  This
    document\n   specifies the 3GPP2 Generic EAP Encapsulation (GEE) protocol for\n
    \  differentiating between multiple EAP conversations between a peer and\n   an
    authenticator.\n\n\t "

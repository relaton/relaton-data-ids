  content: "   [draft-liu-spring-sr-energy-consumption-00] describes the types of\n
    \  energy consumption information, how to collect energy consumption\n   information,
    and the framework for path selection based on energy\n   consumption information.
    This document further details the process\n   of using the PCEP protocol for energy
    consumption based path\n   requests.\n\n   The Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) provides\n   mechanisms that enable Path Computation Elements
    (PCEs) to perform\n   path computations in response to requests from Path Computation\n
    \  Clients (PCCs).\n\n   This document describes the extension to PCEP for conveying
    link\n   energy consumption and node energy consumption, allowing path\n   computation
    based on these energy consumption information.\n\n\t "

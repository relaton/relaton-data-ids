  content: "   This document describes IPv6 neighbor cache update methods from\n   external
    nodes. In current communication environments, using status\n   of IP addresses
    is frequently changed by several operations, such\n   as disconnecting / connecting
    nodes to networks at mobile\n   environments, suspending / hibernating / resuming
    nodes, and\n   consuming large number of IP addresses dynamically when ephemeral\n
    \  address [Ephemeral] function is enabled.\n\n   When using status of an IP address
    is changed from \"Used\" to \"Not\n   Used\", its related used resources such
    as neighbor cache entry\n   should be deleted cooperatively from security enhancement
    viewpoint\n   and efficient resource management viewpoint.\n\n   [RFC4861] defines
    neighbor discovery methods and describes how to\n   manage neighbor cache entries
    by neighbor discovery messages.\n   However, [RFC4861] does not define quick and
    clear neighbor cache\n   update (delete) functions.\n\n   In order to meet above
    request, this document proposes two types of\n   IPv6 neighbor cache update (delete)
    methods from external nodes.\n   One is a heuristic type method that does NOT
    require neighbor\n   discovery message extensions. The other is an explicit type
    method\n   that requires small neighbor discovery message extensions.\n\t "

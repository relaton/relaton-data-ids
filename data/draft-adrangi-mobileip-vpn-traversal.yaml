  content: "Multi-subnetted IEEE 802.11 WLAN networks are being widely \ndeployed
    in Enterprise Intranets –(in many cases requiring a \nVPN tunnel to connect back
    and access Intranet resources), and \npublic areas such as airports, coffee shops,
    convention centers \nand shopping malls. Many of these WLAN networks also employ
    NAT \nto translate between non-routable and routable IPv4 care-of \n(point of
    attachment) addresses. WWAN networks such as those \nbased on GPRS, 1xRTT and
    eventually EDGE, 1xEV, CDMA2000 and \nUMTS are also starting to see deployment.
    These deployments are \npaving the way for applications and usage scenarios requiring
    \nTCP/IP session persistence and constant reachability while \nconnecting back
    to a secured (VPN protected), target “home” \nnetwork. This in turn drives the
    need for a mobile VPN solution \nthat is multi-vendor interoperable, providing
    seamless access \nwith persistent VPN sessions - through NAT gateways when \nneeded.
    This draft proposes a solution framework that enables \nefficient, seamless operation
    of Mobile IPv4 when combined with \nan IPsec-based VPN and supporting NAT traversal
    when needed. \nThe solution has no link layer dependencies and can be applied
    \nto other 802.3-compatible wired and wireless physical media as \nwell.   \n

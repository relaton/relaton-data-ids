  content: "In this document we focus on RSVP-based resource reservations in a heterogeneous
    environment which includes ATM networks.  We describe a method for establishing
    'shortcuts' through an ATM network which avoids the performance penalty associated
    with level 3 processing in a 'classical RSVP over ATM' approach.  For the case
    of guaranteed service we show how to map the RSVP flow characteristics to ATM
    call parameters, and thus enable end-to-end performance guarantees.  We also discuss
    the extensions to RSVP and to ATM signaling required for the implementation of
    these solutions.\n\t "

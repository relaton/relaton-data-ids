  content: "   It has often been the case that manageability considerations have\n
    \  been retrofitted to protocols. This is sub-optimal.\n\n   Similarly, new protocols
    or protocol extensions are frequently\n   designed without due consideration of
    manageability requirements.\n\n   This document specifies the requirement for
    all new Routing Area\n   Internet-Drafts to include an \"Manageability Considerations\"
    section,\n   and gives guidance on what that section should contain.\n\t "

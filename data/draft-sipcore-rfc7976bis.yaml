  script: Latn
  content: "   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases\n
    \  where different SIP private header extensions referred to as \"P-\"\n   header
    fields, and defined in RFC 7315, need to be included in SIP\n   requests and responses
    currently not allowed according to RFC 7315.\n   This document updates RFC 7315,
    in order to allow inclusion of the\n   affected \"P-\" header fields in such requests
    and responses.\n\n   This document also makes updates for RFC 7315 in order to
    fix\n   misalignments that occurred when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted\n
    \  by RFC 7315.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Multipart/Report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type
    is a general \"family\" or \"container\" type for electronic mail reports of any
    kind.  Although this memo defines only the use of the Multipart/Report content-type
    with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs will benefit
    if a single content-type is used to for all kinds of reports.  This document is
    part of a four document set describing the delivery status report service.  This
    collection includes the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) extensions to request
    delivery status reports, a MIME content for the reporting of delivery reports,
    an enumeration of extended status codes, and a multipart container for the delivery
    report, the original message, and a human-friendly summary of the failure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

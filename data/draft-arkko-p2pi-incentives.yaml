  content: "Several papers in the May 2008 P2PI workshop have argued that there\nis
    a need to build new protocol mechanisms to accommodate peer-to-\npeer traffic
    in networks in the most efficient way and with minimal\nimpact to other traffic.
    \ This paper presents an analysis of such\nsolutions from the point of view of
    the incentives of the different\nparties involved in peer-to-peer traffic.  The
    paper concludes that\nit is essential to understand the incentives in order to
    have a\ndeployable solution.\n\t "

  content: "   Looking globally, IPv6 is growing faster than IPv4 and this means\n
    \  that the collective wisdom of the networking industry has selected\n   IPv6
    for the future.  This document provides an overview of IPv6\n   transition deployment
    status and a view on how the transition to IPv6\n   is progressing among network
    operators and enterprises that are\n   introducing IPv6 or have already adopted
    an IPv6-only solution.  It\n   also aims to analyze the transition challenges
    and therefore\n   encourage actions and more investigations on some areas that
    are\n   still under discussion.  The overall IPv6 incentives are also\n   examined.\n\n\n\t "

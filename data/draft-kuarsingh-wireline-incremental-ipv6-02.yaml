  content: "   Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for, or\n   deploying
    IPv6 into their networks.  The operators often face\n   challenges related to
    both IPv6 introduction along with a growing\n   risk of IPv4 run out within their
    organizations.  The overall problem\n   for many of there operators will be to
    meet the simultaneous needs of\n   IPv6 connectivity and continue support for
    IPv4 connectivity for\n   legacy devices and systems with a depleting supply of
    IPv4 addresses.\n   The overall transition will take most networks form an IPv4-Only\n
    \  environment to a dual stack network environment and potentially an\n   IPv6-Only
    operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework\n   for Wireline providers
    who may be faced with many of these challenges\n   as they consider what IPv6
    transition technologies to use, how to use\n   the selected technologies and when
    to use them.\n\n\t "

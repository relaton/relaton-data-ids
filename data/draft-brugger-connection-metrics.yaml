  script: Latn
  content: "Numerous metrics, or features, have been used to describe TCP\nconnections.
    These features are frequently of interest to the network\nintrusion detection
    community, and occasionally the network\nengineering community. While researchers
    may understand these terms\nwhen used by others, there are no formal definitions
    of these terms\nsuch that two researchers looking at the same connection will\nnecessarily
    calculate the same values for all the metrics. This paper\nwill propose a potential
    set of connection metrics with formal\ndefinitions of each.\n\t "

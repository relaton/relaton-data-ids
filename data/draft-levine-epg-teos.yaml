  content: "The Trusted Email Open Standard (TEOS) is a multi-level\n   identity system
    for SMTP e-mail.  It uses signatures to\n   authenticate the identity of the sender
    of a message, and\n   further permits the secure transmission of assertions about\n
    \  each message including the type of message, third-party\n   certifications,
    and graphical trust marks.\n\t "

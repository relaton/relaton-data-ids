abstract:
- content: "<p>Marine networks contain a combination of sensors, controls, and displays.
    The latest marine industry standards require IPv6. The most optimal way to distribute
    sensor data to all displays on the network is multicast. However, use of traditional
    switches can be problematic (overwhelm links) when both high-bandwidth and low-
    bandwidth devices are installed. To solve this problem, the network requires switches
    with multicast snooping. However, source-specific multicast (SSM) is not supported
    on marine switches so the destination address is the only way to differentiate
    multicast streams. This limitation creates several challenges including with the
    pre-allocation of addresses. The solution, described in this draft, provides a
    decentralized, zero-configuration method for dynamically assigning multicast addresses
    through defining an extension to the multicast portion of the IPv6 addressing
    architecture along with a new IANA registry.</p>"

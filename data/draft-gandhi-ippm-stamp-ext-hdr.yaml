  content: "   Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) defined in RFC\n
    \  8762 and its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 can be used for\n   Edge-To-Edge
    (E2E) active measurement.  In Situ Operations,\n   Administration, and Maintenance
    (IOAM) data fields defined in RFC\n   9197 can be used for recording and collecting
    Hop-By-Hop (HBH) and\n   E2E operational and telemetry information.  This document
    extends\n   STAMP to reflect any IPv6 options and MPLS Network Action Sub-Stacks\n
    \  for hop-by-hop and edge-to-edge active measurements, including IOAM\n   data
    fields.\n\n\t "

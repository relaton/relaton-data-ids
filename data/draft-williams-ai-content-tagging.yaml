abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a classification and tagging system designed\n
    \  to identify and preserve the provenance of digital content (text,\n   audio,
    video, and other media) to ensure the integrity of training\n   datasets for machine
    learning systems.  The framework described\n   herein aims to support a standardized
    mechanism for tagging data\n   with metadata that specifies whether the content
    was human-generated\n   or AI-generated.  This enables the exclusion of AI-generated
    data\n   from training corpora where human-originated material is required,\n
    \  and it facilitates the maintenance of clean, verifiable sources for\n   future
    AI development.\n\n\t "

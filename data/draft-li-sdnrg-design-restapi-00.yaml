  content: "   As stated in ONF SDN Architecture WG Charter [Arc2013], in the SDN\n
    \  architecture, the control and data planes are decoupled, network\n   intelligence
    and state are logically centralized, and the underlying\n   network infrastructure
    is abstracted from the applications. As a\n   result, network operators gain programmability,
    automation, and\n   network control, enabling them to build highly scalable, flexible\n
    \  networks that readily adapt to changing business needs. In this\n   architecture,
    the Northbound API provides interfaces to the external\n   components where applicable.\n\n
    \  As REST architectural style has gained more popularity in\n   implementing
    loosely-coupled systems, RESTful services are becoming\n   the style of choice
    for SDN Northbound API and gaining increasingly\n   importance in SDN architecture,
    for example, the Floodlight\n   [Floodlight] has a Northbound API based on REST.\n\n
    \  However, despite the recent advances made on RESTful web services,\n   there
    is a lack of guidelines for designing RESTful networking\n   protocols and communication
    web services, especially based on the\n   Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA)
    that further refines the REST\n   principles. Many networking protocols that claim
    to be REST APIs are\n   not hypertext driven as prescribed by REST. This situation
    can lead\n   to REST networking APIs that are not as scalable, extensible,\n   maintainable,
    and interoperable as promised by REST.\n\n   This document describes the key rules
    and design patterns for the\n   SDN Northbound API in a truly RESTful manner,
    based on our\n   experiences with REST API designs in general and SDN Northbound
    API\n   design in particular. The rules and the design patterns illustrate\n   the
    solutions to the common API problems in REST API designs, using\n   the network
    virtualization API of OpenStack as an example.\n\n\t "

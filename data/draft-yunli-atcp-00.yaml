abstract:
- content: "<p>Opportunistic networks have attracted attention due to their inherent
    characteristics, such as long latency, low data rate, and intermittent connectivity.
    Extensive research has been conducted on opportunistic networks, including the
    architecture, and routing. However, few in the literature report the performance
    of TCP in opportunistic networks, especially in the case of Epidemic Routing.
    This document investigates the performance of TCP [1] in opportunistic networks
    with Epidemic Routing. Our results show that the Epidemic Routing in opportunistic
    networks degrades the performance of TCP because multicopy data packets cause
    duplicate ACKs, and in turn reduce the transmission rate of TCP. An enhanced congestion
    control for TCP, named A-TCP/Reno is proposed. A-TCP/Reno avoids the duplicate
    ACK problem caused by Epidemic Routing.</p>"

  content: "   Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting the\n   design
    of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, \"what\n   network will best
    fit these needs?\"  A part of fitting network design\n   to requirements is the
    problem of complexity, an idea often\n   informally measured using intuition and
    subjective experience.  When\n   would adding a particular protocol, policy, or
    configuration be \"too\n   complex?\"  This document suggests a series of continuums
    along which\n   network complexity might be measured.  No suggestions are made
    on how\n   to measure complexity for each of these continuums; this is left for\n
    \  future documents.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Current Ethernet (802.1) link layers use custom routing protocols \n
    \  that have a number of challenges. The routing protocols need to \n   strictly
    avoid loops, even temporary loops during route propagation, \n   because of the
    lack of header loop detection support. Routing tends \n   not to take full advantage
    of alternate paths, or even non-\n   overlapping pairwise paths (in the case of
    spanning trees). The \n   convergence of these routing protocols and stability
    under link \n   changes and failures is also of concern. This document addresses
    \n   these concerns and suggests that they are related to the need to be \n   able
    to apply network layer routing (e.g., link state or distance \n   vector) protocols
    at the link layer. This document assumes that \n   solutions would not address
    issues of scalability beyond that of \n   existing bridged (802.1D) links, but
    that a solution would be \n   backward compatible with 802.1D, including hubs,
    bridges, and their \n   existing plug-and-play capabilities. \n\n   This document
    is a work in progress; we invite you to participate on \n   the mailing list at
    http://www.postel.org/rbridge \n\t "

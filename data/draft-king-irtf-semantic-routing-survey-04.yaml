  content: "   The Internet Protocol (IP) has become the global standard in any\n
    \  computer network, independent of the connectivity to the Internet.\n   Generally,
    an IP address is used to identify an interface on a\n   network device.  Routing
    protocols are also required and developed\n   based on the assumption that a destination
    address has this semantic\n   with routing decisions made on addresses and additional
    fields in the\n   packet headers.\n\n   Over time, routing decisions were enhanced
    to route packets according\n   to additional information carried within the packets
    and dependent on\n   policy coded in, configured at, or signaled to the routers.
    \ Many\n   proposals have been made to add semantics to IP addresses.  The\n   intent
    is usually to facilitate routing decisions based solely on the\n   address and
    without finding and processing information carried in\n   other fields within
    the packets.\n\n   This document is presented as a survey to support the study
    and\n   further research into clarifying and understanding the issues.  It\n   does
    not pass comment on the advisability or practicality of any of\n   the proposals
    and does not define any technical solutions\n\n\t "

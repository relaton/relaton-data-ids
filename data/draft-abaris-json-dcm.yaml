  content: "   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a widely used data interchange\n
    \  format, suitable for storing configuration data due to its simple\n   syntax,
    machine-readable structure, and ease of parsing and\n   generation.\n\n   This
    document describes informational practices associated with JSON-\n   Based Dynamic
    Configuration Management.  It outlines a recommended\n   naming convention for
    configuration files in the form of a structured\n   filename pattern, such as
    \"<project>@<version>.json\", and specifies a\n   configuration schema to support
    validation, traceability, and non-\n   disruptive updates.  The document also
    describes the rationale for\n   standardization and presents real-world scenarios
    where these\n   practices apply.\n\n\t "

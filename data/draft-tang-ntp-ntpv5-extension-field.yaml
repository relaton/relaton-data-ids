  content: "   This document describes an alternative timestamp to the Monotonic\n
    \  Receive Timestamp Extension Field defined in NTP version 5 (NTPv5)\n   when
    transferring frequency offset.  The new extension field, named\n   Monotonic RAW
    Receive Timestamp Extension Field uses a stable clock\n   source that is not affected
    by NTP adjustment.  It provides more\n   accurate frequency-transfer offset between
    a remote server and local\n   client, which further enhances the accuracy of time
    synchronization.\n\n\t "

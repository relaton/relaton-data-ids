abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an alternative timestamp to the Monotonic Receive
    Timestamp Extension Field defined in NTP version 5 (NTPv5) when transferring frequency
    offset. The new extension field, named Monotonic RAW Receive Timestamp Extension
    Field uses a stable clock source that is not affected by NTP adjustment. It provides
    more accurate frequency-transfer offset between a remote server and local client,
    which further enhances the accuracy of time synchronization.</p>"

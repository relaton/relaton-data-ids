  content: "The Kerberos V5 protocol [3] allows network entities to authenticate\nand
    establish shared secret keys. Some network applications would\nbenefit from a
    lightweight authentication mechanism with many of the\nbenefits of Kerberos, but
    where the messages have fewer bytes than\nexisting Kerberos messages. Also, we
    describe a protocol option that\nrequires only two messages to be sent and received
    from the client,\nto support lightweight clients. This document describes a Kerberos-\nlike
    protocol that does not use ASN.1 and is optimized for smaller\nmessages. The protocol
    makes use of existing Kerberos infrastructure.\n\n\t "

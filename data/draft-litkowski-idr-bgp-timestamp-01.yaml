  content: "   BGP is more and more used to transport routing information for\n   critical
    services.  Some BGP updates may be critical to be received\n   as fast as possible
    : for example, in a layer 3 VPN scenario where a\n   dual-attached site is loosing
    primary connection, the BGP withdraw\n   message should be propagated as fast
    as possible to restore the\n   service.  The same criticity exists for other address-families
    like\n   multicast VPNs where \"join\" messages should also be propagated very\n
    \  fast.\n\n   Experience of service providers shows that BGP path propagation
    time\n   may vary depending on network conditions (especially load of BGP\n   speaker
    on the path) and too long propagation time are affecting\n   customer service.\n\n
    \  It is important for service providers to keep track of BGP updates\n   propagation
    time to monitor quality of service for the customers.  It\n   is also important
    to be able to identify BGP Speakers that are\n   slowing down the propagation.\n\n
    \  This document presents a solution to transport timestamps of a BGP\n   path.
    \ The solution is targeted to be used using special identified\n   beacon prefixes
    that are single-homed.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "As the Internet Protocol continues to increase in popularity as a\nglobal
    communication system, it becomes increasingly valuable to be\nable to use familiar
    IP tools such as ftp for local communication as\nwell. For example, two people
    with laptop computers with built-in\nwireless Ethernet may meet and wish to exchange
    files. It is\ndesirable for these people to be able to use IP application software\nwithout
    the inconvenience of having to manually configure static IP\naddresses or set
    up a DHCP [RFC 2131] server.\nThis draft describes a method by which a host may
    automatically\nconfigure an interface with an IP address in the 169.254/16 range\nthat
    is valid for link-local communication on that interface. This\nis especially valuable
    in environments where no other configuration\nmechanism is available.\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses three major questions that were posed and\ndiscussed
    at some length at the interim meeting in San Diego, June\n2002:\n(1) Should geopriv
    facilitate the misrepresentation of location\ninformation?\n(2) Should the geopriv
    Location Object (LO) accommodate multiple\nlocations as part of a single positioning
    transaction?\n(3) If so, should the Location Object hold multiple locations in
    a\nsingle object, or should the multiple locations be contained in\nmultiple objects?\nIn
    this paper we propose an answer to those questions.\n\n\t "

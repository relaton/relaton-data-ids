  content: "This document describes a new framework for the transport of IP\nDatagrams
    over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS has\nbeen widely accepted
    not only for providing digital TV services, but\nalso as a subnetwork technology
    for building IP networks. Examples\nof systems using MPEG-2 include the Digital
    Video Broadcast (DVB)\nand Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Standards
    for\nDigital Television. \n       \nThe document identifies the need for a set
    of Internet standards\ndefining the interface between the MPEG-2 Transport Stream
    and an IP\nsubnetwork. It suggests a new encapsulation method for IP datagrams,\nand
    proposes protocols to perform IPv6/IPv4 address resolution, to\nassociate IP packets
    with the properties of the Logical Channels\nprovided by an MPEG-2 TS.  \n\t "

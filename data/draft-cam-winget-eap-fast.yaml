  content: "This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) based
    Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) protocol.  EAP-FAST is
    an EAP method that enables secure communication between a peer and a server by
    using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated
    tunnel.  Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used to convey
    authentication related data between the peer and the EAP server.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

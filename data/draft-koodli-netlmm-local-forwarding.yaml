  content: "With bidirectional tunneling in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the communication\nbetween
    any two Mobile Nodes is required to traverse the Local\nMobility Anchor (LMA).
    \ This is the case even when the communicating\nMobile Nodes are attached to the
    same Mobility Anchor Gateway (MAG).\nThis document introduces two messages between
    the LMA and the MAG\nenabling local forwarding by the MAG.  Such forwarding avoids
    the\ndelay due to bidirectional forwarding, and reduces the traffic load\non the
    LMA.\n\t "

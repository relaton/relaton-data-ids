  content: "   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths to\n
    \  a regular TCP session, which is quite suitable for integrated network\n   scenarios
    where multiple paths almost always exist.  However, link\n   handover and link
    on-off switching happen frequently in network\n   systems that integrate different
    systems (especially the systems that\n   continually move), which defeats the
    quality of MPTCP connections.\n   Information about the link handover and on-off
    switching in above-\n   mentioned scenarios can be predicted in advance, but MPTCP
    is not\n   capable of utilizing the prediction information.  This document\n   suggests
    MPTCP be extended with the capacity of obtaining and\n   utilizing the prediction
    information.  Furthermore, the document\n   describes one possible way to enhance
    MPTCP with prediction\n   information, which proposes a modified MPTCP scheduler
    utilizing link\n   on-off prediction information.\n\n\t "

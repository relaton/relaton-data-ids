- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo talks about the problem that exist in the current L2TP\n
    \  network and the solution to that problem.  In L2TP, internet link at\n   LNS
    gets congested when two or more remote user starts communicating \n   between
    them.  This memo suggest multipoint capabality for L2TP,  \n   where LACs communicates
    between them and need not require LNS for \n   every data packet.  This draft
    also deals with the applications of \n   multipoint L2TP in broadband networks.\n\t "

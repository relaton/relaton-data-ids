  content: "   The DataRight+ Security Profile: Baseline is intended to be a\n   compatible
    profile of the [CDS] presented as a profile of\n   [FAPI-1.0-Advanced].  This
    profile focuses primarily on the\n   obligations between Provider and Initiator
    with respect to\n   authorisation requests and does so as an overlay on the underlying\n
    \  FAPI profile combined with the inclusion of specified authorisation\n   types.\n\n
    \  This profile does not attempt to provide elaboration on registration\n   protocols,
    certificate profiles, federation or other components\n   specified within the
    [CDS].  Further terminology used is deliberately\n   jurisdiction agnostic, please
    refer to [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA] for\n   specific ecosystem mappings.\n\n\t "

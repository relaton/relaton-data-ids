  content: "SLPv2 [1] has been widely implemented but not all features of the\nprotocol
    are in common use.   If these features were deprecated from\nthe specification
    the protocol would be simpler, yet still perform\nits core function.  The changes
    proposed in this document could be\nthe basis for a revision of SLPv2 as it is
    considered for advancement\nto Draft Standard.\n\t "

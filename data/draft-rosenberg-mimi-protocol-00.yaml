  content: "   This document specifies the More Instant Messaging Interop (mimi)\n
    \  Transport Protocol (MTP)- a protocol for inter-provider persistent\n   group
    chat.  MIMI utilizes Messaging Layer Security (MLS) for end-to-\n   end encryption
    of content.  The MIMI Transport Protocol plays the\n   role of the Delivery Service
    (DS) defined by the MLS protocol.  MTP\n   is meant to represent the minimal protocol
    required to enable\n   provider to provider federation for messaging exchange
    using MLS.  It\n   is not suitable for client to provider communications.  MTP
    is based\n   on a pull architecture, wherein message delivery from provider A
    to\n   provider B is accomplished by having provider B pull messages from\n   provider
    A.  This provides better scalability and reliability and is\n   amenable to implementation
    in modern cloud software architectures,\n   while also reducing spam risk.  MTP
    serves as a transfer protocol for\n   opaque message content, the format of which
    is specified in a\n   separate document.  MTP is also designed to prevent spam,
    and does so\n   by introducing a layer of authorization for the establishment
    of\n   connections and addition to group chats.\n\n\t "

  content: "RFC 4684, \"Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway\nProtocol/MultiProtocol
    Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol\n(IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)\"
    provides a powerful and general\nmeans for BGP speakers to exchange and propagate
    Route Target\nreachability information which is used for cooperative route\nfiltering.
    \ However, the complexity of implementing the entire\nspecification may have impeded
    its widespread deployment.  This\ndocument specifies the subset of functionality
    which is required for\na provider edge router (\"PE\") to originate Route Target
    NLRI.  Such\nPEs need not implement any filtering functionality.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the problem statement for the Interface to\n
    \  In-Network Functions (I2INF) for user services both on the network-\n   level
    and application-level.  In-Network Functions (INF) include In-\n   Network Computing
    Functions (INCF) which are defined in the context\n   of Network Functions Virtualization
    (NFV) and Software-Defined\n   Networking (SDN).  INF also includes In-Network
    Application Functions\n   (INAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things
    (IoT)\n   Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial\n   Vehicles
    (UAV).  Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used to compose\n   user services
    and consist of a combination of INFs in a target\n   network.  This document investigates
    the need for a standard\n   framework with the interfaces for INFs, in terms of
    applications with\n   the need to run Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the network
    and\n   interoperability among multi-vendor INFs.\n\n\t "

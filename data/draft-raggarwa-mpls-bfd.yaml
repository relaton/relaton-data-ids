  content: "One desirable application of BFD is to detect a MPLS LSP data plane\nfailure.
    \ LSP-Ping [LSP-Ping] is an existing mechanism for detecting\nMPLS data plane
    failures and for verifying the MPLS LSP data plane\nagainst the control plane.
    \ BFD can be used for the former, but not\nfor the latter. However a combination
    of LSP-Ping and BFD can be used\nto provide faster data plane failure detection
    and/or make it\npossible to provide such detection on a greater number of LSPs.
    \ This\ndocument describes the applicability of BFD in relation to LSP-Ping\nfor
    this application. It also describes procedures for using BFD in\nthis environment.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Scheduling traffic in proportion to different nodes can optimize bandwidth
    utilization and improve user experience when the Internet traffic exceeds the
    bandwidth limit of a CDN cache node. This document defines AX and AAAAX RR types
    by adding weight field to existing A and AAAA resource records. A group of weighted
    records will be sorted in the DNS response according to the weight in AX and AAAAX
    records.</p>"

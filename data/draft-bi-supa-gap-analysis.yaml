  script: Latn
  content: "   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different\n   applications
    while maximizing network resources usage, there's\n   growing business pressure
    to minimize operational tasks and the\n   deployment time of new services. New
    automation paradigms are meant\n   to help reach these goals, including the optimization
    of network\n   functions through application control. This control could be signaled\n
    \  directly by an application, through a proxy or orchestrated in a\n   centralized
    manner. The purpose of SUPA is to develop a methodology\n   by which network services
    can be managed using standardized policy\n   rules. SUPA will focus in the first
    phase on inter-datacenter traffic\n   management as part of the distributed data
    center use case, including\n   the automated provisioning of site-to-site virtual
    private networks\n   of various types.This memo analyses the current state of
    the art of\n   the industries in IETF and outside IETF.\n\n\n\n\t "

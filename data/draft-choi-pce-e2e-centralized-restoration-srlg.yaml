- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft describes the concept of the Shared Link Risk Group \n   (SRLG)
    based logical ring configuration and recovery method using \n   ring SRLG for
    the purpose of PCE-based backup path computation.  \n   In this restoration architecture,
    backup paths can be easily \n   established through the end-to-end path which
    follows from the \n   logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment
    of \n   backup path disjoint from the working path at all levels. To take \n   advantage
    of bandwidth considerations and fast restoration \n   mechanisms, a centralized
    Controller is used to provide \n   dedicated protection to Optical Transport Networks
    using the \n   SRLG concept.\n\t "

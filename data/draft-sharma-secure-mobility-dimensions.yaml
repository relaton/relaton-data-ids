  content: "Several solutions to internet mobility have been offered. But the\n   solutions
    are sometimes for different kinds of mobility with \n   different kinds of requirements.
    It becomes confusing to see these \n   disparate types of mobility being discussed
    in the same vein. This \n   document is an attempt to delineate and classify different
    types of \n   network mobility. This attempt shall help us in understanding already
    \n   existing mobility solutions and at the same time help us in proposing\n   new
    solutions. Adding security to mobility adds a new dimension by \n   itself. Various
    types of secure mobility are discussed closely \n   following the types of mobility.\n\t "

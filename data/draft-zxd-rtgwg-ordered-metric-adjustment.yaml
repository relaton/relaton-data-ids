  content: "   Upon link down event or link up event, each device in network\n   individually
    schedules route calculation.  Because of different\n   hardware capabilities and
    internal/external environments, the time to\n   update forwarding entries on these
    devices are disordered which can\n   cause a transient forwarding loop.  This
    document introduces a method\n   to prevent forwarding loop by adjusting link
    metric gradually for\n   several times.\n\n\n\t "

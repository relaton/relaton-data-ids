abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric\n   password
    authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual\n   authentication in
    a client-server setting without reliance on PKI and\n   with security against
    pre-computation attacks upon server compromise.\n   Prior aPAKE protocols did
    not use salt and if they did, the salt was\n   transmitted in the clear from server
    to user allowing for the\n   building of targeted pre-computed dictionaries.  OPAQUE
    security has\n   been proven by Jarecki et al.  (Eurocrypt 2018) in a strong and\n
    \  universally composable formal model of aPAKE security.  In addition,\n   the
    protocol provides forward secrecy and the ability to hide the\n   password from
    the server even during password registration.\n\n   Strong security, versatility
    through modularity, good performance,\n   and an array of additional features
    make OPAQUE a natural candidate\n   for practical use and for adoption as a standard.
    \ To this end, this\n   draft presents several instantiations of OPAQUE and ways
    of\n   integrating OPAQUE with TLS.\n\n   This draft presents a high-level description
    of OPAQUE highlighting\n   its components and modular design.  It also provides
    the basis for a\n   specification for standardization but a detailed specification
    ready\n   for implementation is beyond the current scope of this document\n   (which
    may be expanded in future revisions or done separately).\n\n\t "

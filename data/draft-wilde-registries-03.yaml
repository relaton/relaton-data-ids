  content: "   Registries for Internet and Web protocols fulfill a wide range of\n
    \  tasks, ranging from low-level networking aspects such as packet type\n   identifiers,
    all the way up to application-level protocols and\n   standards.  This document
    summarizes some of the reasons of why,\n   when, and how to use registries.  It
    serves as an informative\n   reference for specification writers considering whether
    to create and\n   manage a registry, allowing them to better understand some of
    the\n   issues associated with certain design and operational decisions.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes the UDP-based Constrained GeneRic Autonomic\n
    \  Signaling Protocol (cGRASP), which is designed to be a constrained\n   and
    lightweight version of the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling\n   Protocol(GRASP, or
    the standard GRASP), with shortened messages and a\n   built-in reliability mechanism.
    cGRASP can work reliably over UDP,\n   making it suitable for IoT, where lightweight
    and resource-\n   constrained devices dominate.  Given the established ecosystem
    of\n   CoAP and aiming to promote cGRASP adoption in IoT, this document also\n
    \  focuses on the cGRASP transition from UDP to a CoAP-based framework,\n   i.e.,
    CoAP-based cGRASP.  Furthermore, this document also discusses\n   the potential
    way to adapt the cGRASP to work on the network without\n   IP connectivity.\n\n\t "

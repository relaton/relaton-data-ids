  script: Latn
  content: "   NEMO basic support enables Mobile Networks by extending Mobile IP to\n
    \  Mobile Routers.  In the case of nested Mobile Networks, this involves\n   the
    overhead of nested tunnels between the Mobile Routers and their\n   Home Agents,
    and causes a number of security issues.\n\n   This proposal alleviates those problems
    as well as other minor ones,\n   by using a source routing within the mobile nested
    structure,\n   introducing a new routing header, called the reverse routing header.\n\n\n\t "

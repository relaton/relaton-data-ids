  content: "IPsec technology is frequently used for remote access scenarios.  A\ntunnel
    is established from a mobile node (such as a laptop) and an\nIPsec gateway located
    at the Enterprise.  The mobile node's tunnel\nouter address is potentially any
    IP address on the Internet.  The\nmobile node's tunnel inner address should be
    an address from within\nthe enterprise.  The assignment of this address should
    ideally be\ndone dynamically.\nThis document specifies a configuration mode called
    'DHCP over IKE'.\nThe document specifies that the payload of a DHCP exchange should
    be\ncarried over an IKE phase 1 exchange.\n\t "

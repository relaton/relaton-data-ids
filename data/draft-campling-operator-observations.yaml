  content: "   The following document includes observations regarding a variety of\n
    \  implementations of recursive DNS capabilities that are important to\n   network
    operators in terms of delivering DNS services to their\n   (several tens of millions
    of) customers.  It highlights some of the\n   challenges that need to be addressed
    to allow the widespread adoption\n   of encrypted DNS by the end-users of network
    operators.\n\n   The information is intended to aid the development of discovery\n
    \  mechanisms for protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS.  It clearly defines\n   problems
    that need technical solutions to allow the deployment of\n   encrypted DNS by
    the largest number of operators to the largest\n   number of users in the shortest
    possible timeframe with little or no\n   disruption to the user experience.\n\n\t "

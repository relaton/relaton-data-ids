  content: "This document is designed to provide a definition of and guidelines for
    providing basic Network Information Center (NIC) information services.  It does
    not address the registration services that many NICs also perform.    This document
    was originally written and produced by the Federal Systems Group of Sterling Software,
    Inc. under contract NAS2-13210 for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA).  Both of these entities have granted permission for this document to be
    considered by the Network Information Services Infrastructure (NISI) working group
    of the User Services Area of the IETF as a possible foundation document to serve
    as an update to RFC 1302/FYI 12.\n\t "

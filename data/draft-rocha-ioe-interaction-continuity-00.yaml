abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet of Everything (IoE) deployments increasingly bind together
    devices, networks, cloud and edge compute, AI-assisted processing, and human participation
    within the same time-bounded operational interactions. When governance is externalized
    into multiple fragmented control contexts, the system must continuously propagate
    and reconcile identity, policy state, routing state, and compute placement decisions
    across those contexts, in real time. This document defines an architectural problem:
    as independently scaling dimensions multiply, coordination surfaces grow at multiplicative
    rates, making deterministic governance impractical. The draft enumerates requirements
    for interaction-scoped governance primitives that collapse fragmented control
    contexts.</p>"

  content: "   The pseudowire (PW) encapsulation of Ethernet, as defined in RFC4448,\n
    \  specifies that the use of the control word (CW) is optional.  In the\n   absence
    of the CW an Ethernet pseudowire packet can be misidentified\n   as an IP packet
    by a label switching router (LSR).  This in turn may\n   lead to the selection
    of the wrong equal-cost-multi-path (ECMP) path\n   for the packet, leading in
    turn to the mis-ordering of packets.  This\n   problem has become more serious
    due to the deployment of equipment\n   with Ethernet MAC addresses that start
    with 0x4 or 0x6.  The use of\n   the Ethernet PW CW addresses this problem.  This
    document recommends\n   the use of the Ethernet pseudowire control word in all
    but\n   exceptional circumstances.\n\n   This document updates RFC4448.\n\n\t "

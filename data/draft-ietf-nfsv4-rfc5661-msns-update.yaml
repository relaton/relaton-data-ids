  content: "   This document presents necessary clarifications and corrections\n   concerning
    features related to the use of attributes in NFSv4.1\n   related to file system
    location.  These revised features include\n   migration, which transfers responsibility
    for a file system from one\n   server to another, and include facilities to support
    trunking by\n   allowing discovery of the set of network addresses to use to access
    a\n   file system.  This document updates RFC5661.\n\n\t "

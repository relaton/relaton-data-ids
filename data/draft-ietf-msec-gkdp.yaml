  content: "This document specifies a group key distribution protocol (GKDP)\n   based
    on IKEv2, the IPsec key management protocol; the new protocol\n   is similar to
    IKEv2 in message and payload formats, and message\n   semantics to a large extent.
    \ The protocol in conformance with MSEC\n   key management architecture contains
    two components: member\n   registration and group rekeying, and downloads a group
    security\n   association from the GCKS to a member.  This protocol is independent\n
    \  of IKEv2 except in its likeness.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes INAP parameters (IN information and its encoding)
    which the SPIRITS protocol can transport from the PSTN into the IP network.  \nThe
    SPIRITS protocol is a protocol through which PSTN can request actions (services)
    to be carried out in the IP network in response to events occurring within the
    PSTN/IN. These services include, but are not limited to: Incoming Call Notification
    (Internet Call Waiting), Internet Caller-Id Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding
    ('Follow Me').  \nThis draft outlines, what INAP parameters are of immediate interest
    \nto SPIRITS, how they may be extracted and encoded for use within \nthe SPIRITS
    domain.  INAP is used as an example protocol to  \nclarify the SPIRITS message
    encoding process.  \nThis Internet-Draft has been written in response to the SPIRITS
    WG Chairs' call for SPIRITS Protocol proposals.  It may be viewed as being a direct
    contribution to the Informational RFC on the SPIRITS protocol parameters.  \nAmong
    other contributions, this I-D is based on:  \no Informational RFC2995, 'Pre-SPIRITS
    implementations' \no SPIRITS Architecture, presented in draft-ietf-spirits-architecture-02,
    \nRFC 3136 \no SPIRITS Protocol Requirements, presented in draft-ietf-spirits-reqs-04,
    current candidate for Informational RFC.  \n\n\t "

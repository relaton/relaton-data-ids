  content: "   SOUTH defines an authorization protocol for evaluating requests\n   issued
    by users, services, or autonomous agents.  SOUTH allows a\n   server to return
    a deterministic decision or an allow decision that\n   is issued with a probability
    determined by local policy.  This\n   enables servers to incorporate uncertainty,
    contextual information,\n   and load conditions into authorization decisions.\n\n
    \  SOUTH is transport independent and can be composed with existing\n   authentication
    mechanisms such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, mutual TLS,\n   or DPoP.  This document
    describes the request and response objects,\n   decision semantics, and an HTTP
    binding for interoperable deployment.\n\n\t "

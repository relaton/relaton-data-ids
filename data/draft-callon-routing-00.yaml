  content: "Frequently a router may have multiple sources of information about paths
    through the network.  For example, a router may be simultaneously learning routes
    from multiple routing domains, and may have static routes configured by the network
    manager.                                                                                                                    This
    paper resents a proposal for control of interactions between multiple routing
    protocols, including choice of routes when multiple IP routing protocols are being
    used simultaneously, as well as exchange of routes between routing protocols.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of this document is to collect and put under discussion\nrequirements
    for a protocol allowing for decomposition of\napplication-awareness from packet
    processing in firewalls. The\nprotocol will be used by application-aware entities
    to control\npacket flows of applications traversing firewalls dynamically. This\nkind
    of control allows applications using session control protocols\nto traverse firewalls
    while still retaining restrictive packet\nfiltering policy. Network management
    tools may also utilize the\nprotocol to manage packet-processing policies. We
    suggest an\nextensible framework that may be used for management of arbitrary\nper-flow
    control states in network nodes.\n\t "

  content: "   When a PIM router reboots, either because of uncontrolled\n   failover
    or because of ISSU, it needs to reconcile the\n   PIM entries. For this, rebooting
    router sends PIM hello with\n   new GenId. In reponse, neighbors send a new hello
    and replay\n   PIM J/P message. Regardless an application maintaing full mroute\n
    \  states, the rebooting route must wait for this replay to complete\n   only
    after which it can mark the oif reconciliation complete.\n   This process is undeterministic
    today. This draft proposes a\n   new mechanism to achieve a faster reconcilaition
    time. For this\n   a new Hello option and a new message type has been introduced.\n\n\n\t "

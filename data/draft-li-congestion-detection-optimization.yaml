- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft proposes an adaptive congestion detection mechanism for\n
    \  high-throughput data transmission in wide area networks (WANs).  With\n   increasing
    network bandwidth (up to 800Gbps) and challenges in\n   traditional TCP-based
    protocols (e.g., throughput degradation over\n   long distances and high packet
    loss rates), the solution focuses on\n   optimizing congestion identification
    while minimizing bandwidth\n   overhead.\n\n\n\t "

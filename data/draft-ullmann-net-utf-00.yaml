  content: "The Internet is no longer a creature of the United States, much less of
    DARPA (the US Defence Advance Research Projects Agency).  It is now an international
    network, and the ability to communicate in any of the world languages on an equal
    footing is an imperative.                            This draft attempts to track
    the development of ISO 10646, a moving target at this writing.  The reference
    citation below is to the 2nd 10646 draft, for which balloting has just concluded.
    \ (June 1992).  It is therefore expected that this memo will potentially change
    until the publication of IS 10646.  Some of the following text refers to 10646
    in the present tense, as if it is IS now; it should be understood in this context.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a topology-based distributed mobility\n   management
    (DMM) mechansim in PMIPv6-based network. In this\n   mechanism, a different sub-network
    prefix is assigned to a different\n   access router (AR) in PMIPv6-domain. The
    sub-network prefix and\n   corresponding AR address information is stored in the
    topology\n   server. With this mechanism, there is no need to query mobile\n   node
    (MN)'s localized mobility anchor (LMA) address information\n   whenever MN moves
    from one network to another.\n\n\t "

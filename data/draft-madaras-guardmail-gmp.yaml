abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the GuardMail Protocol (GMP), a framework for
    authenticated outbound messaging that provides cryptographic proof of origin,
    integrity, and policy compliance for email and file-based communications. GMP
    introduces GuardMail Receipts (GMRs), signed metadata structures bound to sender
    identity and message content that allow recipients to verify authenticity independent
    of transport mechanisms such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. GMP provides a modern, interoperable
    method for organizations to protect against impersonation, deepfake-based fraud,
    unauthorized content changes, and spoofed internal communications in enterprise
    environments.</p>"

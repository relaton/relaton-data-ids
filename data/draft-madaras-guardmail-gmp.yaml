abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies the GuardMail Protocol (GMP), a framework for\n
    \  authenticated outbound messaging that provides cryptographic proof of\n   origin,
    integrity, and policy compliance for email and file-based\n   communications.
    \ GMP introduces GuardMail Receipts (GMRs), signed\n   metadata structures bound
    to sender identity and message content that\n   allow recipients to verify authenticity
    independent of transport\n   mechanisms such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.\n\n   GMP
    provides a modern, interoperable method for organizations to\n   protect against
    impersonation, deepfake-based fraud, unauthorized\n   content changes, and spoofed
    internal communications in enterprise\n   environments.\n\n\t "

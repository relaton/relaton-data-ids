  content: "This document describes two LDAPv3 control extensions for server side
    sorting of search results. These controls allows a client to specify the attribute
    types and matching rules a server should use when returning the results to an
    LDAP search request.  The controls may be useful when the LDAP client has limited
    functionality or for some other reason cannot sort the results but still needs
    them sorted.  Other permissible controls on search operations are not defined
    in this extension.           The sort controls allow a server to return a result
    code for the sorting of the results that is independent of the result code returned
    for the search operation.                                                          The
    key words 'MUST', 'SHOULD', and 'MAY' used in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in [bradner97].\n\t "

  content: "   Network services based on Virtual Networks (VN) or Virtual Circuits\n
    \  (VC) may be run over MPLS-TE links, and support network\n   configurations
    such as hub-spoke, service routing, or on-demand\n   networks.  An MPLS Traffic
    Engineering(TE) network is typically\n   configured and the results of its operation
    analyzed through network\n   management interfaces (CLI, SNMP or NETCONF).  These
    interactions\n   control each of the MPLS TE links, and diagnose operations issues\n
    \  concerning link configuration, MPLS TE protection, and traffic\n   switching-over.
    \ The network management functions also monitor MPLS\n   TE links and provide
    fault detection.\n\n   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) (draft-ietf-i2rs-\n
    \  architecture) programmatic interface to the routing system provides\n   an
    alternative way to control the configuration and diagnose the\n   operation of
    MPLS links.  I2RS may be used for the configuration,\n   manipulation, polling,
    or analyzing MPLS TE.  This document describes\n   a set of use cases for which
    I2RS can be used for MPLS TE.  It is\n   intended to provide a base for a solution
    draft describing I2RS\n   information models and protocol functions that will
    support virtual\n   networks that utilize MPLS TE.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Domain Name System (DNS) has long provided means, such as CNAME\n
    \  (Canonical Name), where a query can be redirected to a different\n   name.
    A DNS response header has an RCODE (Response Code) field, used\n   for indicating
    errors, and response status bits. This document\n   clarifies, in the case of
    such redirected queries, how the RCODE and\n   status bits correspond to the initial
    query cycle (where the CNAME or\n   the like was detected) and subsequent or final
    query cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

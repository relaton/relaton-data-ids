  content: "   This is one of several documents that describe the components within\n
    \  Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS).  DBIS provides a\n   framework
    for the representation of data relating to TCP/IP and the\n   UNIX system within
    [X.500] entries that have previously been stored\n   in the Network Information
    Service [NIS]; so that they may be\n   resolved with the Lightweight Directory
    Access Protocol [RFC4510].\n\n   The intention of DBIS is to extend, and thereby
    replace both NIS and\n   the experimental protocol for using LDAP as a Network
    Information\n   Service (RFC2307), which have both achieved widespread adoption.\n\n
    \  DBIS consists of an LDAP schema, naming conventions and protocols to\n   describe
    its use by DUAs requiring network service information.\n   Client/server communication
    and server-side operations are entirely\n   contained within the domain of LDAP.\n\n
    \  Key aspects of DBIS and improvements over RFC2307 are:\n\n   - Schema is backwards
    compatible with NIS, including case sensitivity\n     of key names.\n\n   - Standardisation
    of mapping information to increase portability of\n     DUA implementations and
    to reduce duplication of client\n     configuration data.\n\n   - Features added
    to increase flexibility in large complex\n     environments:\n\n      o Maps may
    be joined from data located in different areas of the\n        Directory Information
    Tree (DIT).\n\n      o Groups of DUAs may have variances in their data depending
    upon\n        their host netgroup membership.\n\n   - Modular design to allow
    separate parts of the system to be\n     replaced, improved or augmented separately
    in the future.\n\n   - Support added for automounter maps [draft-bannister-dbis-\n
    \    automounter-00].\n\n   This document describes mapping objects used by DBIS
    to locate and\n   transform service information stored within the DIT.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Signed Objects are\n
    \  defined as Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content types\n   by
    way of a standard template (RFC 6488).  That template includes an\n   optional
    CMS signing-time attribute, representing the purported time\n   at which the object
    was signed by its issuer.  At the time when the\n   standard template was defined,
    rsync was the only distribution\n   mechanism for RPKI repositories.\n\n   Since
    the publication of the standard template, a new, additional\n   protocol for distribution
    of RPKI repositories has been developed:\n   the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol
    (RRDP).  While RPKI repository\n   operators must provide rsync service, RRDP
    is typically deployed\n   alongside it as well, and preferred by default by most
    Relying Party\n   (RP) implementations.  However, RP implementations also support\n
    \  fallback to rsync in the event of problems with the RRDP service.  As\n   deployment
    experience with RRDP has increased, the usefulness of\n   optimizing switchovers
    by RPs from one mechanism to the other has\n   become apparent.\n\n   This document
    describes how Publishers and RPs can use the CMS\n   signing-time attribute to
    minimize the burden of switching over from\n   RRDP to rsync.  Additionally, this
    document updates RFC 6488 by\n   mandating the presence of the CMS signing-time
    attribute and\n   disallowing the use of the binary-signing-time attribute.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Open\n
    \  Threat Signaling (DOTS), a protocol for requesting and managing\n   mitigation
    of DDoS attacks.\n\n   DOTS mitigation requests over the signal channel permit
    domains to\n   signal the need for help fending off DDoS attacks, setting the
    scope\n   and duration of the requested mitigation.  Elements called DOTS\n   servers
    field the signals for help, and enable defensive\n   countermeasures to defend
    against the attack reported by the clients,\n   reporting the status of the delegated
    defense to the requesting\n   clients.  DOTS clients additionally may use a reliable
    data channel\n   to manage filters and black- and white-lists to restrict or allow\n
    \  traffic to the clients' domains arbitrarily.  The DOTS signal channel\n   may
    operate over UDP [RFC0768] and if necessary TCP [RFC0793].  This\n   revision
    discusses a transport-agnostic approach to this channel,\n   focusing on the message
    exchanges and delegating transport specifics\n   to other documents.  Discussion
    of the reliable data channel may be\n   found in [I-D.reddy-dots-data-channel].\n\n\t "

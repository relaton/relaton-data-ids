  content: "   It is likely that any JMAP implementation has either bugs or\n   intentionally
    deviates from the standard.  To cope with such a unique\n   behavior, JMAP clients
    need to identify the software behind the JMAP\n   endpoint and apply custom logic.
    \ This specification defines the\n   ability to provide details about the product,
    backend and environment\n   for JMAP servers.\n\n\t "

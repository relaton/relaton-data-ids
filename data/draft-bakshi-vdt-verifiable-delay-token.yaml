abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol for the issuance and verification
    of Verifiable Delay Tokens (VDT) that proves that a minimum amount of wall time
    has elapsed since the issuance of the VDT. The protocol does not rely on trusted
    or synchronized time sources and instead uses Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs).
    The protocol supports time- based access control, anti-abuse and privacy-preserving
    mechanisms by letting the verifier enforce a waiting period, mitigating the abuse
    without learning client identity. The protocol ensures unlinkability between token
    issuance and redemption and does not require the verifier to be aware of the client
    identifiers, network addresses or any long-lived state. VDTs compose well with
    the existing Internet protocols such as HTTP-based systems and Oblivious HTTP.</p>"

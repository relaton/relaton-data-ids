abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a syntax for addressing time intervals within\n
    \  time-based Web resources through URI queries and fragments.  This\n   scheme
    is particularly used for Annodex [1] and CMML [2] Web\n   resources, though it
    could be picked up by any other time-based Web\n   resource format.  Temporal
    addressing enables, e.g., direct access to\n   a clip inside a video stored on
    a Web Server, or direct jumps to a\n   specific event within a piece of music.
    \ The syntax is not restricted\n   to audio or video Web resources though, but
    covers all kinds of Web\n   resources that contain time-continuous information.\n\t "

  content: "The FTP protocol [1] needs two connections. A control and a data\nconnection.
    Using networks with \"port forwarding\" (eg. SSH, DSL\nrouters, VPN etc.) there
    is often only the possibility for the\nserver to listen on only one TCP port.
    In such networks the\ntraditional FTP protocol cannot be used.\n\nThis memo describes
    an extension to the FTP protocol that allows the\nuse of FTP using only one TCP
    port number for both control\nconnections and passive-mode data connections.\n\nThe
    extension can also be used to use the FTP protocol over network\nprotocols that
    do not have a \"port\" concept (such as the NetBIOS\nprotocol).\n\t "

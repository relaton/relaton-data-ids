  content: "   This document calls for the MBone to be free of non-pruning multicast\n
    \  as soon as possible, due to the high cost to the Internet of the\n   traffic
    resulting from them. Consensus is that [DATE 1 month from RFC\n   publication]
    is the goal date for elimating non-pruning multicast\n   routers.\n \n   It cites
    several ways to eliminate non-pruning multicast from a\n   network, allowing per-site
    flexibility.\n\t "

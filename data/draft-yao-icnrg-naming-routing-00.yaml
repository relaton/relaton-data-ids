abstract:
- content: "<p>In ICN (Information-centric network), everything is an identifiable
    object with a name, therefore the number of name prefixes is a few orders of magnitude
    higher than that in current BGP routing table. Towards scalable routing in ICN,
    we propose a name scheme, called container assisted naming. With this scheme,
    an object name consists of two components: a content name which uniquely specifies
    the object within certain scope, and one or more containers which define access
    relationships to the object. This document illustrates the concept of container
    and how it assists scalable routing in ICN.</p>"

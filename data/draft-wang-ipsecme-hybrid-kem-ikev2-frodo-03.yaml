abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple key exchanges in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version
    2 (IKEv2) [RFC9370] specifies a framework, which supports multiple key encapsulation
    mechanisms (KEMs) in IKEv2 by allowing up to 7 layers of additional KEMs to derive
    the final shared secret keys for IPsec protocols. The primary goal is to mitigate
    the “harvest now and decrypt later” threat posed by Cryptographically Relevant
    Quantum Computers(CRQCs). For this purpose, one or more post-quantum KEMs are
    usually performed in addition to the traditional (EC)DH key exchange. This draft
    specifies how the post-quantum KEM algorithm FrodoKEM is instantiated for IKEv2
    as an additional key exchange mechanism. [EDNOTE: IANA KE code points for FrodoKEM
    may need to be assigned, as the code points for ML-KEM has been considered in
    [W-D.K25]. ]</p>"

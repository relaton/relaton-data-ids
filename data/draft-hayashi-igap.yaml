  content: "This memo documents the Internet Group membership Authentication\nProtocol
    (IGAP), a protocol developed by NTT, Nortel Networks and\nPanasonic. IGAP provides
    IGMP's group membership control between\nhosts and their first-hop routers, with
    the addition of user\nauthentication and accounting. IGAP is designed to be used
    in a\ncontrolled or managed IPv4 multicast environment, when authentication\nand
    accounting are required. The user authentication information in\nIGAP can enable
    a provider to control the distribution of the\nmulticast traffic as well as to
    collect real time user accounting\ninformation in an environment where the last-hop
    access networks are\nnot shared.\n\t "

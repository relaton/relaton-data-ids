  content: "This document describes base requirements for protecting control \nchannels(CCs)
    for GMPLS. It provides guidelines needed in order to \nswitchover an active CC
    to one of standby CCs when a failure occurs \nabout the active CC. It defines
    terminology, base concepts, \nnecessities, and considerations that should be noted
    primarily in \norder to complete the mechanism of CC protection. This document
    \ndescribes requirements for providing resilience capabilities of \ncontrol plane
    in GMPLS whose control channel can be separated from \nthe data channel. This
    contribution, as a document that proposes the\nnecessity about resilience of control
    plane like that of transport \nplane, handles related terminologies, base concepts,
    possible \nconfigurations, necessities and requirements, additional \nconsiderations
    including the relationship with other protocol such as \nLMP.\n\t "

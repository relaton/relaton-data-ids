  content: "This document captures problems and issues discovered at SCTP\nbakeoff's
    and on the sigtran mailing list. This document will be\nupdated after each bakeoff
    augmenting the existing draft to include\nany new issues discovered during inter-operability
    testing. Two\nbasic sets of problems are identified by this draft: first, issues\nthat
    need to be addressed when the next revision of SCTP is created,\ni.e.  issues
    that should be remembered in a BIS document; second,\nissues that were found that
    are strictly implementation problems.\n\t "

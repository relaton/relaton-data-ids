  content: "Abstract\n\n     This memo specifies a 64-bit crypto-based host identifier
    that can\n     be used as an interface identifier in protocols that allow address\n
    \    agility, such as [ODT]. The cryptographic nature of the host\n     identifier
    makes it possible to determine whether a correspondent\n     is legitimately using
    said host identifier or not. \n\n     The host identifiers can be used as regular
    interface identifiers\n     in protocols that don't require an identifier that
    is separate from\n     locators, or they can be expanded to 128-bit IPv6 address
    like\n     values for use with protocols that do need such an identifier-only\n
    \    value. \n\t "

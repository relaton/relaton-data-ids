  content: "This document describes a diffserv per-domain behaviour (PDB)  called\nAssured
    \ Rate  (AR).  The  AR  PDB  is  suitable for carrying traffic\naggregates that
    require rate assurance but do not require  delay  and\njitter  bounds.  The traffic
    aggregate will also have the opportunity\nto obtain excess bandwidth beyond the
    assured rate. The  PDB  can  be\ncreated using the diffserv AF PHB along with
    suitable policers at the\ndomain ingress nodes.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC7344 specifies how DNS trust can be partially maintained in-band\n
    \  between parent and child.  There are two features missing in that\n   specification:
    initial trust setup and removal of trust anchor.  This\n   document addresses
    both these omissions.\n\n   Changing a domain's DNSSEC status can be a complicated
    matter\n   involving multiple unrelated parties.  Some of these parties, such
    as\n   the DNS operator, might not even be known by all the organizations\n   involved.
    \ The inability to disable DNSSEC via in-band signalling is\n   seen as a problem
    or liability that prevents some DNSSEC adoption at\n   large scale.  This document
    adds a method for in-band signalling of\n   these DNSSEC status changes.\n\n   Initial
    trust is considered in general to be a hard technical\n   problem, this document
    sets forth reasonable policies that clarify\n   and simplify the initial acceptance
    policy.\n\n\t "

  content: "The UNIX sendmail program has for many years supported a Return-Receipt-To
    (RRT) header field that requests a notice of successful final delivery.    Notice-Requested-Upon-Delivery-To
    (NRUDT) has the same basic function. The big difference is that RRT lists the
    sender's address, while NRUDT lists the recipient's address.                                                   This
    change is critical. RRT works poorly for messages to multiple recipients, because
    it requests a notice from every recipient. RRT in a message to a large mailing
    list produces a giant, usually unintentional, flood of mail. This problem is so
    severe that RRT has been disabled in recent versions of sendmail.                                               NRUDT
    is designed to be adopted immediately, with minimal disruption, as a solution
    to the problems of RRT. Note that NRUDT is merely a request for notification;
    unlike the link-level Delivery Status Notification SMTP extension, NRUDT does
    not provide a guarantee of notification.\n\t "

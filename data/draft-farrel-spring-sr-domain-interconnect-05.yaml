  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) is a forwarding paradigm for use in MPLS and\n
    \  IPv6 networks.  It is intended to be deployed in discrete domains\n   that
    may be data centers, access networks, or other networks that are\n   under the
    control of a single operator and that can easily be\n   upgraded to support this
    new technology.\n\n   Traffic originating in one SR domain often terminates in
    another SR\n   domain, but must transit a backbone network that provides\n   interconnection
    between those domains.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism for providing
    connectivity\n   between SR domains to enable end-to-end or domain-to-domain traffic\n
    \  engineering.\n\n   The approach described allows connectivity between SR domains,\n
    \  utilizes traffic engineering mechanisms (RSVP-TE or Segment Routing)\n   across
    the backbone network, makes heavy use of pre-existing\n   technologies, and requires
    the specification of very few additional\n   mechanisms.\n\n   This document provides
    some background and a problem statement,\n   explains the solution mechanism,
    gives references to other documents\n   that define protocol mechanisms, and provides
    examples.  It does not\n   define any new protocol mechanisms.\n\n\t "

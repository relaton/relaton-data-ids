  content: "The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a mechanism for\n   sending
    session-based instant messages.  The session is negotiated\n   using the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP).  MSRP
    can be used in a centralized\n   conference just as any other media type.  This
    document provides\n   requirements in support for MSRP in centralized conferences,\n
    \  including requirements to provide private instant messages within a\n   conference.\n\t "

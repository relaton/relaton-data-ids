  content: "   This document presents a secure method to configure/reconfigure a key\n
    \  for a resource constrained node when it initially joins to network\n   that
    is currently in operation. The method is suited for a scenario,\n   where resource
    constrained nodes are interconnected with each other\n   and thus form a network
    called Internet of Things. It is assumed that\n   communications for all nodes
    are based on TCP/IP protocols and the\n   nodes use the constrained application
    protocol (CoAP). The presented\n   method does not cover all operations of secure
    bootstrapping for IoT\n   networks, but it is intended to securely support self-reconfiguration\n
    \  of the pre-installed temporary key of joined node.\n\n\n\n\t "

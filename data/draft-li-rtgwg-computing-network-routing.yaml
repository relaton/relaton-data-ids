- language: en

  content: "   This document explores the characteristics of computing cluster\n   network
    and analyzes the challenges of employing the traditional\n   distributed or centralized
    routing mechanisms in it.  In order to\n   achieve the enhanced scalability, improved
    resilience and optimized\n   performance simultaneously, hybrid routing is briefly
    examined as a\n   potential way to combine the advantages of distributed and\n
    \  centralized mechanisms.  The document further shows the possible\n   future
    work.\n\n\t "

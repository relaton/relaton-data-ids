  content: "   This document describes a key management protocol to generate a\n   handover
    key between a mobile node (MN) and an access router (AR) for\n   the purpose of
    securing Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) signaling messages.\n   As such, it specifies
    a message exchange between the MN and the AR\n   and assumptions that must hold
    in order for this protocol to work.\n   The protocol itself is described here
    for FMIPv6 use, but is\n   applicable to other protocols that need to establish
    shared keys\n   between the MN and a network entity.\n\t "

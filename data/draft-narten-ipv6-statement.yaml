  content: "Over the last year, the Internet community has slowly come to realize\nthat
    the IANA and RIR IPv4 free address pool will be exhausted within\nno more than
    3-4 years, and possibly sooner.  At that point, it will\nbecome increasingly difficult
    for ISPs and end sites to obtain the\npublic IPv4 address space they need to expand
    operations.\n\nIPv6 was developed to address the IPv4 address exhaustion problem,\nbut
    widespread deployment has barely begun.  This document reiterates\nthe IETF's
    support and continued commitment to IPv6.  IPv6 deployment\nis still necessary
    to ensure the continued growth and expansion of\nthe Internet.  Deployment of
    IPv6 is needed to preserve important\nInternet properties that have made it a
    success and enable new\ngenerations of applications and services.\n\t "

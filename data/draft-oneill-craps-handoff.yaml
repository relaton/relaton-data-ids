  content: "This draft describes a generalized IP handoff model that supports\nedge
    mobility such as that encountered in cellular systems and\nInternet roaming.  The
    model is mobile-controlled and network-\nconstrained.  The model is generic in
    that it permits both planned\nand unplanned handoff (i.e. proactive and reactive)
    and supports\nboth make-before-break and break-before-make link layers. It also\nsupports
    movement within and between technologies, as well as within\nand between domains.
    Finally, it is -equally applicable to routed\nmobility and to tunneled mobile
    IP-based mobility.\n\t "

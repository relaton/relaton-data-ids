  content: "This memo describes a proposed protocol for locating and connecting users
    together on an internet.                                                   In
    the last year, there has been an explosion in the number of client applications
    on the Internet that communicate directly with another client or clients. These
    applications include internet 'telephones', video phones, whiteboards, and other
    conferencing applications. Each of these applications uses a proprietary or ad-hoc
    solution for providing a directory of currently connected users and performing
    name to address mapping.\n\t "

  content: "   RFC7653 allows for actively transferring the real-time binding\n   information
    data of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6) via TCP, which
    satisfies the need of continuous update of an\n   external requestor with Leasequery
    data.  QUIC could provide useful,\n   reliable and secure semantics for transferring
    active leasequery of\n   DHCPv6, which enabling much better efficiency and performance
    by\n   reducing connect time.  This document describes how to use the QUIC\n   transport
    protocol to deliver DHCPv6 Active Leasequery messages,\n   named DHCP6oQUIC.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers used when one\n
    \  signing operation is split between two cooperating parties.  When\n   performing
    split signing, the first party typically hashes the data\n   to be signed and
    the second party signs the hashed data computed by\n   the first party.  This
    can be useful when communication with the\n   party holding the signing private
    key occurs over a limited-bandwidth\n   channel, such as NFC or Bluetooth Low
    Energy (BLE), in which it is\n   infeasible to send the complete set of data to
    be signed.  The\n   resulting signatures are identical in structure to those computed
    by\n   a single party, and can be verified using the same verification\n   algorithm
    without additional steps to preprocess the signed data.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   When IP VPNs are used to interconnect end-systems [I-D.marques-l3vpn-\n
    \  end-system] it may be desirable to introduce traffic control rules at\n   a
    finer level of granularity than an IP destination address.\n\n   This document
    extends the end-system IP VPN specification with\n   support for fine grain traffic
    classification, filtering and\n   redirection rules.  It applies the existing
    BGP IP VPN flow\n   specification dissemination mechanism [RFC5575] to end-system
    IP VPNs\n   in order to provide the ability to control IP packets that match a\n
    \  specific pattern, which may include fields other than the IP\n   destination
    address.\n\n\t "

  content: "The proxy server plays a central role as an intermediary in the\nestablishment
    of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\nIn that role, they can
    define and impact policies on call routing,\nrendezvous, and other call features.
    However, there is no standard\nmeans by which proxies can have any influence on
    session policies,\nsuch as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc and\nnon-conformant
    techniques have been deployed to allow for such policy\nmechanisms. There is a
    need for a standards-based and complete\nmechanism for session policies. This
    document defines a set of\nrequirements for such a mechanism.\n\t "

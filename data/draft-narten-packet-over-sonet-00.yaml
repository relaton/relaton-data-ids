  content: "   T1.X1 is the ANSI accredited T1 Technical Subcommitee responsible for\n
    \  developing SONET standards, including SONET rates, formats and\n   payload
    mappings.  Its output is also brought into the ITU, for\n   example as in ITU-T
    Recommendation G.707 [G.707].\n \n   The IETF-recommended way to run HDLC over
    SONET is to use the\n   definition found in T1.X1 ANSI documents [T1.105.02, T1.105]
    and ITU\n   document [G.707].\n\n\t "

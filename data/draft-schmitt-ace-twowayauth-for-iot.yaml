  content: "   In this draft a full two-way authentication security scheme for the\n
    \  Internet of Things (IoT) based on existing Internet standards and\n   protocols
    is introduced.  The solution is twofold providing a two-way\n   authentication
    for resource-rich hardware (e.g., class 2 devices with\n   ~50 KiB RAM and ~250
    KiB ROM [RFC7228]) and for devices with less\n   resources (e.g., class 1 devices
    with ~10 KiB RAM and ~100 KiB ROM\n   [RFC7228]).  By relying on an established
    standard, existing\n   implementations, engineering techniques, and security infrastructure\n
    \  can be reused, which enables an easy security uptake.  The proposed\n   security
    scheme for resource-rich devices is, therefore, based on\n   RSA, the most widely
    used public key cryptography algorithm.  It is\n   designed to work over standard
    communication stacks that offer UDP/\n   IPv6 networking for Low power Wireless
    Personal Area Networks\n   (6LoWPANs).  RSA is a bulky solution at the moment
    but shows that it\n   is possible using it on constraint devices for security
    purposes.  An\n   optimization is the usage of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
    as\n   assumed for devices with less resources.\n\n\t "

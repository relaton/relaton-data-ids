  content: "This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation \nProtocol
    (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks \n(also known as enterprise
    networks). SIP is an Internet application-\nlayer control (signalling) protocol
    for creating, modifying, and \nterminating sessions with one or more participants.
    These sessions \ninclude, in particular, telephone calls. QSIG is a signalling
    \nprotocol for creating, modifying and terminating circuit-switched \ncalls, in
    particular telephone calls, within Private Integrated \nServices Networks (PISNs).
    QSIG is specified in a number of ECMA \nStandards and published also as ISO/IEC
    standards. \nAs the support of telephony within corporate networks evolves from
    \ncircuit-switched technology to Internet technology, the two \ntechnologies will
    co-exist in many networks for a period, perhaps \nseveral years. Therefore there
    is a need to be able to establish, \nmodify and terminate sessions involving a
    participant in the SIP\nnetwork and a participant in the QSIG network. Such calls
    are \nsupported by gateways that perform interworking between SIP and QSIG. \nThis
    document is a product of the authors' activities in ECMA \n(www.ecma.ch) on interoperability
    of QSIG with IP networks. \n\n\t "

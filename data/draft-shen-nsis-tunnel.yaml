  content: "This draft presents an NSIS operation over IP tunnels scheme using\nQoS
    NSLP as the NSIS signaling application.  Both sender-initiated\nand receiver-initiated
    reservation modes are discussed.  The scheme\nproposes the use of separate signaling
    sessions inside the tunnel for\nthe end-to-end sessions.  Packets belonging to
    qualified tunnel\nsessions are assigned special flow IDs to be distinguished from
    the\nrest of the tunnel traffic.  The end-to-end session and its\ncorresponding
    tunnel session are associated with each other when\nnecessary; so that adjustment
    in one session may be reflected in the\nother.\n\t "

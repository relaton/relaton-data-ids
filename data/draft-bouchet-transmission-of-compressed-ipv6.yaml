  content: "   The document describes an IPv6 header compression format for\n   transmission
    of IPv6 packets in 6LoWPAN networks. Specifications\n   of the compression format
    rely on specific contexts for which the\n   implementation of fragmentation and
    defragmentation/reassembly is not\n   recommended. Specifications include frameworks
    for compressing and\n   decompressing header as well as compression and decompression
    of\n   source and destination addresses. This document complements\n   \"Compression
    Format for IPv6 Datagrams in 6LoWPAN Networks\",\n   [draft-ietf-6lowpan-hc-07].\n\n\t "

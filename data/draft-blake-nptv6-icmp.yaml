  script: Latn
  content: "   NPTv6 is a stateless, transport-agnostic IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix\n
    \  Translation function that provides the address-independence benefit\n   associated
    with IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT without some of that mechanism's\n   drawbacks.  NPTv6 is
    intended to be deployed in environments where a\n   host might not know its \"external\"
    network prefix(es).  In such an\n   environment, a NPTv6 device must also translate
    network prefixes\n   present in in-bound and out-bound ICMPv6 error message payloads.\n
    \  This document describes the required processing of ICMPv6 error\n   messages.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document introduces the concept of COPS-PR meta-policies and \ndefines
    the Meta-Policy Information Base.  \nThe meta-policy PIB does not introduce a
    new policing area. On the \ncontrary, it defines some provisioning classes that
    can be used by \nall other PIBs, in order to add meta-policing functionality into
    \nthem. The meta-policy PIB, like every PIB, stores policing \ninformation that
    controls some policing mechanisms of the device. \nHowever, unlike other PIBs,
    the policing mechanism controlled by the \nmeta-policy PRCs is the PIB itself.
    The data maintained by these \nPRCs implement policies that control other policies,
    this is why \nthey are called meta-policies. \nMeta-policies is an attempt to
    push intelligence towards the COPS-PR \nPEPs and overcome the rigidity of their
    PIBs. Through meta-policies, \nmore policing information and functionality can
    be pushed towards \nthe PEP, less interaction with the PDP is necessary and less
    network \nand PDP resources are consumed. The PEP is more independent and it \ncan
    bear longer PDP absences.\n\t "

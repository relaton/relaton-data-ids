  content: "This document describes an optional extension to version 2 of the OSPF
    routing protocol [RFC1247] to support the transport of External Attributes associated
    with external routes which AS border routers have originated into OSPF between
    and among border routers using OSPF's reliable flooding mechanism.  External Attributes
    are data associated with routes received and readvertised via some exterior gateway
    protocols, data which has meaning to, and must be distributed among, border routers
    running those protocols to allow external routes to be evaluated and readvertised
    by such routers, but which has no direct influence on routes computed by OSPF.
    \                                                                     The technique
    described uses a new, distinct OSPF link state advertisement (LSA) format (Type
    8) to propagate external attribute information in a form which is opaque to the
    OSPF protocol itself but which is meaningful for border routers running appropriate
    exterior gateway protocols.\n\t "

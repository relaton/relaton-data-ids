  content: "This outline contains a short description of the IETF's core work\nand
    a description of structures and processes which might be used\nto accomplish it.
    \ Many of the elements described are already in\nuse either formally or informally.
    This document does, however,\npropose some new mechanisms to support the work
    of the IETF.  The\nIESG does not believe that this document is complete, nor has
    it\ndecided on a course of action based on this or any other proposal.\nThe IESG
    does hope that presenting an outline set of mechanisms,\nboth old and new, will
    foster discussion. The IESG hopes community\nwill consider both whether the mechanisms
    described here would meet\nthe IETF's needs and, especially, whether the linkages
    among the\nabstracted functions it describes are adequate and complete.\n\t "

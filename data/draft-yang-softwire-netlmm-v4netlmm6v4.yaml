  content: "NETLMM6 may be widely deployed in the 3G network.  But currently,\nmost
    of the mobile hosts are IPv4 nodes without any Mobile IPv4/IPv6\nstacks.  This
    document proposes the solution to enable the IPv4 hosts\nto obtain the network
    connection and set up IPv4 sessions over\nNETLMM6 network.  Extensions and option
    are added to proxy Mobile\nIPv6 allowing for single IPv4 stack hosts to access
    kind of IPv6\nnetwork.  The IPv4 Address could be maintained constantly in the\ndomain
    of NETLMM6.\n\n\t "

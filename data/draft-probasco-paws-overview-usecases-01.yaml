  content: "   Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments.\n
    \  The spectrum is used for various purposes which include entertainment\n   (eg.
    radio and television), communication (telephony and Internet\n   access), military
    (radars etc.) and, navigation (satellite\n   communication, GPS).  Portions of
    the radio spectrum that are unused\n   or unoccupied at specific locations and
    times are defined as \"white\n   space\".  TV White space refers to those unused
    channels, within the\n   range allocated for TV transmission, that can be used
    without\n   interfering with the primary purpose for which it is allocated.\n\n
    \  This document describes examples of how a radio system might operate\n   using
    TV white space spectrum and associated requirements.  Not only\n   does it describe
    the operation of a radio system, but also how the\n   radio system including a
    white space database enables additional\n   services.\n\n\t "

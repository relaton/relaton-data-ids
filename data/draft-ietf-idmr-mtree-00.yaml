  content: "Multicast trees can be shared across sources (shared trees) or may be
    source-specific (shortest path trees). Inspired by recent interests in using shared
    trees for interdomain multicasting,  we investigate the trade-offs among shared
    tree types and source specific shortest path trees, by comparing performance over
    both individual multicast group and the whole network. The performance is evaluated
    in terms of path length, link cost, and traffic concentration.                                      We
    present simulation results over a real network as well as random networks under
    different circumstances. One practically significant conclusion is that member-
    or sender-centered trees have good delay and cost properties on average,  but
    they exhibit heavier traffic concentration which makes them inappropriate as the
    universal form of trees for all types of applications.\n\t "

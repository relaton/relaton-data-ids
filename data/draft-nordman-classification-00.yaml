abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification addresses how to communicate a basic sense of the\n
    \  type of each device present on the network.  This is particularly\n   important
    as the range of devices with connectivity greatly expands,\n   and as indirect
    interests in device characteristics increase, such as\n   energy consumption.
    \ Many applications will benefit from a single\n   standard enumeration of basic
    device types.  This draft does not\n   address detailed device characteristics
    or subtypes.\n\n   The draft also discusses related identify information.  It
    is an\n   initial discussion document to generate feedback and improvement.\n\n\t "

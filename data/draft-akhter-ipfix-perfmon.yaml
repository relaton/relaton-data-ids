  content: "There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of\nnetwork
    applications and the network service in handling user data.\nThis performance
    data provides information essential in validating\nservice level agreements, fault
    isolation as well as early warnings\nof greater problems.  This document describes
    IPFIX Information\nElements related to performance measurement of network based\napplications.
    \ In addition, to the performance information several\nnon-metric information
    elements are also included to provide greater\ncontext to the reports.  The measurements
    use audio/video\napplications as a base but are not restricted to these class
    of\napplications.\n\t "

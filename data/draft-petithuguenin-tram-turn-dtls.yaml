  content: "   This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer\n   Security
    (DTLS) [RFC6347] as a transport protocol between a Traversal\n   Using Relays
    around NAT (TURN) [RFC5766] client and a TURN server.\n   It also specifies modifications
    to the TURN URIs [RFC7065] and to the\n   TURN resolution mechanism [RFC5928]
    to facilitate the resolution of\n   TURN URIs into the IP address and port of
    TURN servers supporting\n   DTLS as a transport protocol.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The address to which email is delivered might be different than any\n
    \  of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were\n   created
    by the email's author.  For example, the address used by the\n   email transport
    service is provided separately, such as through\n   SMTP's \"RCPT TO\" command,
    and might not match any address in the To:\n   or cc: fields.  In addition before
    final delivery, handling can\n   entail a sequence of submission/delivery events,
    using a sequence of\n   different destination addresses that (eventually) lead
    to the\n   recipient.  As well, a receiving system's delivery process can\n   produce
    local address transformations.\n\n   It can be helpful for a message to have a
    common way to record each\n   delivery in such a sequence, and to note each address
    used in the\n   sequence to that recipient, such as for analyzing the path a message\n
    \  has taken, or for loop detection, or for formulating the author's\n   address
    in a reply message.  This document defines a header field for\n   this information.\n\n
    \  Email handling information discloses details about the email\n   infrastructure,
    as well as about a particular recipient; this can\n   raise privacy concerns.\n\n
    \  A header field such as this is not automatically assured of\n   widespread
    use.  Therefore this is being published as an Experiment,\n   looking for constituency
    and for operational utility.  The document\n   is produced through the Independent
    RFC stream and was not subject to\n   the IETF's approval process.\n\n\t "

  content: "Conventional multicast builds a tree structure from the source of a\nmulticast
    stream to the destinations of that stream. Multicast\npackets are forwarded from
    the sources down the tree by each\nintervening router. Each router contains state
    information to\ndetermine the next hop forwarding destination(s) for a packet.
    Where\nthere are a large number of groups, this gives rise to a scaling\nproblem.
    The amount of state to be stored in the routers becomes\nimpossibly large.\nIt
    is attractive to consider the use of multicast to provide\napplications such as
    n-way voice and video conferencing, which would\nrequire a very large number (perhaps
    millions) of relatively small\n(between 3 and 10 members) multicast groups.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a backward-compatible optimization for the Database
    Exchange process in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  In this optimization, a router does not
    list a Link State Advertisement (LSA) in Database Description packets sent to
    a neighbor, if the same or a more recent instance of the LSA was listed in a Database
    Description packet already received from the neighbor.  This optimization reduces
    Database Description overhead by about 50% in large networks.  This optimization
    does not affect synchronization, since it only omits unnecessary information from
    Database Description packets.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

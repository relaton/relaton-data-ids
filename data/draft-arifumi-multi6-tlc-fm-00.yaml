  content: "   The existing transport protocols aren't designed to work well on\n
    \  multi-homed and multi-addressed hosts.  TLC-FM is a transport layer\n   common
    framework, which stores multihoming related information and\n   provides common
    functions and multihoming functions for all the\n   transport protocols.\n   In
    this framework, address information for each remote host and some\n   routing
    information for each next-hop is stored and shared by each\n   transport protocol.
    \ Also in this framework, incoming packet's\n   address fields are re-written
    from the on-wire address to the\n   original one that is expected by transport
    protocols.  This is true\n   for outgoing packets as well.\n\t "

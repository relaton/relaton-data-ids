  content: "   This document defines the Mobile User Plane (MUP) architecture for\n
    \  Distributed Mobility Management.  The requirements for Distributed\n   Mobility
    Management described in [RFC7333] can be satisfied by\n   routing fashion.\n\n
    \  In MUP Architecture, session information between the entities of the\n   mobile
    user plane is turned to routing information so that mobile\n   user plane can
    be integrated into dataplane.\n\n   MUP architecture is designed to be pluggable
    user plane part of\n   existing mobile service architectures, enabled by auto-discovery
    for\n   the use plane.  Segment Routing provides network programmability for\n
    \  a scalable option with it.\n\n   While MUP architecture itself is independent
    from a specific\n   dataplane protocol, several dataplane options are available
    for the\n   architecture.  This document describes IPv6 dataplane in Segment\n
    \  Routing case (SRv6 MUP) due to the DMM requirement, and is suitable\n   for
    mobile services which require a large IP address space.\n\n\t "

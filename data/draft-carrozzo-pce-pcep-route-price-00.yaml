  script: Latn
  content: "   The PCE defined in RFC4655 is a functional entity generally confined\n
    \  in the control plane to elaborate explicit optimal routes with\n   related
    costs to be installed as [G]MPLS tunnels/LSPs.  The resulting\n   route cost(s)/metric(s)
    are Traffic Engineering indicators used by\n   the network administrator (carrier)
    to optimize the usage of its\n   network resources.\n\n   In this document a framework
    for the usage of PCE in cooperation with\n   the Network Service and Business
    Plane (NSBP) is proposed, along with\n   related PCEP extensions.  The NSBP invokes
    this extended PCE (service\n   PCE) to trigger the computation of network service
    offers with\n   related price information.  The price of a network connectivity\n
    \  service generally depends on strategic factors, but it could also be\n   influenced
    by the amount of mobilized network resources (along the\n   route), the ingress/egress
    interfaces/PoPs, etc.  Therefore, it could\n   be provided by an extended service-PCE
    as an additional route\n   information.\n\n   This document focuses on the extensions
    to the PCEP protocol in\n   support of the computation of route prices for intra-
    and inter-\n   domain network connectivity services.  Mechanisms for elaborating
    and\n   retrieving price information in the PCE are vendor-specific and out\n
    \  of the scope of this document.\n\n\t "

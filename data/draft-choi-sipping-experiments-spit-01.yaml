abstract:
- content: "<p>This document shows some experimental results on SPIT on commercial
    VoIP services, in which a SIP UA has not been secured by SIP security protocol
    such as TLS. Although many service providers have been applying the HTTP digest
    scheme to authenticate a SIP UA, they often do not apply SIP signaling protection
    against potential threats between the SIP UA and the SIP proxy. This cause vulnerabilities
    to the VoIP services like SPIT. The aim of this memo is to inform the service
    providers of SPIT threats by showing some experimental results of SPIT on current
    VoIP networks.</p>"

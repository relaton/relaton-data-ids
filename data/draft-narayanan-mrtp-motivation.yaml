  content: "   We proposed a new multi-flow real time protocol (MRTP) in our earlier
    \n   internet-draft [1] for carrying real-time data through multiple paths \n
    \  between the source and the destination. There are a various \n   advantages
    in multipath data transport as demonstrated by [2][3] \n   [5][8]. MRTP would
    provide an end-to-end transport services over \n   multiple flows and paths to
    real time data. In this draft we discuss \n   the motivation for needing such
    a standardized protocol to encourage \n   further discussion on the requirement
    for a multi-path transport \n   protocol. \n\t "

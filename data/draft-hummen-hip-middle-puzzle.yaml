  content: "   The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a secure signaling protocol\n
    \  with a cryptographic namespace.  It provides the communicating peers\n   with
    a cryptographic puzzle mechanism to protect against Denial of\n   Service (DoS)
    attacks exploiting the computation and memory overheads\n   of the protocol exchange.
    \ This document specifies an extension of\n   the protocol that enables an on-path
    network entity to assist in the\n   choice of the puzzle difficulty in case of
    an attack.  Furthermore,\n   it defines a modification of the puzzle mechanism
    that enables a host\n   to delegate puzzle solving to an on-path network entity.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Forwarded email often becomes unauthenticated because it breaks SPF\n
    \  (RFC7208) authentication and DKIM (RFC6376) authentication.  For\n   example
    mailing-lists distribute email to multiple recipients through\n   a separate server
    than the original sending server that breaks IP\n   based SPF authentication and
    potentially may modify the message that\n   breaks the DKIM signature.  This document
    calls for using ARC\n   (RFC8617) to identify and authenticate forwarded emails
    by further\n   specifying the naming of the two digital signatures present in
    ARC\n   headers- the message signature and the seal.  Because this uses ARC\n
    \  digital signature, the receiver has confidence that a valid signature\n   corresponding
    to some forwarder only could have been generated by the\n   named domain.  This
    document also specifies that all forwarded mail\n   flows have associated ARC
    headers and the means to characterize the\n   mail flows.\n\n\t "

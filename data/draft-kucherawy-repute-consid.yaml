  content: "   Reputation services offer quality assessments about likely future\n
    \  behavior, based on past behaviors.  The use of these services has\n   become
    a common tool in many applications that seek to apply\n   collected intelligence
    about traffic sources.  Often this is done\n   because it is common or even expected
    operator practice.  It is\n   therefore important to be aware of a number of considerations
    for\n   both operators and consumers of the data.  This document includes a\n
    \  collection of the best advice available regarding providers and\n   consumers
    of reputation data, based on experience to date.  Much of\n   this is based on
    experience with email reputation systems, but the\n   concepts are generally applicable.\n\n\t "

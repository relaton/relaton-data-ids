  content: "   RFC4090 documents facility backup FRR in MPLS-TE networks.  This\n
    \  document describes methods that allow the Point of Local Repair (PLR)\n   to
    find a path with sufficient available bandwidth to accommodate\n   protected traffic,
    while not making undesired reservations that would\n   require additional capacity.
    \ Below aspects are covered:\n\n   *  Automatic determination of bypass required
    bandwidth by the PLR\n\n   *  Calculation of path based on this information using
    constrained\n      shortest path algorithm (CSPF)\n\n   *  Determination of RSVP
    SENDER-TSPEC rate value for bypass tunnel\n      signaling\n\n\t "

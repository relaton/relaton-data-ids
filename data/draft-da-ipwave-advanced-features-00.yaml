  content: "   For future vehicular networks, some advanced features might be needed\n
    \  to facilitate the use cases as platooning, proximity service\n   awareness,
    autonomous driving and so forth. Thus, this draft intends\n   to present two functions,
    known as vehicular grouping and\n   socialization, for enabling some future-oriented
    use cases. These two\n   functions could be built upon cross-layer identifiers,
    such as MAC,\n   IP, and ID, which also have potential to formulate more value-added\n
    \  services for future vehicular networks.\n\n\n\t "

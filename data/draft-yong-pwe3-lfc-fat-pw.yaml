- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bit rate\nflows
    (large flow) and a huge amount of very low bit rate flows\n(small flow), which
    causes uneven load balance over ECMP or LAG.\nDifferentiating large flow and small
    flow packets in IP/MPLS\nnetworks enables an enhanced ECMP transport. Enhanced
    ECMP applies\ndifferent distribution methods to large flow packets and small flow\npackets
    to improve the load balance and congestion control. This\ndraft proposes large
    flow classification scheme for flow awareness\ntransport in PSN.\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes IP-SVC that is another ATM signaling protocol for
    implementing IP protocols. IP-SVC restricts the range of signaling to an IP subnet,
    and this restriction makes the IP-SVC structure simple.  IP-SVC provides easy
    implementation of the mechanism of ARP and IP multicasting without any servers.
    \                                                      IP-SVC can not establish
    VCs across IP subnet boundaries by itself.  However, adapting CSRs (Cell Switching
    Routers) with RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol) enables end-to-end VC establishment
    across IP subnet boundaries in IP/ATM LANs based on IP-SVC.  This method also
    shows one solution of RSVP over ATM.\n\t "

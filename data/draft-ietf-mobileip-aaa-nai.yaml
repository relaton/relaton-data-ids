  content: "When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks it has to be\nreauthenticated.
    \ If the home network has multiple AAA servers the\nreauthentication request may
    not be received by the same AAAH as\nprevious authentication requests.\nIn order
    for the new AAAH to be able to forward the request to the\ncorrect HA it has to
    know the identity of the HA.  This document\ndefines an extension that enables
    the HA to pass its identity to the\nmobile node which can in turn pass it to the
    AAA server when changing\npoint of attachment.  This document specifies a NAI
    extension that\ncan carry these NAIs.\n\t "

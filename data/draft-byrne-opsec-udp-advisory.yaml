  content: "   User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is commonly used as a volumetric attack\n
    \  transport on the internet.  Some network operators experience surges\n   of
    UDP attack traffic that are multiple orders of magnitude above the\n   baseline
    traffic rate for UDP.  Application developers should be\n   advised that UDP is
    being rate-limited on a bits-per-second and\n   packet-per-second basis by network
    operators to enforce known good\n   baseline traffic levels for UDP. UDP has been
    abused to such an\n   extent that legitimate use may become collateral damage
    and\n   application and protocol developers should avoid using UDP as a\n   transport
    when possible.\n\n\n\t "

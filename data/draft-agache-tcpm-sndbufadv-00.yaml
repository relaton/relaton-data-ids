  content: "   Network operators have difficulty in understanding the end-to-end\n
    \  performance of TCP connections through their networks.  By observing\n   packets
    at different vantage points on their path and maintaining per\n   flow state,
    network operators can detect packet losses,\n   retransmission and estimate RTTs,
    among other metrics.  A key\n   information needed by networks is whether a connection
    is limited by\n   the network or by the application.  This information is very\n
    \  difficult to accurately infer by passive measurements.\n\n   We propose to
    advertise sendbuffer occupancy in TCP: each segment\n   will carry the amount
    of backlogged data present in the sender's\n   buffer.  This information allows
    networks to discern between\n   application-limited, network-limited and flow-control
    limited flows,\n   creating new avenues of network optimization.\n\n\t "

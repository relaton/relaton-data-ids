    IETF Experimentation

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document relaxes recommendations and prescriptions from RFC3168\n
    \  and RFC4774 that get in the way of experimentation with different ECN\n   strategies.
    \ First, RFC3168 and RFC4774 state that, upon the receipt\n   by an ECN-Capable
    transport of a single CE packet, the congestion\n   control algorithms followed
    at the end-systems MUST be essentially\n   the same as the congestion control
    response to a single dropped\n   packet.  This document relaxes this rule in order
    to encourage\n   experimentation with different backoff strategies.  Second, this\n
    \  document allows future IETF specifications to use the ECT(1)\n   codepoint
    in ways that are currently prohibited by RFC3168.  Third,\n   this document allows
    future IETF experiments to use the ECT(0) or\n   ECT(1) codepoint on any TCP segment.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document is intended to update the recommended set of key\n   exchange
    methods for use in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol to meet\n   evolving needs
    for stronger security.  This RFC updates [RFC4253]\n   MUST algorithms.  This
    RFC also notes that the [IANASSH] has replaced\n   [RFC4250] as the primary reference
    document for SSH Protocol Assigned\n   Numbers.\n\n   This document adds recommendations
    for adoption of Key Exchange\n   Methods which MUST, SHOULD+, SHOULD, SHOULD-,
    MAY, SHOULD NOT, and\n   MUST NOT be implemented.  New key exchange methods will
    use the SHA-2\n   family of hashes and are drawn from these from\n   [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-curves]
    and new-modp from the\n   [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-modp-dh-sha2] and gss-keyex [NEWGSSAPI].\n\n\t "

  content: "   RFC 4684 defines Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP) procedures that allow\n
    \  BGP speakers to exchange Route Target reachability information which\n   can
    be used to build a route distribution graph in order to limit the\n   propagation
    of Virtual Private Network (VPN) Network Layer\n   Reachability Information (NLRI)
    between different autonomous systems\n   or distinct clusters of the same autonomous
    system.\n\n   However, according to RFC 4684, in some scenarios, more routes will\n
    \  be sent than need to be sent.\n\n   This document extends RFC 4684. This extension
    allows a BGP speaker\n   to advertise VPN routes more precisely.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Network operators are facing the challenge of providing better\n   network
    services for users.  As the ever developing 5G and industrial\n   verticals evolve,
    more and more services that have diverse network\n   requirements such as ultra-low
    latency and high reliability are\n   emerging, and therefore differentiated service
    treatment is desired\n   by users.  However, network operators are typically unaware
    of which\n   applications are traversing their network infrastructure, which means\n
    \  that only coarse-grained services can be provided to users.  As a\n   result,
    network operators are only evolving their infrastructure to\n   be large but dumb
    pipes without corresponding revenue increases that\n   might be enabled by differentiated
    service treatment.  As network\n   technologies evolve including deployments of
    IPv6 and SRv6, the\n   programmability provided by IPv6 and SRv6 encapsulations
    can be\n   augmented by conveying application related information into the\n   network.
    \ Adding application knowledge to the network layer allows\n   applications to
    specify finer granularity requirements to the network\n   operator.\n\n   This
    document analyzes the existing problems caused by lack of\n   application awareness,
    and outlines various use cases that could\n   benefit from an Application-aware
    IPv6 Networking (APN6)\n   architecture.\n\n\n\t "

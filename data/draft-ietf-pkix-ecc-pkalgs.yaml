  content: "This document gives additional algorithms and associated ASN.1\n   identifiers
    for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) used with the\n   Internet X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Certificate and\n   Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile
    (PKIX).  The algorithms\n   and identifiers here are consistent with both ANSI
    X9.62-2005 and\n   X9.63-2001, and shall be consistent with the forthcoming revisions\n
    \  of these documents.  Consistency shall also be maintained with SEC1\n   and
    SEC2, and any revisions or successors of such documents.\n\t "

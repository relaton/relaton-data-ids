  content: "   In a mobile ad hoc network, difficulties exist in supporting address\n
    \  autoconfiguration and naming resolution due to the lack of\n   centralized
    servers.  This document presents a novel approach, called\n   Name-Based Autoconfiguration
    (NBA), which uses host names to\n   determine IP addresses and provides address
    autoconfiguration and\n   name resolution as a single protocol.\n\t "

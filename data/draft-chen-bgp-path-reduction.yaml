  content: "   In this document we present a mechanism that enhances the \"IGP-metric\n
    \  based MED\" approach so that load balancing is maintained while\n   limiting
    the number of BGP alternate paths carried in a network.  The\n   mechanism involves
    the use of a \"scale factor\" to scale down the IGP\n   metrics for the purpose
    of setting MEDs, and is thus termed \"scaled\n   IGP-metric based MED\".\n\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes the use of one bit in the DS-byte to\n   facilitate
    ECN-type control in the differentiated services\n   architecture. Specifically
    during periods of congestion along a\n   flow's path (indicated using the one-bit
    mechanism), the out-of-\n   profile packets of the flow (packets for which the
    'In profile' bit\n   is cleared) can be either delayed or dropped by the ingress
    network\n   edge routers. This scheme would allow interior routers to preserve\n
    \  their resources for processing in-profile packets during congestion\n   and
    guard against certain types of denial-of-service attacks. The\n   proposed mechanism
    could also be used to build differentiated\n   services networks with lower average
    delay, and aid the\n   implementation of congestion-based pricing schemes in such\n
    \  architectures. The mechanism interoperates well with the baseline\n   differentiated
    services architecture and can also interoperate with\n   ECN-TCP and future ECN-enabled
    transports/applications. Further, the\n   ECN-type flow control can be deployed
    within a differentiated\n   services network even if end-to-end ECN support is
    unavailable,\n   allowing a quick migration path.\n\t "

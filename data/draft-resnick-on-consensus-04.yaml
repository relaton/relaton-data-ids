- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through\n
    \  a consensus process, taking into account the different views among\n   IETF
    participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on\n   technical matters.
    \ In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run\n   by a \"majority rule\"
    philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals\n   like \"humming\" instead of
    voting.  However, more and more of our\n   actions are now indistinguishable from
    voting, and quite often we are\n   letting the majority win the day, without consideration
    of minority\n   concerns.  This document is a collection of thoughts on what rough\n
    \  consensus is, how we have gotten away from it, and the things we can\n   do
    in order to really achieve rough consensus.\n\n      Note (to be removed before
    publication): This document is quite\n      consciously being put forward as Informational.
    \ It does not\n      propose to change any IETF processes and is therefore not
    a BCP.\n      It is simply a collection of principles, hopefully around which\n
    \     the IETF can come to (at least rough) consensus.\n\n\t "

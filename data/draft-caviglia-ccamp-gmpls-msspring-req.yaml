  content: "GMPLS [1] provides ideally a robust and flexible control plane \nprotocols
    set designed for application over generalized transport \nnetwork. A typical application
    of GMPLS is, among others, the control \nof transport networks based on SDH/SONET
    [2] technology. In this \nscenario, the introduction of GMPLS based control plane
    should ensure \nsupport of and/or compatibility with the most important and widely
    \nexploited SDH/SONET features, making possible a seamless interworking \nwith
    inherent data plane requirements. In this document we focus on \none of the most
    attractive SDH/SONET protection mechanism, \nimplemented through MS-SPRing (G.841
    [3]), a widely deployed ITU \nstandard for ring-shared protection.  \n\t "

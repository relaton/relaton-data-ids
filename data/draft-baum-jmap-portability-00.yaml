  content: "   The JMAP base protocol (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile\n
    \  friendly and scalable protocol that can be used for data of any type.\n   This
    makes it a good fit for migrations or data portability use\n   cases.  However,
    due to its large set of features, it is also quite\n   complex, which makes it
    difficult to explore new application domains\n   in practice.  The goal of this
    document is to provide a simplified\n   version of JMAP for more rapid development.\n\n\t "

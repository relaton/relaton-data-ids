  content: "   Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of\n   processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission\n   capacity.  Due to these
    constraints, commonly used security protocols\n   are not easily applicable.  Nevertheless,
    an authentication and\n   authorization solution is needed to ensure the security
    of these\n   devices.\n\n   The Delegated CoAP Authorization Framework (DCAF)
    specifies how\n   resource-constrained nodes can delegate defined authentication-
    and\n   authorization-related tasks to less-constrained devices called\n   Authorization
    Managers, thus limiting the hardware requirements of\n   the security solution
    for the constrained devices.\n\n   To realize the vision of \"one Internet for
    all\", constrained devices\n   need to securely establish trust relationships
    with less constrained\n   devices.  This document lists examples for using DCAF
    with less\n   constrained devices.\n\n\t "

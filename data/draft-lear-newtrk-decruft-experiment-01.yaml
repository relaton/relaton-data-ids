  content: "   This memo documents an experiment to review and classify Proposed\n
    \  Standards as not reflecting documented practice within the world\n   today.
    \ The results identify three classes of documents marked as\n   Proposed Standards
    that should be considered for retirement in some\n   way or another.  We propose
    four options to move forward with further\n   work in this area ranging from doing
    nothing to accepting the results\n   entirely.\n\t "

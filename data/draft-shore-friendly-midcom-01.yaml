abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "While IP was designed around the notion that the network would be\ninvisible
    to the applications that run on them, an increasingly\ncomplex service environment
    along with the compartmentalization of\n'policy' into administrative domains has
    led to a proliferation of\ntypes of middleboxes for policy enforcement, and those
    middleboxes\nare interfering with applications.  Applications now need to influ-\nence
    the behavior of middleboxes, but violating network layering\nprinciples by establishing
    explicit communication channels from\napplications to network-layer middleboxes
    introduces a new set of\nproblems related to topology and discovery as well as
    consequent\nproblems that ripple out from those.  This paper is an introductory\nexamination
    of whether or not there is a better way.\n\n\n\n\t "

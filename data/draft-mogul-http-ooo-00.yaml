abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: " The introduction of persistent connections and pipelining\n        into
    HTTP has resulted in potential performance benefits,\n        but has also exposed
    the problem of head-of-line blocking.\nA simple, compatible, and optional extension
    to HTTP to\nallow a server to issue responses out of order could\nsignificantly
    reduce HOL blocking.  In this extension,\nclients add short ID fields to their
    requests, and servers\necho these IDs back in their responses.  This extension
    is\ndefined as a hop-by-hop rather than end-to-end mechanism,\nso it avoids much
    of the complexity of the end-to-end\napproach.\n\t "

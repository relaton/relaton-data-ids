  script: Latn
  content: "A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on the\nInternet
    as a means of identifying various resources, services, and\ndestinations.  However,
    a means of attaching a set of attributes or\ncharacteristics to a given resource
    identifier and subsequently\nassessing those attributes or characteristics has
    not been specified\nand deployed.\nTwo tasks are envisioned.  The first task will
    be to define a general\nresolution protocol that will translate resource identifiers
    to a\nlist of attributes.  The second task will be to define an\nadministrative
    model and update protocol that can be used to set up\nand maintain the information
    the resolution protocol accesses.\n\t "

  content: "   As LDAP is used more extensively for managing various kinds of data,\n
    \  one often encounters a need to preserve both the ordering and the\n   content
    of data, despite the inherently unordered structure of\n   entries and attribute
    values in the directory.  This document\n   describes a scheme to attach ordering
    information to attributes in a\n   directory so that the ordering may be preserved
    and propagated to\n   other LDAP applications.\n\n\t "

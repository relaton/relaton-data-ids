  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any\n
    \  path.  SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e., instructions)\n   that
    represent a source-routed policy.  The packets steered into an\n   SR Policy carry
    an ordered list of segments associated with that SR\n   Policy.  An SR Policy
    can be instantiated SR-MPLS and SRv6 data\n   planes.\n\n   In some use cases,
    an SRv6 Policy's SID list ends with the policy\n   endpoint's node SID, and the
    traffic steered (over policy) already\n   ensures that it is taken to the policy
    endpoint.  In such cases, the\n   SID list can be optimized by excluding the endpoint
    Node SID when\n   installing the policy.  This draft specifies procedures to indicate\n
    \  whether the endpoint's node SID needs to be included or excluded when\n   installing
    the SRv6 Policy.\n\n\n\t "

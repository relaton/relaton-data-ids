  content: "   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n   improvements
    in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers.\n\n   This memo suggests that the existing
    RFC 3552 threat model, while\n   important and still valid, is no longer alone
    sufficient to cater for\n   the pressing security and privacy issues seen on the
    Internet today.\n   For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against
    endpoints\n   that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not\n
    \  align with the interests of users.  While such protection is\n   difficult,
    there are some measures that can be taken and we argue\n   that investigation
    of these issues is warranted.\n\n   It is particularly important to ensure that
    as we continue to develop\n   Internet technology, non-communications security
    related threats, and\n   privacy issues, are properly understood.\n\n\t "

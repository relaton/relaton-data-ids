  content: "   The current mechanisms used by Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) to\n
    \  secure the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) relies almost solely on\n   public
    key cryptography (i.e.  Certificates and/or Cryptographically\n   Generated Addresses).
    \ While these approaches provide very strong\n   guarantees on the authenticity
    of an IP address to link layer address\n   mapping, they are computationally expensive,
    which might be a problem\n   on resource-constrained devices.\n\n   It is also
    recognized in the SEND specification that it does not\n   compensate for an insecure
    link layer; more specifically, no\n   protections are offered against spoofing,
    link disruption, or bombing\n   DoS attacks launched at the link layer.  Accordingly,
    this note\n   suggests an alternative to the current specification of SEND which\n
    \  leverage on the deemed required link layer security to secure NDP.\n   This
    technique is based on the use of a specific kind of IPv6\n   addresses, the so-called
    Link Layer Hashed Based Addresses (LL-HBA),\n   and of link layer address reachability
    tests.\n\n   When the link layer security prevents attacker to redirect frames
    at\n   the link layer layer, this technique allows to provide some level of\n
    \  security to NDP while relying solely on symmetric (i.e.,\n   computationally
    inexpensive) cryptography.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This note describes an IPv6 option intended to carry a Federated\n
    \  Identity for use in Role-Based Access Control.  Rather than identify\n   a
    person, it identifies a group of systems that the sender is a\n   member of.  Role-Based
    Access Control permits specified sets of\n   systems to communicate with other
    specified sets of systems, with the\n   intention of scalability.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes methods for performing lsp-ping traceroute\n   over
    mpls tunnels.  The techniques outlined in RFC 4379 fail to\n   perform correct
    traceroute validation and path discovery for a LSP\n   that goes over other mpls
    tunnels.  This document describes new\n   procedures that can be used in conjunction
    with the standard\n   procedures described in RFC 4379 to trace such LSPs.\n\t "

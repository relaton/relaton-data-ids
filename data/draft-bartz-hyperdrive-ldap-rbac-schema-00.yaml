  content: "    Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is an authorization strategy in\n
    \  which an entity's permission to access and manipulate targeted\n   resources
    is determined by the entity's role or function within a\n   certain organizational
    context. RBAC's principal motivation is to\n   streamline security policy administration.
    Many discrete authoriza-\n   tions can be aggregated within a defined role. One
    or many roles may\n   be assigned or attributed to individuals. This draft describes
    LDAP\n   object classes and attributes which support RBAC. Adoption of this\n
    \  schema across multiple LDAP implementations will enable RBAC intero-\n   perability
    among heterogeneous underlying directory services.\n\t "

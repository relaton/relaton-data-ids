  content: "   A BGP Flow Specification is an n-tuple consisting of several matching\n
    \  criteria that can be applied to IP traffic.  Application-aware\n   Networking
    (APN) is a framework, where APN data packets convey APN\n   attribute including
    APN ID and/or APN Parameters.  The dynamic Flow\n   Spec mechanism for APN is
    designed for the new applications of\n   traffic filtering in an APN domain as
    well as the traffic control and\n   actions at the policy enforcement points in
    this domain.  These\n   applications require coordination among the ASes within
    a service\n   provider.\n\n   This document specifies a new BGP Flow Spec Component
    Type in order\n   to support APN traffic filtering.  The match field is the APN
    ID.  It\n   also specifies traffic filtering actions to enable the creation of\n
    \  the APN ID in the outer tunnel encapsulation when matched to the\n   corresponding
    Flow Spec rules.\n\n\t "

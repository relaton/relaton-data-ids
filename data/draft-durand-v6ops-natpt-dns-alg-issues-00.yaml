- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Recent discussions on the need to translate or not between IPv4 and\nIPv6
    have brought a better understanding on the impact of tools like\nNAT-PT [NAT-PT].
    \ Several problems have been identified around the\nDNS ALG functionality.  An
    alternative solution that does not require\nthis DNS ALG for connections initiated
    by the IPv6 side has been\nproposed. This memo aims at analyzing the pros and
    cons of both\nsolutions in that case. Connections initiated by the IPv4 side would\nalways
    require the help of a DNS-ALG and thus are not covered by this\nmemo.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a scheme named network-assisted dynamic\n   adaptation
    (NADA), a novel congestion control approach for\n   interactive real-time media
    applications, such as video conferencing.\n   In the proposed scheme, the sender
    regulates its sending rate based\n   on either implicit or explicit congestion
    signaling, in a unified\n   approach. The scheme can reap the benefits of explicit
    congestion\n   notification markings from network nodes. It also maintains\n   consistent
    sender behavior in the absence of such markings, by\n   reacting to queuing delays
    instead.\n\n   We present here the overall system architecture, recommended\n
    \  behaviors at the sender and the receiver, as well as expected network\n   nodes
    operations. Results from extensive simulation studies of the\n   proposed scheme
    are available upon request.\n\n\t "

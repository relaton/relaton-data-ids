  content: "This document describes a transformation method for representing\nnon-ASCII
    characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completely\ncompatible with
    the current DNS. It is a potential candidate for an\nASCII-Compatible Encoding
    (ACE) for internationalized host names, as\ndescribed in the comparison document
    from the IETF IDN Working Group.\nThis method is based on the observation that
    many internationalized host\nname parts will have a few substrings from a small
    number of rows of the\nISO 10646 repertoire. Run-length encoding for these types
    of\nhost names will be fairly compact, and is fairly easy to describe.\n\t "

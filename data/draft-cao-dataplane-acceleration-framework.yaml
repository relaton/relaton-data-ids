  content: "   It is getting popular to running data applications over general\n   purpose
    hardware/chipsets, instead of customized and dedicated\n   hardware/chipset.  This
    way further decouples the software functions\n   from the hardware.  But moving
    data processing intensive applications\n   to general purpose hardware is still
    challenging, although the\n   industry has supplied some proprietary solutions.
    \ This document\n   discusses the problems of data plane acceleration and proposes
    its\n   framework.\n\n\t "

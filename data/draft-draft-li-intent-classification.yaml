  content: "   RFC 7575 [RFC7575] defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy\n
    \  used to operate the network.  Intent management system includes an\n   interface
    for users to input requests and an engine to translate the\n   intents into the
    network configuration and manage their lifecycle.\n   Up to now, there is no commonly
    agreed definition, interface or\n   model of intent.\n\n   This document discusses
    what intent means to different stakeholders,\n   describes different ways to classify
    intent, and an associated\n   taxonomy of this classification.\n\n\t "

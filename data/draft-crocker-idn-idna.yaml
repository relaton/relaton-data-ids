  content: "Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) use Unicode for\ndomain name, rather
    than using a subset of ASCII.  This\nincreased name space, as well the requirement
    to\nmaintain compatibility with the existing domain name\nservice means that IDNs
    must be encoded in a form that\ncan be supported without changes to any portion
    of the\nDNS that does not participate in the upgrade to IDN.\nThis specification
    defines a mechanism called IDNA for\nhandling them in a standard fashion and specifies
    an\nIDNA profile for domain names used as host references.\nIDNA allows non-ASCII
    characters to be represented using\nthe same octets used in so-called host names
    today. This\nrepresentation allows IDNs to be introduced with minimal\nchanges
    to the existing DNS infrastructure. IDNA is only\nmeant for processing domain
    names, not free text.\n\n\n\t "

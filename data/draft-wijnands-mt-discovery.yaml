  content: "Multicast Tunnels  are  built  between  Provider  Edge  (PE) routers\n
    \  to  allow multicast communication between different site's of a VPN.\n   The
    MT tunnel has a destination  MDT  group address  that  is unique\n   to the VPN.
    All routers that act as PE's and are configured for a\n   specific VPN join the
    VPN  MDT multicast  group  in the backbone of\n   the provider network to be able
    to receive each others packets. Each\n   router is  also a  sender  to  the  MDT
    group. How the forwarding of\n   the MDT packets is achieved is depending on the
    PIM mode of the  MDT\n   group.  This can be either PIM-Bidir, PIM-SM or PIM SSM.
    The proposal\n   in this document is related specifically to PIM SSM mode.\n\t "

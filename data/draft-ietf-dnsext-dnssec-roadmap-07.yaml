  content: "DNS Security (DNSSEC)technology is composed of extensions to the\nDomain
    Name System (DNS) protocol that provide data integrity and\nauthentication to
    security aware resolvers and applications through\nthe use of cryptographic digital
    signatures.  Several documents exist\nto describe these extensions and the implementation-specific
    details\nregarding specific digital signing schemes.  The interrelationship\nbetween
    these different documents is discussed here.  A brief\noverview of what to find
    in which document and author guidelines for\nwhat to include in new DNS Security
    documents, or revisions to\nexisting documents, is described.\n\t "

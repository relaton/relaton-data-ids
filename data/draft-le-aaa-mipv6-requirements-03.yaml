    IPv6 is required and needs to be developped. It analyses the\nrequirements expressed
    in RFC 2977 which was written both for MIPv4\nand MIPv6; and it finally updates
    the IPv6 requirements for the AAA\nsupport for Mobile IPv6 to reflect the latest
    modifications and\nevolution of the Mobile IP, AAA and other relevant working
    groups.\n\t "

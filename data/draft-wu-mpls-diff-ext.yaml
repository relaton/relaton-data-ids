  content: "   This document proposes updates to the current MPLS LDP and MPLS RSVP\n
    \  messages for LSP establishment in order to support Differentiated\n   Services
    (Diff-Serv) over ATM LSRs and Frame Relay LSRs.\n \n   In brief, we propose that:\n
    \n      - a set of PHBs that requires no misordering of packets in a\n      microflow
    (even if the microflow contains packets for more than\n      one PHB) be defined
    as a PHB forwarding class (PFC);\n \n      - packets that belong to the same PFC
    and the same forwarding\n      equivalence class (FEC) should be transported over
    the same ATM\n      LSP or FR LSP;\n \n      - for a given FEC, a separate ATM
    LSP or FR LSP should be\n      established for each PFC, so that multiple ATM
    or FR LSPs are\n      established in parallel for support of Diff-Serv;\n \n      -
    among the set of PHBs transported over the same ATM LSP or FR\n      LSP, the
    different PHBs' drop precedences be mapped into, and\n      enforced via, the
    layer 2 specific selective discard mechanism\n      (CLP bit with ATM, DE bit
    with FR).\n\n\t "

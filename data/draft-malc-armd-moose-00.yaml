  script: Latn
  content: "Ethernet does not scale well to large networks.  The flat MAC address\nspace,
    whilst having obvious benefits for the user and administrator,\nis the primary
    cause of this poor scalability; other recent efforts\nto improve upon Ethernet's
    scalability have addressed symptoms,\nrather than this underlying cause.  MOOSE,
    Multi-level Origin-\nOrganised Scalable Ethernet, is an Ethernet switch architecture
    that\nperforms in-place rewriting of MAC addresses in order to impose a\nhierarchy
    upon the address space without reconfiguration or\nmodification of connected devices.
    \ This removes the need for\nswitches to maintain large forwarding databases,
    is of direct use in\nimplementing improved routing, and allows for a variety of
    other\nscalability and security innovations.  MOOSE also includes a\nglobally-scalable,
    distributed and resilient protocol for the\nautomatic assignment of addresses
    to switches, and for detecting and\ncheaply resolving addressing conflicts.\n\t "

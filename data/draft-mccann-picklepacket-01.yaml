  content: "This document describes the Pickle Packet, a message that can be used\nto
    coordinate the opening of a transport connection with various\nmiddleboxes that
    may lie on the path.  It contains the DNS names of\nboth the initiator and the
    responder of the connection and some\nauthentication data.  Because the authentication
    data uses public key\ncryptography, any middlebox can independently authenticate
    the\ninitiator and make a policy decision whether to allow or deny the\nflow based
    on the DNS names.  The Pickle Packet allows for\nmiddleboxes to establish state
    such as firewall pinholes or security\nassociations that can be used to filter
    out unwanted traffic.\n\t "

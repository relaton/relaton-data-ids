  content: "   The draft describes an interface to the discovery of services on a\n
    \  bounded network segment from a building control perspective.\n   Building control
    has special boundary conditions related to: (1)\n   management of devices and
    services, (2) an installation involving\n   stand-alone networks (3) (dis)connecting
    network (from) to Internet\n   without renaming services and devices.  Roaming
    devices are not\n   considered in this version.\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion and suggestions
    for improvement are requested, and should\n   be sent to dnssd@ietf.org.\n\n\t "

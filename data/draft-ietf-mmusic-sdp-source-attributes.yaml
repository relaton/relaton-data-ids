  content: "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to describe
    attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media streams (e.g., Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a multimedia session, but does not provide
    any mechanism to describe individual media sources within a media stream.  This
    document defines a mechanism to describe RTP media sources, which are identified
    by their synchronization source (SSRC) identifiers, in SDP, to associate attributes
    with these sources, and to express relationships among sources.  It also defines
    several source-level attributes that can be used to describe properties of media
    sources. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   In current NSIS signaling, there are two main functions depending on\n
    \  Flow ID, i.e. signaling message routing, data packet classification.\n   Specifically,
    the same information carried by the MRI is also used to\n   derive the packet
    classification at NSLP layer.  This arrangement\n   assumes that identical information
    is required by the two functions\n   at two different layers, and thus has limitations.
    \ With the\n   introduction of NSIS applications in more complicated scenarios,
    such\n   assumption can no longer hold.  Therefore, keeping the dependency\n   between
    the two functions hinders the development of NSIS.  Efforts\n   have been made
    in different NSLP layer applications to extend the\n   relationship, e.g.  QoS
    NSLP.  This draft studied the possibility of\n   disjoining the information for
    the two functions.  Problems faced by\n   the current system and different remedy
    options are discussed.  With\n   these details, it is intended to help the reader
    to evaluate the\n   feasibility of redefining the packet classification information\n
    \  signaling in NSIS.\n\t "

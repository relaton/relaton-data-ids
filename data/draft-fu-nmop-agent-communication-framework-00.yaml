  content: "   As the development of large model and agent technology, it is a trend\n
    \  for multi-agent collaboration to solve complex problems.  This\n   document
    proposes an Agent Communication Framework, a multi-agent\n   communication and
    collaboration framework that facilitates the\n   coordination of heterogeneous
    multi-agents and supports intelligent\n   network operations and maintenance (AIOps).
    \ Its architecture\n   includes an AI gateway and an Agent Name Service, along
    with\n   capabilities such as monitoring and tracking, as well as security\n   protection.
    \ Agent Communication Framework provides a comprehensive\n   solution for multi-agent
    communication and collaboration, laying the\n   foundation for future interactive,
    scalable, secure, and controllable\n   multi-agent network intelligent operations
    and maintenance.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>As the development of large model and agent technology, it is a trend
    for multi-agent collaboration to solve complex problems. This document proposes
    an Agent Communication Framework, a multi-agent communication and collaboration
    framework that facilitates the coordination of heterogeneous multi-agents and
    supports intelligent network operations and maintenance (AIOps). Its architecture
    includes an AI gateway and an Agent Name Service, along with capabilities such
    as monitoring and tracking, as well as security protection. Agent Communication
    Framework provides a comprehensive solution for multi-agent communication and
    collaboration, laying the foundation for future interactive, scalable, secure,
    and controllable multi-agent network intelligent operations and maintenance.</p>"

  content: "Service establishment in the Open Grid Protocol is the process of\ncreating
    an application layer association between a client\napplication and a remote service
    responsible for managing an end\nentity's identity.  Before a service may be used,
    the requesting\nparty must present credentials, handle any per-entity authentication-\ntime
    maintenance requirements, and request capabilities the client\nintends to use.
    \ Peer hosts to be authenticated include end users and\nremote domain hosts.  Multiple
    mechanisms are defined for\nauthentication, but all authentication and service
    establishment\nrequests follow the same pattern.\n\t "

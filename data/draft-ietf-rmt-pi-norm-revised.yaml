  content: "This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative- ACKnowledgment
    (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol.  This protocol can provide
    end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP
    multicast routing and forwarding services.  NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment
    mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms
    to allow for operation with minimal a priori coordination among senders and receivers.
    \ A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol to fairly
    share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP).  It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast
    routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly
    a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers.  The protocol offers
    a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other
    higher-level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways.  The
    protocol leverages the use of FEC-based (forward error correction) repair and
    other IETF Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.  This
    document obsoletes RFC 3940. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

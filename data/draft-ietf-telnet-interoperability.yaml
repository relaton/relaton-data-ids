  content: "This document describes a method for allowing implementors to ensure that
    their implementation of the Environment option will be interoperable with as many
    other implementations as possible, by providing a set of heuristics that can be
    used to help identify which definitions for VAR and VALUE are being used by the
    other side of the connection.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.\n\t "

    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\nIn particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-\nbased management of CableHome
    compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home\nrouters.\nThis memo specifies a MIB module
    in a manner that is compliant to the\nSNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects
    is consistent with the SNMP\nframework and existing SNMP standards.\nThis memo
    is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet\nEngineering Task
    Force.  Comments are solicited and should be\naddressed to the working group's
    mailing list at ipcdn@ietf.org\nand/or the editor.\n\t "

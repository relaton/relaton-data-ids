  content: "   The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in RFC8140 may be\n
    \  usefully supplemented by other renowned figures of Internet and more\n   general
    lore.  This document extends the menagerie to the seminal\n   fable of the \"Holy
    Hand Grenade of Antioch\", as depicted in the Monty\n   Python film \"Monty Python
    and the Holy Grail\", as well as \"Spamalot\",\n   the musical inspired by the
    movie.\n\nSpamalot\n\n   The relevance of the musical \"Spamalot\" to Internet
    lore should be\n   obvious to the reader; but in case of doubt, see also Section
    1\n   (\"What is Spam*?\") of RFC2635.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "It is desirable that most of IPv6 deployment is based on Dual Stack\nIPv4
    and IPv6 nodes so that interoperability with the current IPv4\nbased Internet
    be seamless. The 6to4 transition mechanism offers a\nautomated mechanisms for
    addressing an IPv6 site as well as\ninterconnectivity with other IPv6 sites when
    no native IPv6\nconnectivity is available. DSTM provides a mechanism for dynamic\nIPv4
    address allocation to Dual Stack nodes and a mechanism to send\npackets over a
    network that only supports IPv6 routing. By combining\nthe two mechanisms we show
    how Dual Stack Intranets may be deployed\nwith minimum need for IPv4 address space
    and no native IPv6\nconnectivity.\n\t "

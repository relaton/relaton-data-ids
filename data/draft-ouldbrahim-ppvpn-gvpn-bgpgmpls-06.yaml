  content: "This draft describes a suite of port-based Provider-provisioned \n        VPN
    services called Generalized VPNs (GVPNs) that uses BGP as a \n        VPN auto-discovery
    and GMPLS as a signaling mechanism. GVPN \n        services are \"generalized\"
    as the interfaces on the customer’s \n        and provider ports could be any
    of the interfaces supported by \n        Generalized MPLS (GMPLS). GVPN services
    outlined in this \n        document are: (1) a port-based Generalized Virtual
    Private Wire \n        (GVPW) where the basic unit of service is a Label Switched
    Path\n\n        (LSP) between a pair of customer’s ports within a given VPN \n
    \       port-topology. (2) a Generalized Virtual Private Cross-connect \n        (GVPXC)
    service where the service provider network appears to \n        the customer network
    as a GMPLS-enabled Virtual Private node. A \n        GVPXC service provides flexible
    traffic engineering on the \n        client network and eliminates the need for
    n square routing \n        peering between CEs. Since GVPNs uses GMPLS as the
    signaling \n        mechanism, and since GMPLS applies to both TDM and Optical
    \n        interfaces, it results that GVPN services include Optical/TDM \n        VPNs
    (though they need not be restricted to).\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the RESTful Web Service for Whois data as\n
    \  implemented and fielded by the American Registry for Internet Numbers\n   (ARIN).
    \ ARIN calls this service Whois-RWS.\n\n   The purpose of this document is to
    facilitate discussion and serve as\n   input into a standards process in this
    area, currently being\n   discussed on the WHOIS-based Extensible Internet Registration
    Data\n   Service (WEIRDS) mailing list\n   (https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/weirds).\n\n
    \  Please excuse this very rough initial draft.  It is roughly based on\n   information
    currently published on ARIN's website.  However, future\n   revisions of this
    document are planned, including discussions on\n   lessons learned by ARIN from
    the deployment of Whois-RWS and thoughts\n   on a future, unified standard.\n\n\t "

  content: "We present TCP-over-UDP (ToU), an instance of TCP on top of UDP.  It\nprovides
    exactly the same congestion control, flow control,\nreliability, and extension
    mechanisms as offered by TCP.  It is\nintended for use in scenarios where applications
    running on two hosts\nmay not be able to establish a direct TCP connection but
    are able to\nexchange UDP packets.\n\t "

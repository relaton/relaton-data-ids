  content: "   This document specifies a means for a third-party service to prove\n
    \  and attest the association of a communications platform with a\n   particular
    user's telephone number.  This capability supports secure\n   enrollment for users
    of messaging platforms or similar real-time\n   communication applications, for
    cases where users assert telephone\n   numbers as communication identifiers, and
    interoperating platforms\n   need to verify that identifiers are being properly
    attested.  This\n   general approach can potentially work with other forms of
    Service\n   Independent Identifiers (SIIs) in the More Instant Messaging\n   Interoperability
    (MIMI) framework.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There can be M2M scenarios where responses from a server against\n
    \  requests from client are redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange\n   (with
    no response path from the server to the client) may be desired\n   to minimize
    resource consumption in constrained systems while\n   updating a bulk of resources
    simultaneously, or updating a resource\n   with a very high frequency. CoAP already
    provides Non-confirmable\n   (NON) messages that are not acknowledged by the recipient.
    However,\n   the request/response semantics still require the server to respond\n
    \  with a status code indicating \"the result of the attempt to\n   understand
    and satisfy the request\".\n\n   This specification introduces a CoAP option called
    'No-Response'.\n   Using this option the client can explicitly express to the
    server\n   its disinterest in all responses against the particular request.\n
    \  This option also provides granular control to enable expression of\n   disinterest
    to a particular class of response or a combination of\n   response-classes. The
    server MAY decide to suppress the response by\n   not transmitting it back to
    the client according to the value of No-\n   Response option in the request. This
    option may be effective for\n   both unicast and multicast requests. This document
    also discusses a\n   few exemplary applications which benefit from this option.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In TSCH mode of IEEE802.15.4, as described by [RFC8180],\n   opportunities
    for broadcasts are limited to specific times and\n   specific channels.  Nodes
    in a TSCH network typically frequently send\n   Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames to
    announce the presence of the network.\n   This document provides a mechanism by
    which small details critical\n   for new nodes (pledges) and long sleeping nodes
    may be carried within\n   the Enhanced Beacon.\n\n\t "

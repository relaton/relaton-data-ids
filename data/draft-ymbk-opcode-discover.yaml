  content: "The QUERY opcode in the DNS is designed for unicast. With the \ndevelopment
    of multicast capabilities in the DNS, it is desireable\nto have a more robust
    opcode for server interactions since a single\nrequest may result in replies from
    multiple responders. So DISCOVER\nis defined to deal with replies from multiple
    responders.\nAs such, this document extend the core DNS specifications to allow\nclients
    to have a method for coping with replies from multiple\nresponders. Use of this
    new opcode may facilitate DNS operations in\nmodern networking topologies. A prototype
    of the DISCOVER opcode\nwas developed as part of the TBDS project, funded under
    DARPA grant\nF30602-99-1-0523.\n\n\n\t "

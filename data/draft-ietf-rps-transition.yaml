  content: "The standardization of RPSL (Routing Policy Specification Language) is\nimminent,
    and there is a user community eager to make use of the power-\nful features it
    offers in the Routing Registry (IRR). Thus, a plan of\naction is needed to assure
    a successful transition from the RIPE-181\nlanguage currently employed to describe
    routing policies in the IRR to\nthe more expressive RPSL.  This document describes
    such a plan, which\nthe authors believe can be used to bring about a successful
    transition\nin a timely fashion with a minimum of disruption to the IRR and its
    cur-\nrent role in Internet routing.  This document will be modified to\nreflect
    the progress of the transition if appropriate.\n\t "

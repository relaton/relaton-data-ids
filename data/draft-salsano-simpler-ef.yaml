- language: en

  content: "This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification to RFC\n2598.
    As explained in [CHA], the primary motivation is that the\ndefinition of EF PHB
    given in RFC 2598 does not match the intuition\nof the EF PHB, and has been determined
    to be unimplementable in a\nmanner compliant with the definition.\n\n[CHA] gives
    a new rigorous definition of EF PHB, using a recurrence\nequation that determines
    a bound for time at the which a packet must\nexit the node, given that the arriving
    times and the exit times of\nall packets are recorded.\n\n\t "

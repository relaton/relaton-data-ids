abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies FAF (Foundational AI-context Format), a YAML-
    based format for representing software project context in a form consumable by
    AI development tools. FAF provides a standardized mechanism for sharing project
    architecture, conventions, dependencies, and goals across heterogeneous AI agents,
    addressing context fragmentation in multi-agent development environments. FAF
    is registered with IANA as "application/vnd.faf+yaml" (October 2025). This document
    seeks registration as "application/faf+yaml".</p>

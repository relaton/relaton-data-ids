  content: "   This document specifies FAF (Foundational AI-context Format), a YAML-\n
    \  based format for representing software project context in a form\n   consumable
    by AI development tools.  FAF provides a standardized\n   mechanism for sharing
    project architecture, conventions,\n   dependencies, and goals across heterogeneous
    AI agents, addressing\n   context fragmentation in multi-agent development environments.\n\n
    \  FAF is registered with IANA as \"application/vnd.faf+yaml\" (October\n   2025).
    \ This document seeks registration as \"application/faf+yaml\".\n\n\t "

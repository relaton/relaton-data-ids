  content: "Application-level gateways are used on networks to provide controlled
    access to the Internet.  Clients in those networks must be configured with the
    name or address of available proxy servers, the list of local domain names, and
    other proxy client configuration information before they can access the Internet.
    \ The defacto method of proxy client configuration is the download of a script
    or configuration file named by a URL.  This document describes a DHCP option in
    which to transmit this URL to a proxy client.\n\t "

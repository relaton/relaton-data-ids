  content: "   For existing MPLS LSP tunnel services, it is hard for LSP tunnels to\n
    \  be booked in advance.  In addition, once an LSP tunnel is set up, it\n   is
    assumed to consume a certain amount of resources such as link\n   bandwidth forever.\n\n
    \  Temporal LSP tunnel services (TTS) provides an easy way for us to\n   book
    temporal LSP tunnels in advance.  More importantly, a temporal\n   LSP is an LSP
    with one or more time intervals and it is assumed to\n   consume the resources
    and carry traffic only in these time intervals.\n\n   This document specifies
    a framework for temporal LSP tunnel services\n   and provides a few of reference
    models along with logical components\n   required to design a solution for TTS.\n\n\t "

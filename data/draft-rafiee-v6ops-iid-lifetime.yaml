  content: "   This document introduces a framework, i.e., an application layer\n
    \  based lifetime [applicationiid] to enable applications maintaining\n   their
    users' privacy as well as controlling the number of Interface\n   IDs (IIDs) per
    network adapter. It will also explain different\n   approaches that can be used
    for maintaining the lifetime of an IID.\n   We also compare this framework to
    the other available mechanisms.\n   This document also explains when to remove
    deprecated IP addresses\n   from the a network interface.\n\n\n\n\t "

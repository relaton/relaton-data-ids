  content: "This document discusses the architecture of mobile SCTP (mSCTP) for \n
    \   IP mobility support. The SCTP is the third transport layer protocol \n    next
    to TCP/UDP. It can also be used for IP mobility from the multi-\n    homing features.
    The SCTP with the ADDIP extension (or mSCTP) would \n    provide seamless or soft
    handover for the mobile host without support \n    of routers or agents in the
    networks. For location management, the \n    mSCTP could be used along with Mobile
    IP, Session Initiation Protocol \n    or Reliable Server Pooling.\n\t "

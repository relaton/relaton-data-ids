  content: "   Overlay routing technologies (a.k.a. peer-to-peer technologies) have\n
    \  been introduced to various distributed systems, such as content\n   delivery
    networks and live media streaming systems.  However, these\n   systems cannot
    always utilize optimal network resources from the\n   viewpoint of layer 3 network
    providers and operators of layer 3\n   network providers have difficulties in
    controlling and optimizing the\n   traffic of these systems because these systems
    construct their own\n   networks (i.e., overlay networks) over the layer 3 network
    without\n   taking into account layer 3 network's routing policies.  The ALTO\n
    \  Working Group has worked on application-layer traffic optimization to\n   fill
    the gaps in routing policies between the layer 3 network and\n   overlay networks
    by providing the underlay network topology and cost\n   information to applications
    that build overlay networks.  However,\n   since ASes are operated under different
    policies and cost metrics for\n   application-layer traffic optimization are assumed
    to be autonomously\n   configured by each AS, there are considerations in applying\n
    \  application-layer traffic optimization techniques to cross-domain\n   (inter-AS)
    traffic.  This document summarizes general problems with\n   cross-domain traffic
    of overlay networks and considerations on the\n   AS-level application-layer traffic
    optimization from the viewpoint of\n   inter-AS economics.  This document also
    discusses the conceivable\n   approaches to solve the problems and considerations.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Upon establishing a new link-layer connection, a host may or may not
    \n   have valid IP configuration for Internet Connectivity. A host may \n   determine
    whether its IP configuration is valid by checking Network \n   Layer link change.
    With the information gathered, a host may decide \n   if their own configuration
    needs to be updated and initiate a new \n   configuration in case of link change.
    This procedure is described as \n   Detecting Network Attachment. \n\t "

  content: "Routers are increasingly connected to a variety of smart modems.\nSuch
    a modem's incoming and outgoing link rates can be varied over\ntime with adaptive
    coding and modulation to suit the channel\ncharacteristics.  The link rate and
    conditions offered by the modem\nto connected devices therefore vary.  For connected
    devices to\ncondition traffic and get the most out of the modem's link capacity,\nthey
    need to know the modem's link conditions.  This document\ndescribes one simple
    method for the modem to advertise link rate and\nother characteristics, via UDP
    messages, and discusses alternative\napproaches to communicating this information.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the changes required to make it possible for\n
    \  working group chairs to update the I-D tracker during document\n   shepherding,
    after the request for publication.  It also describes\n   additional requirements
    for the chairs to use the I-D tracker for\n   managing WG documents from their
    earliest stages.  Having the tracker\n   support the working groups more fully
    is a primary benefit, but in\n   addition, this moves towards the goal of providing
    an integrated view\n   of document states from -00 to RFC publication.\n\t "

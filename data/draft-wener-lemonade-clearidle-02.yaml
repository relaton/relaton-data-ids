  content: "   The IMAPRev4 specification supports unsolicited responses being sent\n
    \  to a client at any time. The IDLE specification defines a way for a \n   client
    to sit in an idle connection waiting to receive these \n   responses. This document
    clarifies and extends the set of responses \n   that a client may receive while
    in the idle state. The desire is to \n   allow a client to predict exactly what
    set of unsolicited responses \n   it can rely on receiving when listening on an
    idle connection.\n\t "

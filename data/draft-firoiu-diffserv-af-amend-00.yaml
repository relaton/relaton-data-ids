  content: "   This note was motivated by the ongoing discussion in the\n   Differentiated
    Services Working Group regarding the definition of\n   the Assured Forwarding
    (AF) Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) Group. We\n   consider two issues with the current
    proposal for AF PHB Group in\n   [Heinanen]: the recommendation for AF discard
    mechanism, and the\n   definition of AF classes.  We discuss the implications
    of the\n   definitions and recommendations that have raised comments and\n   propose
    alternative texts.\n\n\t "

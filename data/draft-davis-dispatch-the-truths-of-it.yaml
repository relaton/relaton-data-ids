  content: "   The internet and information technology landscape has changed in many\n
    \  ways since The Twelve Networking Truths was original published via\n   [RFC1925]
    over twenty six years ago.  As a result this document\n   attempts to extend the
    truths of information technology into the\n   twenty-first century.  This memo
    does not specify a standard, except\n   in the sense that all standards MUST implicitly
    follow the\n   fundamental truths.\n\n\t "

  content: "While there is substantial community interest in next-generation\nmultipath-capable
    Internet transports, evolutionary pressures have\ngradually eroded the simplicity
    of the Internet's original transport\narchitecture to a point where it is no longer
    realistically\napplicable to new tranports.  This document proposes a new\narchitectural
    framework for next-generation multipath-capable\ntransport protocols, focusing
    immediately on multipath TCP but taking\ncare to allow for generalization to other
    multipath-capable\ntransports.  The architecture places emphasis on enabling new\nmultipath
    features in a safe, TCP-friendly, and backward-compatible\nfashion, retaining
    full interoperability with both existing\napplications and existing network infrastructure,
    and enabling reuse\nof existing protocols as much as possible while providing
    incremental\ndeployment paths to new, more powerful and/or more efficient\nprotocols.
    \ The architecture re-establishes the long-lost principles\nof end-to-end reliability
    and fate sharing, in the presence of\nexisting and future network middleboxes,
    and enables the deployment\nof transport-neutral end-to-end protection without
    interfering with\nthese policy-enforcing or performance-enhancing middleboxes.
    \ This\ndocument describes architecture goals, a layering model supporting\nthese
    goals, abstract properties of the interfaces between the\narchitecture's new layers,
    general approaches to multipath congestion\ncontrol and how they fit into the
    architecture, realistic protocol\ndesign and incremental deployment paths, and
    ways in which this\ndocument complements and relates to ongoing protocol design\nactivities
    in the IETF.\n\t "

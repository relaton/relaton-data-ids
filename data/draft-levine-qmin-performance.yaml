  content: "   QNAME minimization improves DNS privacy by truncating query names\n
    \  sent to authoritative name servers.  While it works well when there\n   is
    a zone cut between each label in a name, when a zone includes more\n   than one
    level of labels, it can cause multiple redundant queries to\n   the same server,
    significantly increasing the load on that server\n   without additional privacy
    benefits.  This document describes some\n   situations where minimization causes
    load problems and potential ways\n   to fix the problem,\n\n\t "

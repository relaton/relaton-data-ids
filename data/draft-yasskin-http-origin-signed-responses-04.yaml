  content: "   This document specifies how a server can send an HTTP request/\n   response
    pair, known as an exchange, with signatures that vouch for\n   that exchange's
    authenticity.  These signatures can be verified\n   against an origin's certificate
    to establish that the exchange is\n   authoritative for an origin even if it was
    transferred over a\n   connection that isn't.  The signatures can also be used
    in other ways\n   described in the appendices.\n\n   These signatures contain
    countermeasures against downgrade and\n   protocol-confusion attacks.\n\n\t "

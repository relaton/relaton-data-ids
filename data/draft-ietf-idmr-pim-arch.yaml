  content: "Traditional multicast  routing  mechanisms  (e.g.  DVMRP  and\n   MOSPF
    \ [1][2])  were intended for use within regions where groups are\n   widely represented
    or bandwidth is universally plentiful. When  group\n   members, and senders to
    those group members, are distributed\n   sparsely across a wide area, these schemes
    are not  efficient;  data\n   packets  or  membership report information are periodically
    sent over\n   many links that do  not lead to receivers or  senders,  respectively.\n
    \  This  characteristic  lead  the  Internet  community  to  investigate\n   multicast
    \  routing   architectures   that   efficiently    establish\n   distribution
    \ trees across wide-area internets, where many groups are\n   sparsely represented
    and where bandwidth is not  uniformly  plentiful\n   due   to   the  distances
    \ and  multiple  administrations  traversed.\n   Efficiency is evaluated  in  terms
    \ of  the  state,  control  message\n   processing,  and  data  packet  processing
    required across the entire\n   network in order to deliver data packets to the
    members of the group.\n\t "

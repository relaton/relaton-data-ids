- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "We propose a Proactive Approach for Detecting Network Attachment \n(DNA).
    In the approach, the mobile node caches information about \nadjacent access points
    and access routers using the Candidate Access \nRouter Protocol and uses the cached
    information to check the new \nsubnet after the mobile node establishes a new
    air link. This enables \nthe mobile node to determine immediately after the new
    link setup \nwhether the mobile node needs to proceed further for new IP \nconfiguration
    for the link. \n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces an Semantic Routing (SR) Architecture for\n
    \  enabling intelligent, semantic-driven communication among AI Agents.\n   Unlike
    traditional IP-based routing or service mesh approaches, SRA\n   leverages application-layer
    semantics — including service identity,\n   intent vectors, and trust scores —
    to guide routing decisions\n   dynamically.  The architecture supports intent-driven
    task\n   collaboration, trust-aware policy enforcement, and adaptive routing\n
    \  for multi-agent environments.  SRA enables the network to evolve from\n   a
    passive transport layer to an intelligent collaboration substrate\n   supporting
    multi-agent coordination and cognitive networking.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes how to layer [CMP] over [HTTP]. A simple method\nfor
    doing so is described in section 5.4 of [CMP], but that method does \nnot accommodate
    a polling mechanism, which may be required in some \nenvironments. This document
    specifies an alternative method which uses \nthe polling protocol defined in section
    5.2 of [CMP]. A new Content-Type \nfor messages is also defined.\n\n\t "

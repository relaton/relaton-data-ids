  content: "The IPsec Architecture [RFC2401] and IPsec transform RFCs [RFC2402, RFC2406]
    define certain mechanisms for protecting IP traffic. One of the mechanisms defined
    is replay attack protection. But this mechanism is not addressed in multisender
    environment where multiple senders are sending packets for same destination SA
    (This includes sharing of SA as well as multicast). This document reviews the
    issues in multisender environment and addresses solution for this by identifying
    the sending SA and having replay attack protection against each sending SA. The
    documents also summarizes the changes needed in AH, ESP, Key management protocols,
    which would enable IPSec to protect against replay attack protection in multisender
    environment for same destination SA.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "TCP's intertwined error and congestion control is not robust against\nspurious
    timeouts nor is it robust against packet re-orderings. A\npacket that is delayed
    in the network beyond the expiration of TCP's\nretransmission timer, is mistaken
    for a packet loss by a TCP sender.\nAlso, a packet that is re-ordered in the network
    beyond TCP's\nduplicate acknowledgment threshold, is eventually mistaken for a\npacket
    loss by a TCP sender. Both situations lead to a spurious\nretransmit of the oldest
    outstanding segment, and an unnecessary\nreduction of the congestion window at
    the sender. Moreover, a\nspurious timeout forces the sender into a go-back-N retransmission\nmode
    leading to spurious retransmits of all outstanding segments.\n\t "

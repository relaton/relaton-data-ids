  content: "The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login
    and other secure network services over an insecure network.  This document describes
    the SSH authentication protocol framework and public key, password, and host-based
    client authentication methods.  Additional authentication methods are described
    in separate documents.  The SSH authentication protocol runs on top of the SSH
    transport layer protocol and provides a single authenticated tunnel for the SSH
    connection protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

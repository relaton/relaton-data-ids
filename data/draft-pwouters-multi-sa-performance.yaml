  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines two Notification Payloads for the Internet Key\n
    \  Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2): NUM_QUEUES and QUEUE_INFO.\n   These payloads
    add support for indicating that the negotiating of\n   multiple identical Child
    SAs are to be used to optimize performance\n   based on the number of queues or
    CPUs, or to create multiple Child\n   SAs for different Quality of Service (QoS)
    levels.  It indicates that\n   a newer idetnical Child SA should not be interpreted
    as a replacement\n   Child SA.\n\n   Using multiple identical Child Sa's has the
    benefit that each stream\n   has its own Sequence Number, ensuring that CPU's
    don't have to\n   synchronize their crypto state or disable their packet replay\n
    \  detection.\n\n\t "

  content: "There is an strong demand from IP network operators to obtain a\nmethod
    to control the network resource and enhance network\nperformance. The answer for
    this is Traffic Engineering. It is\nderived through the effort in MPLS wg. But
    current, the concept of\nTraffic Engineering seems to be limited to a few keywords,
    namely\nload balancing and restoration.\nThe aim of this document is to enhance
    the concept of traffic\nengineering and point out some aspects of what it is capable
    of. The\ngoal of this document is accomplished if this document could\nenlighten
    the perspective of IP Traffic Engineering and show a\npossible direction. \n\n\t "

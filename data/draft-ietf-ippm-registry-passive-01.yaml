  content: "   This document specifies the Passive Performance Metrics sub-registry\n
    \  of the Performance Metric Registry.  This sub-registry contains\n   Passive
    Performance Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs\n   prepared in the IP Performance
    Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the\n   IETF, and possibly applicable to other
    IETF metrics.\n\n   This document specifies a way to organize registry entries
    into\n   columns that are well-defined, permitting consistent development of\n
    \  entries over time (a column may be marked NA if it is not applicable\n   for
    that metric).  The design is intended to foster development of\n   registry entries
    based on existing reference RFCs, whilst each column\n   serves as a check-list
    item to avoid omissions during the\n   registration process.  Every entry in the
    registry, before IANA\n   action, requires Expert review as defined by concurrent
    IETF work in\n   progress \"Registry for Performance Metrics\" (draft-ietf-ippm-metric-\n
    \  registry).\n\n   The document contains example entries for the Passive Performance\n
    \  Metrics sub-registry: a registry entry for a passive metric based on\n   octetTotalCount
    as defined in RFC5102 and a protocol specific passive\n   metric based on RTP
    packets lost as defined in RFC3550.  The examples\n   are for Informational purposes
    and do not create any entry in the\n   IANA registry.\n\n\n\t "

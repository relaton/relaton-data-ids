  content: "   Current IKEv2 protocol has been designed to establish VPNs with the\n
    \  same outer IP addresses as those used for the IKEv2 channel.  This\n   describes
    the alternate outer IP address extension, and IKEv2\n   extension that enables
    the VPN End User to negotiate a VPN on\n   different interfaces as those used
    for the IKEv2 channel.\n\n   Thus, this extension makes possible a VPN End User
    with multiple\n   interfaces to set an IPsec tunnel on each interface with a Security\n
    \  Gateway by using a single IKEv2 channel instead of using an IKEv2\n   channel
    per interface.  Similarly, for distributed Security Gateways,\n   it also makes
    possible to split the IKEv2 and IPsec traffic on\n   different interfaces.\n\n\t "

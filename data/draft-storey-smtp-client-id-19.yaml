  content: "   Multi-Factor Authentication has rapidly become a driving requirement\n
    \  for any internet based technology that requires authentication.\n   While a
    large number of initiatives are active for providing\n   solutions to this requirement
    for Web Browser based applications that\n   can generally support real time human
    interaction for providing a\n   secondary method of identification, legacy protocols
    such as SMTP\n   authentication have not yet been revised to provide such support\n
    \  despite being a high-risk target for business email compromise,\n   possibly
    as a result of authenticated SMTP activity generally\n   expecting to be non-interactive
    in nature outside of Webmail logins.\n\n   This document defines an extension
    to the SMTP service protocol\n   called \"CLIENTID\" that a SMTP client can provide
    an additional unique\n   identification token prior to standard credentials authentication\n
    \  that the server may then apply as an identify verification method in\n   a
    similar manner to other Multi-Factor authentication techniques.\n\n\t "

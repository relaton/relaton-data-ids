  content: "   This document describes another way to set up a PW between two ASs
    \n   in the scenario of directly connected ASBR between the two ASs. \n   The
    Single-Segment PW or PW Segment of a MS-PW setup between two \n   directly connected
    ASBRs dose not need PSN tunnel, so as to provide\n   a more simple way to set
    up inter-as PW. In the scenario described \n   in this draft, MP-EBGP can also
    be used to signal the mapping of PW,\n   then no other protocols are existed between
    the two ASBRs.\n\n\t "

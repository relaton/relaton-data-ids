- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memorandum discusses the issues and options involved in the design
    of a new transport protocol for multiplexed voice within a single packet. The
    intended application is the interconnection of devices which provide 'trunking'
    or long distance telephone service over the Internet.  Such devices have many
    voice connections simultaneously between them.  Multiplexing them into the same
    connection improves on  the efficiency, enables the use of low bitrate voice codecs,
    \ and  improves scalability.  Options and issues concerning timestamping,  payload
    type identification, length indication,  and channel identification are discussed.
    Several possible header formats are identified, and their efficiencies are compared.
    \                                                This document  is a product of
    the Audio-Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force.
    \ Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing
    list at rem-conf@es.net and/or to the author(s).\n\t "

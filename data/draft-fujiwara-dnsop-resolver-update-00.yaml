  content: "   Parent side NS RRSet and glue records are all information to access\n
    \  servers for child zone.  However, they may be overwritten by child\n   zone
    data (zone apex NS RRSet and other A/AAAA RRSets).  The\n   overwrite makes name
    resolution unstable and induces vulnerabilities.\n   RFC 2181 section 5.4.1 specifies
    trustworthiness of DNS data.  And it\n   is deemed that that all cached data (authoritative
    data, non-\n   authoritative data, referrals and glue records) are merged into
    one.\n   Resolvers may answer non-authoritative data, referrals and glue\n   records
    that should not be returned.  This document proposes updating\n   resolver algorithm
    that separates the cache to \"authoritative data\n   cache\" and \"delegation
    cache\".  The former is used to answer stub\n   resolvers, and the latter is used
    to iterate zones.\n\n\t "

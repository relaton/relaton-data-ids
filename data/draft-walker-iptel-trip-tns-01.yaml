  script: Latn
  content: "Conventional telephony signalling commonly uses E.164 addresses to \nroute
    calls to their destination.  However, selection of the \nsignalling and media
    paths can be influenced by other \nconsiderations.  Some such considerations may
    be user specified,  \nand may differ from that which the network operator would
    normally \nchoose.  In some cases, support for such user-specified options may
    \nbe required by national regulation.  The choice of Transit Network \n(e.g. selection
    of long distance carrier) is such a case. \n \n   This draft describes three ways
    that a Transit Network Selection (or \n   TNS) mechanism can be added to the TRIP
    protocol.\n\t "

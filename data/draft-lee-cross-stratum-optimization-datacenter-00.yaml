  content: "Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such as \nvideo
    gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers used \nto provide application
    services are distributed geographically around \na network, many decisions made
    in the control and management of \napplication services, such as where to instantiate
    another service \ninstance or to which data center out of several a new client
    is \nassigned, can have a significant impact on the state of the network. \nConversely
    the capabilities and state of the network can have a major \nimpact on application
    performance.  \n\nCurrently application decisions are made with very little or
    no \ninformation concerning the underlying network used to deliver those \nservices.
    Hence such decisions may be sub-optimal from both \napplication and network resource
    utilization and quality of service \nobjectives. This document proposes a research
    program into cross \nstratum application/network optimization focusing on the
    challenges \nand opportunities presented by data center based applications and
    \ncarriers networks.\n\t "

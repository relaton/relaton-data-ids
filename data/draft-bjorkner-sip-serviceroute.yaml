- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a SIP header extension to allow for a UAC or \noutbound
    proxy to determine a request path through an initial set of \ndownstream SIP proxies,
    i.e. a loose route mechanism. This is useful \nin scenarios of distributed service
    execution if for example a UA is \nlocated in a visited network and want have
    originating services \nexecuted in the user's home network. \nThis solution is
    also applicable in the scenarios required by 3GPP \nin conjunction with the proposed
    path header.  \n\n\t "

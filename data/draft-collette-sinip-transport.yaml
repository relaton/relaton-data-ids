abstract:
- content: "<p>SIN/IP is a secure, multiplexed transport protocol designed for kernel
    residency and incremental deployment. It provides authenticated encryption (AEAD),
    multiplexed streams over a single connection to avoid head-of-line blocking, connection
    IDs for NAT rebinding and path migration, and pluggable congestion control and
    pacing. SIN/IP can run as a native IP protocol in controlled networks or be encapsulated
    in UDP for Internet deployment. This document specifies the wire format, packet
    and frame layout, connection establishment, packet protection, loss recovery,
    flow control, congestion control, path management, and connection termination.
    It also defines IANA registries for SIN/IP parameters and codepoints.</p>"

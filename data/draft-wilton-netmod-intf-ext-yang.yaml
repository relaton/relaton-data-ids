  content: "   This document defines two YANG modules that augment the Interfaces\n
    \  data model defined in the \"YANG Data Model for Interface Management\"\n   with
    additional configuration and operational data nodes to support\n   common lower
    layer interface properties, such as interface MTU.\n   These properties are common
    to many types of interfaces on network\n   routers and switches and are implemented
    by multiple network\n   equipment vendors with similar semantics, even though
    some of the\n   features are not formally defined in any published standard.\n\n\t "

  content: "Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) has been proposed to overcome the\ndeployment
    limitations of PIM-SM such as handling of well-known\nsources, access control,
    and address allocation. However, current\nSSM work seems to neglect some other
    deployment issues such as the\nconstruction of the shortest path tree especially
    in inter-domain. \nThe routing table entries for constructing SSM tree proportionally\nincrease
    depending on the number of sources and groups.\n\t "

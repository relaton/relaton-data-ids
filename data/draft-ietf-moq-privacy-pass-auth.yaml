abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of Privacy Pass architecture and issuance
    protocols for authorization in Media over QUIC (MoQ) transport protocol. It defines
    how Privacy Pass tokens can be integrated with MoQ's authorization framework to
    provide privacy- preserving authentication for subscriptions, fetches, publications,
    and relay operations while supporting fine-grained access control through prefix-based
    track namespace and track name matching rules. Issues and PRs can be made against
    https://github.com/suhasHere/moq- privacy-pass.</p>"

  content: "   The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol\n   specification
    supports two transport modes: UDP for very infrequent\n   messaging, and TCP for
    all other cases.  However, with TCP comes\n   certain undesirable features, e.g.,
    head of line blocking, which\n   affect performance when a number of sessions
    are multiplexed over the\n   same TCP connection.  In certain environments and
    deployment\n   scenarios, an unreliable, but still congestion controlled, transport\n
    \  would be needed.  This specification proposes DCCP as a transport\n   protocol
    for GIST.\n\n\t "

  content: "IEEE1394 bus is a link layer network with isochronous transfer mode\ncapability.
    \ Therefore it is quite natural that there appears\nfollowing demands.  (1)Transmit
    specific IP flow through a certain\nisochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus.  (2)Transmit
    specific AV flow\n(such as MPEG2-TS with CIP header[61883]) through a certain\nisochronous
    channel of IEEE1394 bus (and control these flows by IP\napplications).  To realize
    these, this draft proposes the protocol\nwith following features.  (1)Notify the
    relation between channel ID\nand IP flow.  (2)Notify the bandwidth of the isochronous\nchannel.
    (3)Notify the direction of the IP flow transmitted through\nthe channel.  (4)Notify
    the attribute of the flow. This protocol is\ndefined as the extension of MCAP
    (Multicast Channel Allocation\nProtocol).\n\n\t "

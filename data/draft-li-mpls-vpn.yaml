  content: "This document describes a proposed architecture for the construction\n
    \  of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  This proposal differs from [1]\n   and
    [2] in that the functionality of the VPN is shared by the\n   Customer Premises
    Equipment (CPE).  Multi-Protocol Label Switching\n   (MPLS) is used as a tunneling
    mechanism across the ISP network.\n\t "

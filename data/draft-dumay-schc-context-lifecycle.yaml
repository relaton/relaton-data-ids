  content: "   Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework\n
    \  provides both a header compression mechanism and an optional\n   fragmentation
    mechanism.\n\n   SCHC operation is based on a common static Context stored at
    the two\n   (or more) ends of a communication.  As the scope of SCHC becomes\n
    \  broader, the static Context needs to evolve towards a more dynamic\n   Context.\n\n
    \  This purpose of this document is to initiate a discussion on the\n   lifecycle
    of a Context.  It describes the main steps in the lifecycle\n   of a SCHC Context,
    and more broadly, it aims at documenting the\n   related Requirements and Terminology
    for the proper use of SCHC.\n   These goals are in line with the Working Group's
    objectives, as set\n   out in the Charter:\n\n   *  \"Produce an informational
    document describing how a carried\n      protocol can use SCHC\",\n\n   *  \"Produce
    Standard Track documents for SCHC Rule Discovery and\n      Parameter Negotiation\",\n\n
    \  *  \"Produce Standard Track documents for SCHC Rule Provisioning\".\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies the changes that need to be made to the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to support SIPP hosts, and describes how a
    host makes use of this protocol and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Router
    Discovery messages to form locally and globally routable address sequences automatically.
    \ The changes to DHCP are intended to be minimal and compatible with existing
    BOOTP and DHCP clients.  Modifications include a new message format and updated
    operation definitions.  Communication between a SIPP client and server is made
    significantly simpler since relay agent functionality is not required.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "\n   Mobility and multi-homing protocols enable multi-addressed nodes
    to\n   redirect ongoing communication sessions from one IP address to\n   another.
    \ Most of these protocols verify a multi-addressed node's\n   reachability at
    a claimed new IP address in order to prevent\n   redirection-based flooding attacks.
    \ In view of reduced protocol\n   latencies, such verification is preferably performed
    concurrently,\n   i.e., while packets are already being sent to the new IP address.\n
    \  This document defines Credit-Based Authorization, a technique that\n   facilitates
    concurrent reachability verification without compromise\n   of security.\n\n\n\t "

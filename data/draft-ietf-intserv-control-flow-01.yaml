  content: "Controlled-Load Service provides data flows with an enhanced quality\n
    \  of service, in the form of low packet delay and a low probability of\n   packet
    loss even under congestion.  A network element providing\n   Controlled-Load Service
    can use an admission control algorithm to\n   limit the number of data flows receiving
    the service.  In this\n   document we describe an admission control algorithm
    for Controlled-\n   Load Service.  This algorithm is not intended for IETF    standardization.
    \ Rather, it is presented for informational purposes\n   only.\n \n   We also
    present a reference implementation framework for the\n   measurement-based admission
    control algorithm.  Our implementation\n   separates the measurement from the
    actual admission control decision\n   to provide the flexibility of using different
    algorithms in bandwidth\n   estimation and admission control.\n\t "

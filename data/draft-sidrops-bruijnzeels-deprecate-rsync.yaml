  content: "   This document formulates a plan of a phased transition to a state\n
    \  where RPKI repositories and Relying Party software performing RPKI\n   Validation
    will use the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP)\n   [RFC8182] as the only mandatory
    to implement access protocol.\n\n   In short this plan consists of the following
    phases.\n\n   In phase 0, today's deployment, RRDP is supported by most, but not\n
    \  all Repositories, and most but not all RP software.\n\n   In the proposed phase
    1 RRDP will become mandatory to implement for\n   Repositories, in addition to
    rsync.  This phase can start as soon as\n   this document is published.\n\n   Once
    the proposed updates are implemented by all Repositories phase 2\n   will start.
    \ In this phase RRDP will become mandatory to implement\n   for all RP software,
    and rsync must no longer be used.\n\n   Measurements will need to be done to help
    determine when it will be\n   safe to transition to the final phase of this plan.
    \ During this\n   phase Repositories will no longer be required to provide rsync
    access\n   for RPKI validation purposes.  However, they may still provide rsync\n
    \  access for direct access to files for other purposes, if desired, at\n   a
    best effort basis.\n\n   Although this document currently includes descriptions
    and updates to\n   RFCs for each of these phases, we may find that it will be
    beneficial\n   to have separate documents for the plan, and each phase, so that
    it\n   might be more clear to all when the updates to RFCs take effect.\n\n\t "

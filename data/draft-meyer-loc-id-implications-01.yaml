  content: "   Recent work on Locator/ID Separation has focused primarily on the\n
    \  control plane protocols concerned with finding Identifier-to-Locator    mappings.
    \ However, experience gained with a trial deployment of a\n   system designed
    to implement Locator/ID Separation has revealed two\n   general classes of problems
    which must be resolved after the mapping\n   is found: The Locator Path Liveness
    Problem and the State\n   Synchronization Problem.  These problems have implications
    for the\n   data plane as well as the control plane.\n\t "

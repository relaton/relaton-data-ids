abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   *This version of the document is aimed to be a base reference point\n
    \  to compare against to see how YANG Push Lite compares to the two core\n   RFCs
    [RFC8639] & [RFC8641] that it is based on.  The next draft\n   revision would
    serve as a better starting point to see the proposed\n   protocol & data model
    for YANG Push Lite.*\n\n   YANG Push Lite is a simplified specification of YANG
    Push,\n   specifically optimized for observability of operational data.\n\n   This
    early draft proposes some enhancements to YANG-Push to optimize\n   its behavior
    for operational data telemetry.  It also lists some\n   additional issues that
    could potentially be discussed if there is\n   further interest in this work,
    in particular whether we should be\n   attempting extensions to YANG-Push (as
    this document is currently\n   framed) or instead should attempt to define a new
    'YANG-Push lite'.\n\n\t "

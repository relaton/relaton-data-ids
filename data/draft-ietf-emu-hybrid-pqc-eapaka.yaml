  script: Latn
  content: "   Forward Secrecy for the Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for\n
    \  Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA' FS) is specified in\n   [RFC9678],
    providing updates to [RFC9048] with an optional extension\n   that offers ephemeral
    key exchange using the traditional Ephemeral\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    (ECDHE) key agreement algorithm for\n   achieving perfect forward secrecy (PFS).
    \ However, it is susceptible\n   to future threats from Cryptographically Relevant
    Quantum Computers,\n   which could potentially compromise a traditional ephemeral
    public\n   key.  If the adversary has also obtained knowledge of the long-term\n
    \  key and ephemeral public key, it could compromise session keys\n   generated
    as part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.\n\n   This draft aims to enhance
    the security of EAP-AKA' FS protocol by\n   leveraging PQ/T Hybrid [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology]\n
    \  algorithms to make it quantum-safe.\n\n\t "

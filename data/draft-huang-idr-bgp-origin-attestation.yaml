abstract:
- content: '<p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provides a framework
    for Route Origin Validation (ROV), but its deployment faces two critical challenges:
    1) high false positive rates for "invalid" states and the operational burden these
    create; 2) incremental deployment has been hindered by limited immediate value
    when ROA coverage is incomplete and ROV deployment remains sparse. This document
    proposes a paradigm shift from reactive ROV validation to proactive origin attestation.
    We introduce two complementary mechanisms: 1) "Pre-validation before propagation"
    where routers validate self-originated routes against local RPKI Verified ROA
    Payload (VRP) cache before advertisement, holding invalid routes for operator
    intervention; and 2) A BGP extension that carries cryptographically signed origin
    attestation in BGP UPDATE messages. Unlike traditional ROV which only validates
    against outband RPKI- based ROAs, this approach enables originating ASes to actively
    attest to the legitimacy of their routes. This provides immediate security benefits
    even with partial deployment: each deploying AS gains stronger protection for
    its own prefixes, and downstream ASes receive clearer signals to distinguish legitimate
    routes from potential hijacks. The mechanisms dramatically reduce false positives
    while creating a deployable path toward comprehensive route origin security.</p>'

  script: Latn
  content: "   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provides a framework\n
    \  for Route Origin Validation (ROV), but its deployment faces two\n   critical
    challenges: 1) high false positive rates for \"invalid\"\n   states and the operational
    burden these create; 2) incremental\n   deployment has been hindered by limited
    immediate value when ROA\n   coverage is incomplete and ROV deployment remains
    sparse.\n\n   This document proposes a paradigm shift from reactive ROV validation\n
    \  to proactive origin attestation.  We introduce two complementary\n   mechanisms:
    1) \"Pre-validation before propagation\" where routers\n   validate self-originated
    routes against local RPKI Verified ROA\n   Payload (VRP) cache before advertisement,
    holding invalid routes for\n   operator intervention; and 2) A BGP extension that
    carries\n   cryptographically signed origin attestation in BGP UPDATE messages.\n\n
    \  Unlike traditional ROV which only validates against outband RPKI-\n   based
    ROAs, this approach enables originating ASes to actively attest\n   to the legitimacy
    of their routes.  This provides immediate security\n   benefits even with partial
    deployment: each deploying AS gains\n   stronger protection for its own prefixes,
    and downstream ASes receive\n   clearer signals to distinguish legitimate routes
    from potential\n   hijacks.  The mechanisms dramatically reduce false positives
    while\n   creating a deployable path toward comprehensive route origin\n   security.\n\n\t "

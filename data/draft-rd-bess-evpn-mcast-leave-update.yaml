  content: "   The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener\n
    \  Discovery (MLD) Proxies for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) specification\n   describes
    the procedures to synchronize IGMP/MLD membership report\n   and leave group states
    in all the PEs that are attached to the same\n   Ethernet Segment.  In particular,
    the Multicast Leave Synch route\n   described in the same specification, synchronizes
    the leave\n   procedures on all the members of the Ethernet Segment, for a\n   multicast
    group and for an amount of time (the Maximum Response\n   Time).  The use of the
    Maximum Response Time may be different\n   depending on whether the local state
    was created by IGMPv2, IGMPv3 or\n   MLDv2.  In addition, the Maximum Response
    Time advertised in the\n   Multicast Leave Synch route needs to account for the
    time that it\n   takes for the route to be propagated in the network, which might
    not\n   be easy to predict.  This document clarifies the use of the Maximum\n
    \  Response Time and updates the procedures for the Multicast Leave\n   Synch
    route.\n\n\t "

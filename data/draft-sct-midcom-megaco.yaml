- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft discusses the applicability of the Megaco/H.248 device  \ncontrol
    protocol [1] as the Middlebox communication protocol. It  \ndiscusses the architectural
    similarities between Megaco and Midcom  \nand how Megaco meets most of the key
    requirements for the Midcom  \nprotocol. Modeling the underlying Middlebox resources
    (such as,  \nfilters, policy rules etc) as separate elements from the Megaco  \nentities
    allows the usage of the protocol as-is, satisfying some of  \nthe resource access
    control requirements. Minimal extensions in the  \nform of new Termination/Package
    definition (without impacting the  \nbase protocol) are sought for Midcom. The
    Midcom protocol profile  \nand other extensions/packages will be specified in
    a separate  \ninternet draft.\n\t "

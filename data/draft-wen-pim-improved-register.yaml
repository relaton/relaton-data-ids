  content: "   In [PIM-SM], Register procedure needs to be triggered by multicast\n
    \  packets in the data-plane/forwarding-plane. The dependences of the\n   control-plane
    on the data-plane/forwarding-plane to build control-\n   plane state does not
    scale well. And also the encapsulation at the\n   Designated Router and decapsulation
    at the Rendezvous Point are \n   relatively expensive operations for routers.
    To solve the above-\n   mentioned problems, this document proposes new mechanisms
    to make a\n   clear separation of the control-plane and the data-plane/fowarding-\n
    \  plane for PIM register procedure.\n\n\t "

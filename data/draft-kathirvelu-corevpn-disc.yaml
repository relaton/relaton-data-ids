  content: "An IPVPN consists of many routers, some  physically  discrete  and\nsome
    \ virtual,  housed in a Provider Edge router. The problem that\npresents itself
    is that these virtual routers need  to  find  each\nother  over  a  virtual  topology
    \ and they need to send broadcast\ndatagrams as mandated in routing protocols
    [such as  the  neighbor\ndiscovery  datagram  and  routing  updates  in  OSPF,
    \ the routing\nupdates in RIPV2 etc] and user data over  this  virtual  topology.\nThis
    memo presents an approach for solving these problems\n\t "

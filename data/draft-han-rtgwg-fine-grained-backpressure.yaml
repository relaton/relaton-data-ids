- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a fine-grained flow control backpressure\n
    \  mechanism for Wide Area Networks (WANs). The mechanism enables\n   precise
    congestion notification and flow control at tenant or task\n   granularity through
    extended network protocols and controller-\n   assisted path discovery. It addresses
    the limitations of traditional\n   flow control mechanisms in WAN environments
    by providing intelligent\n   backpressure with detailed congestion information,
    with specific\n   applicability in SRv6-based networks.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a fine-grained flow control backpressure mechanism
    for Wide Area Networks (WANs). The mechanism enables precise congestion notification
    and flow control at tenant or task granularity through extended network protocols
    and controller- assisted path discovery. It addresses the limitations of traditional
    flow control mechanisms in WAN environments by providing intelligent backpressure
    with detailed congestion information, with specific applicability in SRv6-based
    networks.</p>"

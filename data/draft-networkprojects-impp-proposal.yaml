  content: "There is a growing number of people, on the Internet and elsewhere,\nthat
    are interested in knowing when others are available, in order to\ncommunicate
    with them. A system that provides this information is\nknown as Presence Service.\nInstant
    Messaging is the ability to communicate with someone in a\nrapid, conversational
    fashion. This usually involves short text\nmessages, but it may be extended in
    different ways.\nThis draft is a response to the efforts of the Instant Messaging
    and\nPresence Protocol (IMPP) group. It describes an architecture and\nprotocols
    for Presence and Instant Messaging that meet the\nrequirements of [RFC 2779].
    This draft covers the basic functional\nmodules needed to provide Presence and
    Instant Messaging services. It\nalso provides the semantics for the interactions
    among this set of\nfunctional modules, along with the data format of the information\nexchanged.\n\t "

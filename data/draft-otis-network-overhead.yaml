  content: "System performance is often limited by an integrated device \ninterconnect.
    \ Process differences between logic and memory keep \nlarge-scale memory interconnects
    critical as Moore's Law surpasses \nthe rate of packaging reductions.  Two areas
    are related to memory \ninterconnect performance when handling network messaging:
    \n- Logic and memory state context switching \n- Reassembly of partial messages
    with bifurcation of payload\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There exists a class of modems that wish to support the Dynamic Link\n
    \  Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] but do not present a single Layer\n   2
    network domain as required by DLEP.  Such devices may be:\n\n   o  Modems that
    maintain a varying link to some upstream backbone\n      network infrastructure,
    where the ability to announce link state\n      and DLEP metrics is desired, but
    the concept of a DLEP destination\n      router for the backbone does not apply.
    \ Examples of such devices\n      can include LTE modems, IEEE 802.11 stations
    not in ad-hoc mode,\n      and some satellite terminals.\n\n   o  Modems that
    provide Layer 3 wide area network connectivity between\n      devices, where individual
    DLEP destinations do exist, but are not\n      directly reachable by MAC address.\n\n
    \  This document introduces an optional extension to the core DLEP\n   specification,
    allowing DLEP to be used between routers and modems\n   that operate in this way.\n\n
    \  Note:\n\n   o  This document is intended as an extension to the core DLEP\n
    \     specification, and readers are expected to be fully conversant\n      with
    the operation of core DLEP.\n\n\t "

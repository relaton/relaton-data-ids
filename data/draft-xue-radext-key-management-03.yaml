  content: "   When a mobile device (referred to as Station (STA)) tries to connect\n
    \  to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), it needs to first perform\n   mutual
    authentication with the EAP server of the network.  As a\n   result of successful
    authentication, a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will\n   be generated, and distributed
    to the STA and the Authenticator of the\n   network by the EAP server respectively.
    \ The PMK is used for securing\n   the subsequent communications between the STA
    and the Wireless\n   Termination Point (WTP) it attaches to.  In practice, the\n
    \  authenticator may not be deployed on the WTP.  In this case, an\n   approach
    is required to help the WTP to obtain the PMK.  This work\n   tries to discuss
    the issues related with this topic and proposes a\n   RADIUS extension to address
    the problem.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines a list of operational security requirements for
    the infrastructure of large Internet Service Provider (ISP) IP networks (routers
    and switches).  A framework is defined for specifying \"profiles\", which are
    collections of requirements applicable to certain network topology contexts (all,
    core-only, edge-only...).  The goal is to provide network operators a clear, concise
    way of communicating their security requirements to vendors.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

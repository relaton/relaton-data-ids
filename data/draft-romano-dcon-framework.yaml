  content: "   This document defines the framework for Distributed Conferencing\n
    \  (DCON).  The framework draws inspiration from the work carried out in\n   the
    XCON working group, which has defined a complete architecture for\n   centralized
    conferencing.  DCON is based on the idea that a\n   distributed conference can
    be setup by appropriately orchestrating\n   the operation of a number of XCON
    focus elements, each in charge of\n   managing a certain number of participants.
    \ Interaction between each\n   participant and the corresponding conference focus
    is based on the\n   standard XCON framework, whereas inter-focus interaction is
    defined\n   in this document.\n\n\t "

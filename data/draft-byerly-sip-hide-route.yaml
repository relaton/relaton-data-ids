  content: "This document describes a proposed extension to SIP.\nThis document proposes
    a mechansim to encrypt/hide Record-Route and\nRoute entries in or to support confidentiality
    of SIP proxy\nrouting information.  The functionality of the Record-Route and\nRoute
    headers are preserved.\nThe introduction of this extension allows a set of\ntrusted
    SIP proxies to cooperatively hide the route that\nSIP PDUs transit from untrusted
    proxies and user agents.\n\t "

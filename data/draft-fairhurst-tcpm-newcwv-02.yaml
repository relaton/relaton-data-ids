abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used to support\n
    \  variable-rate traffic that exhibts periods where the transmission\n   rate
    is limited by the application rather than the congestion window.\n   It updates
    TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following\n   either an idle or applications-limited
    interval.  The method is\n   expected to benefit variable-rate TCP applications,
    while also\n   providing an appropriate response if congestion is experienced.\n\n
    \  The document also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation (CWV),\n   an
    IETF experimental specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes\n   that CWV
    sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a\n   widely used solution.
    \ This document recommends that the IETF should\n   consider moving RFC 2861 from
    Experimental to Historic status, and\n   that this is replaced by the current
    specification.\n\n\t "

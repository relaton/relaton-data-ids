  content: "Seeking entries from a directory is a process involving network \nresources.
    It is assumed that a directory is accessed for reading and \nsearching data more
    than for modification purposes. Under such \nassumptions, for performance reasons,
    a mechanism for caching as a \nproxy  which caches all entries is desirable. This
    document describes\na mechanism for caching directory entries. \nThis document
    also defines one operational attribute and two controls\nrequired to be implemented
    for the caching model.\n\t "

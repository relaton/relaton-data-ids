  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular,
    it defines objects for managing version 2 of the Open Shortest Path First Routing
    Protocol. Version 2 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv4 address family.
    Version 3 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv6 address family.\n\n This
    memo obsoletes RFC 1850; however, it is designed to be backwards compatible. The
    functional differences between this memo and RFC 1850 are explained in Appendix
    B. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   TLS and increasingly also DTLS are frequently used to provide channel\n
    \  security for Internet of Things (IoT) communication.  On the Web and\n   smart
    phones, TLS is already the defacto approach for securing\n   protocol interactions.
    \ While the end-to-end security offered by TLS,\n   particularly TLS 1.3, is already
    too much for some, there are others\n   who believe that TLS is insufficient.
    \ While the former group is\n   working on ways to weaken TLS security, the latter
    group is\n   interested in designing an application layer security solution.\n
    \  Whether application-layer security is used in addition to or as a\n   substitute
    for transport-layer security is of secondary importance.\n   However, the security
    needs for such an application layer solution\n   are similar, if not identical,
    to those that drove the design of TLS.\n   This is for an obvious reason: Security
    requirements are not tied to\n   the name of a security protocol nor to the layer
    at which it is\n   executed.  One can make this observation also in other areas,
    such as\n   with the increasing similarity of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and
    the\n   TLS handshake protocols.\n\n   These discussions within the IETF inspired
    the document authors to\n   explore whether TLS could actually be used also at
    the application\n   layer and how complex it would be.  We call this approach
    \"Layered\n   TLS\" since TLS may, in some scenarios, be executed at two layers:\n
    \  above the transport layer in the traditional manner and also at the\n   application
    layer.\n\n\t "

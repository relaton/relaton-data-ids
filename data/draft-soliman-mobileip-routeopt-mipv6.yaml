- language: en

  content: "This draft describes a simple mechanism that allows a MN to\nestablish
    a security association with a CN to enable it to send\nBinding Updates in a secure
    manner as required by MIPv6. The proposed\nmechanism makes use of the AAA infrastructure
    and is only intended\nfor securing network signalling data (e.g. BU's from MN)
    but not\ntraffic. It should be noted that the use of this mechanism need not\nbe
    limited to MIPv6 BUs and may be utilised to allow any two nodes to\nsetupa security
    asociation using the AAA infrastructure.\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes, based on the experience of MIS (Mobile Internet\nServices,
    Inc.) for commercial mobile IP service over IEEE 802.11b\nbased wireless LAN environment,
    how smooth handover between access\npoints is implemented.\nThe major obstacle
    for the smooth handover is time required to scan\nfrequency bands and latency
    of mobile registration is not so much a\nproblem, both of which is solved with
    terminals having two\ntransceivers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Cache-Control general-header field of HTTP/1.1 [1] is used to \n
    \  specify directives that must be obeyed by all caching mechanisms \n   along
    the request/response chain. This document details an extension \n   to the cache-control
    header to enable caching of resources for \n   dynamic sets of users who are grouped
    under certain attributes. Also \n   this document specifies user-defined header
    extensions of HTTP/1.1 \n   [1], which allow these clients to be served from the
    group caches. \n\t "

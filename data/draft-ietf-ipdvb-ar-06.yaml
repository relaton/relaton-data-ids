  content: "This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6 addresses
    with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is known as Address Resolution
    (AR) or Neighbor Discovery (ND). Such address resolution complements the higher-layer
    resource discovery tools that are used to advertise IP sessions.\n\n In MPEG-2
    Networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) value and a
    specific Transmission Multiplex. This document reviews current methods appropriate
    to a range of technologies (such as DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting), ATSC (Advanced
    Television Systems Committee), DOCSIS (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications),
    and variants). It also describes the interaction with well-known protocols for
    address management including DHCP, ARP, and the ND protocol. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

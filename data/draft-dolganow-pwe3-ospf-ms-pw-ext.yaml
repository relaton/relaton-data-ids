abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Multi-segment pseudowires have been defined to enable emulated layer\n
    \  1 and layer 2 services to be delivered from an IP based packet    switched
    network over a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels and PW control \n   protocol sessions.
    \ MS-PWs can be used to scale PW based networks  \n\n   over both a single AS,
    or between multiple ASs, and there is a \n   particular need to be able to dynamically
    route MS-PWs through a \n   given AS to reach PEs at or beyond the edge of the
    AS, where the \n   route of the PW through each AS needs to be automatically determined.
    \n\n   This draft proposes extensions to OSPF to enable the automatic \n   advertisement
    of summarized PW FECs, thus enabling the dynamic \n   routing of MS-PWs across
    an OSPF domain. \n\t "

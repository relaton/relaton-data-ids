  content: "   Secure Mime (S/MIME) defined a method of placing security labels on
    a\n   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) object.  These labels are placed\n   as
    part of the data signed and validated by the parties.  This means\n   that the
    message content is visible to the recipient prior to the\n   label enforcement.
    \ In [EPS-WS-TRUST] a new model has been presented\n   where a third party is
    used as the enforcement point of the label.\n   This document provides the details
    needed to implement the new Plasma\n   model in the CMS infrastructure.\n\n   Additional
    benefits of using the Plasma module include moving\n   responsibility of building
    lock boxes to the server and determining,\n   based on policy, who should be a
    message recipient.\n\n   The document describes and details how the encryption
    process is\n   performed, defines a new lock box attribute to hold the information\n
    \  needed to valid the label and to obtain the keys needed to decrypt\n   the
    message.  The document does not cover the protocol between the\n   client and
    the Plasma policy enforcement server.\n\n\t "

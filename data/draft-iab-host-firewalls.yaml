  content: "In today's Internet, the need for firewalls is generally accepted in the
    industry, and indeed firewalls are widely deployed in practice.  Unlike traditional
    firewalls that protect network links, host firewalls run in end-user systems.
    \ Often the result is that software may be running and potentially consuming resources,
    but then communication is blocked by a host firewall.  It's taken for granted
    that this end state is either desirable or the best that can be achieved in practice,
    rather than (for example) an end state where the relevant software is not running
    or is running in a way that would not result in unwanted communication.  In this
    document, we explore the issues behind these assumptions and provide suggestions
    on improving the architecture going forward.\n\t "

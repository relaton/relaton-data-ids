  content: "   This document introduces the concept of a SCHClet: a modular sub-\n
    \  function within the SCHC (Static Context Header Compression)\n   framework.
    \ Inspired by chiplet architectures in hardware design, a\n   SCHClet encapsulates
    a specific SCHC function—such as compression,\n   fragmentation, or acknowledgments—as
    a self-contained unit.  This\n   modularization enables tailored implementations
    that avoid the\n   overhead of deploying a full SCHC stack.\n\n   By decomposing
    SCHC functionality into SCHClets, the framework\n   becomes more adaptable, extensible,
    and suitable for a wider range of\n   network environments—including, but not
    limited to, constrained\n   networks.  A system using SCHClets remains compliant
    with the SCHC\n   framework and can interoperate with a full SCHC implementation,\n
    \  provided compatible configuration parameters are used.\n\n   Each SCHClet is
    defined by the SCHC Profiles and configuration\n   parameters necessary for interoperability.
    \ It operates within a\n   single Stratum and a single SCHC Instance.  For example,
    a device may\n   implement only the NoAck fragmentation mode as a standalone SCHClet,\n
    \  potentially with fixed parameters.  This modular approach simplifies\n   development,
    reduces resource demands, and provides a framework for\n   future extensibility
    of the SCHC architecture.\n\n\t "

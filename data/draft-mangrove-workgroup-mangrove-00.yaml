  content: "This document describes a novel system called Mangrove for obtaining global
    visibility across the Internet. It achieves this through constructing a comprehensive,
    unified representation of the Internet's topology and routing behavior by aggregating
    and indexing diverse data sources. he core challenge is obtaining an accurate,
    up-to-date model of how packets traverse the global Internet given the Internet's
    vast scale, dynamic nature, and fragmented visibility across multiple organizations
    collecting data in different formats.\n\nMangrove addresses this by leveraging
    the hierarchical structure and natural abstractions of Internet architecture.
    It collects and integrates data from traceroute measurements, BGP routing tables,
    IP allocation records, and active broadband measurements. This multi-source data
    is partitioned and indexed across multiple granularity levels - geographic regions,
    autonomous systems, and IP prefixes - allowing effective storage, querying, and
    scalable processing.\n\nMangrove constructs a unified topology and routing representation
    augmented with an extensible ruleset derived from Internet axioms and measured
    data. For arbitrary source-destination pairs, it computes estimated packet paths
    and associated performance metrics at the highest feasible granularity level based
    on available information completeness. The system handles real-time Internet dynamics
    through incremental rule refinement using detected changes in routing data and
    measurements. This enables timely updates to the topology model without full recomputation.
    Mangrove aims to provide researchers and operators an unprecedented unified Internet
    view for analysis, optimization, planning, security, and regulatory tasks.\n\t "

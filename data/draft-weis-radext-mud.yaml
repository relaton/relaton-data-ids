  content: "   A Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a file describing the\n   expected
    use of a class of devices, usually an Internet of Things\n   class of devices.
    \ It is prepared by a manufacturer and placed on a\n   generally available web
    server, and is addressable via a Uniform\n   Resource Identifier (URI).  The URI
    is often included in a discovery\n   protocol (e.g., DNS, LLDP).  A Network Access
    Server (NAS) in the\n   path of the discovery protocol can collect and forward
    the URI to a\n   RADIUS server, which processes the URI.  This draft defines the\n
    \  RADIUS extension needed for the NAS to forward the URI to the RADIUS\n   server.\n\n\t "

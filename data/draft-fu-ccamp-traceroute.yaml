abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "We identify some issues for generic traceroute for tunnels (tunnel-\ntrace):
    (1) it is possible that some IP hops do not support tunneltrace, \n(2) for each
    tunnel wishing to be traced, at least the two end points \nshould support the
    tunneltrace, (3) tracing message should be able to by-pass firewalls and NATs.
    One possible solution, based on the CASP \nsignaling protocol (stateless mode),
    is proposed to support generic \nroutetracing over tunnels.\n\n\t "

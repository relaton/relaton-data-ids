  content: "   Mapping of addresses to names has been a feature of DNS.  Many sites,\n
    \  implement it, many others don't.  Some applications attempt to use it\n   as
    a part of a security strategy. The goal of this document is to\n   encourage proper
    deployment of address to name mappings, and provide\n   guidance for their use.\n\t "

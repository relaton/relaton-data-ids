- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an algorithm to generate one-time password values,
    based on Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC). A security analysis of the
    algorithm is presented, and important parameters related to the secure deployment
    of the algorithm are discussed. The proposed algorithm can be used across a wide
    range of network applications ranging from remote Virtual Private Network (VPN)
    access, Wi-Fi network logon to transaction-oriented Web applications.\n\n This
    work is a joint effort by the OATH (Open AuTHentication) membership to specify
    an algorithm that can be freely distributed to the technical community. The authors
    believe that a common and shared algorithm will facilitate adoption of two-factor
    authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability across commercial
    and open-source implementations. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

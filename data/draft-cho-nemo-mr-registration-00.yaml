  content: "   In multihomed mobile networks, multiple Mobile Routers can be \n   deployed
    to provide fault recovery or load sharing. Also, each Mobile \n   Router (MR)
    can have a bi-directional tunnel with its own Home Agent \n   (HA). In this multihomed
    mobile network scenario, the neighbor root \n   MR can replace or share the operation
    of another MR. Therefore, MRs \n   should cooperate with each other to provide
    session continuity or \n   load sharing. We present an authentication and registration
    mechanism \n   without introducing extra signaling messages. Using the Return\n
    \  Routability procedure of Mobile IPv6 and the Binding Update message  \n   with
    the neighbor MR registration option, the MR can authenticate and \n   register
    the neighbor MR to its own HA. And the HA can use this \n   registered neighbor
    MR information to provide fault recovery or load \n   sharing. \n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for \n
    \  BGP, termed \"One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter\", which \n   would
    allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh \n   request with
    a set of address-prefix-based filters to make the peer \n   re-advertise only
    the specific routes matching the filters to the \n   speaker. This ORF-type enables
    a BGP speaker to recover some \n   specific \"problematic\" routes without requiring
    its peer to re-\n   advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out of specific address family,
    which \n   makes the trouble shooting operation (such as packets tracking) more
    \n   efficient and reduces the impact on network stability. This filter \n   does
    not change the outbound route filters on BGP peers and should \n   only be used
    for one-time filtering. \n\t "

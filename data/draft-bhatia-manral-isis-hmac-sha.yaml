  content: "This document proposes an extension to IS-IS to allow the use of any \ncryptographic
    authentication algorithm in addition to the already \ndocumented authentication
    schemes, described in the base    \nspecification and RFC 3567.   \n        \nAlthough
    this document has been written specifically for using MAC \nconstruct along with
    the SHA family of cryptographic hash functions, \nthe method described in this
    document is generic and can be used to \nextend IS-IS to support any cryptographic
    hash function in the \nfuture.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a two-stage call-setup mechanism, with the\nresource
    management protocol interleaved between the two stages. The\nobjective of such
    a mechanism is to enable deployment of robust IP\nTelephony services. The first
    phase ensures that resources are made\navailable before the phone rings and the
    participants of the call\nare 'invited' to participate. The second phase involves
    the alerting\nof the user after the network resources are reserved. This draft\npresents
    the call signaling requirements that lead to this design,\nand the specific SIP
    extension of an INVITE that does not ring the\nfar-end phone.\n\t "

  content: "     Transport and application layer protocol provides end-to-end\nconnectivity
    for clients and servers, but conveys limited or even no\ninformation to a middlebox,
    such as Policy and Charging Control (PCC)\nsystem, between the client and server.
    However, PCC needs to authenticate the\nclient-server traffic so that it can perform
    the basic functionality, i.e.,\ncharging the client.\n     Due to lack of traffic
    authentication capability in transport and\napplication layer protocol, state-of-the-art
    PCC adopts Deep Packet\nInspection (DPI) to understand client-server communication
    and decide\nwhether to charge a client. However, in this draft, we show that current\ntransport
    layer protocol(TCP) and application layer(HTTP, TLS) protocol cannot\nmeet the
    need of traffic authentication, i.e., the user can modify the packet\nand by pass
    the ISP PCC to have free ride.\n     Due to the existence of the aforementioned
    free-riding attacks, we\nbelieve that Transport and application layer protocol
    needs to provide\ntraffic authentication capability to a middlebox.\n     In this
    draft, we describe free-riding attacks and present requirements\nfor providing
    traffic authentication.\n\n\n\t "

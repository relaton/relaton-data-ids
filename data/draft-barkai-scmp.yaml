  content: "With the proliferation of IP based internetworking services to mass\nbusiness
    and consumer markets carriers are faced with operational\nchallenges in an extent
    never before experienced in previous LAN MAN\nor WAN environments.  To accommodate
    these new internetworking envi-\nronments, carrier workflow management applications
    for service Ful-\nfillment, Assurance, and Billing (FAB) need to undergo major
    a tran-\nsition.  In essence applications need to transition from being per\ntechnology
    centric to being service centric, as historic correspon-\ndence between technology
    and service is no longer true. Applications\ndo not need to change in nature,
    since they still need to support\ninventory, CRM, order and other workflows.  However,
    applications\nneed to include a service centric aspect as basis for these work-\nflows.\nService
    Centric solutions can be shared by a wide range of management\nand workflow applications,
    rather than be re-invented by each one.\nService Centric Management solutions
    must be distributed in order to\ncope with the massive scale and complexity challenges
    of the underly-\ning networks.  Service Centric Management Protocol (SCMP) and
    distri-\nbution should be standardized to facilitate multi-vendor interoper-\nability
    in this emerging space, allow for potential future embedding\nwithin NE, and to
    allow for Service Centric Management primitives to\nextend across Inter Carrier
    Interfaces (ICI) and inner carrier regu-\nlatory bounds.\n\t "

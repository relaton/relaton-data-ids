  content: "   For some time, Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) have been used
    in\n   the delivery of some Internet services (e.g. delivery of websites,\n   software
    updates and video delivery) as they provide numerous\n   benefits including reduced
    delivery cost for cacheable content,\n   improved quality of experience for end
    users and increased robustness\n   of delivery.\n\n   In order to derive the optimal
    benefit from a CDN it is preferable to\n   deliver content from the servers (caches)
    that are \"closest\" to the\n   End User requesting the content, where \"closest\"
    may be as simple as\n   \"geographical or network distance\" combined with CDN
    server load\n   within a location, but may also consider other more complex\n
    \  combinations of metrics and CDN or Network Service Provider (NSP)\n   policies.\n\n
    \  There are a number of different ways in which a CDN may obtain the\n   necessary
    network topology and/or cost information to allow it to\n   serve End Users from
    the most optimal servers/locations, such as\n   static configuration, passively
    listening to routing protocols\n   directly, active probing of underlying network(s),
    or obtaining\n   topology and cost by querying an information service such as
    the ALTO\n   map & cost services.\n\n   This document describes the use cases
    for a CDN to be able to obtain\n   network topology and cost information from
    an ALTO server(s).\n\n\t "

  content: "RELOAD [1] provides successor replication of data to protect against\ndata
    loss occurring from churn on the overlay.  It specifies storing\nof two redundant
    copies of data on the two immediate successors of a\nparticular node.  This provides
    for basic replication and is highly\nessential for stability of the overlay.  However,
    it does not address\nthe problem of replication to meet the availability requirements
    for\na particular piece of data or to have the replicas be useful in some\ninherent
    load balancing on the overlay.  This document specifies a\nmechanism to provide
    application-agnostic, deterministic replication\non the overlay to meet these
    needs.\n\t "

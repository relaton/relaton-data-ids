  content: "   This document specifies VPLS extensions to support the new VLAN aware\n
    \  bundling service interface type. The new service interface type\n   provides
    advantages in reducing the provisioning overhead, as well as\n   pseudowire scalability
    in environments where a large number of VLANs\n   need to be extended over an
    MPLS/IP network while maintaining traffic\n   segregation among those VLANs.\n\n
    \  The VLAN aware bundling service interface can handle the high scale\n   requirements
    of today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs over\n   a single WAN VPLS
    instance used to interconnect sites. Furthermore,\n   this document specifies
    an extension to the LDP MAC Withdrawal\n   mechanisms to allow per-VLAN MAC flushing
    for the new service\n   interface type.\n\n\t "

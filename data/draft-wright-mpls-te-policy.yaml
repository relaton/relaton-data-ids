- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document considers the application of policy based traffic\nengineering
    techniques to load-balancing in MPLS networks. The\nobjective is not to mandate
    a specific policy, but to (a) provide an\nexample of a policy based approach to
    a traffic engineering problem\nand (b) elucidate a range of potential policies
    related to load\nbalancing as a traffic engineering objective as guidance for
    the\ndevelopment of a Policy Information Base (PIB) for MPLS networks.\n\t "

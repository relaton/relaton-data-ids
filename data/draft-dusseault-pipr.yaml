  content: "Online users have demonstrated a desire to know instantly whether\n          another
    individual is online, to be notified when another\n          individual arrives
    online, and to send instant messages.  These\n          applications currently
    use independent, non-standard and usually\n          non-interoperable protocols.
    \ The goal is to define a standard\n          protocol so that independently written
    client and server\n          implementations can participate in a global network
    of ''online''\n          users.\n \n          This draft outlines requirements
    for a Presence Information\n          Protocol to support these applications.\n

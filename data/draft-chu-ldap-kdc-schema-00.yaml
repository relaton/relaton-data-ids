  content: "This document describes an LDAP [RFC4511] schema for implementing the\nKerberos
    5 [RFC4120] KDC Information Model\n[I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kdc-model].  It also defines
    additional elements\nwhich are not covered by the Information Model, but are already
    in\ncommon use.1.  Background and Motivation\n\nBoth Kerberos and LDAP are frequently
    used separately for distributed\nauthentication.  They can also be used in combination,
    but typically\ntheir user databases remained separate.  This distinction in\ndatabases
    causes unnecessary duplication of data and administration\noverhead.  As such
    it is desirable for both systems to share a single\ndatabase.  Since the LDAP
    data model is more general it is most\nappropriate to store the Kerberos data
    in LDAP.\n\nA number of Kerberos implementations already have support for using\nLDAP
    as their KDC backing store.  However, each implementation uses\nits own schema,
    and the multiple schemas are mutually incompatible.\nFor the sake of interoperability
    and administrative ease, it is\nimportant to define a single standard schema that
    can be used\nuniformly by all Kerberos KDC implementations and interoperates with\nexisting
    LDAP specifications.2.  General Issues\n\t "

    \  and Encryption (JOSE), CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) and\n   Hybrid
    Public Key Encryption (HPKE) to protect data.  These examples\n   are meant to
    coverage the edge cases of both JOSE and COSE, including\n   different structures
    for single and multiple recipients, external\n   additional authenticated data,
    and key derivation function (KDF)\n   context binding.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft describes two generic use-cases that illustrate\n   application
    layer traffic optimization applied to high bandwidth\n   core networks.  The type
    of information and interactions needed to\n   perform various optimizations is
    described. In addition extensions\n   to the existing ALTO protocol widely applicable
    to any high\n   bandwidth applications are suggested.  These include bandwidth\n
    \  constraint representations for a diverse range of control and data\n   plane
    technologies as well as advanced filtering based on\n   constraints.\n\n\t "

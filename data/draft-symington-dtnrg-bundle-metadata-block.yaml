  content: "This document defines an extension block that may be used with the\n   Bundle
    Protocol [2] within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network\n   architecture [4].
    \ This Metadata Extension Block is designed to be\n   used to carry metadata that
    forwarding nodes can use to make routing\n   and other decisions regarding the
    bundle.  This block is defined to\n   enable the actual metadata that is inserted
    into the block to have\n   any content and format, providing the format has been
    documented as a metadata ontology.  Specific metadata ontologies may be defined
    in\n   additional documents.\n\n\t "

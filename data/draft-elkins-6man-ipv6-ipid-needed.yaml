  content: "The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IP Identification (IPID) field\nused
    for fragmentation and reassembly.  In practice, this field\nwas commonly used
    by network diagnosticians for tracking packets. In\nIPv6, the IPID has been moved
    to the Fragment header, and would only\nbe used when fragmentation is required.
    \ Thus, the IPID field in IPv6,\nis no longer able to be utilized in the valuable
    role it played in\nIPv4, relative to diagnostics and problem resolution.  This
    causes\ngreat concern in particular for end users and large enterprises, for\nwhom
    Network/Application availability and performance can directly and\nprofoundly
    affect bottom line financials. Several viable solutions to\nthis situation exist.
    One potential solution is included in later\nsections of this RFC, but the primary
    intention of this RFC is to\ninitiate action by the IETF on this issue, perhaps
    in the form of a\nWorking Group Subcommittee.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo is the specification of the code page, which was originally\n
    \  developed for the transmission of texts in the Ukrainian language\n   through
    networks, and in particular the networks, employing Unix\n   operating systems.
    It is, however, operating-system-neutral, and is\n   used in various situations,
    just as its Russian language counterpart\n   KOI-8R.\n     \n   With some minor
    exceptions, this specification can be considered\n   to be an extension of KOI8-R
    (RFC-1489). The present edition of the\n   specification is the result of the
    wide concensus reached after many\n   prolonged exchanges and discussions, which
    took place in Ukraine and\n   on some Usenet conferences covering Ukraine and
    read by the public\n   who employs the Ukrainian language.\n\t "

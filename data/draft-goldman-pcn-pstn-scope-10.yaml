  content: "The IETF PCN Working Group has continued its work investigating pre-\ncongestion
    and admission control mechanisms.  This work has\nprogressed under the current
    charter, but has not yet considered\nrelated legacy PSTN interactions or the need
    for ubiquitous\nconnectivity between users on dissimilar networks.  The PCN charter\ncould
    be improved by a strong positive statement to the effect\ncommitting to future
    work addressing legacy networks.\n\nIn that light, please consider the questions
    below which include\ndifferential PCN treatment based on traffic types, security,
    and PSTN\ninteroperability concerns.  It seems helpful to have a touchstone of\nsome
    concerns relative to the PSTN network and IP network Gateway in\norder to confirm
    that they will be addressed in future work.  This\nattempt is motivated by a desire
    to avoid the accidental omission of\na topic that may be hard to \"retrofit\"
    in later.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the Path Computation Element communication \nProtocol
    (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client \n(PCC) and a Path
    Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs. Such \ninteractions include path
    computation requests and path computation \nreplies as well as notifications of
    specific states related to the \nuse of a PCE in the context of MPLS and GMPLS
    Traffic Engineering. \nThe PCEP protocol is designed to be flexible and extensible
    so as to \neasily allow for the addition of further messages and objects, should
    \nfurther requirements be expressed in the future. \n\t "

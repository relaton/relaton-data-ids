- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The IPv6 unicast addressing format includes a separation between the\n
    \  prefix used to route packets to a subnet and the interface identifier\n   used
    to specify a given interface connected to that subnet.\n   Historically the interface
    identifier has been defined as 64 bits\n   long, leaving 64 bits for the prefix.
    \ This document discusses the\n   reasons for this fixed boundary and the issues
    involved in treating\n   it as a variable boundary.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for\nIPv4
    and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol and it is\nbased on VRRP (version
    2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and on\ndraft-ieft-vrrp-ipv6-spec-08.txt.
    \ VRRP specifies an election\nprotocol that dynamically assigns responsibility
    for a virtual router\nto one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling
    the\nIPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual router is called\nthe
    Master, and forwards packets sent to these IPv4 or IPv6\naddresses.  VRRP Master
    routers are configured with virtual IPv4 or\nIPv6 addresses and VRRP Backup routers
    infer the address family of\nthe virtual addresses being carried based on the
    transport protocol.\nWithin a VRRP router the virtual routers in each of the IPv4
    and IPv6\naddress families are a domain unto themselves and do not overlap.\nThe
    election process provides dynamic fail over in the forwarding\nresponsibility
    should the Master become unavailable.  For IPv4, the\nadvantage gained from using
    VRRP is a higher availability default\npath without requiring configuration of
    dynamic routing or router\ndiscovery protocols on every end-host.  For IPv6, the
    advantage\ngained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switch over to back up\nrouters
    than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discover\n(RFC 2461) mechanisms.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP. When MPLS labels
    \nare added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an MPLS VPN, \nthe
    packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often \nno more
    than 30 bytes, for example. Header compression can significantly \nreduce the
    overhead through various compression mechanisms, such as \nenhanced compressed
    RTP (ECRTP). We consider using MPLS to route ECRTP \ncompressed packets over an
    MPLS LSP without compression/decompression \ncycles at each router. Such an ECRTP
    over MPLS capability can increase \nthe bandwidth efficiency as well as processing
    scalability of the \nmaximum number of simultaneous compressed flows that use
    header \ncompression at each router.  In this draft we propose to use RSVP-TE
    \nextensions to signal the header compression context and other control \nmessages
    between the ingress and egress LSR.  We re-use the methods in \nECRTP to determine
    the context.\n\t "

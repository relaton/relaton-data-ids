- language: en

  content: "This document presents an alternative addressing architecture for IPv6
    which controls global routing growth with very aggressive topological aggregation.
    It also includes support for scalable multihoming as a distinguished service while
    freeing sites and service resellers from the tyranny of CIDR-based aggregation
    by providing transparent rehoming of both.\n\t "

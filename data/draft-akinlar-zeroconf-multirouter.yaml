  content: "Zero Configuration (Zeroconf) Networks are a particular class of\nTCP/IP
    networks that may be established in the home, in small offices or\neven for a
    variety of adhoc purposes. Zeroconf networks do not have and\nshould not be expected
    to have user configurable network infrastructure\nsuch as DHCP, DNS and other
    administered network services. This is\nbecause typical zeroconf network users
    neither have the skill nor the\ndesire to configure, administer or manage a network
    [1].\nThe IETF Zeroconf Requirements draft [1] presents the zeroconf\nprotocol
    requirements for 4 areas: IP host configuration, domain name to\nIP address resolution,
    IP multicast address allocation, and service\ndiscovery. This draft builds on
    [1] and lists the zeroconf protocol\nrequirements for IP router configuration
    and dynamic routing protocol in\nmulti-router zeroconf networks.\n\nThe IETF Zeroconf
    Requirements draft [1] presents the zeroconf\nprotocol requirements for 4 areas:
    IP host configuration, domain name to\nIP address resolution, IP multicast address
    allocation, and service\ndiscovery. The most complex network topology addressed
    by the Zeroconf\nRequirements document [1] is a multi-segment zeroconf network
    connected\nby a single router. This drafts builds on that draft and lists the\nzeroconf
    protocol requirements for IP router configuration and dynamic\nrouting protocols
    in multi-router zeroconf networks.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
    (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal
    mode. This highly restricts what the user can do until the user has satisfied
    the captive portal conditions.\n\n This document describes a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
    option and a Router Advertisement (RA) option to inform clients that they are
    behind some sort of captive portal enforcement device, and that they will need
    to satisfy the Captive Portal conditions to get Internet access. It is not a full
    solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with captive portals;
    it is designed to be one component of a standardized approach for hosts to interact
    with such portals. While this document defines how the network operator may convey
    the captive portal API endpoint to hosts, the specific methods of satisfying and
    interacting with the captive portal are out of scope of this document.\n\n This
    document replaces RFC 7710, which used DHCP code point 160. Due to a conflict,
    this document specifies 114. Consequently, this document also updates RFC 3679.\n\t "

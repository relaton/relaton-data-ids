  content: "The IETF specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 as protocol for network-based\nmobility
    management.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are attached\nto the network through
    Mobility Access Gateways and registered with a\nLocal Mobility Anchor.  Traffic
    from and to the mobile node traverses\nthe mobile node's Local Mobility Anchor,
    irrespective of the location\nof the mobile node's corresponding communication
    endpoint.  This\ndocument specifies a protocol extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6
    which\nallows the set up and maintenance of a localized routing path between\ntwo
    communicating mobile nodes' Mobility Access Gateways without\ntraversing the mobile
    nodes' Local Mobility Anchor(s).  The protocol\ncomponent of a rendezvous control
    point ensures stable maintenance of\nrouting states during handover in scenarios
    with multiple mobility\nanchors, where states for the two communication endpoints
    are\ndistributed between these anchors.\n\t "

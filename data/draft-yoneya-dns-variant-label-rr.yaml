  content: "   Definition and operation of variant domain names are differ from zone\n
    \  administrators, and there is no generic rules, therefore, in general,\n   it
    is hard to guess variant labels for end users and / or\n   applications.  Meanwhile,
    zone administrators are understanding all\n   variant labels list because they
    generate variant labels and activate\n   them according to rules they defined.
    \ Thus, if there is a mechanism\n   that end users and / or applications can obtain
    variant labels list\n   from zone administrators, then it would be useful.  The
    Variant\n   Labels Resource Record (VL RR) provides such variant labels list for\n
    \  that purpose.\n\n\t "

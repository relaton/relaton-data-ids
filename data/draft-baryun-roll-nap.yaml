  content: "   Some Wireless Ad hoc Networks (WANETs) like LLNs often have\n   different
    devices capabilities, with large scale deployment at\n   different regions or
    environment conditions. In that network\n   context, nodes may not be able to
    participate in certain time\n   periods because of determined conditions. The
    Node Ability of\n   Participation (NAP) protocol enhances the network use of its\n
    \  activities and capabilities. Routers and actuators in such\n   networks can
    be adaptive and efficient for different unpredicted\n   situations.\n\n\t "

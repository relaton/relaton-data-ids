  content: "In SIMPLE based presence and messaging applications, it is necessary \nfor
    \ the user to be able to configure a number of pieces of information. \nOne of
    the most common types of information is a list of URIs. List \nmanagement is useful
    outside the scope of SIMPLE as well, for instance \nin conferencing. There are
    many reasons why it would be beneficial to \nmanage the lists in a similar fashion
    regardless of the application. \nBefore the selection of the actual protocol(s)
    to manage the lists there \nis a need to describe their semantics on an abstract
    level. This \ndocument proposes the semantics for SIMPLE list manipulation protocol.

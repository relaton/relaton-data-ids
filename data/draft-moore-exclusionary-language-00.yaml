abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   It has been asserted that some language in IETF documents is\n   \"exclusionary\"
    - that it offends some readers or groups of people,\n   and/or discourages participation
    in IETF by doing so.  While there is\n   some debate about exactly which language
    is exclusionary, at least\n   some cited examples of such language can credibly
    have such effects.\n   It is believed that most instances of such language are
    accidental,\n   and that most document authors and editors wish to avoid use of\n
    \  language that may be offensive.  This memo therefore attempts to\n   establish
    procedures that warn document authors and editors about\n   language that may
    credibly having such effects, and thereby, to\n   reduce both accidental and deliberate
    use of such language.\n\n   At the same time, it is recognized that in some cases
    there an be\n   strong and conflicting opinions about whether or not particular\n
    \  language is desirable or appropriate.  IETF's primary function is\n   providing
    technical direction for the benefit of the Internet\n   community, rather than
    social engineering.  If a document can be\n   blocked or substantially delayed
    over disputes about the proprietary\n   of language in that document, this can
    be disruptive to IETF's\n   primary function.  This memo therefore makes recommendations
    to\n   prevent such disputes from blocking progress on technical documents.\n\n\t "

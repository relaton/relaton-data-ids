  content: "RObust Header Compression (ROHC), RFC 3095, defines a framework for header
    compression, along with a number of compression protocols (profiles).  One operating
    assumption for the profiles defined in RFC 3095 is that the channel between compressor
    and decompressor is required to maintain packet ordering.  This document discusses
    aspects of using ROHC over channels that can reorder packets.  It provides guidelines
    on how to implement existing profiles over such channels, as well as suggestions
    for the design of new profiles.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

  content: "The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software- Defined
    Networking (SDN) systems. It can compute optimal paths for traffic across a network
    and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands.\n\n
    PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which
    are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP).\n\n SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered
    (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of use cases
    including static LSPs, segment routing, Service Function Chaining (SFC), and most
    forms of a routed or switched network. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider
    PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be
    fully enabled as a central controller.\n\n This document briefly introduces the
    architecture for PCE as a central controller, examines the motivations and applicability
    for PCEP as a control protocol in this environment, and introduces the implications
    for the protocol. A PCE-based central controller can simplify the processing of
    a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily
    completely replacing it.\n\n This document does not describe use cases in detail
    and does not define protocol extensions: that work is left for other documents.\n\t "

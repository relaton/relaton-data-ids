abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the core behavior for Warp, a segmented live
    media transport protocol over QUIC. Media is split into segments based on the
    underlying media encoding and transmitted independently over QUIC streams. QUIC
    streams are prioritized based on the delivery order, allowing less important segments
    to be starved or dropped during congestion.</p>"

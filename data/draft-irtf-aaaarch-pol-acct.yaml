  content: "This document describes policy-based accounting which is an approach\nto
    provide flexibility to accounting architectures. Accounting\npolicies describe
    the configuration of an accounting architecture in\na standardized way. They are
    used to instrument the accounting\narchitecture and can be exchanged between AAA
    entities in order to\nshare configuration information.\nThis document describes
    building blocks and message sequences for\npolicy-based accounting in the generic
    AAA architecture [RFC2903].\nExamples are given for the usage of accounting policies
    in different\nscenarios. Furthermore it is shown how accounting components can
    be\nintegrated into the AAA authorization framework [RFC2904]. This\ndocument
    \ does not propose a language for the description of\naccounting policies. It
    is rather assumed that a suitable policy\nlanguage can be chosen from existing
    or upcoming standards.\n\n\n\t "

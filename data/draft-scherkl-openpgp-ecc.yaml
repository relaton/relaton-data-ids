- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines which algorithm specific parameters are needed\nfor
    elliptic curve cipher (ECC) and elliptic curve digital signature\nalgorithm (ECDSA)
    and how they have to be stored in openPGP packets.\nTherefore it is an supplement
    to the openPGP message format [1].\nIt also defines which checks are needed to
    validate ECC and ECDSA\nkeys and which 'top-level' operations must be performed
    for\nencryption/decryption and signing/signature verification. But it\ngives no
    advices how to implement these checks and operations, nor\nthe underlying mathematics.
    To do this, look for example at IEEE\nP1363 [2].\n\n\t "

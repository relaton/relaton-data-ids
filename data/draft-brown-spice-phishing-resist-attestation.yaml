- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft introduces a phishing-resistant phone number attestation\n
    \  mechanism for multi-factor authentication (MFA).  Conceptually\n   similar
    to WebAuthn, it uses origin-bound cryptographic challenges to\n   ensure that
    users only attest ownership of their phone numbers to\n   legitimate relying parties.
    \ The protocol leverages network-operator-\n   issued verifiable credentials (VCs)
    that cryptographically bind phone\n   number ownership to a user's device.  Applications
    present origin-\n   scoped challenges that users sign using their VC, ensuring
    secure,\n   domain-specific authentication and mitigating replay, relay, and\n
    \  phishing attacks- without relying on SMS-based one-time passwords\n   (OTPs).\n\n\t "

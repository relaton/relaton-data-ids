  content: "The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) measures unidirectional
    characteristics such as one-way delay and one-way loss.  High-precision measurement
    of these one-way IP performance metrics became possible with wider availability
    of good time sources (such as GPS and CDMA).  OWAMP enables the interoperability
    of these measurements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

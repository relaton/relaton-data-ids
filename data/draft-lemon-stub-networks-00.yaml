  content: "   This document describes a set of practices for connecting stub\n   networks
    to adjacent infrastructure networks, as well as to larger\n   network fabrics.
    \ This is applicable in cases such as constrained\n   (Internet of Things) networks
    where there is a need to provide\n   functional parity of service discovery and
    reachability between\n   devices on the stub network and devices on an adjacent
    infrastructure\n   link (for example, a home network).  The stub networks use
    case is\n   intended to fully address the need to attach a single network link
    to\n   an infrastructure network, where the attached link provides no\n   through
    routing and in cases where integration to the infrastructure\n   routing fabric
    (if any) is not available.\n\n\t "

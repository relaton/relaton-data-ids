  content: "This is a proposal of a text to include msgfmt in order to clarify the\nrelation
    between changes in the ''Message-ID'' header and other parts of\na message. This
    information is important, because many mailers use the\n''Message-ID'' to eliminate
    duplicates of the same message, and\ninformation may be lost if this is not done
    the right way.\n \nTemporary note\n \nThis document does not at this time (21
    November 1997) represent any\nconsensus opinion in the drums working group.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Policy Based Routing (PBR) is a generic term that describes functionality
    that currently exists in several routing systems where packets are routed, not
    just based on the destination address but rather based on a policy that is configured/programmed
    in the router. This document describes the information model for PBR as it exists
    in many current implementations.</p>"

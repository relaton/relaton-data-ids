  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a network diagnostic tool called PROBE.\n   PROBE
    is similar to PING in that it can be used to query the status\n   of a probed
    interface, but it differs from PING in that it does not\n   require bidirectional
    connectivity between the probing and probed\n   interfaces.  Instead, PROBE requires
    bidirectional connectivity\n   between the probing interface and a proxy interface.
    \ The proxy\n   interface can reside on the same node as the probed interface,
    or it\n   can reside on a node to which the probed interface is directly\n   connected.
    \ This document updates RFC 4884 and obsoletes RFC 8335.\n\n\t "

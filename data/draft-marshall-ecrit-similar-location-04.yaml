abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces a new way to provide returned location information
    in LoST responses that is either of a completed or similar form to the original
    input civic location, based on whether valid or invalid civic address elements
    are returned within the findServiceResponse message. This document defines a new
    extension to the findServiceResponse message within the LoST protocol [RFC5222]
    that enables the LoST protocol to return a completed civic address element set
    for a valid location response, and one or more suggested sets of similar location
    information for invalid LoST responses. These two types of civic addresses are
    referred to as either "complete location" or "similar location", and are included
    as compilation of ca type xml elements within the existing LoST findServiceResponse
    message structure.</p>

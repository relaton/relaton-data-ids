  content: "The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam\nand
    attach to different access networks without disrupting the\nongoing sessions that
    nodes of the network may have.  By extending\nthe Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile
    Routers, nodes of the network are\nnot required to support any kind of mobility,
    since packets must go\nthrough the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional
    tunnel.\nCommunications from/to a mobile network have to traverse the Home\nAgent,
    and therefore better paths may be available.  Additionally,\nthis solution adds
    packet overhead, due to the encapsulation.\n\nThis document describes an approach
    to the Route Optimisation for\nNEMO, based on the well-known concept of Correspondent
    Router.  The\nsolution aims at meeting the currently identified NEMO Route\nOptimisation
    requirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics and\nSpace Exploration.  Based
    on the ideas that have been proposed in the\npast, as well as some other extensions,
    this document describes a\nCorrespondent Router based solution, trying to identify
    the most\nimportant open issues.\n\nThe main goal of this first version of the
    document is to describe an\ninitial NEMO RO solution based on the deployment of
    Correspondent\nRouters and trigger the discussion within the MEXT WG about this
    kind\nof solution.\n\nThis document (in an appendix) also analyses how a Correspondent\nRouter
    based solution fits each of the currently identified NEMO\nRoute Optimisation
    requirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics\nand Space Exploration.\n\t "

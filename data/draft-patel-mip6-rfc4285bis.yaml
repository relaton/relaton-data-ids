  content: "IPsec is specified as the means of securing signaling messages\n   between
    the Mobile Node and Home agent for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6).\n   MIPv6 signalling messages
    that are secured include the Binding\n   Updates and Acknowledgement messages
    used for managing the bindings\n   between a Mobile Node and its Home Agent.  This
    document proposes an\n   alternate method for securing MIPv6 signaling messages
    between a\n   Mobile Nodes and Home Agents.  The alternate method defined here\n
    \  conists of a MIPv6-specific authentication option that can be added\n   to
    MIPv6 signalling messages\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Drop preference has been proposed as a possible means for providing\n
    \  differentiated services in the Internet.  Used as a parameter in a\n   PHB
    group, drop preference can provide weighted bandwidth sharing\n   amongst flows
    and flow aggregates of a PHB group.  This memo\n   documents a number of services
    which can be implemented using either\n   a single drop preference PHB setting
    or multiple drop preference\n   settings.\n\n\t "

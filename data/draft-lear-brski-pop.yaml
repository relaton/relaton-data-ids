  content: "   This memo specifies a RESTful interface for local deployments to\n
    \  demonstrate proof of possession to a device or to a manufacturer\n   authorized
    signing authority (MASA).  This covers the case where a\n   MASA would not otherwise
    have knowledge of where a device is\n   deployed, or when a MASA may not be required.
    \ Such knowledge is\n   important to onboard certain classes of devices, such
    as those on\n   IEEE 802.11 networks.\n\n\t "

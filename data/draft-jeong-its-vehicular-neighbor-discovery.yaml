- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)\n
    \  for rapid network prefix and service discovery in vehicular networks.\n   It
    is assumed that a vehicle or a Road-Side Unit (RSU) have an\n   external network
    interface and their internal network.  This document\n   defines new ND options
    to allows a vehicle to announce the network\n   prefixes and services inside its
    internal network to another vehicle\n   or RSU.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two complementary mechanisms to improve user
    experience and policy transparency in DNS-based filtering. The first mechanism
    enhances Response Policy Zone (RPZ) operation through Extended DNS Error (EDE)
    signaling. The second introduces a new URI-REDIRECT (URI-R) Resource Record to
    support secure, application-level redirection for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
    Each mechanism can operate independently or together, enabling network operators
    and resolvers to provide safer, TLS-compliant redirection for policy-enforced
    domains.</p>"

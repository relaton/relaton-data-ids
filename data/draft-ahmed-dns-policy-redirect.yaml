abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines two complementary mechanisms to improve\n   user
    experience and policy transparency in DNS-based filtering.\n   The first mechanism
    enhances Response Policy Zone (RPZ) operation\n   through Extended DNS Error (EDE)
    signaling. The second introduces\n   a new URI-REDIRECT (URI-R) Resource Record
    to support secure,\n   application-level redirection for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.\n
    \  Each mechanism can operate independently or together, enabling\n   network
    operators and resolvers to provide safer, TLS-compliant\n   redirection for policy-enforced
    domains.\n\n\t "

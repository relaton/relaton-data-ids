  content: "    ping/traceroute and other network diagnostic tools are widely used
    \n    in the IP networks to diagnose the network reachability, IP packet \n    routing
    and routing failure location. However, the existing \n    ping/traceroute tools
    are adaptable only to the pure networks where\n    the routing is based on destination
    address. When an IP packet \n    passes a certain equipment based on ACL policy
    routing, the \n    ping/traceroute packet routing MAY be different from the real
    \n    traffic flow routing. This will lead to an erroneous diagnostic \n    result.\n\t "

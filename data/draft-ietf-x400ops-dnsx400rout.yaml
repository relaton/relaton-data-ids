  content: "This memo proposes a method of storing in the Internet Domain Name System
    the routing information needed by X.400 MTAs within an X.400 MHS. Routing information
    can be managed in a distributed rather than a centralized way. MTAs located on
    Internet hosts can retrieve the routing information querying the DNS instead of
    having fixed tables which need to be centrally updated and distributed. This document
    specifies a prototype standard proposal. This memo is a joint effort of X400 operation
    working group and RARE Mail and Messaging working group.\n\t "

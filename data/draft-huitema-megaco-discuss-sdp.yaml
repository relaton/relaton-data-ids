  content: "This memo is a contribution to the ongoing debate in the Megaco working\ngroup
    on the use of SDP or H.245 to describe Termination Descriptors.\nOne of the stingy
    point in the debate has been the need, for some gate-\nways, to provide H.323
    compatible 'capability exchanges.' It has some-\ntimes been asserted that such
    exchanges would be hard to provide with an\nSDP syntax. This memo, on the contrary,
    provides a simple solution to\nthe problem, based on the following ideas:\n*    usage
    of SDP to describe termination parameters,\n*    usage of the audit procedure
    to enquire about capabilities,\n*    a syntax in the audit procedure allowing
    to return several       termination descriptors, corresponding to alternative
    capability\n     sets,\n*    an algorithm for translating a set of SDP encoded
    capability sets\n     into an H.245 capability descriptor.\n\t "

  content: "   This memo updates and replaces RFC 2140's description of\n   interdependent
    TCP control blocks, in which part of the TCP state is\n   shared among similar
    concurrent or consecutive connections. TCP\n   state includes a combination of
    parameters, such as connection\n   state, current round-trip time estimates, congestion
    control\n   information, and process information. Most of this state is\n   maintained
    on a per-connection basis in the TCP Control Block (TCB),\n   but implementations
    can (and do) share certain TCB information\n   across connections to the same
    host. Such sharing is intended to\n   improve overall transient transport performance,
    while maintaining\n   backward-compatibility with existing implementations. The
    sharing\n   described herein is limited to only the TCB initialization and so\n
    \  has no effect on the long-term behavior of TCP after a connection\n   has been
    established.\n\n\t "

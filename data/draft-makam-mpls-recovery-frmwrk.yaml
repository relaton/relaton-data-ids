  content: "Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) [1] integrates the label\nswapping
    forwarding paradigm with network layer routing. To deliver\nreliable service,
    MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide\nprotection of the traffic carried
    on different paths. This requires\nthat the label switched routers (LSRs) support
    fault detection,\nfault notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that
    MPLS\nsignaling [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] support the configuration of recovery.\nWith
    these objectives in mind, this document specifies a framework\nfor MPLS based
    recovery.\n\n\t "

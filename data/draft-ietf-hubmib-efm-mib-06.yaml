  content: "This document defines objects for managing Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) capabilities on Ethernet-like interfaces conformant to the
    Ethernet OAM functionality defined in the Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) clauses
    of the Ethernet standards.  The Ethernet OAM functionality is complementary to
    the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in that it is focused on a small
    set of link-specific functions for directly connected Ethernet interfaces.  This
    document defines objects for controlling those link OAM functions and for providing
    results and status of the OAM functions to management entities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "   This document describes a proposed public interface through which an\n
    \  application, such as a network management console, interacts with an\n   Asynchronous
    Management Protocol (AMP) Manager via a database\n   supporting the Structured
    Query Language (SQL).  The use of SQL as an\n   interfacing layer provides a natural
    way to describe interactions\n   with an AMP Manager independent of a particular
    implementation of\n   either the Manager or the application.  Specifically, this
    document\n   presents a database schema capturing how to send controls to a\n
    \  Manager and how to accept reports received by a Manager from one or\n   more
    AMP Agents.\n\n\t "

  content: "In the present Internet Standards Process, stable identifiers for\nstandards,
    as distinct from documents (for which RFC numbers are\nsufficient), has become
    problematic because proportionately few\ndocuments reach Full Standard and are
    assigned STD numbers.  Several\nproposals have been introduced into NEWTRK to
    address this problem,\nbut only in the context of trying to resolve a number of
    other\nissues.  In the hope of making some progress on this dimension, this\ndocument
    proposes a change to the standards-track document identifier\nsystem only.\n\n\t "

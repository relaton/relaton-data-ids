  content: "   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is focused on how to serve time\n
    \  critical flow with low data loss and bounded delay. Unlike\n   contemporary
    solution which improves QoS such as TE, redundant\n   bandwidth provisioning and
    dedicated channel reservation, DetNet\n   provides more general approaches that
    use IP-based techniques and\n   guarantee the worst-case latency of DetNet flows
    while allowing\n   sharing among best-effort flows. For this purpose, DetNet may\n
    \  require upgraded or redefined data plane as well as control plane,\n   since
    current networking cannot assure maximum end-to-end latency.\n   This document
    describes some technical requirements on possible\n   data plane, control plane
    and DetNet flow modeling that can help\n   to clarify those capabilities DetNet
    should have.\n\n\t "

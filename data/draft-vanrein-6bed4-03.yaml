abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The purpose of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications, even on\n
    \  IPv4-only networks.  A specific and new [RFC7059] area of concern is\n   that
    of peer-to-peer protocols such as SIP or file sharing during a\n   chat session.
    \ Applications for such protocols are designed to run in\n   arbitrary environments,
    which means that they can neither rely on\n   native IPv6 for themselves, nor
    for their peers.  The 6bed4 tunnel\n   mechanism ensures that IPv6 can be assumed
    on all peers.  This has a\n   positive impact on the ability to initiate direct
    exchanges between\n   such peers.\n\n   The 6bed4 mechanism is meant as a fallback
    mechanism for IPv6\n   connectivity on networks that do not support it natively,
    by running\n   a tunnel over UDP and IPv4.  The IPv4 address is used to support\n
    \  traceability of the traffic originator, which means that no user\n   account
    or other configuration is needed.\n\n   The tunnel mechanism encapsulates IPv6
    in UDP/IPv4 and builds on the\n   existing IPv6 discovery mechanisms of Stateless
    Address\n   Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to setup an IPv6 address on a 6bed4 Peer,\n
    \  and of Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] to verify if a direct route to a\n   remote
    6bed4 Peer is achievable.\n\n\t "

  content: "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection operates in different modes.\nWhen
    BFD runs in asynchronous mode requires hello packet needs\nto be transmitted and
    received on regular intervals. In software\nbased BFD application, hello packets
    processing path may be\nheavy weight which may involve many processing levels
    to reach\nBFD application. On a scaled system, processing delay may not\nbe constant
    at all the time and this processing delay does appear\nat any point between software
    path entry point and BFD application.\nThis delay needs to be identified and suppressed
    otherwise system\nmay end up on false link failure detection. This internet draft\ndeals
    on this particular case.\n\nSince introducing new Diagnostic bit, it requires
    to update RFC5880.\n\n\t "

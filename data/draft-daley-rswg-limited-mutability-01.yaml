  content: "   The environment in which RFCs are produced has changed significantly\n
    \  since the inception of the series: the process for producing RFCs is\n   now
    a heavyweight process; there is a large and growing set of\n   errata, many with
    serious implications; and the expectations around\n   the use of RFCs have changed
    significantly as document technology has\n   evolved.  In this new environment,
    the long-standing principle of\n   immutability of RFCs, prevents the RFC Series
    from achieving its\n   goals of technical excellence and easily understood documentation.\n
    \  This document addresses that by identifying a possible way forward of\n   a
    new principle of limited mutability for the RFC Series that allows\n   the publishing
    of new versions of RFCs in limited circumstances,\n   replacing the principle
    of immutability.\n\n\t "

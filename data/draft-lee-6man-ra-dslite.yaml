  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 Router\nAdvertisement
    messages to allow IPv6 routers to advertise DS-Lite\nAFTR addresses to IPv6 hosts
    (i.e., a default IPv6 route for DS-Lite\ntraffic).  The provisioning of the AFTR
    address is crucial to access\nIPv4 connectivity services in a DS-Lite context.
    \ Means to ensure\nreliable delivery of this information to connecting hosts is
    a must.\n\nFurthermore, this RA option can be used as a means to distribute DS-\nLite
    serviced customers among a set of deployed AFTRs without\nrequiring a central
    knowledge of the underlying topology and deployed\nAFTRs.\n\t "

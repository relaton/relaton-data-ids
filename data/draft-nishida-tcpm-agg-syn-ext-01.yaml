  content: "   TCP option space is scarce resource as its max length is limited to\n
    \  40 bytes.  This limitation becomes more significant in SYN segments\n   as
    all options used in a connection should be exchanged during SYN\n   negotiations.
    \ This document proposes a new SYN option negotiation\n   scheme that can aggregate
    multiple TCP options in SYN segments into a\n   single option so that more options
    can be negotiate during 3 way\n   handshake.  With its simple design, the approach
    does not require\n   fundamental changes in TCP.\n\n\t "

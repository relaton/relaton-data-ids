  content: "This document presents a framework to assist the writers of certificate
    policies or certification practice statements for participants within public key
    infrastructures, such as certification authorities, policy authorities, and communities
    of interest that wish to rely on certificates.  In particular, the framework provides
    a comprehensive list of topics that potentially (at the writer's discretion) need
    to be covered in a certificate policy or a certification practice statement.  This
    document supersedes RFC 2527.\n\t "

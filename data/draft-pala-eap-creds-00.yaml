- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that\n
    \  rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or\n   tokens)
    for network access, the need for a standardized credentials\n   provisioning and
    management framework is paramount.  The .1x\n   architecture allows for entities
    (e.g., devices, applications, etc.)\n   to authenticate to the network by providing
    a communication channel\n   where different methods can be used to exchange different
    types of\n   credentials.  However, the need for managing these credentials (i.e.,\n
    \  provisioning and renewal) is still a hard problem to solve.\n\n   This specifications
    define how to support the provisioning and\n   management of authentication credentials
    that can be exploited in\n   different environments (e.g., Wired, WiFi, cellular,
    etc.) to users\n   and/or devices by using EAP together with standard provisioning\n
    \  protocols.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document attempts the case for new work that needs to be\n   developed
    for 5G users to improve faster download and upload of the\n   user's data in a
    scenario of dual-connectivity 3GPP access outlining\n   the poor radio coverage
    issues. This document also outlines the\n   faster user data mechanism accompanying
    3GPP access of 5G user\n   device via bearer offloading in case of a poor coverage.\n\n\t "

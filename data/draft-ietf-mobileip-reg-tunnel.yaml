  content: "Using Mobile IP, a mobile node registers with its home agent each\ntime
    it changes care-of address.  If the distance between the\nvisited network and
    the home network of the mobile node is large, the\nsignaling delay for these registrations
    may be long.  This document\ndescribes a new kind of `regional' registrations,
    i.e.  registrations\nlocal to the visited domain.  The regional signaling is performed
    via\na new network entity called a Gateway Foreign Agent and introduces\na layer
    of hierarchy in the visited domain.  Regional registrations\nreduce the number
    of signaling messages to the home network, and\nreduce the signaling delay when
    a mobile node moves from one foreign\nagent to another within the same visited
    domain.  This document is an\noptional extension to the Mobile IPv4 protocol.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the AS hopcount path attribute for BGP.  This\n
    \  is an optional, transitive path attribute that is designed to help\n   limit
    the distribution of routing information in the Internet.\n\n   By default, prefixes
    advertised into the BGP mesh are distributed\n   freely, and if not blocked by
    policy will propagate globally.  This\n   is harmful to the scalability of the
    routing subsystem since\n   information that only has a local effect on routing
    will cause state\n   creation throughout the default-free zone.  This attribute
    can be\n   attached to a particular path to limit its scope to a subset of the\n
    \  Internet.\n\t "

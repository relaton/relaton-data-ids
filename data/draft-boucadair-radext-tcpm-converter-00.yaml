  script: Latn
  content: "   Because of the lack of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support at the server\n
    \  side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model\n   that
    relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called\n   Converters.  Network-assisted
    MPTCP deployment models are designed to\n   facilitate the adoption of MPTCP for
    the establishment of multi-path\n   communications without making any assumption
    about the support of\n   MPTCP by the communicating peers.  Converters located
    in the network\n   are responsible for establishing multi-path communications
    on behalf\n   of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities to\n
    \  achieve different goals that include (but are not limited to)\n   optimization
    of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of\n   resiliency (e.g., primary/backup
    communication paths), and traffic\n   offload management.\n\n   This document
    specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User\n   Service (RADIUS) attributes
    that carry the IP addresses that will be\n   returned to authorized users to reach
    one or multiple Converters.\n\n\n\t "

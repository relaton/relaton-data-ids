  content: "In order for the local mobility anchor to receive and forward uplink\ntraffic
    for a mobile node, Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol mandates\nthe LMA to have an
    active BCE with a registered proxy CoA that is the\nother end of the tunnel between
    the LMA and MAG.  In some systems and\nduring active inter-MAG handoff with traffic
    that is sensitive to\ndelay and packet loss, the LMA is required to forward uplink
    traffic\nfor the mobile node from the target MAG without completely switching\nthe
    tunnel from the source MAG.  This document specifies a mechanism\nwhich allows
    the target MAG to perform transient registration for a\nnew proxy CoA and the
    LMA to create a transient BCE for the same\nmobile node for a specified period
    of time while maintaining the\noriginal mobile node's BCE which reference the
    old pCoA at the source\nMAG.\n\t "

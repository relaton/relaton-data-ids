  content: "   3GPP2 is working in specifying a way to allow the mobile network \n
    \  subscribers to configure the Firewalls in their network according to \n   their
    needs[3]. \n   This document defines requirements for a Firewall Configuration
    \n   Protocol. It has been produced by a number of 3GPP2 member companies \n   and
    endorsed by 3GPP2. It contains 3GPP2 requirements to a next \n   generation Firewall
    Configuration Protocol. \n    \n   With the number of threats that keep increasing
    on the Internet, \n   many networks have decided to deploy Firewalls to reduce
    the \n   possible risks and protect their users as well as their network \n   resources.
    Firewalls can however present many issues with new \n   protocols, applications
    and scenarios to be supported. Data packets \n   may be discarded at the Firewalls.
    In addition, the clients may \n   often be the only parties that know the requirements
    and details of \n   the data communications. This document therefore explains
    why a \n   protocol allowing clients to configure Firewalls would be useful, \n
    \  and attempts to identify the requirements and features to be \n   supported
    by such a protocol. \n\n\t "

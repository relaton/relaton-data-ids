  content: "This ID will contain my analysis of the Core-Edge Elimination\narchitecture
    (CEE) scalable routing proposals considered by the RRG\nin 2010, as well as some
    other CEE architectures.  This ID is to\nsupport and document the IRTF Routing
    Research Group discussions\nconcerning scalable routing, in early 2010.  It is
    not a formal\nproduct of the RRG.  To what extent its contents are supported by
    RRG\nconsensus can only be determined by the co-chairs.\n\t "

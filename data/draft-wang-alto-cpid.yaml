  content: "The goal of the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)\nprotocol
    is to provide guidance to applications which have to select\none or several hosts
    from a set of candidates, all of which are able\nto provide the desired resource.
    \ The goal of the mechanisms\nspecified in this document is to extend the existing
    solution, and\nprovide basic attributes to each end terminal to make it network-\naware.
    \ These mechanisms introduce a way to directly transfer the\nguidance or costs
    using Network Location identifiers/PIDs, called\nCPIDs.  And the exisiting The
    proposed solution inherits the existing\nsolution's architecture, messages, and
    other mechanisms.  It can be\nused as an independent solution or function together
    with other\nfunctions in the existing solution to provide guidance for different\nclient
    and balance the workload on the server.  Additional details\nfor the process will
    be provided in the next version of the draft.\n\t "

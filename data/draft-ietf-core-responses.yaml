  content: "   In CoAP as defined by RFC 7252, responses are always unicast back to\n
    \  a client that posed a request.  The present memo describes two forms\n   of
    responses that go beyond that model.\n\n   The design spaces for the new CoAP
    Options proposed to represent\n   these responses are now sufficiently understood
    that they can be\n   developed to standards-track specifications, either in this
    document\n   or by transferring the specification for an Option to a document
    that\n   that Option closely works with.\n\n\t "

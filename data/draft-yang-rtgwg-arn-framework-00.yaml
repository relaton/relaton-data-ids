abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   With progress of more and more new technologies have been deployed\n
    \  in large scale, such as SRv6 and network slicing, it is highly\n   desirable
    to open these new capability to applications. Current\n   practice is using ACLs
    to classify the packet and then map those\n   traffic onto proper network resources.
    This is the way the\n   application is passively perceived by the network, rather
    than the\n   application actively calling the network, and changes in application\n
    \  characteristics require triggering network configuration\n   adjustments, making
    it difficult to deploy at scale.\n\n   The document proposes a new framework called
    Application Request\n   Network (ARN), by encapsulating more network functions
    into ARN ID,\n   thus it opens up interfaces to applications. The vision is to
    enable\n   applications to access network resources like they access an\n   operating
    system.\n\n\t "

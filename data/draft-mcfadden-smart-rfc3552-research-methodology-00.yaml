  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC3552 provides guidance to authors in crafting RFC text on Security\n
    \  Considerations. The RFC is more than fifteen years old. With the\n   threat
    landscape and security ecosystem significantly changed since\n   the RFC was published,
    RFC3552 is a candidate for update. This draft\n   proposes that, prior to drafting
    an update to RFC3552, an examination\n   of recent, published Security Considerations
    sections be carried out\n   as a baseline for how to improve RFC3552. It suggests
    a methodology\n   for examining Security Considerations sections in published
    RFCs and\n   the extraction of both quantitative and qualitative information that\n
    \  could inform a revision of the older guidance.\n\n\t "

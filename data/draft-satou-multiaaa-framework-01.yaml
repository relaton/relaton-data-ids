  content: "This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to \nmeet
    the requirements presented in draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req-\n04.txt, \"Requirements
    for Accounting, Authentication and \nAuthorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting
    Services\". In this \nframework a user sends a request for multicast data to a
    network \nservice provider.  The network service provider selects the \nappropriate
    content provider to which it then sends on the request \ntransparently in a way
    so that the network service provider and \ncontent provider do not need to know
    the corresponding user id for \nthe same user in the other provider's domain.
    \ The content provider \nthen responds with an indication of \"success\" or \"failure\"
    to the \nnetwork provider and in the case of \"success\", the network provider
    \nmay delivery the requested data to the user.  The network service \nmay base
    its decision to deliver such data to the user based on its \nbandwidth management
    policy.  The framework is designed to be \nflexible and extendible, so it will
    be possible to implement \npartially enabled versions as well as fully enabled
    versions of the \nmodel.  Also an additional entity may provide transit of requests
    \nbetween network service providers and content providers, either \nthrough relaying
    or tunneling. \n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft technical proposal describes how MPEG DMIF (Delivery\nMultimedia
    Integration Framework)  can be used with RTSP for setting\nMPEG-4 service sessions
    and subsequently detaching the service. DMIF\ncreates an instance of DMIF RTSP
    augmented with QoS appropriate for\neach MPEG-4 stream and also makes use of the
    FlexMux to carry multiple\nstreams on a single UDP or TCP IP flow. The stream
    control play/pause\netc. using RTSP is executed directly by the MPEG-4 Systems
    Sync Layer.\n \nComments are solicited and should be addressed to the working
    group's\nmailing list at confctrl@isi.edu and/or the authors.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines\n
    \  for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to\n   support
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially the smart\n   meters for electricity.
    \ The inherent advantage of existing\n   electricity infrastructure facilitates
    the expansion of PLC\n   deployments, and moreover, a wide variety of accessible
    devices\n   raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.  As part\n
    \  of this technology, Narrowband PLC (NBPLC) is focused on the low-\n   bandwidth
    and low-power scenarios that includes current standards\n   such as ITU-T G.9903,
    IEEE 1901.2 and IEEE 1901.2a.  This document\n   describes how IPv6 packets are
    transported over constrained PLC\n   networks.\n\n\t "

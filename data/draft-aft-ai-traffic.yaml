  content: "   The growth in terms of number of parameters of LLM models as well as\n
    \  the need to use or train those models with private or protected data\n   will
    require service providers operating LLM-based services to\n   cooperate to train,
    specialize or serve LLM-based services accross\n   datacenters.  Given their structure,
    the number of parameters they\n   incorporate and the collective communication
    librairies they are\n   built with, LLM training and inference (or serving) network
    traffic\n   has specific characteristics.\n\n   In that regard, understanding
    the specificities of AI-related\n   workloads is critical to determine how to
    operate AI-based services\n   in a federated setting across datacenters.\n\n\t "

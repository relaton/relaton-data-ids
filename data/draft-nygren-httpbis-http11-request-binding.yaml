abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP/1.1 Message Binding adds new hop-by-hop header fields that are
    cryptographically bound to requests and responses. The keys used are negotiated
    out-of-band from the HTTP datastream (such as via TLS Exporters). These header
    fields allow endpoints to detect and mitigate desynchronization attacks, such
    as HTTP Request Smuggling, that exist due to datastream handling differences.</p>"

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) [RFC4760] specifies that the set of\n   network-layer
    protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop\n   field may belong is
    determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI)\n   and the Subsequent Address
    Family Identifier (SAFI).  The current\n   AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address
    family only have provisions\n   for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs
    to the IPv4 protocol\n   when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information
    (NLRI)\n   or VPN-IPv4 NLRI.  This document specifies the extensions necessary\n
    \  to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop\n   address
    that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an\n   extension of the AFI/SAFI
    definitions to allow the address of the\n   Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4
    NLRI to also belong to the IPv6\n   protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop in
    order to determine which of\n   the protocols the address actually belongs to,
    and a new BGP\n   Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether
    they\n   can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.\n\n\t "

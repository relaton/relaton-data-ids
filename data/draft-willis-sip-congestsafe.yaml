- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol allows the use of UDP for transport\nof
    SIP messages.  The use of UDP inherently risks network congestion\nproblems, as
    UDP itself does not define congestion prevention,\navoidance, detection, or correction
    mechanisms.  This problem is\naggravated by large SIP messages which fragment
    at the UDP level.\nTransport protocols in SIP are also negotiated on a per-hop
    basis, at\nthe SIP level, so SIP proxies may convert from TCP to UDP and so\nforth.
    \ This document defines what it means for SIP nodes to be\ncongestion safe and
    specifies an extension by which a SIP User Agent\nmay require that its requests
    are treated in a congestion safe\nmanner.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides\n
    \  mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path\n   computations
    in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.\n   The stateful PCE
    extensions allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS)
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSPs) using PCEP.\n\n   This
    document proposes a set of extensions for the stateful PCE, so\n   as to enable
    bandwidth scheduling for LSP and adjust the bandwidth\n   based on the customers'
    scheduled bandwidth requirement of a traffic\n   service in a centralized network
    environment.  A bandwidth scheduled\n   LSP can be adjusted to the new bandwidth
    at its starting time and\n   adjusted back to the original bandwidth at its ending
    time.\n\n\t "

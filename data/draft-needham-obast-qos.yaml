  content: "This document outlines some of the fundamental requirements and issues
    \nrelated to the control and maintenance of quality of service (QoS) in an \nOpen
    Base Station Transport (OBAST) architecture.  It begins with a \nreview of a baseline
    OBAST architecture, highlighting those elements \nthat are particularly relevant
    to QoS provisioning, then discusses the \nrequirements for QoS within this framework.
    \ In particular, the \nrequirements for control and maintenance of QoS during
    mobility \nhandoffs, and for support of adaptive applications, is addressed.\n\t "

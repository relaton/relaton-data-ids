  content: "The SIP MESSAGE method is used to send instant messages, where each\nmessage
    is independent of any other message. This is often called\npager-mode messaging,
    due to the fact that this model is similar to\nthat of most two-way pager devices.
    Another model is called\nsession-mode. In session-mode, the instant messages are
    part of a\nmedia session that provides ordering, a security context, and other\nfunctions.
    This media session is established using a SIP INVITE, just\nas an audio or video
    session would be established.\nThis document describes a The Message Session Relay
    Protocol (MSRP),\na mechanism for transmitting session-mode messages with minimal
    relay\nsupport. Additionally, this document describes using the SDP offer/\nanswer
    model to initiate such sessions.\n\n\n\t "

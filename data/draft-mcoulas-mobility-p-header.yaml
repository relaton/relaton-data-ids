  content: "Voice call continuity and media over IP session mobility operations \n
    \  are typically characterized by the movement of a specific segment of \n   a
    communication session across networks and/or devices. This movement \n   may be
    implemented through the use of SIP procedures that result in \n   the establishment
    of a new segment replacing the existing segment. \n   This document proposes a
    private extension to the Session Initiation \n   Protocol (SIP) that enable User
    Agents (UA) to indicate that a SIP \n   request is associated with a mobility
    operation for an existing \n   session. \n\t "

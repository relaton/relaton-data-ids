abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The IPv6 neighbor discovery cache is vulernable to a Denial of\n   Service
    attack that purposely exhausts the state used during the\n   neighbor discovery
    address resolution process.  This can be very\n   disruptive when a router is
    successfully attacked.\n\n   This memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor discovery
    to be used\n   by routers to eliminate the opportunity for this DoS attack.  This\n
    \  method of stateless neighbor discovery would be used for unknown or\n   untrusted
    packet sources, when the router's neighbor cache's state\n   capacity reaches
    a medium to high threshold of use.  Trusted packet\n   sources would continue
    to be provided with traditional stateful\n   neighbor discovery.\n\n\t "

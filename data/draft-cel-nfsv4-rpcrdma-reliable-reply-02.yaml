  content: "   RPC transports such as RPC-over-RDMA Version One require reply\n   buffers
    to be in place before an RPC Call is sent.  However, Upper\n   Layer Protocols
    sometimes have difficulty estimating the expected\n   maximum size of RPC replies.
    \ This introduces the risk that an RPC\n   Reply message can overrun reply resources
    provided by the requester,\n   preventing delivery of the message, through no
    fault of the\n   requester.  This document describes a mechanism that eliminates
    the\n   need for pre-allocation of reply resources for unpredictably large\n   replies.\n\n\t "

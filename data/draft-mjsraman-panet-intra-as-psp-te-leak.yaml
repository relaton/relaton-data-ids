  content: "   In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power\n
    \  consumption of an Autonomous System (AS) using a collaborative\n   approach
    between areas within an AS. We identify the low-power paths\n   within non-backbone
    areas and then use Traffic Engineering (TE)\n   techniques to route the packets
    along the stitched paths from non-\n   backbone areas / backbone area to other
    non-backbone areas. Such low-\n   power paths can be identified by using the power-to-available-\n
    \  bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional constraint in the Constrained\n   Shortest
    Path First (CSPF) algorithm. For routing the data traffic\n   through these low-power
    paths, the Inter-Area Traffic Engineered\n   Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that
    spans multiple areas can be used.\n   Extensions to the Interior Gateway Protocols
    like OSPF and IS-IS that\n   support TE extensions can be used to disseminate
    information about\n   low-power paths in the respective areas (backbone or non-backbone)\n
    \  that minimize the PWR ratio metric on the links within the areas and\n   between
    the areas thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce\n   the power consumption.\n\n
    \  The feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying our\n   algorithm
    to an AS with a backbone area and several non-backbone\n   areas. The techniques
    proposed in this paper for the Inter-Area power\n   reduced paths require a few
    modifications to the existing features of\n   the IGPs supporting TE extensions.
    The proposed techniques can be\n   extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy,
    such as Inter-AS\n   paths, through suitable modifications as in [11].\n\n   When
    link state routing protocols like OSPF or ISIS are used to\n   discover TE topology,
    there is the limitation that traffic engineered\n   paths can be set up only when
    the head and tail end of the label\n   switched path are in the same area. There
    are solutions to overcome\n   this limitation either using offline Path Computation
    Engine (PCE)\n   that attach to multiple areas and know the topology of all areas.\n
    \  This document proposes an alternative approach that does not require\n   any
    centralized PCE and uses selective leaking of low-power TE path\n   information
    from one area into other areas.\n\n\t "

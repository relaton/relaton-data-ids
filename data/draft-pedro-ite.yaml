  content: "   This document specifies the schemas and models required to realize\n
    \  the data formats and interfaces for Intent-Based Networking (IBN).\n   They
    are needed to enable the composition of services to build a\n   translation engine
    for IBN-based network management.  This intent\n   translation engine (called
    an intent translator) is an essential\n   function for network intents to be enforced
    into a target network for\n   the configuration and management of the network
    and its security.\n\n\t "

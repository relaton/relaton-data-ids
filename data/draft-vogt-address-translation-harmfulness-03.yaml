  content: "Address translation is widely considered harmful because it conflicts\nwith
    design principles highly regarded within the Internet\nengineering community.
    \ Still, address translation has become common\npractice despite technical problems
    because it constitutes an easy-\nto-deploy solution to a set of common operational
    needs.  Since some\nof these needs will continue to exist in IP version 6, there
    is\nconcern within the Internet engineering community about the potential\nproliferation
    of harmful technology from IP version 4 to IP version\n6.  This document investigates
    this concern.  It compares feasible\naddress translator designs with respect to
    the harmful impact they\nmay have, explains why the problems of address translation,
    as used\ntoday, are to a significant extent entailed by the shortage of global\naddresses
    in IP version 4, and shows how the problems can be\nmitigated in IP version 6.\n\t "

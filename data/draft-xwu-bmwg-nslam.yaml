  content: "   While the networking technologies have evolved over the years, the\n
    \  layered approach has been dominant in many network solutions.  Each\n   layer
    may have multiple interchangeable, competing alternatives that\n   deliver a similar
    set of functionality.  In order to provide an\n   objective benchmarking data
    among various implementations, the need\n   arises for a common abstract model
    for each network service layer,\n   with a set of required and optional specifications
    in respective\n   layers.  Many overlay and or underlay solutions can be described\n
    \  using these models.\n\n\t "

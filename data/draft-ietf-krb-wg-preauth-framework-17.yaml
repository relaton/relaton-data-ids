  content: "Kerberos is a protocol for verifying the identity of principals (e.g.,
    a workstation user or a network server) on an open network. The Kerberos protocol
    provides a facility called pre-authentication. Pre-authentication mechanisms can
    use this facility to extend the Kerberos protocol and prove the identity of a
    principal.\n\n This document describes a more formal model for this facility.
    The model describes what state in the Kerberos request a pre-authentication mechanism
    is likely to change. It also describes how multiple pre-authentication mechanisms
    used in the same request will interact.\n\n This document also provides common
    tools needed by multiple pre-authentication mechanisms. One of these tools is
    a secure channel between the client and the key distribution center with a reply
    key strengthening mechanism; this secure channel can be used to protect the authentication
    exchange and thus eliminate offline dictionary attacks. With these tools, it is
    relatively straightforward to chain multiple authentication mechanisms, utilize
    a different key management system, or support a new key agreement algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

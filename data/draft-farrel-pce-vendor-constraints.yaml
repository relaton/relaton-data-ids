  content: "The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey path\ncomputation
    requests and responses between Path Computation Clients\n(PCCs) and Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs), and also between\ncooperating PCEs. In PCEP the path computation
    requests carry details\nof the constraints and objective functions that the PCC
    wishes the\nPCE to apply in its computation.\n\nThe mechanisms defined for indicating
    objective functions include\nthe capability to convey vendor-specific objective
    functions. This\ndocument defines a facility to carry vendor-specific constraints
    in\nPCEP.\n\t "

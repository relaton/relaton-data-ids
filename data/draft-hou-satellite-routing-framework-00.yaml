  content: "   The inter-satellite routing is the premis to ensure that the\n   satellite
    network provides end-to-end stable service covering the\n   whole world.  However,
    the mature terrestrial network technologies\n   are difficult to directly apply
    to the satellite network for the\n   highly dynamic network topology and the limited
    on-board resources.\n   This issue is further exacerbated in LEO mega-constellations.
    \ In\n   view of this challenge, this document presents a routing framework\n
    \  for LEO mega-constellation.  Based on the orbit position\n   characteristic
    and the predictable topology, this framwork realizes\n   flexible region division,
    establishes intra-region and inter-region\n   path, as well as completes end-to-end
    data forwarding.\n\n\t "

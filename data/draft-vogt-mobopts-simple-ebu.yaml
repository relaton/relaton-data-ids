  content: "Mobile IPv6 defines a return-routability procedure for secure use of\nroute
    optimization between unacquainted nodes.  Unfortunately, this\nprocedure is known
    to have undesired impacts on handoff latency.\nThis document specifies extensions
    to Mobile IPv6 that eliminate the\nlatency of the return-routability procedure.
    \ The extensions thus\nprovide a basis for more efficient reactive as well as
    proactive\nhandoff management.  They are optional and fully backward-compatible.\n\n\n\t "

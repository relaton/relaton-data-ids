  content: "In a mobile environment it is often desirable to allow a user to\n   restrict
    or constrain the set of messages that will be sent to\n   the mobile device. There
    may be several reasons. The user may \n   not want to pay for the bandwidth consumed,
    they may not want to\n   to consume memory on the phone or they may just want
    to restrict\n   what they get \"bothered\" by while in a mobile environment. This\n
    \  draft defines a way to allow the user to restrict message sets per\n   folder.\n\t "

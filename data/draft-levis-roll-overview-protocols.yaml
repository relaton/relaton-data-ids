  content: "Networks of low power wireless devices introduce novel IP routing\n   issues.
    \ Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and\n   smart objects,
    have difficult constraints: very limited memory,\n   little processing power,
    and long sleep periods.  As most of these\n   devices are battery-powered, energy
    efficiency is critically\nimportant.  Wireless link qualities can vary significantly
    over time,\n   requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize topology\n
    \  change energy costs.  Such low power and lossy networks (L2Ns) have\n   routing
    requirements that existing mesh protocols only partially\n   address.  This document
    provides a brief survey of the strengths and\n   weaknesses of existing protocols
    with respect to L2Ns.  It provides\n   guidance on how lessons from existing and
    prior efforts can be\n   leveraged in future protocol design.\n\n\t "

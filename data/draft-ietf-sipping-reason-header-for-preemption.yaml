  content: "This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) Reason Header to be included in a BYE Method Request as a result
    of a session preemption event, either at a user agent (UA), or somewhere in the
    network involving a reservation-based protocol such as the Resource ReSerVation
    Protocol (RSVP) or Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS).  This document does not attempt
    to address routers failing in the packet path; instead, it addresses a deliberate
    tear down of a flow between UAs, and informs the terminated UA(s) with an indication
    of what occurred. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

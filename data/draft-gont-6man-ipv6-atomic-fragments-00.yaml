  content: "   IPv6 allows packets to contain a Fragment Header, without the packet\n
    \  being actually fragmented into multiple pieces.  Such packets\n   typically
    result from hosts that have received an ICMPv6 \"Packet Too\n   Big\" error message
    that advertises a \"Next-Hop MTU\" smaller than 1280\n   bytes, and are currently
    processed by hosts as \"fragmented traffic\".\n   By forging ICMPv6 \"Packet Too
    Big\" error messages an attacker can\n   cause hosts to employ \"atomic fragments\",
    and the launch any\n   fragmentation-based attacks against such traffic.  This
    document\n   discusses the generation of the aforementioned \"atomic fragments\",\n
    \  the corresponding security implications, and formally updates RFC\n   2460
    and RFC 5722 such that the attack vector based on \"atomic\n   fragments\" is
    completely eliminated.\n\n\t "

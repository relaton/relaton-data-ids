  content: "The IESG prefers to avoid having RFCs linger in Proposed Standard\nStatus.
    \ In general, RFCs which have demonstratable interoperability\nand usefulness
    should become Draft Standards, and eventually may\nbecome full Standards, as described
    in RFC 2026 [1] section 6.2.  \nWhen a Proposed Standard RFC is reissued to become
    Draft, corrections,\nclarifications and other changes can be integrated into the
    update.  \nHowever, if changes to the protocol are 'very significant', then \nthe
    document needs to be issued as Proposed Standard again.\nThis document describes
    an approach to reissue the core RFCs which\ndescribe LDAPv3, all of which are
    currently at Proposed Standard\nstatus.  It also summarizes the status of other
    existing and upcoming\nstandards-track LDAP RFCs.\n\n\t "

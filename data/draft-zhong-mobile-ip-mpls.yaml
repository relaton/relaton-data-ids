  content: "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) combines the efficiency and \nsimplicity
    of IP routing together with the high-speed switching of\nATM. Mobile IP is a protocol
    that allows mobile users to maintain\ncontinuous IP network connectivity. In this
    document, we describe\na scheme to integrate both the Mobile IP and MPLS protocols.
    The\nintegration of both these protocols improves the scalability of the\nMobile
    IP data forwarding process by leveraging on the features of\nMPLS which are fast
    switching, small state maintenance and high\nscalability. In addition, we have
    removed the need for IP-in-IP \ntunneling from Home Agent (HA) to Foreign Agent
    (FA) under this\nscheme. This document defines the signaling and control mechanisms\nrequired
    to integrate MPLS and Mobile IP.\n\t "

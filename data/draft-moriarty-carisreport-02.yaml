  content: "   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Society (ISOC)\n
    \  hosted a day-long Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale\n   (CARIS)
    workshop on 18 June 2015 in coordination with the Forum for\n   Incident Response
    and Security Teams (FIRST) Conference in Berlin.\n   The workshop included members
    of the FIRST community, attack response\n   working group representatives, network
    and security operators,\n   Regional Internet Registry (RIR) representatives,
    researchers,\n   vendors, and representatives from standardisation communities.
    \ Key\n   goals of the workshop were to improve mutual awareness,\n   understanding,
    and coordination among the diverse participating\n   organizations and their representatives.
    \ The workshop also aimed to\n   provide the attendees with greater awareness
    of existing efforts to\n   mitigate specific types of attacks, and greater understanding
    of the\n   options available to collaborate and engage with these efforts.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines an email header field, Require-Recipient-Valid-\n
    \  Since, to provide a method for senders to indicate to receivers the\n   time
    when the sender last confirmed the ownership of the target\n   mailbox.  This
    can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership,\n   and thus prevent mail
    from being delivered to the wrong party.\n\n   The intended use of this header
    field is on automatically generated\n   messages that might contain sensitive
    information.\n\n\t "

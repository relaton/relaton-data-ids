  content: "   The service function chaining concept differentiates between a\n   service
    function chain and a service function path.   A chain is a\n   sequence of service
    function types whereas a path is a sequence of\n   service function instances
    that realize each type of service\n   function.\n\n   This document describes
    the architectural approach to reducing the\n   abstract service function chain
    to the concrete service function\n   path.\n\n\n\n\t "

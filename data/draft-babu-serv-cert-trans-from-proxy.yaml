  content: "   Intercepting transparent proxies splice the client-Server connection\n
    \  into two connections: Client-Proxy connection, Proxy-server \n   connection.
    On Client-Proxy connection, proxy sends it's certificate\n   to the client. As
    client is generally (in such a scenario) \n   pre-configured to accept proxy's
    certificate, client accepts and \n   proceeds further with the connection. On
    Proxy-Server connection, \n   server sends its certificate to the proxy. Proxy
    typically doesn't \n   possess the information (like MX domain name in case of
    SMTP)    \n   required to validate the certificate. The certificate validation
    is\n   at times very complex & hence it is better to offload this \n   reponsibility
    to the original client itself.\n\n   This document addresses this issue by extending
    TLS to let proxy \n   send server's certificate to the client for validation and
    suggests\n   how client can indicate certificate validation result to the proxy.\n\n\t "

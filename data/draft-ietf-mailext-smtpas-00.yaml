abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document reflects apparent ambiguities in RFC 821 that remain after
    the clarifications in RFC 1123.  It also includes some material from RFC 1123
    that appeared to need amplification.  These have been identified in multiple ways,
    mostly by tracking flaming on the header-people list and problems of unusual readings
    or interpretations that have turned up as the SMTP extensions have been deployed.
    \ It is important to note that everything here is in response to some identified
    confusion or bad behavior, not just paranoia.      Although SMTP was designed
    as a mail transport and delivery protocol, this specification also contains information
    that is important to its use as a 'mail posting' protocol, as recommended for
    POP3 [RFC-POP3] and IMAP4 [RFC-IMAP4].      Except when the historical terminology
    is necessary for clarity, this document uses the current 'client' and 'server'
    terminology to identify the sending and receiving SMTP processes, respectively.
    \     A companion document discusses mail bodies and formats: RFC-822, MIME, and
    their relationship.\n\t "

  content: "As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an increased\nneed
    to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introduced\nGMPLS signaling extensions
    for supporting the early version of G.709\n[G.709-v1]. The basic routing considerations
    from signaling\nperspective is also specified in [RFC4328].\n\nThe recent revision
    of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] and\n[GSUP.43] have introduced new ODU
    containers (both fixed and\nflexible) and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities,
    enabling\nsupport for optimal service aggregation.  \n\nThis document describes
    OSPF protocol extensions to support\nGeneralized MPLS (GMPLS) control for routing
    services over the\nstandardized OTU/ODU containers in support of ODU based TDM\nswitching.
    Routing support for Optical Channel Layer switching\n(Lambda switching) is not
    covered in this document.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4 service continuity is one of the most sensitive problems that
    must be resolved by Service Providers during the IPv6 transition period - especially
    after the exhaustion of the public IPv4 address space. Current standardization
    effort that addresses IPv4 service continuity focuses on stateful mechanisms.
    This document elaborates on the motivations for the need to undertake a companion
    effort to specify stateless IPv4 over IPv6 approaches.</p>"

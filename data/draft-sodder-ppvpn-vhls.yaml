- language: en

  content: "This draft describes an Ethernet [IEEE-802.3] L2VPN model that \nprovides
    point-to-point and point-to-multipoint Layer 2 data \ncommunication services using
    a hierarchical LAN switching \narchitecture.  The model is based on a hierarchical
    MAC frame format. \nScalability and manageability is achieved by simplifying the
    control \nplane at the cost of adding functionality to the forwarding plane.\n\t "

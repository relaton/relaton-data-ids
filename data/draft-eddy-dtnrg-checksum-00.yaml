  content: "   The Delay-Tolerant-Networking Bundle Protocol includes a custody\n
    \  transfer mechanism to provide acknowledgements of receipt for\n   particular
    bundles.  No checksum is included in the basic DTN Bundle\n   Protocol, however,
    so it is not possible to verify that bundles have\n   been either forwarded or
    passed through various convergence layers\n   without errors having been introduced.
    \ This document partially\n   rectifies the situation by defining a Bundle Protocol
    extension for\n   carrying payload checksums and describes how its use can be\n
    \  integrated with both custody transfer and fragmentation.\n\t "

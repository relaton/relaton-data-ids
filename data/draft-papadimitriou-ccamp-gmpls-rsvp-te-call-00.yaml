  content: "In certain networking topologies it may be advantageous to maintain\n
    \  associations between endpoints and key transit points to support an\n   instance
    of a service. Such associations are known as Calls.\n\n   A Call does not provide
    the actual connectivity for transmitting user\n   traffic, but only builds a relationship
    by which subsequent\n   connections may be made. In Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) such
    connections\n   are known as Label Switched Paths (LSPs).\n\n   This document
    specifies how GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling may be used and\n   extended to support
    Calls. These mechanisms provide full and logical\n   Call/Connection separation.\n\n
    \  The mechanisms proposed in this document are applicable to any\n   environment
    (including multi-area), and for any type of interface:\n   packet, layer-2, time-division
    multiplexed, lambda or fiber\n   switching.\n\t "

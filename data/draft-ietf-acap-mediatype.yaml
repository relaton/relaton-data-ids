  content: "With the definition of standardized media types in MIME it has become\nnecessary
    to keep mapping tables which translate between the standard\nmedia type names,
    commonly used file name extensions, any platform\nspecific typing mechanism, and
    helper applications to view, compose,\nedit or print media types.  Supplying a
    set of site defaults is\nuseful so that users won't have to configure well-known
    types.  The\nmailcap mechanism provides some of this functionality in a\nhomogeneous
    environment with a shared file system, and both the\nMacintosh program 'Internet
    Config' and the Windows Registry have had\nsome success in consolidating these
    tables for multiple applications\non a single machine.  But neither of these addresses
    the problems of\nmulti-platform users or a heterogeneous environment.\nApplication
    Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) provides appropriate\nfacilities for this
    need.  ACAP's dataset structure is extensible and\nACAP's inheritance feature
    provides for enterprise default settings\nwith per-user customization.  This memo
    defines an ACAP dataset class\nfor media type mapping tables.\n\t "

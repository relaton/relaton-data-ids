  content: "   When RBridges are connected by a bridge LAN link, they need to select\n
    \  out a Designated VLAN to be used for PDU exchange and TRILL data\n   forwarding.\n\n
    \  This document specifies an approach for RBridges to automatically\n   determine
    a Designated VLAN on a LAN link for default configured\n   RBridges. When a DVLAN
    has to be changed for the sake of a better\n   connectivity of a LAN link, RBridges
    can change their Designated VLAN\n   with least traffic interruption according
    to the soft Designated VLAN\n   change method.\n\n\t "

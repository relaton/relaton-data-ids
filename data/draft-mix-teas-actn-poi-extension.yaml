  content: "   This document extends the draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability to\n
    \  the use case where the DWDM optical coherent interface is equipped on\n   the
    Packet device.  It identifies the YANG data models being defined\n   by the IETF
    to support this deployment architecture and specific\n   scenarios relevant for
    Service Providers.  Existing IETF protocols\n   and data models are identified
    for each multi-layer (packet over\n   optical) scenario with a specific focus
    on the MPI (Multi-Domain\n   Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network Controllers
    Interface)in\n   the ACTN architecture.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo shows an example of how to provide and implement IPv4/IPv6\n
    \  dual stack anycast DNS services, which are based on the experience of\n   IPv4/IPv6
    anycast DNS implementation.  In order to provide a\n   reference model to DNS
    operators who have a plan to deploy IPv4/IPv6\n   anycast DNS services onto their
    own DNS servers in the future, this\n   memo mainly specifies a way to configure
    IPv6-related functions\n   without IPv4-related matters.\n\n\t "

  content: "ARIS (Aggregate Route-Based IP Switching) adds the advantages of high-speed
    switching to a network based on routing protocols.  It provides a means of mapping
    network-layer routing information to link-layer switched paths, enabling datagrams
    to traverse a network at media speeds.  This memo defines the ARIS protocol and
    its mechanisms.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>[DKIM2] and associated documents describe the DomainKeys Identified
    Mail v2 (DKIM2) email authentication protocol. DKIM2 is designed to address shortcomings
    in email authentication protocols and mechanisms released prior to DKIM2, specifically
    SPF [RFC7208], DKIM [RFC6376], DMARC [RFC7489], and ARC [RFC8617]. Those shortcomings
    most commonly manifested themselves in email messages that passed through one
    or more intermediary hosts (e.g., forwarders or mailing list servers) while transiting
    from origination to final destination. Although these messages were properly authenticated
    when sent, the alteration of their path and/or content by the intermediary hosts
    would cause authentication checks to fail at the final destination. In addition,
    DKIM was susceptible to "replay" of signatures, when attackers would construct
    abusive messages in such a way that they would pass validation checks for a DKIM
    signature that had been imported from another message entirely. To address these
    shortcomings, DKIM2 provides methods not only for intermediary systems to provide
    details of the changes that they make to a message in transit, but also for receiving
    hosts to validate those changes in addition to the original message. DKIM2 also
    allows recipients to detect when messages have been unexpectedly "replayed" and
    can also ensure that delivery status notifications (DSNs) are only sent to entities
    that were involved in the transmission of a message. This document describes the
    recommended usage of the DKIM2 protocol for sending hosts, intermediary hosts,
    and receiving hosts.</p>

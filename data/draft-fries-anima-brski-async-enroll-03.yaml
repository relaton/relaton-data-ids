  content: "   This document discusses enhancements of bootstrapping of a remote\n
    \  secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) to also operate in domains\n   featuring
    no or only timely limited connectivity to backend services\n   offering enrollment
    functionality, specifically a Public Key\n   Infrastructure (PKI).  The enhancements
    proposed to enable this are\n   also applied to further set of use cases in which
    a pledge may not\n   have a direct connection to the registrar and is served by
    for\n   instance by a commissioning tool as an agent providing registrar\n   connectivity.
    \ In the context of deploying new devices the design of\n   BRSKI allows for online
    (synchronous object exchange) and offline\n   interactions (asynchronous object
    exchange) with a manufacturer's\n   authorization service.  For this it utilizes
    an authenticated self-\n   contained voucher to transport the domain credentials
    as a signed\n   object to establish an initial trust between a pledge and the
    target\n   deployment domain.  The currently supported enrollment protocol for\n
    \  request and distribution of deployment domain specific device\n   certificates
    provides only limited support for asynchronous PKI\n   interactions.  This memo
    motivates the enhancement of supporting\n   authenticated self-contained objects
    for certificate management by\n   using an abstract notation.  The enhancement
    allows on one hand off-\n   site operation of PKI services outside the deployment
    domain of the\n   pledge.  This addresses specifically scenarios, in which the
    final\n   authorization of a certification request of a pledge cannot be made\n
    \  in the deployment domain and is therefore delegated to a operator\n   backend.
    \ On the other hand, this enhancement also facilitates the\n   exchange of certificate
    management information via a pledge agent.\n   The goal is to enable the usage
    of existing and potentially new PKI\n   protocols supporting authenticated self-containment
    for certificate\n   management exchanges.\n\n\t "

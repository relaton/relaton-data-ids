  content: "This document addresses topics related to hierarchical and stitched \nGeneralized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched \nPaths (LSPs).  It describes
    extensions to allow an egress to identify \nthat a bi-directional LSP will be
    used as a dynamically signaled \nForwarding Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP) or Routing
    Adjacency (RA). In \naddition, the document also addresses the issue of how to
    indicate \nthat an LSP should be advertised as a traffic engineering (TE) link
    \ninto a different instance of the IGP and how to identify the instance \nthat
    should be used.\n\t "

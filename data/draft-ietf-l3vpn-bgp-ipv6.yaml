  content: "This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use its
    packet-switched backbone to provide Virtual Private Network (VPN) services for
    its IPv6 customers. This method reuses, and extends where necessary, the \"BGP/MPLS
    IP VPN\" method for support of IPv6. In BGP/MPLS IP VPN, \"Multiprotocol BGP\"
    is used for distributing IPv4 VPN routes over the service provider backbone, and
    MPLS is used to forward IPv4 VPN packets over the backbone. This document defines
    an IPv6 VPN address family and describes the corresponding IPv6 VPN route distribution
    in \"Multiprotocol BGP\".\n\n This document defines support of the IPv6 VPN service
    over both an IPv4 and an IPv6 backbone, and for using various tunneling techniques
    over the core, including MPLS, IP-in-IP, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and
    IPsec protected tunnels. The inter-working between an IPv4 site and an IPv6 site
    is outside the scope of this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

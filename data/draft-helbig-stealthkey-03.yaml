  content: "This document describes a key management, designated as StealthKey\nManagement.
    StealthKey Management establishes short-term keys which\nare derived from a common
    long-term key in two entities, referred\nto as sender and receiver, for symmetric
    encryption algorithms and\ncryptographic authentication protocols based on a common
    secret.\nStealthkey Management covers two main parts:\n- Independent generation
    of the short-term keys by the sender and\nreceiver from either the common long-term
    key and the time, or\nfrom the common long-term key and a sequence number.\n-
    Synchronization of the short-term keys between both entities.\nThe important advantages
    of using StealthKey Management for message\nencryption and authentication are
    the ability to change the short-\nterm keys frequently, without exchanges between
    sender and receiver\nand the independence of other applications for the key change\nprocess
    (in band). A commonly used term for key change is rekeying.\nThe required long-term
    key can be established remotely through the\nuse of known symmetric or asymmetric
    key protocols, or locally via\nmanual setup. StealthKey Management improves the
    performance of any\nof today's key management protocols, by extending the protocol
    with\nthe frequent changing of keys.\n\t "

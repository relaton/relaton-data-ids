  content: "The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is a profile of the\n   Real-time
    Transport Protocol that can provide confidentiality,\n   message authentication,
    and replay protection to the RTP traffic and\n   to the control traffic for RTP,
    the Real-time Transport Control\n   Protocol (RTCP).  This document describes
    a method of using DTLS key\n   management for SRTP by using a new extension that
    indicates that SRTP\n   is to be used for data protection, and which establishes
    SRTP keys.\n\t "

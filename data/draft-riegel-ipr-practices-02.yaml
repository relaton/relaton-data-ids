  script: Latn
  content: "Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), in particular patents are\nimportant
    for standards development organizations (SDOs).  A patent\ngrants a monopoly to
    the owner to control the usage of the covered\ntechnology.  If such a technology
    is becoming part of a standard the\npatent owner can arbitrarily restrict the
    usage of the standard.\nTherefore all SDOs are concerned about patents in their
    standards.\nThis memo focuses on practices the IETF may apply to cope with patent\nrights
    in its standards.  The proposal is based on the idea of open\nstandards and is
    fully aligned to the current IPR rules of the IETF.\nThe intention is to retain
    the mind of the IETF while enabling the\nconsideration of IPR covered proposals
    in a defined way.\n\t "

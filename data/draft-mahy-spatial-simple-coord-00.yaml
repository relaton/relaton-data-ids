  content: "The Spatial Working Group is creating a Spatial Location Protocol\n\n(SLoP)
    [2] for requesting the spatial location of a target user or\n\ndevice.  SLoP is
    designed to carry other formats that contain the\n\nspatial location.  In many
    cases either the SLoP client and/or\n\nserver could be a small mobile device with
    limited processing,\n\nmemory, storage, and battery life.  This proposal is a
    simple, text-\n\nbased format to carry latitude, longitude, altitude, time, and\n\naccuracy.\n\n\n\t "

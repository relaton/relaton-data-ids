  content: "The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a
    packet-based transport technology based on the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
    and pseudowire (PW) data-plane architectures.\n\n This document describes a framework
    to support a comprehensive set of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) procedures that fulfill the MPLS-TP OAM requirements for fault, performance,
    and protection-switching management and that do not rely on the presence of a
    control plane.\n\n This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunication Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.\n\t "

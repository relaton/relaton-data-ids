  content: "The TCP user timeout controls how long transmitted data may remain unacknowledged
    before a connection is forcefully closed.  It is a local, per-connection parameter.
    \ This document specifies a new TCP option -- the TCP User Timeout Option -- that
    allows one end of a TCP connection to advertise its current user timeout value.
    \ This information provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection to adapt
    its user timeout accordingly.  Increasing the user timeouts on both ends of a
    TCP connection allows it to survive extended periods without end-to-end connectivity.
    \ Decreasing the user timeouts allows busy servers to explicitly notify their
    clients that they will maintain the connection state only for a short time without
    connectivity. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

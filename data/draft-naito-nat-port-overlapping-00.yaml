- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   When network address translation (NAT) is used in an address resource\n
    \  restricted environment, or when a lot of users are located under a\n   NAT
    device, IP addresses and port resources may be eaten up, and this\n   affects
    user experiences very negatively.  This situation can be\n   greatly mitigated
    by tweaking mapping behavior and session timer\n   handling in NAT functions.
    \ This document proposes extension for\n   optimizing NAT IP address and port
    resources in address resource\n   restricted environments.  The extension enables
    simultaneous use of a\n   NAT external port for different transport sessions.\n\n\t "

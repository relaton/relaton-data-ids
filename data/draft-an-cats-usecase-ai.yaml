  content: "   AI models, especially AI large models have been fastly developed and\n
    \  widely deployed to serve the needs of users and multiple industries.\n   Due
    to that AI large models involve mega-scale data and parameters,\n   high consumption
    on computing and network resources, distributed\n   computing becomes a natural
    choice to deploy AI large models.\n\n   This document desribes the key concepts
    and deployment scenarios of\n   AI large model, to demonstrate the necessity of
    considering computing\n   and network resources to meet the requirements of AI
    tasks.\n\n\t "

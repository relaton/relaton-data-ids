  content: "This document describes a Lower than Best-Effort (LBE) per-hop\nbehavior
    (PHB) for use within and between Differentiated\nServices domains [3].  The primary
    objective of this LBE PHB\nis to separate LBE traffic from best-effort traffic
    in\ncongestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce.\nFurthermore, LBE
    traffic gets a minimal share of bandwidth so\nthat it will not be fully preempted
    by best-effort traffic.\nThis is achieved by discarding LBE packets more aggressively\nthan
    best-effort packets while trying to enqueue them in case\nof congestion.\nThere
    are numerous uses for this PHB, e.g., for transmission\nof background traffic
    such as bulk data transfers of minor\nimportance, backup data traffic during working
    hours or\ntraffic caused by web search engines while gathering\ninformation from
    web servers.  Thus, it constitutes the\nnetwork equivalent to a background priority
    for processes in\nan operating system.  Moreover, it is particularly useful in\ncases
    when packets of a better service are re-marked by a node\nfor subsequently receiving
    a forwarding treatment that is\nequivalent to the best-effort service.  In this
    situation the\nLBE PHB helps to protect other best-effort packets from\nexperiencing
    unfair forwarding treatment because it avoids\ntheir preemption by re-marked packets.
    \ For instance, this\ncase occurs when heterogeneous multicast groups should be\nsupported.\n\n\n\t "

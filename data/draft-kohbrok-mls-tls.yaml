abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details how the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol
    can be combined with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) record layer to yield
    the MLS-TLS secure channel protocol. In this composed protocol, MLS acts as a
    continuous key agreement protocol that allows initiator and responder to protect
    both past and future messages in case of key material compromise. As such, MLS-TLS
    is suitable for long-lived connections. MLS-TLS also inherits the modularity of
    MLS and can be configured with post-quantum secure ciphersuites.</p>"

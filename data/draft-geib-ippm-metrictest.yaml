  content: "This document specifies tests to determine if multiple independent\ninstantiations
    of a performance metric RFC have implemented the\nspecifications in the same way.
    \ This is the performance metric\nequivalent of interoperability, required to
    advance RFCs along the\nstandards track.  Results from different implementations
    of metric\nRFCs will be collected under the same underlying network conditions\nand
    compared using state of the art statistical methods.  The goal is\nan evaluation
    of the metric RFC itself, whether its definitions are\nclear and unambiguous to
    implementors and therefore a candidate for\nadvancement on the IETF standards
    track.\n\t "

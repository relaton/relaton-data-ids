  script: Latn
  content: "Current proposals dealing with authorization of media streams for \nmultimedia
    services like IP telephony and video assume a pre- \nestablished relationship
    between elements of the network (e.g. \nsession managers, edge routers, policy
    servers and end hosts). In \nsome environments, however, such pre-established
    relationships may \nnot exist either due to the complexity of creating these \nassociations
    a priori (e.g. in a network with many elements), or due \nto the different business
    entities involved (e.g. service provider \nand access provider), or due to the
    dynamic nature of these \nassociations (e.g. in a mobile environment). \nIn this
    document, we describe scenarios where there is no pre-\nestablished relationship
    between entities and describe mechanisms \nfor exchanging information between
    network elements in order to \nauthorize the use of resources for a service and
    to co-ordinate \nactions between the session and bearer control planes.\n\t "

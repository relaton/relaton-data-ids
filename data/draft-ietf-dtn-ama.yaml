  content: "   This document describes a management architecture suitable for\n   deployment
    in challenged networking environments for the\n   configuration, monitoring, and
    local control of application services.\n   Challenged networking environments
    exhibit interruptions in end-to-\n   end connectivity and communications delays
    that are both long-lived\n   and unpredictable.  Even in these challenging conditions,
    such\n   networks must provide some type of end-to-end information transport\n
    \  and fault protection while also supporting configuration and\n   performance
    reporting.  This management may need to operate without\n   human- or system-in-the-loop
    synchronous interactivity and without\n   the preservation of transport-layer
    sessions.  In such a context,\n   challenged networks must exhibit behavior that
    is both determinable\n   and autonomous while maintaining as much compatibility
    with non-\n   challenged-network operational concepts as possible.\n\n   The architecture
    described in this document is termed the\n   Asynchronous Management Architecture
    (AMA).  The AMA supported two\n   types of asynchronous behavior.  First, the
    AMA does not presuppose\n   any synchronized transport behavior between managed
    and managing\n   devices.  Second, the AMA does not support any query-response\n
    \  semantics.  In this way, the AMA allows for operation in extremely\n   challenging
    conditions, to include over uni-directional links and\n   cases where delays/disruptions
    would otherwise prevent operation over\n   traditional transport layers, such
    as when exceeding the Maximum\n   Segment Lifetime (MSL) of the Transmission Control
    Protocol (TCP).\n\n\t "

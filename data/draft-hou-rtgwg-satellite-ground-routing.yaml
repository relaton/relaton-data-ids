  content: "   With the development of network technology, the satellite network are\n
    \  gradually integrating with the terrestrial network.  This draft\n   illustrates
    a satellite ground routing architecture based on access\n   satellite prediction
    to solve the end-to-end communication issue in\n   the satellite ground integration
    scenario where the connection\n   between terrestrial nodes and satellites switches
    frequently.  This\n   architecture includes registration nodes which are responsible
    for\n   maintaining access node information.  Each access node preserve\n   satellite
    orbit information, performs access satellite prediction,\n   and generates encapsulation
    addresses.  The access satellite\n   undertakes data encapsulation, data forwarding,
    and data\n   unencapsulation based on encapsulation addresses.\n\n\t "

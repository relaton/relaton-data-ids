  content: "   This document describes the Concise Binary Object Representation\n
    \  (CBOR) Sequence format and associated media type \"application/cbor-\n   seq\".
    \ A CBOR Sequence consists of any number of encoded CBOR data\n   items, simply
    concatenated in sequence.\n\n   Structured syntax suffixes for media types allow
    other media types to\n   build on them and make it explicit that they are built
    on an existing\n   media type as their foundation.  This specification defines
    and\n   registers \"+cbor-seq\" as a structured syntax suffix for CBOR\n   Sequences.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP),
    a protocol for inter-domain multicast routing.  BGMP builds shared trees for active
    multicast groups, and optionally allows receiver domains to build source-specific,
    inter-domain, distribution branches where needed.  BGMP natively supports \"source-specific
    multicast\" (SSM).  To also support \"any-source multicast\" (ASM), BGMP requires
    that each multicast group be associated with a single root (in BGMP it is referred
    to as the root domain).  It requires that different ranges of the multicast address
    space are associated (e.g., with Unicast-Prefix-Based Multicast addressing) with
    different domains.  Each of these domains then becomes the root of the shared
    domain-trees for all groups in its range.  Multicast participants will generally
    receive better multicast service if the session initiator's address allocator
    selects addresses from its own domain's part of the space, thereby causing the
    root domain to be local to at least one of the session participants.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

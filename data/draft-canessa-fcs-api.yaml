  content: "During the past twelve months there has been interest in Fixed Content
    \nStorage servers.  Vendors have been introducing offerings that use \nproprietary
    API calls.  This is causing delay in acceptance.  By using \na set of standard
    API calls software developers, vendors and end-users \nwould benefit.\n\nThis
    document provides background on the need for an API.  It defines \na simple and
    reduced yet robust set of Application Programming \nInterface (API) calls to be
    supported by implementations of FCS \nservers.\n\nStore, query and retrieve operations
    are described in detail.  The \nconcept, description and format of a Global Unique
    Identifier (GUID) \nare provided.  A GUID serves as a unique handle to each object
    stored \nby a FCS server.  The list of the set of API calls is defined.  A \nbasic
    set of data structures and support functions is presented.\n\t "

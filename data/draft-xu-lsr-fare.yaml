  content: "   Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become increasingly\n
    \  popular in recent years due to their impressive performance in\n   various
    natural language processing tasks.  These models are built by\n   training deep
    neural networks on massive amounts of text data, as\n   well as visual and video
    data, often consisting of billions or even\n   trillions of parameters.  However,
    the training process for these\n   models can be extremely resource-intensive,
    requiring the deployment\n   of thousands or even tens of thousands of GPUs in
    a single AI\n   training cluster.  Therefore, three-stage or even five-stage CLOS\n
    \  networks are commonly adopted for AI networks.  The non-blocking\n   nature
    of the network become increasingly critical for large-scale AI\n   models.  Therefore,
    adaptive routing is necessary to dynamically\n   distribute traffic to the same
    destination over multiple equal-cost\n   paths, based on network capacity and
    even congestion information\n   along those paths.\n\n\n\t "

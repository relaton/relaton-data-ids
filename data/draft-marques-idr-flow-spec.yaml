  content: "This document defines a new BGP NLRI encoding format that can be used\n
    \  to distribute traffic flow specifications.  This allows the routing\n   system
    to propagate information regarding more-specific components of\n   the traffic
    aggregate defined by an IP destination prefix.\n\n   Additionally it defines two
    applications of that encoding format.\n   One that can be used to automate inter-domain
    coordination of traffic\n   filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate\n
    \  (distributed) denial of service attacks.  And a second application to\n   traffic
    filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service.\n\n   The information is carried
    via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),\n   thereby reusing protocol algorithms,
    operational experience and\n   administrative processes such as inter-provider
    peering agreements.\n\t "

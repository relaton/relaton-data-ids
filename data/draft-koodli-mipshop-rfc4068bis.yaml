  content: "   Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to\n
    \  the Internet when moving from an Access Router to another, a process\n   referred
    to as handover.  During handover, there is a period when\n   the Mobile Node is
    unable to send or receive packets due to both\n   link switching delay and IP
    protocol operations.  This ``handover\n   latency'' resulting from standard Mobile
    IPv6 procedures, namely\n   movement detection, new Care of Address configuration
    and Binding\n   Update, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice\n
    \  over IP. Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non\n   real-time,
    throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This document\n   specifies a protocol
    to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6\n   procedures.  This document
    does not address improving the link\n   switching latency.\n\t "

  content: "A fractional-forwarding scheme is a highly compact, flexible scheme\nfor
    specify routing for both traffic engineering (TE) and fast\nrerouting.  The ability
    of fractional forwarding can be a key benefit\nof MPLS over OSPF/IS-IS.  Many
    highly effective TE algorithms are\nproposed and evaluated based on fractional
    forwarding.\n\nIn this document, we propose MPLS-ff, an extension to MPLS to allow\nefficient
    implementation of fractional forwarding.  We present the\nrequired extensions
    in the MPLS data forwarding plane.  We also list\nthe requirements in signaling
    for MPLS-ff.\n\t "

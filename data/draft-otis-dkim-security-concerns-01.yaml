  content: "   This document describes a few security concerns remaining within the\n
    \  working group draft of the DKIM base document.  As the base document\n   is
    a work-in-progress, some issues may have been already resolved.\n   As with many
    protocols, accommodations for convenience are balanced\n   against possible negative
    security repercussions.  This draft\n   attempts to expand upon some of these
    repercussions.  In addition,\n   some threat scenarios may have been considered
    too improbable to\n   warrant the inclusion of mechanisms exceeding prior strategies.
    \ This\n   draft attempts to justify added precaution.  And lastly, some\n   considerations
    may have neglected a transformation occurring with the\n   display of the email-address
    localpart and domain impacting a\n   recipient's recognition.  This draft offers
    minor remedies for these\n   security related issues.\n\t "

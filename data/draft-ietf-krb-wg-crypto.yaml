  content: "This document describes a framework for defining encryption and checksum
    mechanisms for use with the Kerberos protocol, defining an abstraction layer between
    the Kerberos protocol and related protocols, and the actual mechanisms themselves.
    \ The document also defines several mechanisms.  Some are taken from RFC 1510,
    modified in form to fit this new framework and occasionally modified in content
    when the old specification was incorrect.  New mechanisms are presented here as
    well.  This document does NOT indicate which mechanisms may be considered \"required
    to implement\". [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

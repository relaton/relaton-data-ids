  content: "People often refer to things in the real world by a common name or\nphrase,
    e.g., a trade name, company name, or a book title. These\nnames are sometimes
    easier for people to remember  and type than\nURLs.  Furthermore, because of the
    limited syntax of URLs, companies\nand individuals are finding that the ones that
    might be most\nreasonable for their resources are being used elsewhere and so
    are\nunavailable. For the purposes of this document, a 'common name' is a\nword
    or a phrase, without imposed syntactic structure, that may be\nassociated with
    a resource.\n\t "

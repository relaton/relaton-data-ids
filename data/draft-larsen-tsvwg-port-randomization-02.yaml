  script: Latn
  content: "Recently, awareness has been raised about a number of \"blind\" attacks\n
    \  that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n   and
    similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks range from\n   throughput-reduction
    to broken connections or data corruption.  These\n   attacks rely on the attacker's
    ability to guess or know the four-\n   tuple (Source Address, Destination Address,
    Source port, Destination\n   Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance
    to be attacked.\n   This document describes a simple and efficient method for
    random\n   selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an\n
    \  attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  While this is not a\n   replacement
    for cryptographic methods, the described port number\n   randomization algorithms
    provide improved security/obfuscation with\n   very little effort and without
    any key management overhead.\n\t "

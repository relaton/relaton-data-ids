  content: "A method is proposed for providing key information for use between\na
    mobile node and correspondent node, to be used for the purpose of\nauthenticating
    Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates.  The key distribution\nis secure except against man-in-the-middle
    attacks, when the\nattacker resides along the routing path between the correspondent\nnode
    and the mobile node's home agent.  The key can be used for\nauthenticating subsequent
    Binding Updates from the same mobile node,\nsubstantially reducing the number
    of key establishment cycles needed\nfor maintaining efficient communication paths
    between the mobile node\nand correspondent node.\n\t "

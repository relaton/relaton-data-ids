  content: "Network security incidents such as Denial of Service (DoS), system\n    compromises,
    worms, and viruses typically result in the loss of\n    service, data, and resources
    both human and system.  Security\n    incidents can be detrimental to the health
    of the network as a\n    whole.  Network Providers (NP) need to be equipped and
    ready to\n    assist in tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in\n
    \   place before the occurrence of an attack.  This paper proposes a\n    proactive
    inter-network communication method to integrate existing\n\n    tracing mechanisms
    across NP boundaries to identify the source(s)\n    of an attack. The various
    methods implemented to detect and trace\n    attacks must be coordinated on the
    NPs network as well as provide a\n    communication mechanism across network borders.
    \ It is imperative\n    that NPs have quick communication methods defined to enable\n
    \   neighboring NPs to assist in tracking a security incident across\n    the
    Internet.  This proposal integrates current incident detection\n    and tracing
    practices for network traffic, which could be extended\n    for security incident
    handling.  Policy guidelines for handling\n    incidents are recommended and can
    be agreed upon by a consortium\n    using the defined protocol and extended to
    each NP's clients.\n\t "

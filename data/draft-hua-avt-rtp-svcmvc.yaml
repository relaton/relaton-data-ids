  content: "   This memo specifies how to support RTP packet stream thinning (or\n
    \  rate adaptation) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) with the\n   Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) running over UDP to make effect in\n   parallel with
    reliable RTCP report to the RTP sender.  It introduces\n   \"dummy RTP packets\"
    into the single-session transmission (SST) mode\n   for Scalable Video Coding
    (SVC) and Multiview Video Coding (MVC).\n   The reactions of RTP receivers upon
    receiving the \"dummy RTP packets\"\n   are defined.  The document also recommend
    to extend the ECN\n   functionalities based on the scalability feature of SVC
    and MVC.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the AI-Native Network Protocol (AINP) version
    0.1, a semantic communication protocol designed for intent exchange between AI
    agents. AINP replaces location-based routing with semantic routing, byte-stream
    delivery with intent delivery, and simple handshakes with multi-round negotiation.
    AINP enables agents to discover each other by capability rather than network location,
    negotiate terms autonomously, and exchange structured intents with cryptographic
    security.</p>"

  content: "   This document specifies the AI-Native Network Protocol (AINP) version\n
    \  0.1, a semantic communication protocol designed for intent exchange\n   between
    AI agents.  AINP replaces location-based routing with\n   semantic routing, byte-stream
    delivery with intent delivery, and\n   simple handshakes with multi-round negotiation.
    \ AINP enables agents\n   to discover each other by capability rather than network
    location,\n   negotiate terms autonomously, and exchange structured intents with\n
    \  cryptographic security.\n\n\t "

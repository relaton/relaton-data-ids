- language: en

  content: "This document proposes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize\nthe
    negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart. An End-of-RIB\nmarker is specified
    and can be used to convey routing convergence\ninformation.  A new BGP capability,
    termed 'Graceful Restart\nCapability', is defined which would allow a BGP speaker
    to express\nits ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart. Finally,\nprocedures
    are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information\nacross a TCP transport
    reset.\n\t "

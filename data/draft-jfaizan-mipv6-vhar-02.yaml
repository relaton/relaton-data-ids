  content: "   Current specifications of Mobile IPv6 does not provide Home Agent \n
    \  Reliability in the home link. The aim of this draft is to introduce \n   Virtual
    Home Agent Reliability Protocol as the solution. In this \n   protocol multiple
    Home Agents coexist on the same home link and share \n   the same Global IP address.
    Only one of them is active at a time and \n   serves the Mobile Node. The Home
    Agent failure and failover \n   mechanisms are completely transparent to the Mobile
    Node which is \n   required for minimal service interruption time. This protocol
    does \n   not introduce any new Mobile IPv6 message over the air interface and
    \n   thus helps reducing the overall overhead.   Current specifications of Mobile

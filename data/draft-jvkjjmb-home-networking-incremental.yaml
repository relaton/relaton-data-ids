  content: "   The home network is an environment subject to ongoing evolution and\n
    \  change.  Many home networks today are simplistic in nature, often\n   comprising
    of a single router/gateway.  The expectation over time is\n   predicated on the
    notion that the home network will be more complex\n   servicing many in-home and
    Internet functions.  The home network will\n   evolve necessitating the replacement
    and update to current hardware\n   and software to more advanced devices and software
    capable of\n   operating in more complex environments.  This document provides
    a\n   view on how the home network can progress from today's foundational\n   form,
    to a more advanced environment, using progressive technological\n   capabilities.\n\n\n\t "

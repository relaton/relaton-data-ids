  content: "   IEEE 802.1 has developed standards as part of its Data Center\n   Bridging
    (DCB) activity to (1) efficiently minimize data loss due to\n   queue overflow
    for selected classes of traffic within Local Area\n   Networks (LANs) meeting
    certain conditions and (2) provide means to\n   allocate the available bandwidth
    on links to different classes of\n   traffic. These standards are now in IEEE
    Std 802.1Qbb-2011, IEEE Std\n   802.1Qaz-2011, and the Congestion Notificaiton
    freature in IEEE Std\n   802.1Q-2011.\n\n   This document briefly explains these
    standards and discusses the\n   support of these IEEE 802 standards in TRILL switches
    (devices that\n   implement the IETF TRILL protocol standard).\n\n\n\t "

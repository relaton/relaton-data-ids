  content: "The base mobile-IP specification allows mobile computers to move freely
    between various points of attachment to the Internet.  However, each time the
    mobile computer moves, a Registration Request message has to be approved by the
    mobile node's Home Agent.  In cases where the home agent is far away, it may become
    too expensive or (in the cases of network partition) even impossible to complete
    these frequent registrations.  In this draft document, we specify a new variety
    of registration, using a Regional Registration Request and Regional Registration
    Reply, that is no longer always required to be transacted with the home agent.\n\t "

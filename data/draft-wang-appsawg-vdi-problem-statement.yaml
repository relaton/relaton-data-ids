  content: "   The Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a technology to separate local\n
    \  desktop and remote computing/storage resources, which was initially\n   derived
    from the remote desktop administration but with new business\n   models and very
    different use cases.  Most of existing VDI systems\n   are based on proprietary
    implementation, and positioning different\n   market with different features.
    \ Since virtual desktop technology is\n   believed to be a mainstream application
    delivery method, like http\n   protocol against web applications, so it's important
    to make the\n   virtual desktop access protocol open and standard.  This draft\n
    \  summarizes the limitations of existing virtual desktop systems, and\n   proposes
    the intent standardization work in IETF.\n\n\t "

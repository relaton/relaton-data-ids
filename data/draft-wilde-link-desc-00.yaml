  content: "   Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by links, and\n
    \  these links often define certain expectations about the interactions\n   (such
    as HTTP methods being used, media types being sent in the\n   request, or URI
    parameters being used in a certain way).  While these\n   expectations are essential
    to define the possible framework for\n   interactions, it may be useful to further
    narrow them down by\n   providing link descriptions, which can help clients to
    gain more\n   runtime knowledge about the resource they are about to interact
    with.\n   This memo defines Link Descriptions, a model and associated media\n
    \  type that can be used to describe links by supporting descriptive\n   markup
    for representing interaction information with links.  Link\n   Descriptions can
    be used by media types (by inclusion or by\n   reference) that seek to make Link
    Descriptions runtime-capable,\n   without having to create their own representation.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines hybrid key exchange methods based on classical\n
    \  ECDH key exchange and post-quantum key encapsulation schemes.  These\n   methods
    are defined for use in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol.  It\n   also defines
    post-quantum public key authentication methods based on\n   post-quantum signature
    schemes.  These methods are defined for use in\n   the SSH Authentication Protocol.\n\nNote\n\n
    \  EDNOTE: The goal of this draft is to start the standardization of PQ\n   algorithms
    in SSH early to mitigate the potential record-and-harvest\n   later with a quantum
    computer attacks.  This draft is not expected to\n   be finalized before the NIST
    PQ Project has standardized PQ\n   algorithms.  After NIST has standardized then
    this document will\n   replace TBD1, TBD3 with the appropriate algorithms and
    parameters\n   before proceeding to ratification.\n\n   EDNOTE: Discussion of
    this work is encouraged to happen on the IETF\n   WG Mailing List or in the GitHub
    repository which contains the draft:\n   https://github.com/csosto-pk/pq-ssh/issues

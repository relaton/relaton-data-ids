  content: "In this draft, we propose an architecture for the inter-area LSP setup\nbased
    on a combination of constraints. We derive the\narchitectural requirements for
    the routing protocols, signaling\nprotocols and the MIBs to support such an idea.
    We also demonstrate how\nsuch a mechanism will reduce the crankback during LSP
    setup. A possible\noutline of the modifications to the CSPF algorithm and examples
    are\npresented. In the companion document [INTER_AREA_EXT] we elaborate on\nthe
    extensions required for such architecture.\n\n\t "

  content: "RFC 3031 permits MPLS load balancing while making no specific\nrepresentations
    as to implementation requirements. This has\nsubsequently become an issue with
    respect to the reliability of path\ntest mechanisms. Load balancing algorithms
    may separate path test\nprobes from the path of interest. This document proposes
    guidelines\nfor implementation of load balancing such that path test mechanisms\nare
    not impacted.\n\t "

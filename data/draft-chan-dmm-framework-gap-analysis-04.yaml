  script: Latn
  content: "   This document introduces a framework for analyzing mobility\n   management
    protocols in terms of their key abstracted logical\n   functions.  The framework
    is capable of presenting a unified view,\n   reducing the clutter that obscures
    a casual reader from understanding\n   the commonalities between different approaches
    in mobility\n   management.  More importantly, a first order application of this\n
    \  framework allows us to examine previously standardized mobility\n   management
    protocols, such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several of\n   their extensions),
    and describe their core functionality in terms of\n   different configurations
    of the logical functions defined by the\n   framework.  As a result, we can use
    the framework to analyze the gaps\n   between the protocols needed in a distributed
    mobility management\n   environment and the functionality provided by the current
    generation\n   of mobility management protocols.  Our analysis points to the need\n
    \  for a re-configuration of logical functions identified in the\n   framework
    as well as the need for new extensions which can make\n   distributed mobility
    management possible in the future.\n\n\t "

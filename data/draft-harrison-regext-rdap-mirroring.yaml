  content: "   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by Regional\n
    \  Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to\n   provide
    access to their resource registration information.  While\n   most clients can
    retrieve the information they need on an ad hoc\n   basis from the public services
    maintained by each registry, there are\n   instances where local copies of those
    remote data sources need to be\n   maintained, for various reasons (e.g.  performance
    requirements).\n   This document defines a protocol for transferring bulk RDAP
    response\n   data and for keeping a local copy of that data up to date.\n\n\t "

  content: "   There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical SDN context, in\n
    \  which an orchestrator may not have detailed information to be able\n   to perform
    an end-to-end path computation and would need to request\n   lower layer/domain
    controllers to calculate some (partial) feasible\n   paths.\n\n   Multiple protocol
    solutions can be used for communication between\n   different controller hierarchical
    levels. This document assumes that\n   the controllers are communicating using
    YANG-based Application\n   Programming Interface (APIs).\n\n   This document describes
    some use cases for an Application\n   Programming Interface for path computation.
    A related yang model\n   will be proposed in a next version or in another document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a conceptual database, the Routing\n   Authentication
    Policy Database (RAPD), which cooperates with the key\n   table to provide the
    configuration information for the automated key\n   management protocols in generating
    key materials for routing\n   protocols.  Additionally, the RAPD also provides
    authorization\n   policies so as to guarantee that the keying material for securing\n
    \  routing protocol exchanges is distributed only to the appropriate\n   peers.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Invariant-Closed System Design (ICSD) defines an architectural principle
    for building systems in which all representable states are valid and compliant
    by construction. Rather than relying on runtime detection, validation, or remediation
    of invalid or abusive behaviour, ICSD ensures that invalid states are structurally
    unrepresentable through constrained state models, invariant-bound transitions,
    and authority-anchored truth sources. This document introduces the ICSD concept,
    its core properties, design trade-offs, and applicability to compliance-critical
    domains such as payroll, taxation, financial reporting, and regulated infrastructure.
    It is intended for discussion and experimentation in environments requiring high
    assurance of correctness, auditability, and resistance to abuse.</p>"

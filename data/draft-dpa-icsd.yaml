  content: "   Invariant-Closed System Design (ICSD) defines an architectural\n   principle
    for building systems in which all representable states are\n   valid and compliant
    by construction.  Rather than relying on runtime\n   detection, validation, or
    remediation of invalid or abusive\n   behaviour, ICSD ensures that invalid states
    are structurally\n   unrepresentable through constrained state models, invariant-bound\n
    \  transitions, and authority-anchored truth sources.\n\n   This document introduces
    the ICSD concept, its core properties,\n   design trade-offs, and applicability
    to compliance-critical domains\n   such as payroll, taxation, financial reporting,
    and regulated\n   infrastructure.  It is intended for discussion and experimentation
    in\n   environments requiring high assurance of correctness, auditability,\n   and
    resistance to abuse.\n\n\t "

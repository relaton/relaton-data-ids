  content: "As part of the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture [3], \nconference
    course control deals with the control of running \nconferences after the creation
    of the initial conference state with \nrespect to the membership and access control
    during runtime of the \nsession. The spectrum of scenarios reaches from small
    multiparty \ngatherings up to large scaled meetings with a high fluctuation of
    \nuser’s membership and activity. \nThis document identifies the problem areas
    to define the scope of \nconference course control efforts within the IETF. \n\n\t "

  content: "   There exist many extensions to Internet addressing, as it is defined\n
    \  in [RFC0791] for IPv4 and [RFC8200] for IPv6, respectively.  Those\n   extensions
    have been developed to fill gaps in capabilities beyond\n   the basic properties
    of Internet addressing.  This document outlines\n   those properties as a baseline
    against which the extensions are\n   categorized in terms of methodology used
    to fill the gap together\n   with examples of solutions doing so.\n\n   While
    introducing such extensions, we outline the issues we see with\n   those extensions.
    \ This ultimately leads to consider whether or not a\n   more consistent approach
    to tackling the identified gaps, beyond\n   point-wise extensions as done so far,
    would be beneficial.  The\n   benefits are the ones detailed in the companion
    document\n   [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing], where, leveraging
    on\n   the gaps identified in this memo and scenarios provided in\n   [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing],
    a clear problem\n   statement is provided.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo proposes a lightweight and incremental approach to\n   improving
    early cross-area review in the IETF.  This proposal has two\n   specific goals.
    Firstly, the current perception is that the IETF\n   standardization process is
    bogged down and takes far too long.  One\n   factor in this slowness appears to
    be the workload placed upon the\n   IESG when documents are brought to them.  Given
    that one role of the\n   IESG has been to provide cross-area review, offloading
    some portion\n   of that work may increase the speed of the process.  Secondly,\n
    \  cross-area review done early in the process may be a good tool for\n   identifying
    significant problems with a Working Group's efforts long\n   before the documents
    reach the IESG.  As such, the early cross-area\n   review can improve the quality
    of the output from the Working Group\n   by sifting the wheat from the chaff.\n\t "

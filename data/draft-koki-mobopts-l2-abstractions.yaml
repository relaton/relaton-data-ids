  content: "This draft proposes unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fast\nhandovers.
    \ For efficient network communication, it is vital for a\nprotocol layer to know
    or utilize other layer's information such as a\nform of L2 triggers.  However,
    each protocol layer is basically\ndesigned independently.  Since each protocol
    layer is also\nimplemented independently in current operating systems, it is very\nhard
    to exchange control information between protocol layers.  To\nsolve the problem,
    this draft defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions\nin the form of \"primitive\"
    to achieve fast handovers in the network\nlayer.  This mechanism is called \"L3-driven
    fast handovers\" because\nthe network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by using
    the\n\"primitives\".\n\t "

  content: "This document defines textual conventions for the constants used in\nMIBs
    for the IPsec protocols.  In particular, it documents those\nnumbers whose assignments
    are managed by the IANA, with new\nassignments being made over time.  The textual
    conventions provide\nIPsec-related MIBs with clearer documentation, and insulate
    them from\nhaving to track new assignments by the IANA.\nThe MIB documented by
    this document will become a separate living\ndocument maintained by the IANA,
    and will be the document of record\nfor these assignments.\n\t "

  content: "   Cloud Computing has been attracting a lot of attention from the\n   networking
    industry. Some of the most publicized requirements are\n   related to the evolution
    of the Cloud Networking Infrastructure to\n   accommodate a large number of tenants,
    efficient network utilization,\n   scalable loop avoidance, and Virtual Machine
    Mobility.\n\n   This draft describes a framework for cloud networking, highlighting\n
    \  the applicability of existing work in various IETF Working Groups\n   (e.g.,
    RFCs and drafts developed in IETF L2VPN and L3VPN Working\n   Groups) to cloud
    networking, and the gaps and problems that need to\n   be further addressed. That
    is, the goal is to understand what may be\n   re-used from the current protocols
    and call out requirements specific\n   to the Cloud space that need to be addressed
    by new standardization\n   work with proposed solutions in certain cases.\n\n\t "

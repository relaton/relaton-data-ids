  content: "   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and\n   networks.
    \ Basic CoAP messages work well for the small payloads we\n   expect from temperature
    sensors, light switches, and similar\n   building-automation devices.  Occasionally,
    however, applications\n   will need to transfer larger payloads -- for instance,
    for firmware\n   updates.  With HTTP, TCP does the grunt work of slicing large\n
    \  payloads up into multiple packets and ensuring that they all arrive\n   and
    are handled in the right order.\n\n   CoAP is based on datagram transports such
    as UDP or DTLS, which\n   limits the maximum size of resource representations
    that can be\n   transferred without too much fragmentation.  Although UDP supports\n
    \  larger payloads through IP fragmentation, it is limited to 64 KiB\n   and,
    more importantly, doesn't really work well for constrained\n   applications and
    networks.\n\n   Instead of relying on IP fragmentation, this specification extends\n
    \  basic CoAP with a pair of \"Block\" options, for transferring multiple\n   blocks
    of information from a resource representation in multiple\n   request-response
    pairs.  In many important cases, the Block options\n   enable a server to be truly
    stateless: the server can handle each\n   block transfer separately, with no need
    for a connection setup or\n   other server-side memory of previous block transfers.\n\n
    \  In summary, the Block options provide a minimal way to transfer\n   larger
    representations in a block-wise fashion.\n\n   The present revision -11 fixes
    one example and adds the text and\n   examples about the Block/Observe interaction,
    taken from -observe.\n   It also adds a couple of formatting bugs from the new
    xml2rfc.  The\n   \"grand rewrite\" is next.\n\n\t "

  content: "Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and\nIPv6-only
    hosts at the same time.  Such networks also want to IPv6/\nIPv4 translation for
    the IPv6-only host so it can access servers on\nthe IPv4 Internet.  On such a
    network, the synthesized AAAA responses\nfrom a DNS64 can cause traffic to be
    translated.  This document\ndescribes a solution to avoid that translation when
    the application\nuses DNS.\n\t "

  content: "   Over the years, it has been noticed that network firewalls are an\n
    \  inadequeate mechanism in most cases for protecting the hosts,\n   especially
    from internal attacks.  This document analyzes two\n   security paradigms, the
    network-based and the host-based\n   (distributed), and in consequence outlines
    a problem statement and\n   framework for distributed security.\n\t "

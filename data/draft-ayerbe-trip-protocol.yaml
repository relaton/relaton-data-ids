abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity
    Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for establishing claims of physical-world
    presence through cryptographically signed, spatially quantized location attestations
    called "breadcrumbs." Breadcrumbs are chained into an append-only log, bundled
    into verifiable epochs, and distilled into a Trajectory Identity Token (TIT) that
    serves as a persistent pseudonymous identifier. Trust in a TIT accumulates through
    spatiotemporal diversity of the underlying trajectory rather than through biometric
    capture or centralized credential issuance. TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic
    and operates independently of any particular naming system, blockchain, or application
    layer.</p>

abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity
    Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for establishing claims of physical-world
    presence through cryptographically signed, spatially quantized location attestations
    called "breadcrumbs." Breadcrumbs are chained into an append-only log, bundled
    into verifiable epochs, and distilled into a Trajectory Identity Token (TIT) that
    serves as a persistent pseudonymous identifier. This revision introduces a formal
    trust-scoring framework grounded in statistical physics. A Criticality Engine
    evaluates the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of movement trajectories for the 1/f
    signature characteristic of biological Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). A mobility
    model based on truncated Levy flights and Markov anchor transition matrices enforces
    known constraints of human movement. A six-component Hamiltonian energy function
    detects anomalies in real time by combining spatial, temporal, kinetic, flock-alignment,
    contextual, and structural analysis of each breadcrumb against the identity's
    learned behavioral profile. TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic and operates
    independently of any particular naming system, blockchain, or application layer.</p>

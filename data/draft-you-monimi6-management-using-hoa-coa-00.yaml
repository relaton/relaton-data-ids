abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes a simple method that multiple HoAs obtained by \neach
    of heterogeneous interfaces should be registered to home agents \nas like CoAs
    to support benefits of multihoming, such as ubiquitous \naccessibility, redundancy,
    and inter interface handover. However, a protocol for using HoA as CoA was already
    referred by [ID.Multi_PB]. \nIn this draft, we should extend situation that HoAs
    are used as like \nCoAs, and modify registration protocol for multiple CoAs [ID.MCoA]
    \n[ID.MMI] to support reliable and robust network connectivity. \n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Unicode Standard and ISO/IEC 10646 jointly define a coded\n   character
    set, referred to as Unicode, which encompasses most of the\n   world's writing
    systems.  Characters of the same language are\n   arranged close to each other
    in the Unicode code table.  This memo\n   proposes a dynamic Unicode transformation
    format(DUTF).  DUTF has the\n   characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII
    range, and uses XOR to\n   calculate the offset value between the Unicode code
    point of adjacent\n   non-ASCII characters in the source string, then encodes
    the result as\n   a variable-length sequence of octets.\n\n\t "

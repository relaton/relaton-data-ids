  content: "This document presents the Service Management Architecture, an architectural
    framework for defining SNMP MIB modules for Customer Network Management (CNM)
    of network services over connection-oriented networks.  The work is motivated
    by the fundamental differences in management views and functionality between a
    service provider and a service customer.  Differences between service provider
    and service customer include whole-network vs. network-portion view, direct vs.
    \ indirect management, and physical vs. logical view.  These fundamental differences
    suggest a difference in philosophy between Service Management and Device Management.
    Much work has been done and experience gained in writing Device MIB modules for
    hands-on management of physical devices, but defining Service MIB modules is a
    relatively new area and requires the development of a new architectural framework.\n\t "

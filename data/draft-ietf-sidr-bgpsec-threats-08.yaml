abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a threat model for the context in which\n   Exterior
    Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) path security mechanisms will\n   be developed.
    \ The threat model includes an analysis of the Resource\n   Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI), and focuses on the ability of an\n   autonomous system (AS) to verify
    the authenticity of the AS path info\n   received in a BGP update.  We use the
    term PATHSEC to refer to any\n   BGP path security technology that makes use of
    the RPKI.  PATHSEC\n   will secure BGP, consistent with the inter-AS security
    focus of the\n   RPKI.\n\n   The document characterizes classes of potential adversaries
    that are\n   considered to be threats, and examines classes of attacks that might\n
    \  be launched against PATHSEC.  It does not revisit attacks against\n   unprotected
    BGP, as that topic has already been addressed in the\n   BGP-4 standard.  It concludes
    with brief discussion of residual\n   vulnerabilities.\n\n\t "

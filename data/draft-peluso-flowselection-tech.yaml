  content: "Flow selection is the process in charge of electing a limited number\nof
    flows from all of those observed at an observation point to be\nconsidered into
    the measurement process chain.  The flow selection\nprocess can be enabled at
    different stages of the monitoring\nreference model.  It can be performed at metering
    time once the\npacket classification has been executed, i.e. flow state dependent\npacket
    selection, or at recording/exporting time by limiting the\nnumber of flows to
    be stored and/or exported to the collector\napplications.  This document illustrates
    the motivations which might\nlead flow selection to be performed and presents
    a classification of\nthe related techniques.  The document furthermore provides
    an\ninformation model for configuring flow selection techniques and\ndiscusses
    what information about the flow selection process is\nbeneficial to be exported
    by adopting a suitable information model.\n\t "

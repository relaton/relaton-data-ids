  content: "   This document defines three YANG 1.1 modules: the first defines\n   features
    and groupings common to both SSH clients and SSH servers,\n   the second defines
    a grouping for a generic SSH client, and the third\n   defines a grouping for
    a generic SSH server.\n\nEditorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)\n\n   This
    draft contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with\n   finalized
    values at the time of publication.  This note summarizes\n   all of the substitutions
    that are needed.  No other RFC Editor\n   instructions are specified elsewhere
    in this document.\n\n   Artwork in this document contains shorthand references
    to drafts in\n   progress.  Please apply the following replacements:\n\n   *  AAAA
    --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-\n      types\n\n   *
    \ BBBB --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-trust-\n      anchors\n\n
    \  *  CCCC --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-keystore\n\n   *
    \ DDDD --> the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-\n      server\n\n
    \  *  EEEE --> the assigned RFC value for this draft\n\n   Artwork in this document
    contains placeholder values for the date of\n   publication of this draft.  Please
    apply the following replacement:\n\n   *  2022-12-12 --> the publication date
    of this draft\n   The \"Relation to other RFCs\" section Section 1.1 contains
    the text\n   \"one or more YANG modules\" and, later, \"modules\".  This text
    is\n   sourced from a file in a context where it is unknown how many modules\n
    \  a draft defines.  The text is not wrong as is, but it may be improved\n   by
    stating more directly how many modules are defined.\n\n   The \"Relation to other
    RFCs\" section Section 1.1 contains a self-\n   reference to this draft, along
    with a corresponding Informative\n   Reference in the Appendix.\n\n   The following
    Appendix section is to be removed prior to publication:\n\n   *  Appendix B.  Change
    Log\n\n\t "

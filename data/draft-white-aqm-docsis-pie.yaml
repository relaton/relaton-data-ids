  content: "   DOCSIS cable modems provide broadband Internet access to over one\n
    \  hundred million users worldwide.  They are commonly positioned at the\n   head
    of the bottleneck link for traffic in the upstream direction\n   (from the customer),
    and as a result, the impact of buffering and\n   bufferbloat in the cable modem
    can have a significant effect on user\n   experience.  The CableLabs DOCSIS 3.1
    specification includes\n   requirements for cable modems to support an Active
    Queue Management\n   (AQM) algorithm that is intended to alleviate the impact
    that\n   buffering has on latency sensitive traffic, while preserving bulk\n   throughput
    performance.  In addition, the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0\n   specifications have also
    been amended to contain similar\n   requirements.\n\n\t "

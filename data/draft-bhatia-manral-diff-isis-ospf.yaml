  content: "The increasing popularity of IS-IS [IS-IS] and OSPF [OSPF] over    \n
    \  the years has drawn significant attention to the relative merits and \n   de-merits
    of one with respect to the other. This draft presents an \n   elaborate comparison
    between the two routing protocols to explain how \n   the features and functionalities
    of one differs from the other. \n   Wherever applicable the differences between
    OSPFv2 and OSPFv3[OSPFv3] \n   have also been pointed out.\n\t "

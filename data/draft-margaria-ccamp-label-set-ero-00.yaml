  script: Latn
  content: "   The paths chosen by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)\n
    \  Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be constrained using the Explicit\n   Route
    (ERO) object and related sub-objects.  Standard ERO sub-objects\n   can specify
    the Autonomous System (AS), LSR Node Ids, Numbered or\n   unnumbered TE links,
    downstream and upstream labels, and PCE path\n   keys thus restricting which resources
    are to be used by a TE-LSP.\n\n   The Explicit Label Control (ELC) in the explicit
    route object (ERO)\n   allows both terminating an LSP on a particular outgoing
    port and\n   label of an egress node, as well as restricting which label to use
    on\n   any hop along the path determined by the route.  However, currently,\n
    \  its not allowed to specify more than 2 labels (downstream and\n   upstream
    label), and it is not possible to specify, for a given\n   section or segment
    of a TE-LSP path, a set of labels to restrict\n   which label to be allocated
    from a Set of candidate labels.\n\n   This memo provides extensions to the RSVP-TE
    and PCEP protocols to\n   support Label Sets in the form of ERO sub-objects, being
    applicable\n   to ERO and ERO-like (IRO, RRO, XRO) sub-objects, extending the
    ELC\n   concept to a set of candidate labels.\n\n\t "

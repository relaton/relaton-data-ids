  content: "Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] provides data \n   integrity
    protection, confidentiality and data origin authentication \n   for data transported
    in an IP packet.  \n    \n   There are various applications and protocols that
    do not require \n   confidentiality but only need data integrity assurance or
    data origin \n   authentication. Since ESP support is mandatory for IPSec, such
    \n   applications end up using ESP with NULL encryption. \n    \n   However, because
    of the way ESP is defined, it is impossible for \n   firewalls and intermediate
    routers to differentiate between encrypted \n   ESP and ESP NULL packets by simply
    examining them. This poses \n   problems for the firewalls since such packets
    cannot be filtered and \n   identified. It poses a different set of problems for
    routers since \n   such packets cannot be properly filtered, classified and prioritized.
    \n    \n   This document proposes an extension to ESP so that firewalls and \n
    \  routers can disambiguate between ESP encrypted and ESP NULL encrypted \n   packets.

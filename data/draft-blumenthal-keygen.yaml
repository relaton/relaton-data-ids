  content: "This document describes Pseudo Random Function (PRF) based on \nMAC function
    (keyed iterated hash function), and offers a ref-\nerence implementation of PRF
    based on SHA-1. \nThis PRF can be used to produce cryptographic keys for authen-\ntication/integrity
    and encryption. It uses pre-shared secret \nand publicly known random value (and
    possibly parties’ identi-\nties). The main advantage of this algorithm over other
    similar \nones is that its security is formally tied to the MAC property \nof
    the underlying function.\n\t "

  content: "   PANA design provides support for various types of deployments. Access\n
    \  networks can differ based on the availability of lower-layer\n   security,
    placement of PANA entities, choice of client IP\n   configuration and authentication
    methods, etc.  This I-D defines a\n   general framework for describing how these
    various deployment choices\n   are handled by PANA and the access network architectures.\n
    \  Additionally, two possible deployments are described in detail: using\n   PANA
    over DSL networks and WLAN networks.\n\t "

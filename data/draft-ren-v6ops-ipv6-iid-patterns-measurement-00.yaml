  content: "   Interface Identifiers (IIDs) are critical components of IPv6\n   addresses,
    significantly impacting user privacy and the feasibility\n   of network reconnaissance.
    \ RFC 7707 previously provided a\n   comprehensive analysis of IID patterns based
    on data from the early\n   stages of IPv6 deployment.  However, with the widespread
    adoption of\n   privacy-enhancing standards such as RFC 7217, historical data
    no\n   longer accurately reflects the current IPv6 ecosystem.  This document\n
    \  provides updated measurements of IID patterns by utilizing an\n   improved
    pattern recognition method and incorporating novel data\n   sources, such as public
    mailing lists.  The measurement data reveals\n   that while \"Low-byte\" patterns
    have decreased significantly in server\n   addresses, a substantial number of
    seemingly random addresses\n   actually belong to non-random, specific patterns,
    implying that\n   heuristic scanning remains a viable vector.  Furthermore, while\n
    \  client devices have widely adopted randomized addresses-effectively\n   enhancing
    privacy-Client Premise Equipment (CPE) routers continue to\n   exhibit a high
    usage rate of IEEE EUI-64 addresses, constituting an\n   often-overlooked privacy
    risk.  This document aims to update the\n   statistics and analysis regarding
    IID pattern distribution found in\n   RFC 7707, providing essential insights for
    modern network defense\n   strategies and standard compliance.\n\n\t "

  content: "The end-to-end principle is the core architectural guideline of the Internet.
    \ In this document, we briefly examine the development of the end-to-end principle
    as it has been applied to the Internet architecture over the years.  We discuss
    current trends in the evolution of the Internet architecture in relation to the
    end-to-end principle, and try to draw some conclusion about the evolution of the
    end-to-end principle, and thus for the Internet architecture which it supports,
    in light of these current trends.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

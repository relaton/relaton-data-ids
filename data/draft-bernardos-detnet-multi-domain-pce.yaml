  content: "   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides the capability to carry\n
    \  specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications\n   with
    extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency over a path or\n   network.
    \ As DetNet deployments expand, they will inevitably need to\n   span multiple
    domains that may be under separate administrative or\n   technological control.
    \ This creates a need for a control plane\n   solution that can establish and
    maintain end-to-end DetNet services\n   across these domain boundaries.\n\n   This
    document defines a framework for a Path Computation Element\n   (PCE)-based control
    plane for multi-domain DetNet.  It first\n   establishes a working definition
    of a \"DetNet Domain\" for the purpose\n   of path computation and control.  It
    then describes two high-level\n   architectural approaches for inter-domain path
    computation and\n   resource reservation: a Hierarchical PCE model and a peer-to-peer
    PCE\n   \"stitching\" model.  This framework provides the foundation for more\n
    \  specific work on multi-domain DetNet solutions.\n\n\t "

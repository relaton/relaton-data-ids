abstract:
- content: '<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides the capability to carry
    specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely
    low data loss rates and bounded latency over a path or network. As DetNet deployments
    expand, they will inevitably need to span multiple domains that may be under separate
    administrative or technological control. This creates a need for a control plane
    solution that can establish and maintain end-to-end DetNet services across these
    domain boundaries. This document defines a framework for a Path Computation Element
    (PCE)-based control plane for multi-domain DetNet. It first establishes a working
    definition of a "DetNet Domain" for the purpose of path computation and control.
    It then describes two high-level architectural approaches for inter-domain path
    computation and resource reservation: a Hierarchical PCE model and a peer-to-peer
    PCE "stitching" model. This framework provides the foundation for more specific
    work on multi-domain DetNet solutions.</p>'

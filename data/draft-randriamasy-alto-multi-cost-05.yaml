abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer\n   traffic
    Optimization) that includes a \"Network Map Service\", an\n   \"Endpoint Cost
    Service\" and an \"Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service\" and\n   thus incentives for
    application clients to connect to ISP preferred\n   Endpoints.  These services
    provide a view of the Network Provider\n   (NP) topology to overlay clients.\n\n
    \  The present draft proposes a light way to extend the information\n   provided
    by the current ALTO protocol.  The purpose is to broaden the\n   possibilities
    of the Application Clients in two ways.  Firstly it\n   proposes to include information
    on multiple cost types in a single\n   ALTO transaction, providing a better mapping
    of the Selected\n   Endpoints to needs of the growing diversity of Content Networking\n
    \  Applications and to the network conditions.  Secondly it proposes new\n   cost
    types, that are an abstraction of time-sensitive network\n   information as viewed
    by the Network Provider.  All this also helps\n   producing a more robust choice
    when multiple Endpoints must be\n   selected.\n\n   There are 2 parts in this
    draft: the first part initiates protocol\n   extensions to support requests on
    multiple Cost Types in one single\n   transaction.  These first extensions also
    integrate the discussions\n   within the ALTO Working Group.  The second part
    proposes use cases\n   motivating further definitions of additional CostTypes
    and Cost\n   related attributes and capabilities.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes the use of the web service framework based \non
    XML protocols to implement speech engine remote control \nprotocols (SERCP).\nThis
    document is informational. It illustrates how web services \ncould be used. It
    is not a detailed specification. This is expected\nto be the output of the SPEECHSC
    activity, if it is decided to go \nin this direction. It also enumerates the requirements
    that have \nled to selecting a web service framework.\nSpeech engines (speech
    recognition, speaker, recognition, speech \nsynthesis, recorders and playback,
    NL parsers, and any other speech\nprocessing engines (e.g. speech detection, barge-in
    detection etc) \netc...) as well as audio sub-systems (audio input and output
    \nsub-systems) can be considered as web services that can be \ndescribed and asynchronously
    programmed via WSDL (on top of SOAP), \ncombined in a flow described via WSFL,
    discovered via UDDI and \nasynchronously controlled and via SOAP that also enables
    \nasynchronous exchanges between the engines.\nThis solution presents the advantage
    to provide flexibility, \nscalability and extensibility while reusing an existing
    framework \nthat fits the evolution of the web: web services and XML protocols
    \n[15].\nThis document proposes using web services as a framework for SERCP.\nThe
    proposed framework enables speech applications to control \nremote speech engines
    using the standardized mechanism of web \nservices. The control messages may be
    tuned to the controlled \nspeech engines.\n\t "

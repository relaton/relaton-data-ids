- language: en

  content: "This document presents a framework for the GMPLS control plane. It studies
    the GMPLS control plane from three different perspectives: functional partitioning,
    computational layering and network partitioning. First, it studies the functional
    building blocks of a generic GMPLS control plane and illustrates that, in order
    to be generalized for different technologies and their specific application environment,
    what each functional component could assume, what it 'should' (instead of 'how')
    accomplish, what are the generic    procedures and possible options.\n\t "

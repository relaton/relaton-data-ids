  content: "   This document provides a solution to extend LDP signaling to set up
    \n   and maintain Point-to-Multipoint MultiSegment Pseudowire (P2MP MS-\n   PW).
    The P2MP PW described in this draft is constructed by multiple \n   unidirectional
    PW segments. Such an extension of existing point to \n   point Pseudowire is made
    necessary by new applications. The document \n   only deals with the leaf-initiated
    P2MP PW setup and maintenance. The\n   processing for setting up a P2MP MS-PW
    is based on the same as MLDP \n   for P2MP LSP setup. \n\n\t "

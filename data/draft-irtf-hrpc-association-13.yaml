  content: "   This document explores whether the relationship between the Internet\n
    \  architecture and the ability of people to exercise their rights to\n   peaceful
    assembly and association online.  It does so by asking the\n   question: what
    are the protocol development considerations for\n   freedom of assembly and association?
    \ The Internet increasingly\n   mediates our lives, our relationships, and our
    ability to exercise\n   our human rights.  As a global assemblage, the Internet
    provides a\n   public space, yet it is predominantly built on private\n   infrastructure.
    \ Since Internet protocols and architecture play a\n   central role in the management,
    development, and use of the Internet,\n   we analyze the relation between protocols,
    architecture, and the\n   rights to assemble and associate to mitigate infringements
    on those\n   rights.  This document concludes that the way in which infrastructure\n
    \  is designed and implemented impacts people’s ability to exercise\n   their
    freedom of assembly and association.  It is therefore\n   recommended that the
    potential impacts of Internet technologies\n   should be assessed, reflecting
    recommendations of various UN bodies\n   and international norms.  Finally, the
    document considers both the\n   limitations on changing association and impact
    of \"forced\n   association\" in the context of online platforms.\n\n\t "

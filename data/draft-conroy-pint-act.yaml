  content: "This  Internet Draft is one of a pair written at the  request of one\nof
    the SPIRITS Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussion\non what extended
    functionality SPIRITS may be used to provide; the\nPINT work has similar requirements
    for a definition of the building\nblocks that might be used in future services
    (and so need to be\nsupported by the protocol). This note provides the 'mirror
    image' of\nthe associated SPIRITS draft, listing functional building blocks that\nmay
    be executed in response to future PINT protocol requests.\n\n\n\t "

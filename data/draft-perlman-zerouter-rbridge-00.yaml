  script: Latn
  content: "This design provides the ability to have an entire campus, with\nmultiple
    physical links, look to IP like a single subnet.  This\ncapability is often provided
    today with bridges.  Bridges have the\nadvantage of being plug-and-play.  However,
    they have disadvantages:\nrouting is confined to a spanning tree, the header on
    which the\nspanning tree forwards has no hop count, spanning tree forwarding in\nthe
    presence of loops spawns exponential copies of packets, nodes can\nhave only a
    single point of attachment, and the spanning tree, in\norder to avoid temporary
    loops, is slow to start forwarding on new\nports.  The design in this paper avoids
    those disadvantages of\nbridges.  The basic design is layer 3-independent, and
    is a design\nfor bridging with a shortest-path routing algorithm (instead of\nspanning
    tree paths), and with more robust forwarding.  Then the\ndesign is extended to
    provide IP-specific optimizations.\n\n\n\t "

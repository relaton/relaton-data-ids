  content: "FMIPv6 aims to achieve seamless handoff but needs (AP-ID, AR-Info) in\nPARs
    to function and can't work if PAR doesn't have an entry for the\nnext AP.  In
    this draft, we present a scheme to dynamically build\n(AP-ID, AR-Info) tuple in
    PAR and make FMIPv6 perform even when PAR\ndoesn't have a suitable (AP-ID, AR-Info)
    tuple by putting LinkID\nprefix in L2 beacon.\n\n\n\t "

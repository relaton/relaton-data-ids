  content: "   TCP option space is scarce resource as its maximum length is limited\n
    \  to 40 bytes.  This limitation becomes more significant in SYN\n   segments
    as all options used in a connection should be exchanged\n   during SYN negotiations.
    \ This document proposes a new SYN option\n   negotiation scheme that can aggregate
    multiple TCP options in SYN\n   segments into a single option so that more options
    can be negotiate\n   during 3-way handshake.  With its simple design, the approach
    does\n   not require fundamental changes in TCP.\n\n\t "

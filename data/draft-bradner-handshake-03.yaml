  content: "   There is confusion over how to get an RFC published in the IETF.\n
    \  Recently a long time IETF participant asked me what 'secret\n   handshake'
    was need to get documents published as RFCs since he had\n   been trying unsuccessfully
    to get that done.  This memo is the result\n   of that query and describes the
    procedures required, gives the proper\n   references and the required email addresses.\n\n\t "

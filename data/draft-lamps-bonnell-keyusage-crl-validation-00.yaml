abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 5280 defines the profile of X.509 certificates and certificate\n
    \  revocation lists (CRLs) for use in the Internet.  This profile\n   requires
    that certificates which certify keys for signing CRLs\n   contain the key usage
    extension with the cRLSign bit asserted.\n   Additionally, RFC 5280 defines steps
    for the validation of CRLs.\n   While there is a requirement for CRL validators
    to verify that the\n   cRLSign bit is asserted in the keyUsage extension of the
    CRL issuer's\n   certificate, there is no requirement for validators to verify
    the\n   presence of the keyUsage extension itself.  The lack of this\n   requirement
    may manifest in an issue in some Public Key\n   Infrastructures where a CRL issuer
    who has been certified by a\n   Certification Authority to issue CRLs on its behalf
    can sign CRLs\n   using a key that has not been certified for signing CRLs.\n\n
    \  This document specifies an enhancement to the CRL validation process\n   to
    explicitly require the presence of the keyUsage extension to\n   resolve this
    issue.\n\n\t "

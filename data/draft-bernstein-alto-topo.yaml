  content: "   Exposing additional topology information of networks to applications\n
    \  and users beyond that of the current ALTO protocol can enable many\n   important
    existing and emerging use cases, and many network providers\n   already provide
    additional information about their networks.  At the\n   same time, there is no
    standard for exposing network topology in a\n   manner that provides simplification
    via abstraction to the\n   application layer and information hiding via abstraction
    to the\n   network provider.  In this document, we provide a survey of use-cases\n
    \  for extended network topology information, present some initial\n   requirements
    for such services, and then give a framework of how to\n   integrate such an extended
    ALTO topology service with network control\n   infrastructure.\n\n\t "

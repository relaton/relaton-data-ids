  content: "This document describes how the IPv7 proposal called IP Address Encapsulation
    (IPAE) meets the evaluation criteria established by the Internet Engineering Steering
    Group and described in 'RFC-1380 IESG Deliberations on Routing and Addressing'.
    \ IPAE is currently developed to be a transition mechanism for a new IP protocol.
    \ This document focuses on the specific case of using IPAE to transition to the
    Simple IP Protocol (SIP).  It addresses the criteria against both IPAE and SIP.
    \              This document also includes how IPAE meets the criteria described
    by Craig Partridge in a message titled 'Criteria for selecting IPv7' sent to the
    Big-Internet mailing list on 22-October-1992.\n\t "

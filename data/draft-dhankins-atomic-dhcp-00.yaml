abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Most protocol developers ask themselves if a protocol will work, or\n
    \  work efficiently.  These are important questions, but another less\n   frequently
    considered is wether the proposed protocol changes present\n   themselves barriers
    to adoption by deployed software (more\n   importantly, needlessly so).\n\n   This
    document seeks to provide information on the challenges to DHCP\n   Option software
    implementers, and in doing so to provide guidance to\n   prospective DHCP Option
    authors to help them produce options that are\n   easily adoptable.\n\n\t "

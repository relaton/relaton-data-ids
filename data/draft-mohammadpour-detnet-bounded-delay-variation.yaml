  content: "   Some DetNet use-cases (applications) require guaranteed bounds on\n
    \  packet delay-variation, not just on latency.  This document gives a\n   methodology
    to derive guaranteed packet delay-variation bounds in\n   DetNet and apply it
    to a number of proposed mechanisms.  When the\n   required packet delay-variations
    is very low, clock non-idealities\n   affect the bounds, even in a synchronized
    DetNet networks.  This\n   document also gives a methodology to account for such
    an effect.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing \n
    \       multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session
    \n        invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP was
    \n        not intended to provide capability indication or capability \n        negotiation,
    however over the years, SDP has seen widespread adoption \n        and as a result
    it has been gradually extended to provide limited \n        support for these.
    SDP and its current extensions however do not have \n        the ability to negotiate
    one or more alternative transport protocols \n        (e.g. RTP profiles) which
    makes it particularly difficult to deploy \n        new RTP profiles such as secure
    RTP and RTP with RTCP-based feedback. \n\n        The purpose of this document
    is to address that by identifying a set \n        of requirements, evaluate existing
    work in this area, and provide a \n        recommended solution for extending
    SDP with capability negotiation.\n\t "

  content: "The architectural principles laid out in RFC2276[9] defines the\nconcept
    of a 'resolver discovery service'. This document describes\nan immediately-deployable
    RDS. It is implemented by a new DNS\nResource Record, NAPTR (Naming Authority
    PoinTeR)[10], that provides\na method for encoding incrementally discovered rules
    within DNS. By\nusing these incrementally discovered rules to re-map parts of
    a URI,\nwe can change the host that is contacted to resolve a URI.  This\nwill
    allow a more graceful handling of URLs over long time periods,\nand forms the
    foundation for a new proposal for Uniform Resource\nNames.\n\t "

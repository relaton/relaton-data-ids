  script: Latn
  content: "    This document defines the Fast Multicast Protocol for Mobile IPv6\n
    \   [2] in the Fast Handovers environments whereby a mobile node (MN)\n    can
    receive multicast data with reduced loss and delay after\n    handoffs. The proposed
    protocol can be implemented by the simple\n    modification of the Fast Handovers
    protocol [1] so that it can be\n    easily applied to the Fast Handovers for Mobile
    IPv6. This document\n    does not need a certain assumption of a specific multicast
    routing\n    protocol, so that any existing multicast routing protocol can be\n
    \   used with the proposed protocol.\n\n\t "

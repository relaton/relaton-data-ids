  content: "The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality
    of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain in a simple, scalable,
    and robust fashion.  This document defines the two metering and marking behaviours
    of PCN-nodes.  Threshold-metering and -marking marks all PCN-packets if the rate
    of PCN-traffic is greater than a configured rate (\"PCN-threshold-rate\").  Excess-
    traffic-metering and -marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the
    amount marked equals the rate of PCN-traffic in excess of a configured rate (\"PCN-excess-rate\").
    \ The level of marking allows PCN-boundary-nodes to make decisions about whether
    to admit or terminate PCN-flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful\n   Intercept is a key requirement.
    For example, MPLS-based Layer 2 VPN\n   models like VPLS and the like do not have
    any provider provisioned\n   methods of lawful intercept that are comprehensive,
    quick and easy to\n   provision from one single point. More particularly the auto-\n
    \  provisioning of lawful intercept for all sets of streams travelling\n   between
    VPN sites and consequent re-direction of these streams to the\n   appropriate
    government network has not been covered without multiple\n   instances of having
    to configure the intercept at various points in\n   the network both in the Single-AS
    case and the Inter-Provider VPN\n   case.\n\n   this paper, we propose a technique
    which uses a set of pre-defined\n   labels called Lawful Intercept labels and
    a method for provisioning\n   lawful intercept amongst the various PE devices
    using these labels\n   both in the Single-AS and the inter-provider VPN cases.
    A single\n   point of configuration is the key to this idea. The intercepted\n
    \  traffic is mirrored on a PE or a whole set of PEs or on all the PEs\n   participating
    in the VPN. A technique called the Domino-effect\n   provisioning of these Label-based
    Provider Provisioned Lawful\n   Intercept mechanism is also outlined.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Enhanced VPNs aim to deliver VPN services with enhanced\n   characteristics,
    such as guaranteed resources, latency, jitter, etc.,\n   so as to support customers
    requirements on connectivity services with\n   these enhanced characteristics.
    \ Enhanced VPN requires integration\n   between the overlay VPN connectivity and
    the characteristics provided\n   by the underlay network.  A Network Resource
    Partition (NRP) is a\n   subset of the network resources and associated policies
    on each of a\n   connected set of links in the underlay network.  An NRP could
    be used\n   as the underlay to support one or a group of enhanced VPN services.\n
    \  The NRP-specific resource information and status needs to be\n   collected
    from network nodes and reported to the network controller\n   for NRP-specific
    management and path computation.\n\n   This document specifies the BGP Link-State
    (BGP-LS) mechanisms with\n   necessary extensions to advertise the information
    of NRPs to network\n   controller in a scalable way.  The NRP information is advertised\n
    \  using a separate type of BGP-LS NLRI, which allows flexible update of\n   NRP
    information without impacting the based link state information.\n\n\t "

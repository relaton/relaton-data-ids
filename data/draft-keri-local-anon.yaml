- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The privacy requirement of anonymity is much harder to achieve than\n
    \  security goals like confidentiality or authentication, since network\n   routing
    has to take place between well known spots of the network.\n   There are solutions
    providing anonymity on the Internet implemented\n   on the application level,
    but there's also a possibility to achieve\n   local anonymity on Ethernet networks
    without the introduction of new\n   anonymous protocols by following a protocol
    anonymizing approach\n   described in this document.  Protocol anonymization is
    a simple\n   network operation mode, which can provide local client anonymity
    on\n   Ethernet networks under certain circumstances by eliminating the host\n
    \  identification capabilities of widely used local network protocols.\n\t "

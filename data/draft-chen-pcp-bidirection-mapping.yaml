  content: "The memo has proposed a bi-directional option, along with which PCP\ncould
    not only control PCP client pinhole, but also could manage port\nmapping status
    for communicating remote peers.  The bi-directional\nport control mode will eliminate
    risks of connections interruption\ncaused by remote peer pinhole timeout.\n\t "

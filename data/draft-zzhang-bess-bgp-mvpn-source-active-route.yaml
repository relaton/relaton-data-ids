  content: "   RFC6514 specifies the protocol and procedures for multicast in MPLS/\n
    \  BGP IP VPNs.  In the Any-Source Multicast (ASM) case, the section\n   \"14.
    \ Supporting PIM-SM without Inter-Site Shared C-Trees\" specifies\n   that the
    Provider Edge that serves as a customer Rendezvous Point or\n   runs Multicast
    Source Discovery Protocol advertises Source Active\n   (SA) routes for ASM flows
    when it discovers those flows.  This\n   document describes a situation where
    an optional enhancement to the\n   advertisement of SA routes is desired and specifies
    the procedures.\n   It updates RFC6514.\n\n\t "

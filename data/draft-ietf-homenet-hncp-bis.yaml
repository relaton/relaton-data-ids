  content: "   This document describes the Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP),\n
    \  an extensible configuration protocol, and a set of requirements for\n   home
    network devices.  HNCP is described as a profile of and\n   extension to the Distributed
    Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP).  HNCP\n   enables discovery of network borders,
    automated configuration of\n   addresses, name resolution, service discovery,
    and the use of any\n   routing protocol that supports routing based on both the
    source and\n   destination address.\n\n\t "

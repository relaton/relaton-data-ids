  content: "The MVPN (Multicast Virtual Private Network) architecture is divided\ninto
    a number of functional \"layers\".  At each layer, multiple\noptions are allowed.
    \ It is necessary to allow multiple options at\neach layer because \"one size
    doesn't fit all.\"  However, it is not\nexpected that any particular implementation
    will support all the\npossible combinations of options.  To ensure multi-vendor\ninteroperability,
    it is useful to specify \"profiles\", where each\nprofile is a particular combination
    of options.  The number of\nspecified profiles will be much less than the total
    number of\npossible combination, and a given implementation can be characterized\nby
    saying which profiles it supports.  This document describes two\nprofiles that
    use a PIM control plane.\n\t "

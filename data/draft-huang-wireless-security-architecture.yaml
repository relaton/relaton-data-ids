  content: "     After analysis and comparison of domestic and international  \n     wireless
    network secure schemes and standards, security threats  \n     for heterogeneous
    wireless network are investigated in theory and \n     practice. According to
    the comprehensive summing-up of current  \n     secure standards' application,
    existing secure vulnerabilities and \n     secure hidden troubles which may happen
    in future, \"network \n     layered,security classified and trusted domain departed\"
    secure \n     standard model is proposed, and corresponding standards for \n     heterogeneous
    wireless network security architecture are also put \n     forward. \n\t "

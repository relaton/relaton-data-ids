  content: "The File Transfer Protocol has a very long history, and despite the\nfact
    that today, other options exist to perform file transfers, FTP\nis still in common
    use.  As such, it is important that in the\nsituation where some client computers
    are IPv6-only while many\nservers are still IPv4-only and IPv6-to-IPv4 translators
    are used to\nbridge that gap, FTP is made to work through these translators as\nbest
    it can.\n\nFTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands that\nare
    IPv4-specific, and as extended, IP version agnostic commands.\nThe only FTP mode
    that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4\ntranslator is extended passive.
    \ However, many existing FTP servers\ndon't support this mode, and some clients
    don't ask for it.  This\ndocument describes server, client and middlebox (if any)
    behavior\nthat minimizes this problem.\n\t "

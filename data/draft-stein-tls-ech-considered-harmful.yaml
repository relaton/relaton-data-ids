  content: "   Encrypted Client Hello is designed to enhance personal privacy, in\n
    \  particular obstructing the ability of communications service\n   providers
    (but not Over The Top service providers) to map packet\n   flows to applications.
    \ While mostly ineffective in attaining this\n   goal, it does severely hamper
    network-based detection of malicious\n   flows, thus exposing end-users to various
    security risks that were\n   previously avoidable.\n\n\t "

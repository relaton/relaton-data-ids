  content: "This document defines an IPv6 Geographic global unicast address \nformat
    for use in the Internet.  The address format defined in this \ndocument is consistent
    with the IPv6 Protocol [1] and the \"IPv6 \nAddressing Architecture\" [2].  It
    is designed to facilitate scalable \nInternet routing when sites attach to multiple
    service providers, by \nusing a prefix based on a geographic reference to the
    site. A \nnatural byproduct of this address allocation mechanism is that all \naddresses
    are fixed allowing sites to change providers at will \nwithout requiring their
    network to renumber.\n\t "

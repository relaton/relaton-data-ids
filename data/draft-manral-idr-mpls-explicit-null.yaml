  content: "This document provides an alternate mechanism to [6PE] to interconnect
    \n   IPv6 routes over MPLS-enabled IPv4clouds. This approach\n   relies on IPv6
    Provider Edge routers (6PE-Alt) which are Dual Stack in\n   order to connect to
    IPv6 islands and to the MPLS core which is only\n   required to run IPv4 MPLS
    and run the mechanism as described in this \n   document.  The 6PE-Alt routers
    exchange the IPv6 reachability \n   information transparently over the core using
    the Multi-Protocol \n   Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4 or IPv6.  In
    doing so,\n   the BGP Next Hop field is used to convey the IPv4 address of the
    6PE-Alt\n   router so that dynamically established IPv4-signaled MPLS Label\n
    \  Switched Paths (LSPs) can be used without explicit tunnel\n   configuration.
    Unlike [6PE] case the labels are not sent with each route\n   and does not use
    BGP to transport labels [RFC3107]. It instead makes use\n   of the IPv6 Explicit
    NULL label as the VPN label, which is defined \n   [RFC3032] and updated in [RFC4182].
    \n\n   This document elegantly uses the concept of non overlapping IPv6 routes
    to\n   provide BGP MPLS IP VPN functionality. The document can be further used
    for \n   provinding the functionality in case of non-overlapping IPv6 routes.\n\n
    \  This approach allows a functionality similar to [RFC4659], without the \n   cumbursome
    extensions required for the same. With the [RFC3879] IPv6 addresses\n   are now
    globally unique (except for Link local). It also reduces the number \n   of multi
    AS scenarios.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a proposed extension to SIP [1].  This exten-\nsion
    adds the 183 Session Progress response and a new header to indi-\ncate why a SDP
    message body is included in a 18x message.\nThe introduction of the 183 informational
    response message would\nallow a called user agent to indicate to the calling user
    agent\nwhether or not the calling user agent should apply local alerting for\nthe
    session.  The existing 180 Ringing message would indicate that\nthe calling user
    agent has the option of providing local alerting\n(and generally should).  The
    183 Session Progress message would indi-\ncate that the calling user agent should
    not provide local alerting.\nIn additionally, the calling user agent may be called
    on to establish\na media session to be used by the called user agent to indicate
    the\nstatus of the session setup request as part of the indicated media\nstream.
    \ The indication of whether or not to play early media to the\ncalling user would
    be controlled with a new Session header included\nin the 183 message.\n\t "

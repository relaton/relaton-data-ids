  content: "   Letters of Agency (LOA) are commonly used to authorise network\n   providers
    to accept and propagate routing information received from\n   others.  The Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) can be used to\n   perform a similar function,
    with the advantage that RPKI-signed\n   objects can be validated automatically
    and in a more robust manner\n   than manual processing of documents.  However,
    some network operators\n   have established processes that expect and require
    LOAs to be\n   exchanged, despite their limitations.  This document proposes a\n
    \  format for constructing a LOA in the case where RPKI validation is\n   available,
    with the goal of enabling a transition to a future where\n   LOAs are no longer
    needed.\n\n\t "

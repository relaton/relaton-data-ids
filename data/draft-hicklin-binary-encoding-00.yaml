abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document suggests a method of encoding generic binary files so that
    they can be transmitted as MIME attachments between systems that use RFC 1652-compliant
    message transfer agents (such as Sendmail 8.7 (now in beta)).  This encoding method
    has a size increase of < 2% in the vast majority of cases, whereas base-64 encoding
    increases file size by ~33%.  This encoding method would use a new MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding
    type: 'binary-to-8bit-encoding'.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are
    requested.\n\t "

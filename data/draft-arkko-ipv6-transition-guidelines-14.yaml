  content: "The Internet continues to grow beyond the capabilities of IPv4.  An expansion
    in the address space is clearly required.  With its increase in the number of
    available prefixes and addresses in a subnet, and improvements in address management,
    IPv6 is the only real option on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some
    effort, resources, and expertise.  The availability of many different deployment
    models is one reason why expertise is required.  This document discusses the IPv6
    deployment models and migration tools, and it recommends ones that have been found
    to work well in operational networks in many common situations.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

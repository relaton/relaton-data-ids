  content: "When the Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group was
    chartered, an object identifier arc was allocated by IANA for use by that working
    group.  This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that
    arc, returns control of that arc to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies
    for any future assignments within that arc.\n\t "

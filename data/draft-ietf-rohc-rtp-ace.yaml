  content: "When Real-Time Multimedia over IP is applied to cellular systems, it\nis
    critical to minimize the overhead of the IP/UDP/RTP header, as\nspectral efficiency
    is a top requirement.  Robustness to errors and\nerror bursts is also a must.\nExisting
    IP/UDP/RTP header compression schemes such as that presented\nin IETF RFC 2508
    [CRTP], do not provide sufficient performance in\nsuch environments.  This report
    describes a new scheme (ACE, or\nAdaptive header ComprEssion) , which like RFC
    2508, is based on the\nidea that most of the time IP/UDP/RTP fields are either
    constant or\ncan be extrapolated in a linear fashion.  However, ACE incorporates\nseveral
    additional concepts which enable it to provide excellent\ncompression efficiency
    (exceeds the performance of [CRTP]) along with\na high degree of error-resiliency.
    \ Some of the concepts employed,\nsuch as Variable Length Encoding (VLE), enable
    ACE to adapt to\nchanging behavior in the IP/UDP/RTP header fields, such that
    good\nefficiency and robustness characteristics are maintained over a wide\nrange
    of operating conditions.\nACE is a general framework that can be parameterized
    to account for\nthe existence/non-existence and performance characteristics of
    the\nfeedback channel.  Thus, ACE is applicable over both bi-directional\nand
    unidirectional links.\nACE is also able to perform a seamless handoff, i.e. the
    scheme can\nresume efficient compression operation immediately after handoff.\n\t "

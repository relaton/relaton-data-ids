  content: "   This document describes the use case for providing IPsec flow\n   protection
    by means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller\n   and raises the requirements
    to support this service.  It considers\n   two main scenarios: (i) gateway-to-gateway
    and (ii) host-to-gateway\n   (Road Warrior).  For the gateway-to-gateway scenario,
    this document\n   describes a mechanism to support the bootstrapping of key material\n
    \  between network resources to protect data traffic with IPsec and IKE,\n   both
    in intra and inter-SDN cases.  The host-to-gateway case defines\n   a mechanism
    to bootstrap key material to protect data with IPsec\n   between an end user's
    device and a gateway.\n\n\t "

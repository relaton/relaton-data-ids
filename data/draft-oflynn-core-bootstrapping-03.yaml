  content: "The Internet of Things is marching its way towards completion.  Nodes\ncan
    use standards from the 6LoWPAN and ROLL WG to achieve IP\nconnectivity.  IEEE
    Standards ensure connectivity at lower layers for\nresource-constrained devices.
    \ Yet a central problem remains at a\nmore basic layer without a suitable answer:
    how to initially\nconfigure the network.  Without configuration the network never\nadvances
    beyond a large box of nodes.  Current solutions tend to be\nspecific to a certain
    vendor, node type, or application.\n\nThis document outlines exactly what problems
    are faced in solving\nthis problem.  General problems faced in any low-power wireless\nnetwork
    are outlined first; followed by how these apply to\nbootstrapping.  A selection
    of currently proposed techniques is\npresented.  From these a more generic approach
    is presented, which\ncan solve the problem for a wide range of situations.\n\nAn
    emphasis is on performing this bootstrapping in a secure manner.\nThis document
    does not cover operation of the network securely.  This\ndocument does provide
    the basis for allowing the network to operate\nsecurely however, by providing
    standard methods for key exchanges and\nauthentication.\n\t "

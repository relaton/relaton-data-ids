  content: "   In an era where AI-generated content has become indistinguishable\n
    \  from human writing, the Human-Generated Content Protocol (HGCP)\n   proposes
    a voluntary signing framework that enables human authors to\n   take responsibility
    for their expressions.  Instead of relying on\n   probabilistic detection methods
    or enforcing centralized identity,\n   HGCP encourages a simple yet powerful act:
    a signer publicly declares\n   responsibility for authored content through a structured
    signature\n   block.  The protocol is platform-neutral, supports both real-name
    and\n   anonymous identities, and prioritizes transparency, accountability,\n
    \  and human agency.  HGCP defines minimal signature structures,\n   integration
    suggestions for platforms and tools, and philosophical\n   guidance for fostering
    expression trust in an increasingly synthetic\n   information ecosystem.\n\n\t "

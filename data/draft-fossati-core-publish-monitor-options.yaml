  content: "   This memo defines two additional Options for the Constrained\n   Application
    Protocol (CoAP) especially targeted at sleepy sensors:\n   Publish and Monitor.\n\n
    \  The Publish Option enables opportunistic updates of a given resource\n   state,
    by temporarily delegating the authority of the Publish'ed\n   resource to a Proxy
    node.  The whole process is driven by the\n   (sleepy) origin -- which may actually
    never need to listen.\n\n   The Monitor Option complements the typical Observe
    pattern, enabling\n   the tracking of a resource hosted by a node sleeping most
    of the\n   time, by taking care of establishing and maintaining an Observe\n   relationship
    with the (sleepy) origin on behalf of the (sleepy)\n   client.\n\n\t "

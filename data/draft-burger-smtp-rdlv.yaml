  content: "There is an issue with SMTP that RFC 1047 raised in 1988.  The time\n
    \  between a SMTP client submitting a mail object and the SMTP server\n   responding
    to the request can be arbitrarily long.  SMTP addresses\n   this issue by a hack,
    hoping that the SMTP server responds fast\n   enough and the SMTP client waits
    long enough to find out if the\n   submission was successful.\n\t "

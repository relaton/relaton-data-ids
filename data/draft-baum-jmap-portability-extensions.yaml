  content: "   JMAP (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile friendly and scalable\n
    \  protocol that can be used for data of any type.  This makes it a good\n   fit
    for migrations or data portability use cases.  This extension\n   adds additional
    features useful (but not limited to) those use cases.\n\n   It adds a feature
    exposing details about the product, backend and\n   environment of a JMAP server.\n\n
    \  It also adds a data model for extending the JMAP Response with log\n   messages,
    particularly helpful for debugging.\n\n\t "

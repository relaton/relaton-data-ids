  content: "Latency is such requirement that must be achieved according to the\nService
    Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service\nproviders.  Network Performance
    Objective (NPO) defined in ITU-T\nY.1540 and Y.1541 is used for describing the
    meaning and numerical\nvalues performance parameters traversing multiple packet
    networks.\nThe definitions of the packet network performance parameters are\noften
    also used as the basis of SLAs service providers, but possibly\nwith different
    numerical values.  A SLA is a part of a service\ncontract where the level of service
    is formally defined between\nservice providers and customers.  For example, the
    service level\nincludes platinum, golden, silver and bronze.  Different service\nlevel
    may associate with different protection/restoration\nrequirement.  Latency can
    also be associated with different service\nlevel.  The user may select a private
    line provider based on the\nability to meet a latency SLA.\n\nThe key driver for
    latency is stock/commodity trading applications\nthat use data base mirroring.
    \ A few milli seconds can impact a\ntransaction.  Financial or trading companies
    are very focused on end-\nto-end private pipe line latency optimizations that
    improve things\n2-3 ms.  Latency and latency SLA is one of the key parameters
    that\nthese \"high value\" customers use to select a private pipe line\nprovider.
    \ Other key applications like video gaming, conferencing and\nstorage area networks
    require stringent latency and bandwidth.\n\nThis document describes the requirements
    and mechanisms to\ncommunicate latency as a traffic engineering performance metric
    in\ntoday's network which is consisting of potentially multiple layers of\npacket
    transport network and optical transport network in order to\nmeet the latency
    SLA between service provider and his customers.\nThis document also extends RSVP-TE
    and IGP to support these\nrequirement.  These extensions are intended to advertise
    and convey\nthe latency information of nodes and links as traffic engineering\nperformance
    metric.\n\t "

  content: "   The Privacy-Enhanced Realtime Conferencing (PERC) architecture\n   defines
    a system by which multiparty conferences can be handled by a\n   conference server
    that is \"semi-trusted\": that is, it is trusted to\n   correctly handle media
    packets, but it is not trusted with the actual\n   contents of the media streams.
    \ In order to use this architecture\n   within WebRTC, we must describe how information
    is conveyed among\n   various network functions.  This document describes the
    information\n   to be conveyed and how it is transferred.\n\n\t "

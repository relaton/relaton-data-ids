  content: "   Filtering RIBs in BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) can be desirable for\n
    \  several use-cases like, for example, limiting the amount of data a\n   collector
    station has to process or allow a sender to export only a\n   certain afi/safi
    of interest.  This document defines a light way to\n   inform a collector station
    that a Adj-Rib-In / Adj-Rib-Out data feed\n   is being filtered.\n\n\t "

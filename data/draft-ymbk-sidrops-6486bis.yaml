  content: "   This document defines a \"manifest\" for use in the Resource Public
    Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI).  A manifest is a signed object (file) that\n   contains
    a listing of all the signed objects (files) in the\n   repository publication
    point (directory) associated with an authority\n   responsible for publishing
    in the repository.  For each certificate,\n   Certificate Revocation List (CRL),
    or other type of signed objects\n   issued by the authority that are published
    at this repository\n   publication point, the manifest contains both the name
    of the file\n   containing the object and a hash of the file content.  Manifests
    are\n   intended to enable a relying party (RP) to detect certain forms of\n   attacks
    against a repository.  Specifically, if an RP checks a\n   manifest's contents
    against the signed objects retrieved from a\n   repository publication point,
    then the RP can detect \"stale\" (valid)\n   data and deletion of signed objects.\n\n\t "

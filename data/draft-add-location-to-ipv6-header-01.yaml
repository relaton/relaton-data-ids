  content: "   This document describes IP-LOC, a proposed extension to IPv6 header\n
    \  which suggests adding optional geo-location field, in order to\n   enhance
    existing geo-location based IP service as well as adding new\n   ones.\n\n   The
    current method of determining geo-location of IP traffic is\n   through RIR (Regional
    Internet Registry) database, this information\n   is not very accurate as it depends
    on how the ISP registers its IP\n   subnets, that is normally done in a country/city
    format.\n\n   It also assumes that in the future, GPS capability could be added
    to\n   the router itself (just like smart phones) and packet marking and\n   classification
    based on geo-location will be required.\n\n   QoS, firewall and routing based
    on geo-location might also be\n   required in the future when mobile routers move
    from one geo-location\n   to another, which has a different policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t "

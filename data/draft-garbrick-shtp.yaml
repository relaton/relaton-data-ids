  content: "   This document describes HTTPX, a protocol for providing access to\n
    \  materials that may be objectionable or that have age or locale-based\n   restrictions,
    while providing a simple method to filter such content\n   where required.\n \n
    \  HTTPX uses the protocol HTTP 1.1 ([RFC 2068]), with the single\n   exception
    of designating a separate range of TCP and UDP port\n   numbers that are allocated
    to a specific content type.\n\n\t "

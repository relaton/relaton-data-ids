  content: "   This document motivates and specifies a data model to report power\n
    \  and energy efficiency of an asset.  As highlighted during the IAB\n   workshop
    on environmental impacts\n   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-iab-ws-environmental-\n
    \  impacts-report-00), visibility is a very important first step\n   (paraphrasing
    Peter Drucker's mantra of \"You cannot improve what you\n   don't measure\").
    \ During the workshop the need for standardized\n   metrics was established, to
    avoid proprietary, double counting and\n   even contradictory metrics across vendors.\n\n
    \  This Power and Energy Efficiency Telemetry Specification (POWEFF) is\n   required
    to promote consistency across vendors and consumers, based\n   on: 1.  The definition
    of datasets and attributes defining a common\n   data model utilized by the standard
    calculation to yield power and\n   energy efficiency value for any asset or network
    element.  2.  The\n   standard calculations utilizing the specified datasets and
    attributes\n   which will yield energy consumption and energy efficiency value
    for\n   any asset or network element.\n\n   The model provides information and
    data requirements for calculating\n   the Power and Energy Efficiency for specific
    assets.  Assets can\n   include hardware (physical or virtual), software, applications,
    or\n   services.\n\n\t "

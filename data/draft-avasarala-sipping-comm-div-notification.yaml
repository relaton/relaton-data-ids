  content: "   3GPP and ETSI TISPAN are defining PSTN/ISDN simulation services and\n
    \  in particular the Communication Diversion (CDIV) using IP Multimedia\n   (IM)
    core Network (CN) subsystem supplementary service.  As part of\n   CDIV, a (SIP)
    Event Notification Framework-based mechanism is used\n   for notifying Users about
    diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of\n   their incoming communication sessions.
    \ A new event package is\n   proposed for allowing users to subscribe for and
    receive such\n   notifications.  Users have further capability to define filters\n
    \  controlling the selection, rate and content of such notifications.\n   This
    SIP event package is applicable to the IMS and may not be\n   applicable to the
    general Internet.\n\t "

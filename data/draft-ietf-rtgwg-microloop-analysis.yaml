  script: Latn
  content: "   Link-state routing protocols (e.g. OSPF or IS-IS) are known to\n   converge
    to a loop-free state within a finite period of time after a\n   change in the
    topology. It is normal, however, to observe short-term\n   loops during the period
    of topology update propagation, route\n   recalculation, and forwarding table
    update, due to the asynchronous\n   nature of link-state protocol operation. This
    document provides an\n   analysis of formation of such microloops and suggests
    simple\n   mechanisms to minimize them.\n\t "

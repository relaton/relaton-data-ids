  content: "   As the scale of IP networks and the importance of services increase\n
    \  continuously, the data collected by telemetry is increasing\n   exponentially.
    \ To support the network simulation, traffic\n   optimization and risk detection
    of the network, Digital Twin\n   technology on data communication networks is
    mentioned increasingly.\n   Real-time synchronization between controllers and
    devices is a\n   critical feature of Digital Twin Network, which require much
    more\n   volume telemetry data between controllers and devices.  All of these\n
    \  bring more pressure on the network bandwidth, device CPU and\n   controller
    CPU.  This document proposes a method to optimize the\n   problem.\n\n\n\t "

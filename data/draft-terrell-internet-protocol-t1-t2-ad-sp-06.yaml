  content: "This paper Defines the 'IPtX Protocol Specification', and provides a\nvisualization
    of the lack of IP Address Control, a Blunder, which may\nbe excused partly because
    of the impossibility of Predicting the\nCurrent, as well as the Future use and
    growth of the Internet.\nHowever, this requires an investigation, or Analysis
    for the Current\nuse of the HD-Ratio in the IPv4 and IPv6 IP Specifications. Moreover,\nwhile
    the IPv4 IP Specification, is indeed the primary focus of this\ninvestigation.
    To provide a fair comparison however, this Analysis\nrequires, if not mandates,
    the use of the IPt1 and IPt2 specifications\nas well. The reasoning here nevertheless,
    is the difference in the\nrespective Addressing Schematics. Where by, the Addressing
    Scheme of the\nformer focuses primarily on the HOST IP Address (Assignment), while
    the\nfocus of the latter emphasizes only the Network IP Address. Nevertheless,it
    shall be concluded, the Addressing Methods used in the Schematic also affects
    the Efficiency; 'the RATIO of Total Number of Nodes that can be attached to Service
    the Global Networking Community, and the Number of available IP Addresses used
    for the Connection'.\nIn other words, this 'Analysis is Argument', whose focus
    upon the\n'HD-Ratio' and the 'CIDR Notation' establishes the foundation defining\nthe
    'INTERNET PROTOCOL t1 and t2 ADDRESS SPACE' for the IPt1 and IPt2\nProtocol Specifications.
    Which moreover, exceeds the Mandate Defining a\nNew IP Addressing System specified
    as the Requirements outlined in\nRFC1550.\n\t "

  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to\nprovide
    a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when\nthe user is alerted.
    \ This is done using the Alert-Info header.\nHowever, the reference addresses
    only network resources with specific\nrendering properties.  There is currently
    no support for predefined\nstandard identifiers for describing the semantics of
    the alerting\nsituation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without\nbeing
    tied to a particular rendering.  To overcome this limitation\nand support new
    applications, a new family of URNs for use in SIP\nAlert-Info header fields is
    defined in this specification.\n\t "

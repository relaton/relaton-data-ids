abstract:
- content: "<p>This document makes several prescriptions regarding the following key
    exchange methods in TLS, most of which have been superseded by better options:
    1. This document deprecates the use of RSA key exchange in TLS. 2. It limits the
    use of Diffie Hellman key exchange over a finite field to avoid known vulnerabilities
    and improper security properties. 3. It discourages the use of static elliptic
    curve Diffie Hellman cipher suites.</p>"

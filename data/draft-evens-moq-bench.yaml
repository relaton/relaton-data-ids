  content: "   This document defines a comprehensive methodology for benchmarking\n
    \  Media over QUIC Transport (MOQT) relays to evaluate their performance\n   under
    realistic conditions.  The methodology utilizes configurable\n   test profiles
    that simulate common media streaming scenarios\n   including audio-only distribution,
    combined audio-video streaming,\n   and multi-participant conferencing environments.
    \ The framework\n   defines standardized message formats, synchronization mechanisms,
    and\n   comprehensive metrics collection to ensure reproducible and\n   comparable
    results across different relay implementations.  Test\n   scenarios cover both
    (QUIC) datagram and stream forwarding modes,\n   enabling evaluation of relay
    performance characteristics such as\n   throughput, latency variance, object loss
    rates, and resource\n   utilization.  The resulting benchmark data facilitates
    objective\n   comparison and analysis of (MOQT) relay implementations, supporting\n
    \  informed deployment decisions and performance optimization efforts.\n\n\t "

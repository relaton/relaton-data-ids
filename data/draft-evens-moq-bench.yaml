abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a comprehensive methodology for benchmarking
    Media over QUIC Transport (MOQT) relays to evaluate their performance under realistic
    conditions. The methodology utilizes configurable test profiles that simulate
    common media streaming scenarios including audio-only distribution, combined audio-video
    streaming, and multi-participant conferencing environments. The framework defines
    standardized message formats, synchronization mechanisms, and comprehensive metrics
    collection to ensure reproducible and comparable results across different relay
    implementations. Test scenarios cover both (QUIC) datagram and stream forwarding
    modes, enabling evaluation of relay performance characteristics such as throughput,
    latency variance, object loss rates, and resource utilization. The resulting benchmark
    data facilitates objective comparison and analysis of (MOQT) relay implementations,
    supporting informed deployment decisions and performance optimization efforts.</p>"

  content: "This document contains a text version of the Number Portability\nSupplement
    (11/98) to ITU-T Recommendation E.164 (The international\npublic telecommunication
    numbering plan, 05/97) [2].  That\nSupplement [3] defined terminology for number
    portability within an\nE.164 numbering scheme; identified formats, call flows,\narchitectures,
    and routing approaches for some methods; and gave\nexamples of some processes
    needed to implement number portability.\nA January 2000 workshop on IP-Telecomms
    interworking (focused on\nnumbering, naming, addressing, and routing) identified
    issues to be\naddressed by the IETF and/or the ITU [4].  This Supplement was noted\nas
    a document related to a joint IETF/ITU issue on E.164 number\nportability.  A
    text version was posted on the ITU's web site in\nMarch 2000 and notified to the
    itu+ietf and enum mailing lists.\nThis Internet Draft is being submitted to support
    work of the ENUM\n(Telephone Number Mapping) Working Group on impacts of local
    number\nportability on a DNS-based architecture and protocols for mapping a\ntelephone
    number to a set of attributes (e.g., URLs) [5].\n\n\t "

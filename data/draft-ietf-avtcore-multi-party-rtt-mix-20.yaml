  content: "This document provides enhancements of real-time text (as specified in
    RFC 4103) suitable for mixing in a centralized conference model, enabling source
    identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text from different sources.
    The intended use is for real-time text mixers and participant endpoints capable
    of providing an efficient presentation or other treatment of a multiparty real-time
    text session. The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the Contributing
    Source (CSRC) list in the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet for source
    identification. The method makes use of the same \"text/t140\" and \"text/red\"
    formats as for two-party sessions.\n\n Solutions using multiple RTP streams in
    the same RTP session are briefly mentioned, as they could have some benefits over
    the RTP-mixer model. The RTP-mixer model was selected to be used for the fully
    specified solution in this document because it can be applied to a wide range
    of existing RTP implementations.\n\n A capability exchange is specified so that
    it can be verified that a mixer and a participant can handle the multiparty-coded
    real-time text stream using the RTP-mixer method. The capability is indicated
    by the use of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 8866) media attribute,
    \"rtt-mixer\".\n\n This document updates RFC 4103 (\"RTP Payload for Text Conversation\").\n\n
    A specification for how a mixer can format text for the case when the endpoint
    is not multiparty aware is also provided.\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "This document presents a conservative loss recovery algorithm for TCP\nthat
    is based on the use of the selective acknowledgment (SACK) TCP\noption.  The algorithm
    presented in this document conforms to the\nspirit of the current congestion control
    specification (RFC 2581),\nbut allows TCP senders to recover more effectively
    when multiple\nsegments are lost from a single flight of data.\n\t "

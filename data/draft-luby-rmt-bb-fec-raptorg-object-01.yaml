  content: "This document describes a Fully-Specified FEC scheme, corresponding\nto
    FEC Encoding ID XXX, for the RaptorG forward error correction code\nand its application
    to reliable delivery of data objects.\n\nRaptorG codes are a new family of codes
    to provide superior\nflexibility, larger source block sizes and better coding
    efficiency\nthan Raptor codes in RFC5053.  RaptorG is also a fountain code, i.e.,\nas
    many encoding symbols as needed can be generated by the encoder\non-the-fly from
    the source symbols of a source block of data.  The\ndecoder is able to recover
    the source block from any set of encoding\nsymbols for most cases equal to the
    number of source symbols and in\nrare cases with slightly more than the number
    of source symbols.\n\nThe RaptorG code described here is a systematic code, meaning
    that\nall the source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can be\ngenerated.\n\nStatus
    of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with
    the\nprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.\n\nInternet-Drafts are working documents

  content: "The definition of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is specified abstractly,
    and does not detail a particular implementation. The abstract definition of IPP
    is contained within the 'IPP Model' document, a separate document available at
    the Printer Working Group IPP web page HTTP://www.pwg.org/. This document attempts
    to map IPP Model operations and semantics to HTTP 1.1 equivalent operations.\n\t "

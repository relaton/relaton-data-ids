  content: "After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated\nby
    the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible\nthat the call-taker
    feels the need for further communication or for a\nclarification.  For example,
    the call may have been dropped by\naccident without the call-taker having sufficient
    information about\nthe current situation of a wounded person.  A call-taker may
    trigger\na callback towards the emergency caller using the contact information\nprovided
    with the initial emergency call.  This callback could, under\ncertain circumstances,
    then be treated like any other call and as a\nconsequence, it may get blocked
    by authorization policies or may get\nforwarded to an answering machine.\n\nThe
    IETF emergency services architecture addresses callbacks in a\nlimited fashion
    and thereby covers a couple of scenarios.  This\ndocument discusses some shortcomings
    and raises the question whether\nadditional solution techniques are needed.\n\t "

  content: "The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) allows hop-by-hop integrity protection
    of RSVP neighbors.  This requires messages to be cryptographically protected using
    a shared secret between participating nodes.  This document compares group keying
    for RSVP with per-neighbor or per-interface keying, and discusses the associated
    key provisioning methods as well as applicability and limitations of these approaches.
    \ This document also discusses applicability of encrypting RSVP messages.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.\n\t "

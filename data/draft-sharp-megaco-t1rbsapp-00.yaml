  content: "The Media Gateway Control Protocol (megaco) can be used to carry T1\nRobbed
    Bit Signaling (RBS) between the Media Gateway (MG) and the\nMedia Gateway Controller
    (MGC).  This document describes the\napplicability of megaco to carrying T1 Robbed
    Bit Signaling.  T1\nRobbed Bit Signaling is a type of Channel Associated Signaling
    used\nmainly in the United States of America (USA) and Canada.  A\ndescription
    and specification for T1 RBS can be found in EIA/TIA-\n464-B.  This draft does
    not define any new packages, but identifies\nthe need for new packages to support
    Robbed Bit Signaling.  It is\nanticipated that packages for FX service will be
    very similar to\npackages defined for analog lines.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces a fast reroute architecture within the\n   programmable
    data plane (PDP-FRR) for enhancing network resilience\n   through rapid failure
    detection and swift path migration, leveraging\n   in-band network telemetry and
    source routing.  Unlike traditional\n   methods that rely on the control plane
    and face significant delays in\n   rerouting, the proposed architecture utilizes
    a white-box modeling of\n   the data plane to distinguish and analyze packet losses
    accurately,\n   enabling immediate identification for link failures (including
    black-\n   hole and gray failures).  By utilizing in-band network telemetry and\n
    \  source routing, the proposed solution significantly reduces reroute\n   times
    to a few milliseconds, offering a substantial improvement over\n   existing practices
    and marking a pivotal advancement in failure\n   tolerance.\n\n\t "

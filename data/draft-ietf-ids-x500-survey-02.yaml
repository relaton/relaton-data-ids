  content: "This document is the result of a survey asking people to detail their
    advanced usages of X.500.  It is intended to show how various organizations are
    using X.500 in ways which extend the view of X.500 as a \"White Pages\" service.
    \ This RFC is a product of the Integrated Directory Services Working Group of
    the Application and User Services Areas of the IETF.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.\n\t "

  content: "This memo documents the methodology and results of an experiment\nwhich
    tested the availability of the DNS Extension Mechanism (EDNS0)\non a large set
    of authority-only nameservers.  The experiment was\nconducted in the bar during
    the IETF 72 meeting on 27 July 2008.\n\nThe results of this experiment suggest
    that EDNS0 deployment is\nextensive: it was found that 94.4% of non-defective
    authority-only\nservers are EDNS0-capable.\n\t "

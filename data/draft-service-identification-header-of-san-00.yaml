  script: Latn
  content: "   As the cloud and computing migrates to edges further away from the\n
    \  traditional centered cloud, the services residing at the distributed\n   cloud
    start to be delivered in such a ubiquitous and dynamic way.\n   That it is challenging
    to the ongoing routing and interconnecting\n   scheme under which host address
    is the global networking\n   identification.  This draft proposes a service identification
    which\n   is designed to be treated both as a service routable ID and an\n   interface
    to the service requirements as well as service-associated\n   cloud resources.
    \ Service Aware Network header is illustrated and\n   specified.\n\n\t "

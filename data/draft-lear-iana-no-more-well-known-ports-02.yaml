  content: "Amongst other things the IANA manages port assignments for TCP, UDP,\nand
    SCTP protocols.  This document specifies the procedure by which\nthose assignments
    take place.  The distinction between so-called\n\"well known ports\" and other
    public static assignments is deprecated,\nthe use of SRV records is encouraged,
    and documentation of port use\nis strongly encouraged.\n\t "

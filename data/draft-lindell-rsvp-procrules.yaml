  content: "This memo contains an algorithmic description of the rules\n     used
    by an RSVP implementation for processing messages.  It is\n     intended to clarify
    the version 1 RSVP protocol specification\n     [RFC 2205].  These rules are decomposed
    into pieces which are\n     contained inside of an abstract processing architecture.\n
    \n     This document provides an updated version of the previous\n     processing
    rules [RFC 2209].  It attempts to provide a\n     description that is less dependent
    on the particular design\n     choices made in the ISI reference implementation
    of RSVP.\n\t "

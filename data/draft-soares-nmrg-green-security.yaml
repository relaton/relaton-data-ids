  content: "   With the onset of the climate emergency, all areas of human activity\n
    \  are expected to continuously assess their Greenhouse Gas emissions\n   and
    encourage the use of clean energy sources as much as possible.\n   The current
    discussion on green networking in the Network Management\n   research field still
    needs to be expanded to the adjoined areas, such\n   as Network Security.  This
    document summarizes the security\n   considerations of the existing works and
    outlines possible research\n   directions for energy-aware security mechanisms.\n\n\t "

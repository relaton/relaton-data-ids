  content: "EAP is used to establish secure communication channel in \nIKEv2 and in
    Wireless Security. EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-MD5, \nEAP-SIM uses radius protocol
    for communication bewteen \nradius server and the client. These protocols are
    used in \nboth Wireless network authentication and in IKEV2 authentication \nto

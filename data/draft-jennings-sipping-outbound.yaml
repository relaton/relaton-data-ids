  content: "Often with SIP a request can only be routed over an existing\n   connection
    or flow, such as when there is a firewall or network\n   address translation (NAT)
    device in the network path.  TLS is also\n   affected when the user agent (UA)
    does not have a certificate\n   suitable for mutual TLS authentication.  This
    draft addresses how\n   user agents and proxies need to behave to work in these
    environments.\n   This work shows how existing SIP mechanisms can be used to allow
    the\n   UA to register multiple times over different connections or flows and\n
    \  the proxies can use the instance-id in the contact header to identify\n   that
    the multiple flows go to the same UA.  It can then choose which\n   flow to use
    to route requests to this UA.\n\t "

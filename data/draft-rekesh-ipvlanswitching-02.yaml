  content: "The objective of this document is to define and formalize the use of\nIP-based
    VLAN switching in the context of virtualization of network\nservices. Networking
    infrastructure appliances may host multiple\nvirtual instances of network services.
    IP address inspection on a\npacket coming from an external network such as the
    Internet can be\nused to switch the packet into a VLAN, through use of VLAN tags
    on\nEthernet frames. The tagged frame is subsequently fed to a VLAN-aware\nnetworking
    infrastructure appliance where the packet is directed to a\nvirtualized service
    instance. This method of IP-based VLAN switching\non a packet assists in hosting
    multiple virtual instances of network\nservices on servers and other appliances.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "Currently, group membership management in IP Multicast and\nAnycast can
    be abused in order to launch denial-of-service (DoS)\nattacks.  The root of the
    problem is that routers cannot\ndetermine if a given host is authorized to join
    a group\n(sometimes referred to as the 'Proof-of-Membership Problem'\n[ECUMN00]).
    We propose a solution for IPv6 based on Group\nCryptographically Generated Addresses
    (G-CGA).\nThese addresses have characteristics of statistical uniqueness\nand
    cryptographic verifiability that lend themselves to severely\nlimiting certain
    classes of DoS attacks. Our scheme is fully\ndistributed and does not require
    any trusted third party or\npre-established security association between the routers
    and the\nhosts.  This is not only a huge gain in terms of scalability,\nreliability
    and overhead, but also in terms of privacy.\n\t "

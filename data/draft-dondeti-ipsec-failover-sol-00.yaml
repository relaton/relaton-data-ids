  script: Latn
  content: "   IPsec gateways and servers maintaining SAs with large number of\n   clients
    can quickly recover from failover using the protocols and\n   procedures specified
    in this document.  These techniques also\n   facilitate IPsec clients to move
    from one gateway to another and\n   resume operation without having to rerun IKEv2.
    \ The idea is to\n   maintain IKEv2 and IPsec SA state at either the client or
    one or more\n   backup servers to reduce the communication and computation overhead\n
    \  associated with reestablishing the SAs from scratch.  Client to\n   server
    SA state storage retrieval mechanisms and client-initiated or\n   server-initiated
    failover recovery protocols are specified.  This\n   document, however, does not
    define an inter-gateway transport\n   mechanism to transfer the state across entities
    at the backend.\n\n\t "

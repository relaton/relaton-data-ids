  content: "This document specifies Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol modifications extending the concept of preemption
    with the goal of reducing or eliminating traffic disruption of preempted Traffic
    Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  Initially, MPLS RSVP-TE was defined
    with support for only immediate TE LSP displacement upon preemption.  The utilization
    of a reroute request notification helps more gracefully mitigate the reroute process
    of preempted TE LSP.  For the brief period soft preemption is activated, reservations
    (though not necessarily traffic levels) are in effect under-provisioned until
    the TE LSP(s) can be rerouted.  For this reason, the feature is primarily, but
    not exclusively, interesting in MPLS-enabled IP networks with Differentiated Services
    and Traffic Engineering capabilities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "When BGP is used to distribute a route, it can also be used to \ndistribute
    a Link Layer PATH_NEXT_HOP binding which is mapped to that \nroute such that packets
    to that network route can be switched \ndirectly across an Ethernet switched network.
    This document specifies \nthe way in which this is done.\n\t "

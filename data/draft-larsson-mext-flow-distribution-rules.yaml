  content: "This document defines an OS independent rule language as a mean to\ndefine
    and perform per flow path selection for a multi-homed node.\nPer flow path selection
    is typically needed when there exist multiple\nnetwork interfaces, each with different
    network characteristics, and\nan application has specific performance requirements
    for a data flow\nthat makes one network interface more suitable than another.\n\nThe
    flow distribution rule set is used by the node itself but also\nexchanged with
    other nodes that needs to know about the multi-homed\nnode's capability of receiving
    data on multiple network interfaces.\nThis document does not define how the rule
    set is transferred between\nnodes.\n\t "

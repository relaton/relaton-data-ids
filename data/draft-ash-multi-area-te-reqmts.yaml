  content: "This draft describes requirements for multi-area TE within the context
    of GMPLS.  Based on the requirements, the goal is to eventually provide\nprotocol
    extensions needed for multi-area TE.  Various approaches to\nmulti-area TE are
    considered, and these approaches are evaluated against the requirements.  These
    approaches include state dependent routing (SDR) LSP selection, event dependent
    routing (EDR) LSP selection, and time dependent routing (TDR) LSP selection.  These
    approaches include needs to support path-computation server (PCS) functionality,
    query functionality, crankback functionality, TE feedback functionality, and summary-LSA
    functionality.\nThe target in future releases of this document will be to converge
    on a\nreduced subset of the required multi-area TE methods and protocol\nextensions.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an approach for exposing Device Models as\n
    \  Network Models (DMaNM).  In particular, this document provides\n   guidance
    for structuring a data model to facilitate the reuse of\n   device models within
    the customer-facing interface of Software-\n   Defined Networking (SDN) controllers.
    \ The objective of this approach\n   is to enhance the reusability of device models
    in various network\n   scenarios and ease the mapping between network/service
    models with\n   device models and ensure lossless mapping between the various
    layers.\n\n\t "

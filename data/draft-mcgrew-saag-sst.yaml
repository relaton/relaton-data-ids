- language: en

  content: "This document describes a cryptographic transform which uses a\nstream
    cipher (which can generate keystream segments in arbitrary\norder) and a universal
    hash function to provide both privacy and\nauthentication together, or either
    security service separately.\nThis transform is efficient, provably secure, appropriate
    for\nnetwork security, and is believed to be patent free.\n\t "

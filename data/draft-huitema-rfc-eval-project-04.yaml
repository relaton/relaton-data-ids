  content: "   This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the recently\n
    \  published RFC.  We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in\n   2018,
    looking for history and delays.  We also use two randomly\n   chosen sets of RFC
    published in 2008 and 1998 for comparing delays\n   seen in 2018 to those observed
    10 or 20 years ago.\n   The average RFC in the 2018 sample was produced in 3 years
    and 4\n   months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent in the working\n   group,
    3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and 3 to 4\n   months in RFC
    production.  The main variation in RFC production\n   delays comes from the AUTH-48
    phase.\n\n   We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using\n
    \  Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about\n   deployment.
    \ We show that citation counts indicate academic interest,\n   but correlate only
    loosely with deployment or usage of the\n   specifications.\n\n   The RFCs selected
    for this survey were chosen at random and represent\n   a small sample of all
    RFCs produced, and only approximately 10% of\n   the RFCs produced in each of
    1998, 2008, and 2018.  It is possible\n   that different samples would produce
    different results.  Furthermore,\n   the conclusions drawn from the observations
    made in this document\n   represent the author's opinions and do not have consensus
    of the\n   IETF.\n\n\t "

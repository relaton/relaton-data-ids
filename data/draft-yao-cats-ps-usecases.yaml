  content: "   Distributed computing is a tool that service providers can use to\n
    \  achieve better service response time and optimized energy\n   consumption.
    \ In such a distributed computing environment, providing\n   services by utilizing
    computing resources hosted in various computing\n   facilities aids support of
    services such as computationally intensive\n   and delay sensitive services.  Ideally,
    compute services are balanced\n   across servers and network resources to enable
    higher throughput and\n   lower response times.  To achieve this, the choice of
    server and\n   network resources should consider metrics that are oriented towards\n
    \  compute capabilities and resources instead of simply dispatching the\n   service
    requests in a static way or optimizing solely on connectivity\n   metrics.  The
    process of selecting servers or service instance\n   locations, and of directing
    traffic to them on chosen network\n   resources is called \"Computing-Aware Traffic
    Steering\" (CATS).\n\n   This document provides the problem statement and the
    typical\n   scenarios for CATS, which shows the necessity of considering more\n
    \  factors when steering traffic to the appropriate computing resource\n   to
    best meet the customer's expectations and deliver the requested\n   service.\n\n\t "

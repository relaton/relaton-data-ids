abstract:
- content: <p>Many service providers have been exploring distributed computing techniques
    to achieve better service response time and optimized energy consumption. Such
    techniques rely upon the distribution of computing services and capabilities over
    many locations in the network, such as its edge, the metro region, virtualized
    central office, and other locations. In such a distributed computing environment,
    providing services by utilizing computing resources hosted in various computing
    facilities (e.g., edges) is being considered, e.g., for computationally intensive
    and delay sensitive services. Ideally, compute services are balanced across servers
    and network resources using metrics that are oriented towards compute capabilities
    and resources instead of simply dispatching the service requests in a static way
    or optimizing solely on connectivity metrics. For example, systematically directing
    end user-originated service requests to the geographically closest edge or some
    small computing units may lead to an unbalanced usage of computing resources,
    which may then degrade both the user experience and the overall service performance.
    We have named this kind of network with dynamic sharing of edge compute resources
    "Computing-Aware Traffic Steering" (CATS). This document provides the problem
    statement and the typical scenarios of CATS, which is to show the necessity of
    considering more factors when steering the traffic to the appropriate service
    instance based on the basic edge computing deployment to provide the service equivalency.</p>

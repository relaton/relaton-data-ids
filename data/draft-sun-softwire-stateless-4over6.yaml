  content: "   This document specifies a stateless 4over6 mechanism which moves the\n
    \  translation function from tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to initiators\n   (B4s).
    \ It is used for service providers offering residual deployment\n   of the IPv4
    service across IPv6-only domains.  The concentrator will\n   record the full set
    of prefix mapping rules independent of the number\n   of subscribers, while the
    initiator will only keep a single rule of\n   its own sub-domain.  The BNG devices
    can learn the rule set further,\n   to achieve traffic optimization between initiators.
    \ In this way, it\n   not only achieve scalability and simplicity feature benefits
    from\n   stateless address mapping, but also keep CPE functions simple.\n   Besides,
    flexible addressing and scattered IPv4 address blocks can be\n   supported as
    well.  Traffic optimization can be deployed\n   incrementally when necessary.\n\n\t "

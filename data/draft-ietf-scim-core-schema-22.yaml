  content: "The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications
    are designed to make identity management in cloud-based applications and services
    easier. The specification suite builds upon experience with existing schemas and
    deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration,
    while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its
    intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing
    a common user schema and extension model as well as binding documents to provide
    patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP.\n\n This document provides a platform-neutral
    schema and extension model for representing users and groups and other resource
    types in JSON format. This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud
    service providers.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with a NAT\n
    \  or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server\n   to
    differentiate between different clients.  Such differentiation is\n   valuable
    in several scenarios.  This memo describes a technique to\n   differentiate TCP
    clients sharing an IP address.  The proposed method\n   uses a TCP option, which
    avoids altering the application-level\n   payload and works well with SSL-protected
    connections.\n\n\t "

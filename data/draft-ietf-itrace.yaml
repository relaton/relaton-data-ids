  content: "It is often useful to learn the path that packets take through the \nInternet,
    especially when dealing with certain denial-of-service \nattacks.  We propose
    a new ICMP message, emitted randomly by routers \nalong the path and sent randomly
    to the destination (to provide \nuseful information to the attacked party) or
    to the origin (to \nprovide information to decipher reflector attacks).\n\t "

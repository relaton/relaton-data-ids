  content: "This document specifies how the level 3 multihoming Shim6 protocol (Shim6)
    detects failures between two communicating nodes.  It also specifies an exploration
    protocol for switching to another pair of interfaces and/or addresses between
    the same nodes if a failure occurs and an operational pair can be found. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

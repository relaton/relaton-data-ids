  content: "   This document describes an Under-Specified FEC Scheme that can be\n
    \  used with the broad class of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes\n   and
    their application to the reliable delivery of objects on packet\n   erasure channels.
    \ Additionally, this document describes the LDPC-\n   Staircase and LDPC-Triangle
    Forward Error Correction codes, two\n   instances of the LDPC FEC Scheme, in a
    way that enables fully inter-\n   operable implementations.  The LDPC codes belong
    to the class of\n   large block FEC codes, as defined in RFC3453, which enables
    them to\n   efficiently encode/decode large objects, in a single block.  They\n
    \  also enable a receiver to recover the k source symbols from any set\n   of
    a little bit more than k encoding symbols.\n\t "

  content: "With rising cost and an increasing awareness of the environmental\nimpact
    of energy consumption, a desirable feature of networked\ndevices is to be able
    to assess their power state and energy\nconsumption at will.  With this data available,
    one can build\nsophisticated applications such as monitoring applications or even\nactive
    energy management systems.  These systems themselves are out\nof scope of this
    memo, as it discusses only considerations for the\nmonitored devices.  Implementation
    specifics such as the definition\nof a Management Information Base are also outside
    the scope of this\ndocument.\n\t "

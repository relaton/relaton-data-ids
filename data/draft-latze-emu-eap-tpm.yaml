  content: "This document describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)\n[RFC3748]
    method for identity distribution, authentication and\nsession key distribution
    using the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG)\nTrusted Platform Module (TPM).  The
    TPM has been defined by the TCG\nin order to establish a root of trust and measurements
    in (consumer)\ncomputers.  It provides several cryptographic functions and a secure\nstorage
    for keys and hashes.  There is also a TPM specification for\nmobile devices called
    Mobile Trusted Module (MTM), which can also be\nused for EAP-TPM.  This new EAP
    method allows network authentication,\nwhich also supports user anonymity, the
    usage of different user\nidentities for the authentication with different network
    operators,\nresult indication, and a fast re-authentication.\n\t "

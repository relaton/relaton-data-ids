  content: "   Bursty concurrent streams from holographic applications can cause\n
    \  congestion in wireless access networks, leading to increased delay\n   and
    QoS issues.  The egress server of a data center (DC egress) can\n   regulate outbound
    network traffic and mitigate congestion if it\n   obtains dynamic information
    about the wireless access network's queue\n   and capabilities.  The document
    proposes a network-assisted multi-\n   flow transmission control scheme that leverages
    underlying link state\n   information of access points to perform delay prediction
    and flow\n   control at the DC egress to alleviate congestion and improve user\n
    \  experience.\n\n\t "

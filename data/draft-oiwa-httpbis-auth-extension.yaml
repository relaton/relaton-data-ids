  content: "   This document specifies a few extensions of HTTP authentication\n   framework
    for interactive clients.  Recently, fundamental features of\n   HTTP-level authentication
    is not enough for complex requirements of\n   various Web-based applications.
    \ This makes these applications to\n   implement their own authentication frameworks
    using HTML Forms and\n   other means, which becomes one of the hurdles against
    introducing\n   secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers and
    user-\n   agent clients.  The extended framework fills gaps between Web\n   application
    requirements and HTTP authentication provisions to solve\n   the above problems,
    while maintaining compatibility against existing\n   Web and non-Web uses of HTTP
    authentications.\n\n\t "

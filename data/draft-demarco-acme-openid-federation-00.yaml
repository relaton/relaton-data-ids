  content: "   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol\n
    \  allows server operators to obtain TLS certificates for their\n   websites,
    based on a demonstration of control over the website's\n   domain via a fully-automated
    challenge/response protocol.\n\n   OpenID Federation 1.0 defines how to build
    a trust infrastructure\n   using a trusted third-party model.  It uses a trust
    evaluation\n   mechanism to attest the possession of public keys, protocol specific\n
    \  metadata and various administrative and technical information related\n   to
    a specific entity.\n\n   This document defines how X.509 certificates associated
    with a given\n   OpenID Federation Entity can be issued by an X.509 Certification\n
    \  Authority through the ACME protocol to the organizations which are\n   part
    of a federation built on top of OpenID Federation 1.0.\n\n\t "

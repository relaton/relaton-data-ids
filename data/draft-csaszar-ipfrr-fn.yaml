  content: "   This document describes the benefits and main applications of sending\n
    \  explicit fast notification (FN) packets to routers in an area. FN\n   packets
    are generated and processed in the dataplane, and a single FN\n   service can
    substitute existing OAM methods for remote failure\n   detection, such as a full
    mesh of multi-hop BFD session. The FN\n   service, therefore, decreases network
    overhead considerable. The main\n   application is fast reroute in pure IP and
    in IP/LDP-MPLS networks\n   called IPFRR-FN. The detour paths used when IPFRR-FN
    is active are in\n   most cases identical to those used after Interior Gateway
    Protocol\n   (IGP) convergence. The proposed mechanism can address all single\n
    \  link, node, and SRLG failures in an area; moreover it is an efficient\n   solution
    to protect against BGP ASBR failures as well as VPN PE\n   router failures. IPFRR-FN
    can be a supplemental tool to provide FRR\n   when LFA cannot repair a failure
    case, while it can be a replacement\n   of existing ASBR/PE protection mechanisms
    by overcoming their\n   scalability and complexity issues.\n\n\t "

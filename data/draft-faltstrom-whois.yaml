  content: "This document presents extensions to the Whois protocol output\nformat
    which enables a possibility for the server to send referal\ninformation to the
    Whois client. This referal mechanism can be used\nfor example in a situation with
    a registrar/registry model, where\nthe registrars all have their own Whois databases,
    and together they\nserve a whole TLD. It can also be used when implementing a\nroot-whois
    service on top of all whois servers in the world, and\nthis way enable the possibility
    of creating advanced proxy services.\nFor the latter, a registration procedure
    is also suggested, where\nWhois services can be registered.\nDiscussion on this
    Internet-Draft is to be held on the mailing list\nietf-whois-ext@imc.org, which
    is hosted by the Internet Mail\nConsortium. To subscribe, send an email to ietf-whois-ext-request@imc.org,

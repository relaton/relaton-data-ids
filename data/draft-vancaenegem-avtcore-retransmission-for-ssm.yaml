  content: "   This document describes RTP retransmission for source-specific\n   multicast
    (SSM) architectures with unicast feedback.  RTP payload\n   format for retransmissions
    has been defined in RFC 4588, whereas the\n   RTP profile an RTP receiver could
    use to issue RTP Control Protocol\n   (RTCP) feedback messages and the format
    of these feedback messages\n   have been defined in RFC 4585.  RFC 5760 defines
    the operation for\n   SSM architectures with unicast feedback.\n\n   First, we
    document potential issues that could arise when providing a\n   retransmission
    service using RTP retransmission (RFC 4588 and RFC\n   4585) for RFC 5760 architectures
    based on rules described in the\n   relevant RFCs.  We then present solutions
    that allow to avoid\n   unnecessary feedback suppression, provide enhanced retransmission\n
    \  services and address congestion control for retransmission in an SSM\n   environment.
    \ These solutions specify certain rules that apply to the\n   distribution source,
    feedback target(s), retransmission source(s) and\n   RTP receivers.\n\n\t "

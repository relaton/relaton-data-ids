  content: "This document specifies the Diameter Application for Authentication\nand
    Authorization in Web Applications (Diameter WebAuth).  This\nDiameter application
    is intended to be used by Diameter clients to\nperform authentication and authorization
    operations with a Diameter\nserver in web-based environments.  It provides facilities
    to allow\nweb sites to authenticate their web user clients using a number of\n(HTTP)
    authentication schemes.  In addition, it supports user\nauthorization using dedicated
    service identifiers.  Diameter WebAuth\nmay also be used by non web-based Diameter
    clients and servers that\nrequire a lightweight authentication and authorization
    Diameter\napplication.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>A robust network has enough capacity to satisfy demand during peak
    hours. It has extra capacity to ensure fault-tolerance. Many networks have a daily
    utilization pattern. For example, a network might be busy during the day and less
    busy at night. These networks have sufficient capacity during peak hours, and
    excess capacity during non-peak hours. Excess capacity increases energy costs
    and environmental impact. This document introduces a Power Conserving Path Placement
    Strategy (PCPPS). When possible, PCPPS concentrates traffic onto a small set of
    network resources. When traffic is concentrated onto a small set of network resources,
    other network resources become idle and can be powered down until they are needed
    again. This solves the problem of excess capacity during non-peak hours.</p>"

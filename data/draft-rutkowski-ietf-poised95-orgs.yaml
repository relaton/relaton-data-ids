  content: "This draft is related to the Hovey and Bradner [1], and Huizer drafts
    [2], addressing only the matter of formal external relationships.               The
    IETF is at a juncture in its evolution.  The key factors to consider are:   a)
    the most effective standards bodies in the past have all been independent;   b)
    failure to do so invariably ends up seriously damaging good standards bodies;
    \  c) incorporation as an independent entity is needed for the IETF;  d) Other
    effective standards bodies on the Internet, in particular the WWW bodies, are
    also independent;   e) one simple and easy alternative proposed here is incorporation
    under Swiss law (which also virtually eliminates liability problems and provides
    the IETF with its own international stature), and locate the secretariat wherever
    desired.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "This paper create a method using a simple implementation to inform \nthe
    traffic source at a very early stage that the network is becoming \noverload or
    congested and to ask the source to slow down its \ntransmission rate. For simplicity,
    the network only indicates \ncongesition to the node where data transmission rate
    will be reduced \nor increased adaptively. For the consideration of asymmetric
    routing \nand to shorten long control delay time, the congestion notification
    \nmessage generated for the incipient congestion in the network should \nimmediately
    routed back according to its source address. Upon \nreceiving this message, the
    source terminal discards this message and \nimmediately initiates its congestion
    control, then it sends message \nto tell the network node to stop adding it.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Section 2.5.1.5 of RFC 4733 specifies how an implementation of the\n
    \  telephony-event payload type can pack multiple short-duration event\n   reports
    into one RTP packet.  Because this capability was added to\n   RFC 4733 in a fashion
    which is not backward compatible with RFC 2833,\n   it is desirable that a sender
    have the means to determine whether the\n   receiver understands such packets.
    \ This memo specifies a new SDP\n   attribute, a=multev, to indicate that capability.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a problem statement for assets lifecycle\n   management
    and operations.  It describes the framework, the\n   motivation and requirements
    for asset-centric metrics including but\n   not limited to asset adoption, usability,
    entitlements, supported\n   features and capabilities, enabled features and capabilities.
    \ An\n   information model is proposed whose primary objective is to measure\n
    \  and improve the network operators' experience along the lifecycle\n   journey,
    from technical requirements and technology selection through\n   renewal, including
    the end of life of an asset.\n\n\t "

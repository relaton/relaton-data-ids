abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines the Prague congestion control scheme,\n
    \  which is derived from DCTCP and adapted for Internet traffic by\n   implementing
    the Prague L4S requirements.  Over paths with L4S\n   support at the bottleneck,
    it adapts the DCTCP mechanisms to achieve\n   consistently low latency and full
    throughput.  It is defined\n   independently of any particular transport protocol
    or operating\n   system, but notes are added that highlight issues specific to
    certain\n   transports and OSs.  It is mainly based on the current default\n   options
    of the reference Linux implementation of TCP Prague, but it\n   includes experience
    from other implementations where available.  It\n   separately describes non-default
    and optional parts, as well as\n   future plans.\n\n   The implementation does
    not satisfy all the Prague requirements (yet)\n   and the IETF might decide that
    certain requirements need to be\n   relaxed as an outcome of the process of trying
    to satisfy them all.\n   In two cases, research code is replaced by placeholders
    until full\n   evaluation is complete.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document addresses the communication between an application\n
    \  server and media server.  The current work in SIPPING and XCON\n   working
    groups show these logical functions but do not address the\n   physical decomposition
    and the protocol between the entities.\n\n   The document presents the architecture
    and the requirements from the\n   protocol.  The document lists current work that
    is relevant to the\n   problem.\n\n\n\t "

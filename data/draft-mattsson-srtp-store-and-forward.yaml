  content: "The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) was designed to allow\nsimple
    and efficient protection of RTP.  To provide this, encryption\nand authentication
    of media and control signaling are tightly coupled\nto the RTP session, and the
    information in the RTP header.  Hence, in\ngeneral, it is not possible to perform
    store-and-forward of protected\nmedia using SRTP.\n\nThis document gives, based
    on a use case analysis, requirements that\nSRTP and new SRTP transforms need to
    satisfy in order to allow secure\nstore-and-forward operation.  A first outline
    on how to introduce the\nneeded new functionality and transforms in SRTP is also
    presented.\n\t "

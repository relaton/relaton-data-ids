  content: "   Repair path mechanism is an important element in IP/LDP fast reroute.\n
    \  In this document we propose a way to calculate local repair paths\n   using
    alternative shortest paths. The solution can provide complete\n   coverage for
    all destinations within an IGP area that can possibly be\n   protected.\n\n   In
    this document we also suggested an \"Explicit Path with Loose\n   Segment\" model
    that can be used to characterize, classify, and\n   analyse repair paths. We proved
    some of the common properties of\n   loose segments, and showed that the model
    can be used to characterize\n   all existing fast reroute solutions.\n\t "

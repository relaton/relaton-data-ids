  content: "This Internet Draft aims at providing general guidelines for the\nAUTOCONF
    solution space, through providing a set of evaluation\nconsiderations for IP autoconfiguration
    mechanisms in MANETs.  These\nevaluation considerations conform to the AUTOCONF
    problem statement\ndraft and the MANET architecture draft.  The main objective
    of this\ndraft is to illustrate some key features and highlight some important\nbehaviours
    for the different autoconf mechanisms, and thus aiming to\nhelp solution developers
    during mechanisms' design and to help\nimplementers in the choice of the autoconf
    mechanism that fits better\ntheir particular requirements, taking into consideration
    a number of\nimportant factors that are discussed in this draft.\n\t "

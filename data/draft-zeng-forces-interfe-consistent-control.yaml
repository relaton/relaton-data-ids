  content: "       This document addresses the inter-FE consistent control problem
    for\n       ForCES in software-defined network (SDN), and proposes an inter-FE\n
    \      consistent control scheme through dynamic match-field selection. In\n       detail,
    the control element (CE) analyzes the similarities and\n       differences between
    both the old and rules. Then, CE dynamically\n       determines appropriate match
    fields and, correspondingly, generates a\n       set of transitional flow entries.
    After that, it deletes the old flow\n       entries and writes the new ones. Finally,
    the consistent control is\n       achieved after deleting the transitional flow
    entries. This scheme\n       guarantees the inter-FE consistent control.\n\n\t "

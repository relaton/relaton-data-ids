  content: "    This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture\n
    \   called OARS which could simplify the data communication process\n    between
    two hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant\n    [RFC4787] [RFC5382]
    NAT devices.  The key mechanism in OARS is the\n    newly defined \"Couple\" operation
    (using STUN [RFC5389] message\n    format) which allows the Relay servers to be
    easily incorporated\n    into existing CGN/CDN nodes which are already deployed
    within the\n    network in a distributed manner.\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\t "

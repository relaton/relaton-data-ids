  content: "During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 both protocols will be used\nsimultaneously.
    \ Most nodes will support both protocols and will be\nable to communicate via
    both IPv4 and IPv6 transport.  Problems arise\nwhen a node only supports IPv4
    and it wants to communicate with a\nnode that only supports IPv6.  Translation
    between the two IP\nprotocols might be needed in some cases.  This memo discusses
    the\nproblems involved in translation between IPv4 and IPv6.\n\t "

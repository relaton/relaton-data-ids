  content: "    This document specifies the extensions to the Session Initiation \n
    \   Protocol (SIP) for the call completion services provided in the \n    context
    of ETSI Next Generation Networks (NGN).  Therefore this \n    document describes
    a SIP event package that enables subscribing to \n    and managing call completion
    queues.  Furthermore this document \n    extends the usage of the Allows-events
    header field to 180 Ringing \n    and 486 Busy responses, and specifies an indication
    used for the \n    prioritization of call-completion calls. \n\n\t "

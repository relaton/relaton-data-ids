  content: "   The updated DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM2) permits an\n   organization
    that owns the signing domain to claim some\n   responsibility for a message by
    associating the domain with the\n   message through a digital signature.  This
    is done by publishing to\n   Domain Name Service (DNS) of the domain a public
    key that is then\n   associated to the domain and where messages can be signed
    by the\n   corresponding private key.  Assertion of responsibility is validated\n
    \  through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer’s domain\n   directly
    to retrieve the appropriate public key.  This document\n   describes DKIM2 DNS
    record format and how to find the record.\n\n\t "

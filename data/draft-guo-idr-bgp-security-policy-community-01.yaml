abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a set of standardized BGP community to signal
    inter-AS routing security policy intent. The initial focus is on RPKI-based Route
    Origin Validation (ROV) using ROAs [RFC6482] [RFC6811] [RFC9582]. ROV produces
    validation outcomes such as "Valid", "Invalid", and "NotFound", but the operational
    treatment of "NotFound" and similar ambiguous cases is entirely a matter of local
    policy and often differs across networks. This document defines transitive community
    that allows an Origin AS to explicitly express its security policy expectations
    regarding how its own originated routes SHOULD be treated when downstream Autonomous
    Systems (ASes) perform ROA-based origin validation. A typical example is an Origin
    AS indicating a preference for strict handling of ambiguous validation outcomes
    (e.g., NotFound) for its prefixes. Unlike validation states, these community does
    not assert correctness, authorization, or RPKI deployment status, which is confront
    to [AVOID-RPKI-STATE-IN-BGP]. Instead, they communicate origin-declared policy
    intent to all downstream ASes, enabling them to correlate this intent with locally
    derived validation results. By enabling explicit signaling of security expectations
    without exporting validation state, this mechanism allows downstream ASes to make
    more informed policy decisions while reducing the risk of accidental outages caused
    by misalignment between origin expectations and downstream local policies. The
    mechanism is orthogonal to existing routing security validation technologies and
    does not alter their semantics or deployment models.</p>

  content: "The CXTP specification uses basic SCTP as transport for CXTP message\nexchanges
    between a mobile node's previous and new access routers.\nIt also relies on a
    pre-established IPsec ESP transport mode tunnel.\nThis document discusses two
    alternative approaches based on\n\"persistent\" associations using either SCTP
    streams feature or GIST\nprotocol.  While both approaches reduce context transfer
    latency\nduring handovers, GIST also offers more flexible transport and richer\nsecurity
    properties.\n\t "

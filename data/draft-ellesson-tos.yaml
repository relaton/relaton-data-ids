    Byte in IPv4 and IPv6 Headers

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes an arrangement of fields in the IPv4 TOS byte\n   [RFC795,
    RFC1349], and in the IPv6 Traffic Class byte [IPv6], and\n   proposes a definition
    for their associated semantics. The intention\n   is to enable the preservation
    of currently useful differential class-\n   based queueing behavior on existing
    network devices, while\n   simultaneously enabling new methods of bandwidth allocation
    and\n   policing via drop preference, all within the context of flows which\n
    \  may be encrypted at the IP layer using IPSEC.\n \n   (Note: the IPv6 Class
    field has recently been expanded to eight bits,\n   but this in not yet available
    in any version of the specification).\n\t "

  content: "   The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the concept\n
    \  of link-layer resources in LLNs.  Nodes are synchronized and follow a\n   schedule.
    \ A cell in that schedule corresponds to an atomic link-\n   layer resource, and
    can be allocated to any pair of neighbors in the\n   network.  This allows the
    schedule to be built to tightly match each\n   node's bandwidth, latency and energy
    constraints.  The [IEEE802154e]\n   standard does not, however, present a mechanism
    to do so, as building\n   and managing the schedule is out of scope of the standard.
    \ This\n   document describes the 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top) and the\n   commands
    it provides to upper network layers such as RPL or GMPLS.\n   The set of functionalities
    includes feedback metrics from cell states\n   so network layers can take routing
    decisions, TSCH configuration and\n   control procedures, and the support for
    decentralized and centralized\n   scheduling.  In addition, 6top can be configured
    to enable packet\n   switching at layer 2.5, analogous to GMPLS.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This is the second release of iTIP.  After having learned from\n   RFC-2446
    where most of this text comes from.  This document\n   represents the common objects
    needed for basic calendaring.  The\n   VTODO, VJOURNAL, VTIMEZONE, recurrence
    rules (RDATE remains), and\n   scheduling and their associated properties have
    been removed.  These\n   removals are expected to appear in new memos at a later
    time and will\n   be independent extensions of this specification.  The new EXTENSIONS\n
    \  property will exist to allow for compatible sets of extensions.\n\t "

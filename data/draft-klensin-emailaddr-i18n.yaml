  content: "   Internationalization of electronic mail addresses is, if anything,\n
    \  more important than the already-completed effort for domain names.\n   In most
    of the contexts in which they are used, domain names can be\n   hidden within
    or as part of various types of references.  Email\n   addresses, by contrast,
    are crucial: use of names of people or\n   organizations as, or as part of, the
    email local part is, for obvious\n   reasons, a well-established tradition on
    the network.  Preventing\n   people from spelling their names correctly is, in
    the long term,\n   inexcusable.  At the same time, email addresses pose a number
    of\n   special problems -- they are more difficult than simple domain names\n
    \  in some respects, but actually easier in others.  This document\n   discusses
    the issues with internationalization of email addresses,\n   explains why some
    obvious approaches are incompatible with the\n   definitions and use of Internet
    mail, and proposes a solution -- for\n   both addressing and email internationalization
    more generally -- that\n   is likely to serve users and the network well for the
    long term.\n\t "

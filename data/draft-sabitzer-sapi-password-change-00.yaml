  content: "   This document proposes a standardized set of API endpoints for securely\n
    \  changing user passwords, using a unique identifier prefix to ensure\n   compatibility
    and avoid conflicts with other APIs. As the number of\n   online accounts continues
    to grow, managing passwords has become\n   increasingly challenging. Even with
    the use of password managers, the\n   process of updating passwords-whether due
    to a security breach,\n   expiration, or other reasons-remains a time-consuming
    and manual task.\n   Currently, there is no standardized method for performing
    password changes\n   across various platforms, which further complicates this
    process. The goal\n   of this proposal is to establish a universal standard for
    password change\n   processes, enabling password managers and services to automate
    password\n   updates with minimal configuration, thereby reducing the burden on
    users\n   and improving overall security.\n\n\t "

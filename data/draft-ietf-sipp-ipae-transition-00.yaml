  script: Latn
  content: "The Internet is experiencing growing pains.  The phenomenal success of
    TCP/IP -- the exponential growth in the size of the global IP-connected Internet
    and the ever increasing number of systems deployed on isolated networks running
    the Internet protocols -- is likely to bring about two serious problems in the
    near future.  First, since the IP routing system has little hierarchical structure
    it may not scale much above its current size.  Secondly, since the 32-bit IP address
    space is assigned in an inefficient manner, it may be exhausted within a few years.
    \ These problems have given rise to a number of proposals for revising the Internet
    Protocol.  SIPP -- the Simple Internet Protocol Plus -- is one proposal for a
    next generation Internet Protocol.                          If SIPP, or any next
    generation IP, is to be successful, it must provide an easy mechanism by which
    hosts and routers implementing the new protocol can continue to interoperate with
    systems using the existing IP version.  Also, there must be mechanism to transition
    the Internet to the new protocol without disrupting operation of the Internet.\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses issues with assigning an IP address to a host\ninterface
    such that the IP address may only be used with a restricted\nset of ports.  This
    concept is referred to herein as a port-\nrestricted IP address.  A number of
    issues with this concept are\ndocumented, and the issues are contrasted with other
    approaches to\ndealing with IPv4 address exhaustion.\n\t "

  content: "The protocol referred to as \"HTTP/1.0\" includes the specification for
    a Basic Access Authentication scheme.  This scheme is not considered to be a secure
    method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed over the
    network as clear text.  A specification for a different authentication scheme
    is needed to address this severe limitation.  This document provides specification
    for such a scheme, referred to as \"Digest Access Authentication\". [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

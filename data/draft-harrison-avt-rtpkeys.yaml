  content: "[Note: This draft is preliminary and is believed to contain errors\nand
    omissions.]\nThis memo describes an RTP payload format (KS) which transports\ncryptographic
    key information for encrypted media streams.  The media\nstreams themselves are
    transported independently, and may or may not\nbe carried by RTP.  The KS payload
    format makes particular provision\nfor media carried by SRTP [4].  The payload
    carried over KS contains\nthe information necessary for seamlessly applying new
    decryption keys\nduring an active session, by means of byte-granularity pointers\nreferencing
    into the protected stream.  The KS payload is based on\nCMS [2] and is scalable
    to a wide variety of streaming media\n\n\t "

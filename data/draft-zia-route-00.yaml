  content: "   The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport\n
    \  protocol (ROUTE Protocol) is specified for robust delivery of\n   application
    objects, including application objects with real-time\n   delivery constraints,
    to receivers over a unidirectional transport.\n   Application objects consist
    of data that has meaning to applications\n   that use the ROUTE Protocol for delivery
    of data to receivers, for\n   example, it can be a file, or a DASH or HLS segment,
    a WAV audio\n   clip, etc. The ROUTE Protocol also supports low-latency streaming\n
    \  applications.\n\n   The ROUTE Protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast,
    and multicast\n   transport. Therefore, it can be run over IP/UDP including multicast\n
    \  IP. ROUTE Protocol can leverage the features of the underlying\n   protocol
    layer, e.g. to provide security it can leverage IP security\n   protocols such
    as IPSec.\n\n\t "

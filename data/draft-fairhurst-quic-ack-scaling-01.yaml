  content: "   ACKs are used by transport protocols to confirm delivery of packets.\n
    \  The transmission of ACKs consumes resources at the receiver, in the\n   network
    and at the sender.  On network paths where there is\n   significant path asymmetry,
    acknowledgments of data receipt can\n   reduce the efficient use of network capacity.
    \ This effect occurs\n   when the return capacity is significantly more constrained
    than the\n   forward capacity, or the cost of transmission per packet is a\n   significant
    component of the total transmission cost.  In these\n   cases, reducing the ratio
    of acknowledgements to data can improve\n   link utilization and reduce link transmission
    costs.  It can also\n   reduce processing overhead at the sender and receiver.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a change to the default acknowledgement policy\n   of
    the QUIC transport protocol to improve performance over paths with\n   appreciable
    asymmetry.\n\n\t "

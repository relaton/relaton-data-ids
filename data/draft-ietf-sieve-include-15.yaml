  content: "The Sieve Email Filtering \"include\" extension permits users to include
    one Sieve script inside another.  This can make managing large scripts or multiple
    sets of scripts much easier, and allows a site and its users to build up libraries
    of scripts.  Users are able to include their own personal scripts or site-wide
    scripts. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

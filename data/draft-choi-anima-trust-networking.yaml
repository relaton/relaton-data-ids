  content: "       This document describes trust networking as an application of\n
    \      autonomic networking. The objective of trustworthy autonomic\n       networking
    is providing trust networking environment where all\n       autonomic nodes can
    communicate without any security concern. It\n       defines a trust networking
    domain and describes how to configure and\n       maintain the trust networking
    domain. While communication within the\n       trust networking domain is done
    with trust, the communication with\n       external nodes should be done via a
    specific autonomic service agent\n       (ASA) called \"trust gateway\". The trust
    gateway ASA performs trust\n       evaluation of the external nodes and enforces
    domain specific\n       policies to keep the domain trustworthy.\n\n\n\n\t "

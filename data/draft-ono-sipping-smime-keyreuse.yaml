- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The SIP User Agent uses Secure MIME (S/MIME) Cryptographic Message\n   Syntax
    (CMS) EnvelopedData to protect SIP messages for\n   confidentiality.  While SIP
    messages can be encrypted with different\n   keying materials for each message
    in a dialog, it usually requires a\n   public key operation for each message and
    the computational cost of\n   such operations are relatively expensive.  This
    draft proposes a\n   method of bidirectional key exchange to reuse keying materials
    for\n   S/MIME-secured messages in a dialog and use a symmetric key mechanism\n
    \  instead of an asymmetric key mechanism such as a public key\n   operation.
    \ The proposed mechanism also achieves the sharing of\n   keying material among
    multiple entities simply.\n\t "

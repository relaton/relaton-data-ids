abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "One goal of this document is to define approaches to achieve a \"once\nand
    only once\" delivery of messages. The EDIINT AS2 protocol [AS2] is\nimplemented
    by a number of software tools on a variety of platforms\nwith varying capabilities
    and with varying network service quality.\nAlthough the AS2 protocol defines a
    unique \"Message-ID\", current\nimplementations of AS2 do not provide a standard
    method to prevent\nthe same message (re-transmitted by the initial sender) from
    reaching\nback-end business applications at the initial receiver.\n\nA second
    goal is to reduce retransmissions and failures when AS2 is used\nin a synchronous
    mode for transmitting MDNs.  There can be a large\nlatency between receipt of
    the POSTed entity body and the MDN response\ncaused by the operations of decompressing,
    decrypting, and signature\nchecks. Uncoordinated timeout policies and intermediate
    devices dropping\nconnections have interfered with reliable data exchange. The
    use of an\nHTTP 102(Processing) status code is described to mitigate these\ndifficulties.
    Use of these reliability features is indicated by\npresence of the \"AS2-Reliability\"
    value in the EDIINT-Features header.\n\nIntended Status\n\nThe intent of this
    document is to be placed on the RFC track as an\nInformational RFC.\n\nFeedback
    Instructions:\nNOTE TO RFC EDITOR:  This section should be removed by the RFC
    editor\nprior to publication.\n\nIf you want to provide feedback on this draft,
    follow these\nguidelines:\n\n-Send feedback via e-mail to the ietf-ediint list
    for discussion,\nwith \"AS2 Reliability\" in the Subject field. To enter or follow
    the\ndiscussion, you need to subscribe to ietf-ediint@imc.org.\n\n-Be specific
    as to what section you are referring to, preferably\nquoting the portion that
    needs modification, after which you state\nyour comments.\n\n-If you are recommending
    some text to be replaced with your suggested\ntext, again, quote the section to
    be replaced, and be clear on the\nsection in question.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes extensions to IS-IS, OSPF, and BGP-LS Traffic\n
    \  Engineering to distribute the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Packet Error\n   Rate
    (PER) metrics for the links that can be used for flexible\n   algorithm and path
    selection purpose.\n\n\n   Note that this document only covers the mechanisms
    with which\n   network-performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms
    for\n   measuring network performance or acting on that information, once\n   distributed,
    are outside the scope of this document.\n\n\t "

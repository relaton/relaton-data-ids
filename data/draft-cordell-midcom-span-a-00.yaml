  content: "SPAN-A (pronounced 'spanner') is a candidate for the pre-midcom SPAN\nprotocol.
    \ The scope of SPAN (Simple Protocol for Augmenting NATs) is\nto enable protocols
    involving multiple associated sessions to operate\nacross NATs.  Such protocols
    typically use transport addresses to\nidentify associated sessions.  This works
    well for environments where\nend-to-end addressing is in force, but is broken
    by the introduction\nof NATs.  SPAN is intended to operate with symmetric NATs
    by using a\nrelay outside the NAT.  It complements STUN [STUN] which operates\nwith
    various kinds of cone NAT.\n\n\n\t "

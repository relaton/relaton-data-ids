  script: Latn
  content: "[RFC5036] and [MLDP] describes the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) \nfor
    setup of point-to-point (P2P), point to multi-point (P2MP) and \nmultipoint-to-multipoint
    (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). \nUpstream node selection for P2MP/MP2MP
    LSP and label map propagation \nfor P2P is based on route availability and local
    policy. If multiple \npaths are available then there is no method for selection
    of certain \npreferred nodes. A new method is defined in this document that can
    \noptionally be used as a tiebreaker among multiple available paths in \nupstream
    node selection. This method provides a mechanism to guide \ntraffic via specific
    set of nodes in a network.\n\t "

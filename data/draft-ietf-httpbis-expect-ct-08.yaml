abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new HTTP header field named Expect-CT, which
    allows web host operators to instruct user agents to expect valid Signed Certificate
    Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these hosts. Expect-CT allows
    web host operators to discover misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency
    deployments. Further, web host operaters can use Expect-CT to ensure that, if
    a UA which supports Expect-CT accepts a misissued certificate, that certificate
    will be discoverable in Certificate Transparency logs.</p>"

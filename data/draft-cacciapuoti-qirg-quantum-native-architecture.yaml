  content: "   This document extends RFC 9340 by outlining a set of quantum-native\n
    \  architectural tenets for the design and evolution of the Quantum\n   Internet.
    \ These principles should not be interpreted as dogmas but\n   as pragmatic guidelines
    and criteria for harnessing the unique\n   properties of quantum entanglement
    within networked systems.  Such\n   design perspectives, while departing from
    the classical Internet,\n   remain aligned with a foundational insight: the principle
    of constant\n   change, articulated in RFC 1958.\n\n   The document specifies
    quantum-native extensions to the Quantum\n   Internet framework, defining an entanglement
    packet switching\n   paradigm and an explicit separation between the Quantum Data
    Plane\n   and Quantum Control Plane.  It introduces Quantum Internet Addressing\n
    \  to extend quantum semantics into control and coordination, and\n   generalizes
    the classical forwarding concept to quantum packets.\n\n\t "

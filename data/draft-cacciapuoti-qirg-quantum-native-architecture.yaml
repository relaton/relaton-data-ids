abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends RFC 9340 by outlining a set of quantum-native
    architectural tenets for the design and evolution of the Quantum Internet. These
    principles should not be interpreted as dogmas but as pragmatic guidelines and
    criteria for harnessing the unique properties of quantum entanglement within networked
    systems. Such design perspectives, while departing from the classical Internet,
    remain aligned with a foundational insight: the principle of constant change,
    articulated in RFC 1958. The document specifies quantum-native extensions to the
    Quantum Internet framework, defining an entanglement packet switching paradigm
    and an explicit separation between the Quantum Data Plane and Quantum Control
    Plane. It introduces Quantum Internet Addressing to extend quantum semantics into
    control and coordination, and generalizes the classical forwarding concept to
    quantum packets.</p>"

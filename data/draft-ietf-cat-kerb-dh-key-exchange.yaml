  content: "   The Kerberos protocol [RFC1510] currently establishes session keys
    by\n   the assertion of one party (usually the KDC).  This document\n   describes
    a method for using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to\n   establish the shared secret
    between a Kerberos client and application\n   service.  For the purposes of this
    document, the Ticket Granting\n   Service is considered an application service.\n\n\t "

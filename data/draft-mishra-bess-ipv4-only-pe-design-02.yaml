  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers try to decide whether or not to\n
    \  upgrade their brown field or green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6\n   transport,
    Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in\n   the transition of
    their Provider (P) core network as well as Provider\n   Edge (PE) Edge network
    from IPv4 to IPv6.  Operators must be able to\n   continue to support IPv4 customers
    when both the Core and Edge\n   networks are IPv4-Only.\n\n   This document details
    an important External BGP (eBGP) PE-CE Edge\n   IPv4-Only peering design that
    leverages the MP-BGP capability\n   exchange by using IPv4 peering as pure transport,
    allowing both IPv4\n   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and IPv6
    Network Layer\n   Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over the same (Border\n
    \  Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session.  The design change provides the\n   same
    Dual Stacking functionality that exists today with separate IPv4\n   and IPv6
    BGP sessions as we have today.  With this design change from\n   a control plane
    perspective a single IPv4 is required for both IPv4\n   and IPv6 routing updates
    and from a data plane forwarindg perspective\n   an IPv4 address need only be
    configured on the PE and CE interface\n   for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding.\n\n
    \  This document provides a IPv4-Only PE design solution for use cases\n   where
    operators are not yet ready to migrate to IPv6 or SRv6 core and\n   would like
    to stay on IPv4-Only Core short to long term and maybe\n   even indefinitely.
    \ With this design, operators can now remain with\n   an IPv4-Only Core and do
    not have to migrate to an IPv6-Only Core.\n\n   From a technical standpoint the
    underlay can remain IPv4 and still\n   transport IPv6 NLRI to support IPv6 customers,
    and so does not need\n   to be migrated to IPv6-Only underlay.  With this IPv4-Only
    PE Design\n   solution , IPv4 addressing only needs to be provisioned for the\n
    \  IPv4-Only PE-CE eBGP Edge peering design, thereby eliminating IPv6\n   provisioning
    at the Edge.  This core and edge IPv4-Only peering\n   design can apply to any
    eBGP peering, public internet or private,\n   which can be either Core networks,
    Data Center networks, Access\n   networks or can be any eBGP peering scenario.
    \ This document provides\n   vendor specific test cases for the IPv4-Only peering
    design as well\n   as test results for the five major vendors stakeholders in
    the\n   routing and switching indusrty, Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia and\n   Huawei.
    \ With the test results provided for the IPv4-Only Edge\n   peering design, the
    goal is that all other vendors around the world\n   that have not been tested
    will begin to adopt and implement this new\n   Best Current Practice for eBGP
    IPv4-Only Edge peering.\n\n   This Best Current Practice IPv4-only eBGP peering
    design\n   specification will help in use cases where operators are not yet\n
    \  ready to migrate to IPv6 or SRv6 core or for very lage operator core\n   with
    thousdands of nodes where it maybe impractical to change the\n   underlay infrastructure
    to IPv6, and can now keep the existing IPv4\n   data plane IP, MPLS or SR-MPLS
    underlay intact indefinitely.\n\n   This document also defines a new IPv4 next
    hop encoding for IPv6 NLRI\n   over IPv4 Next Hop to uses 4 byte IPv4 address
    for the next hop and\n   not a IPv4 mapped IPv6 address.  This encoding has been
    adopted by\n   the industry but has not been standardized until now with this\n
    \  document.\n\n\t "

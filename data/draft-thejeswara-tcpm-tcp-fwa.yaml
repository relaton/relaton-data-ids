  content: "   This document describes TCP Fast Window Advance (FWA) flag in TCP\n
    \  Header to avoid the Head of Line Blocking in TCP long alive\n   connections
    and in TCP long fat networks.  FWA flag shall be set by\n   the sender to force
    the TCP receiver to change its expected sequence\n   number.  This allows the
    application sender to send fresh application\n   session data to receiver on the
    existing TCP connection without\n   blocking on the earlier session.  The FWA
    flag will solve long\n   standing Head of Line (HOL) blocking problem in TCP for
    certain TCP\n   applications.\n\n\t "

  content: "Meeting quality of service (QoS) in a network is \nchallenging. DiffServe
    architecture, given in [RFC2474] has \nbeen proposed as a solution. However, it
    results in a \nkind of self-simlalarity in the network traffic. The method \nresults
    in the reduction of bit rates and discard of \ncells during congestion. It requires
    re transmission of \nthe same data. Alternatively, the information input can be
    \nreduced with hierarchical arrangement of data in to different \nlevels of abstraction.
    With the increased load on the network, \nthe complexity of meeting QoS and the
    issues of congestion \nare to be transferred to the receiver from the network.

  content: "   Header Compression over IPsec [HCOIPSEC], documents the work items\n
    \  needed to integrate hop-by-hop header compression algorithms with\n   IPsec
    security associations.  However, as a result of various\n   discussions within
    the IETF, two alternative approaches to achieving\n   HCoIPsec have emerged.  This
    draft is intended to document the two\n   alternatives, and help those involved
    with HCoIPsec development\n   converge on one common approach for realizing HCoIPsec.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the\n
    \  needs of new applications, particularly including the applications\n   that
    are associated with 5G services.  These applications require\n   better isolation
    and have more stringent performance requirements\n   than that can be provided
    with traditional overlay VPNs.  An enhanced\n   VPN may be used for 5G transport
    network slicing, and will also be of\n   use in more generic scenarios.  This
    document specifies the IGP\n   mechanisms with necessary extensions to build a
    set of Segment\n   Routing (SR) based virtual networks with customized topology
    and\n   resource attributes in the network.  These virtual networks could be\n
    \  used as the underlay of enhanced VPN service.  The proposed mechanism\n   is
    applicable to both Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS)\n   and segment
    routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).\n\n\n\t "

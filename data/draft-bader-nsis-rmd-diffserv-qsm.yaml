abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes an NSIS QoS Signaling Policy model for \n   networks
    that use the Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) \n   concept.  RMD is a technique
    for adding admission control to \n   Differentiated Services (Diffserv) networks.
    \ RMD complements \n   the Diffserv architecture by pushing complex classification,
    \n   conditioning and admission control functions to the edges of a \n   Diffserv
    domain and simplifying the operation of internal nodes. \n\t "

  content: "This document examines the proposal for a SIP extension to allow \nauthentication
    of a user-agent through a proxy to a RADIUS server \nusing CHAP put forward by
    Byerly and Williams [BYERLY]. An \nalternative method is offered which does not
    require any changes to \nthe SIP protocol as defined in [SIP]. It also will not
    require any \nmodification to the way RADIUS clients communicate with RADIUS\nServers
    [RADIUS], although it will change the way some of the\nfields are interpreted
    by the RADIUS server.\n\t "

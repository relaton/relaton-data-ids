  content: "This document describes open research challenges for network virtualization.
    \ Network virtualization is following a similar path as previously taken by cloud
    computing.  Specifically, cloud computing popularized migration of computing functions
    (e.g., applications) and storage from local, dedicated, physical resources to
    remote virtual functions accessible through the Internet.  In a similar manner,
    network virtualization is encouraging migration of networking functions from dedicated
    physical hardware nodes to a virtualized pool of resources.  However, network
    virtualization can be considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing
    as it not only involves virtualization of computing and storage functions but
    also involves abstraction of the network itself.  This document describes current
    research and engineering challenges in network virtualization including the guarantee
    of quality of service, performance improvement, support for multiple domains,
    network slicing, service composition, device virtualization, privacy and security,
    separation of control concerns, network function placement, and testing.  In addition,
    some proposals are made for new activities in the IETF and IRTF that could address
    some of these challenges.  This document is a product of the Network Function
    Virtualization Research Group (NFVRG).\n\t "

  content: "   When certificates are used as credentials to attest the assignment
    of\n   ownership of telephone numbers, some mechanism is required to provide\n
    \  certificate freshness.  This document specifies short-lived\n   certificates
    as a means of guaranteeing certificate freshness for\n   secure telephone identity
    (STIR), potentially relying on the\n   Automated Certificate Management Environment
    (ACME) or similar\n   mechanisms to allow signers to acquire certificates as needed.\n\n\t "

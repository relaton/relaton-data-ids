  content: "Protection and recovery are important features of service offerings in
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Increasingly,
    MPLS and GMPLS networks are being extended from single domain scope to multi-domain
    environments.\n\n Various schemes and processes have been developed to establish
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain environments. These are discussed
    in RFC 4726: \"A Framework for Inter-Domain Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic
    Engineering\".\n\n This document analyzes the application of these techniques
    to protection and recovery in multi-domain networks. The main focus for this document
    is on establishing end-to-end diverse Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs in multi-domain
    networks. This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

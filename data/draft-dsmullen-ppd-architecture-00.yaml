- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a framework that empowers users to define and\n
    \  enforce privacy policies within their home networks through a Privacy\n   Preference
    Declaration (PPD) protocol.  As connected devices\n   proliferate, this approach
    enhances user control by enabling user-\n   defined privacy settings for different
    data types, automatic policy\n   discovery by new devices, and accountability
    measures such as\n   notifications, network restrictions, or perhaps reporting
    non-\n   compliance with users' defined preferences to designated authorities.\n
    \  The framework aims to cultivate a privacy-conscious home network\n   environment
    through clear, enforceable privacy governance.\n\n\t "

  content: "  This paper defines a new extension header-SRv6 Policy Key\n  to focusing
    on the problems of timeliness and accuracy of\n  controller-aware paths in SRv6
    networks.\n  The scheme enables network nodes to report path information\n  to
    the controller by adding a path unique identifier to the\n  message header, which
    ensures that the controller has a\n  real-time and accurate picture of the SR
    path status. Even if\n  the SID is lost in transmission or the controller is unable\n
    \ to monitor it in real time and accurately.\n  This approach aims to network
    availability and O&M efficiency\n  of SDN, particularly in scenarios involving
    multi-path tunnel\n  configurations and load balancing.\n\n\n\t "

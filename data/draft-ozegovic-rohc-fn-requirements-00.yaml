  content: "This draft describes requirements expected to be achieved with \nprofile
    formal notation system for ROHC.\nThe RObust Header Compression (ROHC) [1] scheme
    is designed to \ncompress packet headers over error prone channels. It is built
    \naround an extensible core framework that can be tailored to \ncompress new protocol
    stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.\nThe role of formal notation is to
    provide a simple method for ROHC\nprofile specification. It is to be used in the
    phase of profile\nrefinement to achieve maximal compression ratio possible, as
    well \nas in the phase of software implementation to provide unambiguous\nprofile
    specification. \n\t "

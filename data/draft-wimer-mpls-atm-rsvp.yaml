  content: "The MPLS Architecture [MPLS-ARCH] discusses a way in which ATM\nswitches
    may be used as Label Switching Routers.  The ATM switches\nrun network layer routing
    algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.), and\ntheir data forwarding is based on
    the results of these routing\nalgorithms.  Additional ATM-specific routing and
    addressing is\noptional but not required.  ATM switches used in this way are known\nas
    ATM-LSRs.\n\n\t "

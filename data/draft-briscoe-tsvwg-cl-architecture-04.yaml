  content: "This document describes a deployment model for pre-congestion \nnotification
    (PCN) operating in a large DiffServ-based region of the \nInternet. PCN-based
    admission control protects the quality of service \nof existing flows in normal
    circumstances, whilst if necessary (eg \nafter a large failure) pre-emption of
    some flows preserves the quality \nof service of the remaining flows. Each link
    has a configured-\nadmission-rate and a configured-pre-emption-rate, and a router
    marks \npackets that exceed these rates. Hence routers give an early warning of
    \ntheir own potential congestion, before packets need to be dropped. \nGateways
    around the edges of the PCN-region convert measurements of \npacket rates and
    their markings into decisions about whether to admit \nnew flows, and (if necessary)
    into the rate of excess traffic that \nshould be pre-empted. Per-flow admission
    states are kept at the \ngateways only, while the PCN markers that are required
    for all routers \noperate on the aggregate traffic - hence there is no scalability
    impact \non interior routers.  \n\t "

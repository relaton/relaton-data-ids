  content: "   Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering to deploy\n
    \  Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks.  As a\n   consequence
    of this development, there is a need for interconnecting\n   these local CDNs.
    \ The necessary interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs\n   are currently being defined
    in the Content Delivery Networks\n   Interconnection (CDNI) WG.  This document
    focuses on the CDNI\n   Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI).\n
    \  Specifically, this document outlines how the solutions currently\n   being
    defined in the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) WG\n   can facilitate
    Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement in a CDNI\n   context, i.e. how the CDNI
    FCI can be realised with the ALTO\n   protocol.  Concrete examples of how ALTO
    can be integrated within\n   CDNI request routing and in particular in the process
    of selecting a\n   downstream CDN are given.  The examples in this document are
    based on\n   the use cases and examples currently being discussed in the CDNI
    WG.\n\n\t "

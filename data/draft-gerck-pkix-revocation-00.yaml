  content: "   PKIX certificate revocation protocols are primarily described in \n
    \  RFC3280. This Document revisits limitations on determining the \n   revocation
    status of a certificate.  Ambiguous aspects of revocation \n   and revocation
    delegation are resolved.  An objective point of view \n   is introduced as a reference
    that does not depend on the observer \n   (e.g., the RP).  The revocation status
    of a certificate issued by a \n   conforming CA is shown to be always well-defined
    from a relying \n   party's point of view -- i.e., it is unambiguous (revoked
    or not \n   revoked) and ultimately determinable at any period in time. The \n
    \  limitations on determining the revocation status of a certificate \n   have
    nothing to do with the eventual result of the determination \n   process by a
    relying party. The limitations have to do with the \n   efforts for that determination,
    which may require a large (actually \n   unspecified) amount of time and work.
    Some practices are also \n   suggested, allowing a relying party to determine
    the revocation \n   status of a certificate with higher reliability in less time.
    The \n   same considerations apply to determinations of status \"change\" \n   processes,
    including certificateHold and removefromCRL. \n\t "

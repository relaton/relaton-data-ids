  content: "This   document  presents   a  QoS   architecture   framework  with\npreliminary
    protocol specifications for next generation wireless IP\nnetworks. The  architecture
    is based on  differentiated services in\nthat traffic are aggregated and forwarded
    in backbone network based\non per  hop behaviors.  In the proposed  architecture,
    there  is at\nleast  one   global  server  and   several  local  nodes   in  each\nadministration
    domain. The server is  referred to as the QoS Global\nServer (or QGS), and local
    nodes are referred to as QoS local nodes\n(or  QLN).   QLNs  are  ingress  nodes
    of  the  DS  (Differentiated\nService)  domain.   They reside  generally  in  the
    \ edge of  wired\nbackbone networks.  The QGS retains  the global information
    \ of the\ndomain, and  informs QLNs  what to do  when traffic comes  in.  The\nmobile
    station (MS) has the  QoS signaling with QGS only.  Once the\nQoS signaling is
    done, the QGS updates the QoS profile in each QLN.\nThe MS  is then free to  move
    within the same  domain without other\nQoS signaling.  The actual traffic generated
    by MS goes through QLN\nonly.  The QGS is in control plane and QLNs are in transport
    plane.\nBy  retaining   the  global  information  in   central  server  and\nseparating
    \ control and  transport, the  architecture  is flexible,\neasy  to   add  new
    \ services,   and  more  efficient   for  mobile\nenvironment.\n\t "

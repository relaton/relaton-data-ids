  content: "LSP-Ping is an existing and widely deployed OAM mechanism for MPLS\nLSPs.
    \ This document describes extensions to LSP-Ping so that LSP-\nPing can be used
    to perform OAM on MPLS-TP LSPs.  It also clarifies\nthe procedures to be used
    for processing the OAM packets.  Further,\nit describes how LSP-Ping can be used
    to perform Connectivity\nVerification, Route Tracing and Adjacency functions in
    MPLS-TP\nnetworks.\n\t "

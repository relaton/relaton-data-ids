  content: "This draft proposes an extension to the multicast routing table in\nrouters
    in order to achieve better support for using multicast\nwithin Differentiated
    Services (DS) networks. Only one additional DS\ncodepoint for each virtual interface
    in the multicast routing table\nis required to open up a variety of different
    uses, e.g., to solve\nresource provisioning problems or to support heterogeneous
    DiffServ\nmulticast groups.\n\n\t "

  content: "This Internet Draft describes, analyzes, and compares different\nstrategies
    for allocating addresses, in a way that can be generalized\nfor any power-of-two
    sized, binary address space.  One such strategy\nis proposed as being \"optimal\",
    when viewed from the perspective of\nspace-packing efficiency.  This Draft recommends
    use of this\ntechnique as a \"Best Current Practice\", for both IPv4 and IPv6\naddress
    allocations.Author's Note\n\nThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this
    draft or a related\ndraft(s) being placed on the Informational Track for v6ops.\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in [2]\n\t "

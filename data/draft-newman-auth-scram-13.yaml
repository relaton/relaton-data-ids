  content: "The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by\nInternet
    application protocols is the transmission of clear-text\npasswords over a channel
    protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nThere are some significant security
    concerns with that mechanism,\nwhich could be addressed by the use of a challenge
    response\nauthentication mechanism protected by TLS.  Unfortunately, the\nchallenge
    response mechanisms presently on the standards track all\nfail to meet requirements
    necessary for widespread deployment, and\nhave had success only in limited use.\n\nThis
    specification describes a family of Simple Authentication and\nSecurity Layer
    (SASL, RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called the\nSalted Challenge Response
    Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which\naddresses the security concerns and meets
    the deployability\nrequirements.  When used in combination with TLS or an equivalent\nsecurity
    layer, a mechanism from this family could improve the\nstatus-quo for application
    protocol authentication and provide a\nsuitable choice for a mandatory-to-implement
    mechanism for future\napplication protocol standards.\n\t "

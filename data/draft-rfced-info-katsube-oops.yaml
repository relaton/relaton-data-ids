  content: "This memo describes a new internetworking architecture which makes better
    use of the property of ATM.  IP datagrams are transferred along hop-by-hop path
    via routers, but datagram assembly/disassembly and IP header processing are not
    necessarily carried out at individual routers in the proposed architecture.  A
    concept of 'Cell Switch Router (CSR)' is introduced as a new internetworking equipment,
    which has ATM cell switching capabilities in addition to conventional IP datagram
    forwarding.  Proposed architecture can provide applications with high-throughput
    and low-latency ATM pipes while retaining current router-based internetworking
    concept.  It also provides applications with specific QoS/bandwidth by cooperating
    with internetworking level resource reservation protocols such as RSVP.\n\t "

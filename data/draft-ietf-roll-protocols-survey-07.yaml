  content: "   Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and smart    objects,
    present difficult constraints: very limited memory, little\n   processing power,
    and long sleep periods.  As most of these devices\n   are battery-powered, energy
    efficiency is critically important.\n   Wireless link qualities can vary significantly
    over time, requiring\n   protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize topology
    change energy\n   costs.  Routing over such low power and lossy networks introduces\n
    \  requirements that existing routing protocols may not fully address.\n   Using
    existing application requirements documents, this document\n   derives a minimal
    and not exhaustive set of criteria for routing in\n   low-power and lossy networks.
    \ It provides a brief survey of the\n   strengths and weaknesses of existing protocols
    with respect to these\n   criteria.  From this survey it examines whether existing
    and mature\n   IETF protocols can be used without modification in these networks,
    or\n   whether further work is necessary.  It concludes that no existing\n   IETF
    protocol meets the requirements of this domain.\n\t "

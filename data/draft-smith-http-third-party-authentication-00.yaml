  content: "Existing HTTP authentication schemes require knowledge of the secret\nused
    to establish the client's identity be known in some manner by\nthe site requiring
    the authentication.  Some situations exist in\nwhich a site has a legitimate reason
    to authenticate a client but\ncannot be trusted with the information required
    to authenticate that\nclient.  The authentication scheme defined in this document
    allows a\nsite to authenticate a client via a trusted third-party.\n\t "

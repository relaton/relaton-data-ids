abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The current Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) specification dictates\nthat
    a transport layer connection can carry SIP requests in only one\ndirection i.e.
    from the client to the server.  This presents\nscalability problems as twice the
    number of connections are needed\nfor each pair of SIP entities that communicate
    with each other.  The\ninternet-draft [I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse] specifies a
    mechanism for\nreusing SIP over TLS connections.  However, that document is\npredicated
    on secure TLS mutual authentication and specifically\nrefrains connection reuse
    for transports such as SIP over TCP and\nSCTP.  There are many situations, such
    as in Trust Domains [RFC3324],\nwhere TLS mutual authentication may not be required
    but where\nconnection reuse is beneficial.  This document specifies connection\nreuse
    for SIP over connection-oriented transports such as TCP and\nSCTP.  It specifies
    the same mechanism for connection reuse as\nspecified in [I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse],
    however, the solution is\npresented in the context of Trust Domains.\n\t "

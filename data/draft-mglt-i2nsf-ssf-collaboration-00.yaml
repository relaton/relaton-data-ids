  content: "   This document specifies a collaboration agreement protocol.  The\n
    \  collaboration agreement makes possible individual security services\n   functions
    (SSF) to collaborate with each other.  The collaboration is\n   mostly intended
    for SSF located in different administrative domains,\n   in which case the collaboration
    cannot be performed by a shared\n   orchestrator.\n\n   The collaboration between
    SSF in different domains assumes the\n   traffic is steered through the two domains.\n\n\t "

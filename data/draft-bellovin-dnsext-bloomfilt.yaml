abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Some aspects of DNSSEC, such as NXDOMAIN error messages, require an\nauthenticated
    answer.  Producing this answer requires complex\nmechanisms, online storage of
    the zone's secret key, expensive online\ncomputations, or massive zone files.
    \ As an alternative, we propose\nstorage of authenticated pointers to Bloom filters.
    \ This scheme\nprovides large reductions in the size of, and computational expense\nto
    produce, partially-signed zone files.\n\t "

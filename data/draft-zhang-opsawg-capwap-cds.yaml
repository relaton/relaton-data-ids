  content: "   CAPWAP defines a specification to encapsulate a station's data frames\n
    \  between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller\n   (AC)
    using CAPWAP.  Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data\n   frames can be
    either locally bridged or tunneled to the AC.  When\n   tunneled, a CAPWAP data
    channel is used for tunneling.  In many\n   deployments it is desirable to encapsulate
    date frames to an entity\n   different from the AC for example to an Access Router
    (AR).  Further,\n   it may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulations
    to\n   carry the stations' data frames.  This document provides a\n   specification
    for this and refers to it as Alternate tunnel\n   encapsulation.  The Alternate
    tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP\n   to tunnel non-management data frames
    to an endpoint different from\n   the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of
    many known encapsulation\n   types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.  The WTP may
    advertise support\n   for Alternate tunnel encapsulation during the discovery
    or join\n   process and AC may select one of the supported Alternate Tunnel\n
    \  encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.\n\n\t "

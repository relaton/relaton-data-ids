  content: "     RFC3530 described an fs_locations attribute which can be used to\n
    \    allow an fs to migrate between servers without disrupting client\n     access
    and to refer a client to another server providing access to\n     a specified
    file system.  Initial implementation work for this\n     feature has exposed a
    number of areas where RFC3530's handling of\n     the issues leaves something
    to be desired.  This document makes a\n     number of suggestions to remedy these
    issues when the NFSv4 spec\n     next undergoes a significant revision, most likely
    in connection\n     with implementing a new minor revision, such as NFSv4.1.\n\t "

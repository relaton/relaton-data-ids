  content: "   In customer sites having IPv4-only CPEs, Teredo provides a last\n   resort
    IPv6 connectivity [RFC4380] [RFC5991] [RFC6081].  However,\n   because it is designed
    to work without involvement of Internet\n   service providers, it has significant
    limitations (connectivity\n   between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses
    is uncertain;\n   connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations
    of\n   NAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that, being base on ISP\n
    \  cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of IPv6\n   addresses,
    it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix by network\n   specific prefixes assigned
    by local ISP's (an evolution similar to\n   that from 6to4 to 6rd).  In hosts,
    6a44 can be implemented either\n   autonomously or as an extension of Teredo.
    \ The specification is\n   complete enough for actual deployment, including with
    independently\n   written codes.\n\n\t "

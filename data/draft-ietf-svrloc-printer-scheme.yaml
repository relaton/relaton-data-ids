  content: "This document is a product of the Service Location and Internet\nPrinting
    Protocol Working Groups of the Internet Engineering Task\nForce (IETF).  Comments
    should be sent to the srvloc@srvloc.org and\nipp@pwg.org mailing lists.  \nThis
    document defines the 'service:printer:' abstract type and the\nattributes associated
    with it.  This 'service:printer:' template is\ndesigned to be used in conjunction
    with the Service Location\nProtocol, Version 2 (SLPv2) [13], but may be used with
    any directory\nservice which supports attribute/value pair registration, such
    as the\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol, Version 3 (LDAPv3 [16]).  \nThe
    'service:printer:' type is specified as an abstract service type.\nPrinters advertised
    with the 'service:printer:' abstract type may be \naccessible by one or more print
    protocols, such as IPP [3] and LPR\n[2].  \n\n\t "

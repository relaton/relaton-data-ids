  content: "   The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol is a key management\n
    \  standard defined in RFC 3830 for streaming and real-time\n   applications.
    In these applications, the MIKEY protocol may be used\n   to provide group key
    management. With the base protocol, the change\n   of one group member triggers
    the unicast transmission of a new group\n   key to all members. In the context
    of an application delivering\n   multicast streams to end-users located at multiple
    capillary\n   networks, the key update messages may scale in proportion to the\n
    \  number of nodes; thus creating a substantial overhead. This I-D\n   proposes
    an extension to the MIKEY protocol allowing the management\n   of the group as
    a set of clusters, but with fewer changes to the RFC\n   3830 standard. Clustering
    helps in reducing the communication\n   overhead produced during key update by
    using unicast mode only with\n   nodes that belong to clusters where group membership
    changes\n\n\t "

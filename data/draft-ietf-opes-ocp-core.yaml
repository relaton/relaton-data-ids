  content: "This document specifies the core of the Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES)
    Callout Protocol (OCP).  OCP marshals application messages from other communication
    protocols: An OPES intermediary sends original application messages to a callout
    server; the callout server sends adapted application messages back to the processor.
    \ OCP is designed with typical adaptation tasks in mind (e.g., virus and spam
    management, language and format translation, message anonymization, or advertisement
    manipulation).  As defined in this document, the OCP Core consists of application-agnostic
    mechanisms essential for efficient support of typical adaptations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

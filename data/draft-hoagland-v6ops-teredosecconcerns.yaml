  content: "Additional security concerns with Teredo are documented, beyond what\n
    \  is in RFC 4380.  This is based on an independent analysis of Teredo's\n   security
    implications.  The primary intent of this document is to\n   provide information
    and recommendations to the IETF that can be used\n   in any updated Teredo specification.
    \ The second intended audience is\n   anyone that can help improve security in
    Teredo as deployed, so they\n   will be aware of these concerns.\n\t "

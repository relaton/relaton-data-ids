  content: "   IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable\n   implementations.
    \ Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly\n   gaining popularity in several
    deployment scenarios, not the least in\n   what used to be solely areas of traditional
    telecommunication\n   protocols.  Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods
    that\n   enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and\n
    \  two-way network performance.  Unfortunately, however, standard IP\n   performance
    measurement security mechanisms cannot be readily used\n   with IPsec.  This document
    makes the case for employing IPsec to\n   protect O/TWAMP and proposes a method
    which combines IKEv2 and\n   O/TWAMP as defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively.
    \ This\n   specification aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be\n
    \  secured, while on the other hand, it extends the applicability of\n   O/TWAMP
    to networks that have already deployed IPsec.\n\n\t "

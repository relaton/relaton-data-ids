  content: "   This document describes version 1.3 of the Ethernet Automatic\n   Protection
    Switching (EAPS) (TM) technology invented by Extreme\n   Networks to increase
    the availability and robustness of Ethernet\n   rings.  An Ethernet ring built
    using EAPS can have resilience\n   comparable to that provided by SONET rings,
    at lower cost and without\n   some of the constraints (e.g. ring size) of SONET.\n\n\t "

  content: "   With WiFi beginning to establishing itself as a trusted access\n   network
    for service providers, it has become important to provide\n   functions commonly
    available in 3G and 4G networks in WiFi access\n   networks.  Such functions include
    Access Point Name (APN) Selection,\n   multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections
    and seamless mobility\n   between WiFi and 3G/4G networks.\n\n   EAP/AKA (and
    EAP/AKA') is standardized by 3GPP as the access\n   authentication protocol for
    trusted access networks.  This IETF\n   specification is required for mobile devices
    to access the 3GPP\n   Evolved Packet Core (EPC) networks.  This document defines
    a few new\n   EAP attributes and procedures to provide the above-mentioned\n   functions
    in trusted WiFi access networks.\n\n\t "

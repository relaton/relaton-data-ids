  content: "   There are on-going activities in the networking community to develop\n
    \  solutions that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous\n   wired
    and wireless access systems including, but not limited to, IEEE\n   802.21.  Intelligent
    access selection, taking into account link layer\n   attributes, requires the
    delivery of a variety of different\n   information types to the terminal from
    different sources within the\n   network and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements
    for this\n   signalling have both transport and security issues that must be\n
    \  considered.  The signalling must not be constrained to specific link\n   types,
    so there is at least a common component to the signalling\n   problem which is
    within the scope of the IETF.  This draft presents a\n   problem statement for
    this core problem.\n\n\t "

  content: "The changing structure and size of today's Internet has taxed the \nexisting
    name services and their architecture to the breaking \npoint. The DNS system of
    today was unfortunately architected to \nhave a single root zone and limited set
    of Top Level Domains. This \nis defined usually in the set of root servers any
    resolving \nrequest uses to lookup an address. \n\nThis proposal then is an attempt
    to lessen the impact on end-users \nand registrars and to allow IP owners a greater
    freedom in \nrepresenting namespace to their customers. \n\nThe elevator description
    is that this I-D proposes the \nrestructuring of domain names more fully along
    the lines of a \ntelephone number by creating a ROOT ZONE PROTOCOL as an addition
    \nto multiply the existing DNS services times the number of ROOT \nZONES.\n\t "

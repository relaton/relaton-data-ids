  content: "   Many of today's Web security problems have their root in the\n   widespread
    usage of weak authentication mechanisms bundled with the\n   usage of password
    based credentials.  Dealing with both of these\n   problems is the basis of this
    publication.\n\n   This document extends the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol\n
    \  with a flexible and widely deployed authentication framework, namely\n   the
    Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), to improve security of\n   Web- as well
    as non-Web-based applications.  The EAP framework allows\n   so-called EAP methods,
    i.e. authentication and key exchange\n   protocols, to be plugged into EAP without
    having to re-design the\n   underlying protocol.  The benefit of such an easy
    integration is the\n   ability to run authentication protocols that fit a specific\n
    \  deployment environment, both from a credential choice as well as from\n   the
    security and performance characteristics of the actual protocol.\n\n   This work
    follows the example of IKEv2, where EAP has been added to\n   allow clients to
    seamlessly use different forms of authentication\n   credentials, such as passwords,
    token cards, and shared secrets.\n\n\t "

    Name System (DNS) servers, and in the data that these DNS servers contain.  This
    memo tries to summarize current Internet requirements as well as common practice
    in the operation and configuration of the DNS.  This memo also tries to summarize
    or expand upon issues raised in [RFC 1537].\n\t "

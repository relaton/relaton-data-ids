  content: "   This document specifies a set of new DNS Resource Record (RR) types\n
    \  to support the Data Interoperability Protocol (DIP).  DIP models\n   entities
    as \"Data Objects\" (DOs) indexed by \"Data Object Identifiers\"\n   (DOIs), which
    are syntactically equivalent to DNS domain names.  The\n   RR types specified
    herein-DLR, DOPK, DOAUTH, DODIGEST, DOCG, and\n   DOALGO-are designed to hold
    key attributes of a DO.  This approach\n   addresses the inherent limitations
    of repurposing existing RR types\n   (such as TXT) with respect to structured
    data representation,\n   efficiency in handling binary data, and query granularity.
    \ The\n   result is a native, efficient, and extensible mechanism for\n   discovering
    and managing DO metadata via the DNS.\n\n\t "

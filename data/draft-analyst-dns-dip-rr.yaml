abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a set of new DNS Resource Record (RR) types
    to support the Data Interoperability Protocol (DIP). DIP models entities as "Data
    Objects" (DOs) indexed by "Data Object Identifiers" (DOIs), which are syntactically
    equivalent to DNS domain names. The RR types specified herein-DLR, DOPK, DOAUTH,
    DODIGEST, DOCG, and DOALGO-are designed to hold key attributes of a DO. This approach
    addresses the inherent limitations of repurposing existing RR types (such as TXT)
    with respect to structured data representation, efficiency in handling binary
    data, and query granularity. The result is a native, efficient, and extensible
    mechanism for discovering and managing DO metadata via the DNS.</p>

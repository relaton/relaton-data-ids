- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a methodology for testing the operation, \n  administration
    and maintenance (OA&M) of a general VPN service, that \n  is applied here to Hierarchical
    Virtual Private LAN Services (HVPLS) \n  as described in [VPLS].  As part of this
    methodology, the MPLS ping \n  concepts described in [LSP-PING] are extended to
    enable HVPLS spoke-\n  to-spoke connectivity testing.  The approaches to identifying
    OAM \n  packets has also been made compatible with [LSP-PING] and [PWE3-VCCV].
    \ \n   \n  These are the goals of this draft: \n       -   checking connectivity
    between 'service-aware' nodes of a \n           network, \n       -   verifying
    data plane and control plane integrity, \n       -   verifying service membership
    \n   \n  There are two specific requirements to which we call attention because
    \n  of their seemingly contradictory nature: \n       -   the checking of connectivity
    MUST involve the ability to use \n           packets that look like customer packets
    \n       -   the OAM packets MUST not propagate beyond the boundary of the \n
    \          provider network\n\t "

  content: "In Proxy Mobile IPv6, one prefix can only be assigned to one\ninterface
    of a mobile node by the local mobility anchor (LMA) and\ndifferent mobile nodes
    can not share this home network prefix.\nManaging per-MN's interface home network
    prefixes is likely to\nincrease the processing load at the LMA.  Based on the
    idea that\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers can\nmanage
    prefixes, we propose a new technique in which LMA offloads\ndelegation and release
    tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6 server.\nLMA requests a prefix for an incoming
    mobile node to the DHCPv6\nserver.  Based on this prefix, the mobile node can
    create a home\naddress for its interface.  When the mobile station leaves the\nnetwork,
    the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server.\nAuthentication, Authorization and
    Accounting (AAA) servers can also\nplay a role in prefix delegation.\n\t "

  content: "IP mutli-function Media Server control is a problem that has slowly\nbubbled
    up in importance over the past four years.  A driver in the\nIETF is the requirements
    generated by the XCON framework.  Many\napproaches have been proposed.  Some of
    these proposals are device-\ncontrolled-oriented, such as H.248.  Others are server-oriented,\nusing
    SIP and application-oriented markup.  Before rushing headlong\ninto a framework
    for a solution, it is time to step back and try to\nunderstand just what the scope
    of the problem is.  Once consensus is\nreached, we can then move forward with
    a framework for a solution.\n\nThis document describes a number of existing approaches
    and proposals\nto solve the Application Server - Media Server protocol problem,\ntheir
    characteristics and benefits and drawbacks.\n\n\t "

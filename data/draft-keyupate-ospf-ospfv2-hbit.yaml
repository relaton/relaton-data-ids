  content: "   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] defines an option field for router-LSAs known as a\n
    \  R-bit.  If the R-bit is clear, an OSPFv3 router can participate in\n   OSPF
    topology distribution without acting as a forwarder to forward\n   the transit
    traffic.  In such cases, an OSPF router would only accept\n   traffic intended
    for local delivery.  This draft defines R-bit\n   functionality for OSPFv2 defined
    in [RFC2328].\n\n\t "

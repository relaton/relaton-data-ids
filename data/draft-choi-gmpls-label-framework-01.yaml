  script: Latn
  content: "Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends the MPLS \ncontrol
    plane to encompass packet switching, time-division, lambda \nand fiber switching.
    The new forms of label which used in GMPLS to \ndeal with the widening scope of
    MPLS into the optical and time domain \nare collectively referred to as a 'Generalized
    Label'. In this draft \nfor extending MPLS label specification [5], we describe
    the concept \nand characteristics of Generalized Label for GMPLS. We also discuss
    \nthe format and considerations for label encoding. Particularly we \npresent
    the necessity of mapping rule at ingress and egress switching \ninterface where
    data flows with label of a different granularity are \nmerged into the aggregated
    data flow of large bandwidth. \n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 5492 allows a BGP speaker to advertise its capabilities to its peer.
    When a route is propagated beyond the immediate peer, it is useful to allow certain
    capabilities to be conveyed further. In particular, it may be useful to advertise
    forwarding plane features. This specification defines a new BGP transitive attribute
    to carry such capability information, the "Router Capabilities Attribute," or
    RCA. This specification also defines an RCA capability that can be used to advertise
    the ability to process the MPLS Entropy Label as an egress LSR for all NLRI advertised
    in the BGP UPDATE. It updates RFC 6790 and RFC 7447 concerning this BGP signaling.</p>

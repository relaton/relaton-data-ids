  content: "   This document presents a detailed analysis of the problems and\n   requirements
    of network addressing in \"Internet in space\" for\n   terrestrial users.  It
    introduces the basics of satellite mega-\n   constellations, terrestrial terminals/ground
    stations, and their\n   inter-networking.  Then it explicitly analyzes how space-terrestrial\n
    \  mobility yeilds challenges for the logical topology, addressing, and\n   their
    impact on routing.  The requirements of addressing in the\n   space-terrestrial
    network are discussed in detail, including\n   uniqueness, stability, locality,
    scalability, efficiency and backward\n   compatibility with terrestrial Internet.
    \ The problems and\n   requirements of network addressing in space-terrestrial
    networks are\n   finally outlined.\n\n\t "

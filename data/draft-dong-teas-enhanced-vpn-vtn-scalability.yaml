  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to meet the needs of some customers or\n   applications,
    including the customers and applications that are\n   associated with 5G, which
    requires connectivity services with\n   advanced characteristics, such as the
    assurance of some Service Level\n   Objectives (SLOs) and specific Service Level
    Expectations (SLEs).\n   VPN+ could be used for network slice realization both
    in the context\n   of 5G and in more generic scenarios, such as enterprise services\n
    \  which have requirement on the performance assurance.  With the demand\n   for
    VPN+ services increases, scalability would become an important\n   factor for
    the large scale deployment of VPN+. This document\n   describes the scalability
    considerations about the network control\n   plane and data plane in enabling
    VPN+ services, some optimization\n   mechanisms are also proposed.\n\n\t "

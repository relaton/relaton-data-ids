abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC7540 defines HTTP/2, including a method for communicating\n   priorities.
    \ Some implementations have begun using closed streams as\n   placeholders when
    constructing their priority tree, but this has\n   unbounded state commitments
    and interacts poorly with HTTP/QUIC.\n   This document proposes an extension to
    the HTTP/2 priority scheme for\n   both protocols.\n\n\t "

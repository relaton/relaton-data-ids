abstract:
- content: <p>The United States Government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite
    B Cryptography" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
    for national security applications. This document specifies the conventions for
    using Suite B cryptography in IP Security (IPsec). Since many of the Suite B algorithms
    are used in other environments, the majority of the conventions needed for the
    Suite B algorithms are already specified in other documents. This document references
    the source of these conventions, with some relevant detail repeated to aid developers
    who choose to support Suite B. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>

  content: "This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for\n
    \  IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol.  It is based on the\n   original
    version of VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in\n   RFC2338.\n\n   VRRP
    specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns\n   responsibility for
    a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a\n   LAN.  The VRRP router controlling
    the IP address(es) associated with\n   a virtual router is called the Master,
    and forwards packets sent to\n   these IP addresses.  The election process provides
    dynamic fail over\n   in the forwarding responsibility should the Master become\n
    \  unavailable.  The advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a\n   quicker
    switch over to back up routers than can be obtained with\n   standard IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery [ND] mechanisms.\n\t "

  content: "   Segment routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a source routing paradigm that\n
    \  explicitly indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress\n   node.
    \ An SR Policy is associated with one or more candidate paths,\n   and each candidate
    path is either dynamic, explicit or composite.\n   This document describes an
    intelligent routing method for SR Policy\n   based on network quality in MPLS
    and IPv6 environments.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Privacy-Enhanced Electronic Mail system (PEM) [1] provides an inclusive
    standard as adopted by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) to provide secure
    electronic mail over the Internet.  The PEM protocols [2] provide for encryption,
    authentication, message integrity, and key management.  PEM's encryption [3] accomplishes
    privacy of messages using DES in CBC mode; Integrity [4] via a cryptographic hash
    algorithm called a Message Integrity Check (MIC)using either MD2 or MD5; Symmetric
    key management [5] using DES in ECB mode or triple-DES using two keys (EDE mode);
    and supports [6] public-key certificates for key management, using the RSA algorithm
    and X.509 standard for certificate structure.    This document describes the use
    of a Spiral Network Algorithm Compression routine integrated into the message-text
    encryption routines to provide enhanced confidentiality and smaller message size
    without impacting the throughput of the PEM system.  It is the intention of the
    author to seek guidance from the readers on methods of testing and certification
    other than those listed herein.\n\t "

  content: "ASON (Automatic Switch Optical Network), which provides fast and \ndynamic
    connection from point to point, is the typical representation \nof the next generation
    intelligent optical network. There are two \nmain kinds of resource reservation
    protocols in RSVP-TE (Resource \nReservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering), the
    most widely applied \nsignaling in ASON, which are FRP (forward reservation protocol)
    and \nBRP (backward reservation protocol). Both of them are used to apply \nin
    single-domain optical network. However, when they are used in \nmulti-domain optical
    network, there are apparent drawbacks. On base \nof FRP and BRP, we propose a
    reservation protocol-IDRPBP, which is \nbased on priority in multi-domain optical
    network with wavelength \nconversion implement at border nodes. Through analysis
    and simulation, \nwe find it can achieve the trade-off between blocking probability
    and \nconnection setup time.\n\t "

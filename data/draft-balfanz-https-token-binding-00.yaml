abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP\n
    \  servers to cryptographically bind authentication tokens (such as\n   cookies
    and OAuth tokens) to a TLS [RFC5246] connection.\n\n   We describe both _first-party_
    as well as _federated_ scenarios.  In\n   a first-party scenario, an HTTP server
    issues a security token (such\n   as a cookie) to a client, and expects the client
    to send the security\n   token back to the server at a later time in order to
    authenticate.\n   Binding the token to the TLS connection between client and server\n
    \  protects the security token from theft, and ensures that the security\n   token
    can only be used by the client that it was issued to.\n\n   Federated token bindings,
    on the other hand, allow servers to\n   cryptographically bind security tokens
    to a TLS [RFC5246] connection\n   that the client has with a _different_ server
    than the one issuing\n   the token.\n\n   This Internet-Draft is a companion document
    to The Token Binding\n   Protocol [DraftPopov]\n\n\t "

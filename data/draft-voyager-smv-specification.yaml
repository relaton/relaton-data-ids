  content: "   The Secure Mobile Vault Format (SMVF) defines a binary container\n
    \  format for storing encrypted password vaults on mobile devices.  The\n   format
    is designed to be offline-first, zero-knowledge,\n   cryptographically robust,
    and forward-compatible.  SMVF specifies\n   strict structural layout, authenticated
    encryption, and deterministic\n   metadata handling suitable for constrained mobile
    environments.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed before publishing
    as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at\n

  content: "This document describes an architecture for the communication between
    \nBorder Routers (BR) and a Bandwidth Broker (BB) in a MPLS/DiffServ \ncore network.
    This architecture is based on the Common Open Policy \nService (COPS) protocol
    and defines a new Client Type extension for it. This specification applies basically
    to intra-domain MPLS/DiffServ \nnetwork scenarios. However, the same extensions
    to COPS are suitable \nfor inter-domain communications, when MPLS Label Switched
    Paths (LSP) \nwith QoS-DiffServ guarantees are established across multiple \nMPLS/DiffServ
    islands. Therefore, this document provides also a \nsimple and efficient model
    for inter-BB communication. \n\n\t "

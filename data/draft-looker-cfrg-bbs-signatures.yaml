  content: "   BBS is a digital signature scheme categorized as a form of short\n
    \  group signature that supports several unique properties.  Notably,\n   the
    scheme supports signing multiple messages whilst producing a\n   single output
    digital signature.  Through this capability, the\n   possessor of a signature
    is able to generate proofs that selectively\n   disclose subsets of the originally
    signed set of messages, whilst\n   preserving the verifiable authenticity and
    integrity of the messages.\n   Furthermore, these proofs are said to be zero-knowledge
    in nature as\n   they do not reveal the underlying signature; instead, what they\n
    \  reveal is a proof of knowledge of the undisclosed signature.\n\n\t "

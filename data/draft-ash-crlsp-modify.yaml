  content: "After a CR-LSP is set up, its bandwidth reservation may need to be\nchanged
    by the network operator, due to the new requirements for the\ntraffic carried
    on that CR-LSP [2]. This contribution presents an\napproach to modify the bandwidth
    and possibly other parameters of an\nestablished CR-LSP using CR-LDP [3] without
    service interruption.\nThe LSP modification feature can be supported by CR-LDP
    with a minor\nextension of an _action indicator flag_. This feature has\napplication
    in dynamic network resources management where traffic of\ndifferent priorities
    and service classes is involved.\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces the requirements and use cases for IP RAN\n
    \  (Radio Access Networks). To support the requirements, the document\n   provides
    an architecture with centralized control plane as well as\n   separation of control
    plane and data plane.  The document also\n   describes techniques for IP RAN network
    initialization and\n   construction; interfacing to management plane and third
    party\n   applications.  This document can be used as a guideline for central\n
    \  controlled IP RAN design and development.\n\n\t "

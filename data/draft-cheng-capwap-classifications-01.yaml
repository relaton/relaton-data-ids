  content: "   This document describes classifications for wireless local area\n   network
    (WLAN) functionality.  The main benefit of a consistent\n   system of classification
    is accommodating the diversity of WLAN\n   designs as seen in the Control and
    Provisioning of Wireless Access\n   Points framework.  This draft describes policies
    with which\n   classifications may be used.  The document analyzes various WLAN\n
    \  architectures and recent standardization efforts to derive key\n   requirements
    for a CAPWAP WLAN protocol.  It is envisioned that\n   protocol development based
    on these requirements will enable\n   interoperability among the various WLAN
    designs.\n\t "

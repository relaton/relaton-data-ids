  content: "In recent era of Information Technology the data traffic over the\nInternet
    is increasing uncontrollably. This proliferation of data\ntraffic is due to general
    shift towards  e-business and  other \napplication  of Information Technology.
    The businesses relying on\nInternet  lose billions of dollars each year due to
    slow or failed \nweb  services.   Therefore,  in  Internet research, the most\nconspicuous
    issue is to develop methodologies to reduce net\ntraffic over the Internet. In
    this paper, an algorithm is proposed\nto reduce net data traffic, which works
    at Internet layer in TCP/IP\nreference model.  The algorithm monitors data repetitions
    in IP\ndatagram and prepares a compression code in response of this\nrepetition.
    If no IP datagrams are repeated, no compression code\nis sent. Therefore, the
    algorithm does not put any overhead on\nthe system. Furthermore, as the proposed
    algorithm works at IP\ndatagrams only, therefore, it remains transparent from
    all\nclient-server applications.   \n\t "

  content: "   Virtualization and cloud services have evolved significantly in the\n
    \  last few years.  Additionally trends in virtualization like Network\n   Function
    Virtualiztion and Softward Defined Networking are bound to\n   have implications
    to mobile network architectures of cellular systems\n   (3G/4G), WiFi and others.
    \ IETF has developed a number of mobility\n   protocols that are used in the industry
    today.  Mobility network\n   architectures continue to evolve and it is likely
    that they will\n   embrace virtualization and cloud services trends as well.  The
    IETF\n   can play a role in defining the mobility protocols that support\n   architectures
    which leverage virtualization and cloud technologies.\n   This document captures
    several use cases and requirements for a\n   virtualized mobile network architecture.\n\n\t "

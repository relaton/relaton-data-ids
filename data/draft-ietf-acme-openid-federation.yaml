  content: "   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol\n
    \  allows server operators to obtain TLS certificates for their\n   websites,
    based on a demonstration of control over the website's\n   domain via a fully-automated
    challenge/response protocol.\n\n   OpenID Federation 1.0 defines how to build
    a trust infrastructure\n   using a trusted third-party model.  It uses a trust
    evaluation\n   mechanism to attest to the possession of private keys, protocol\n
    \  specific metadata and miscellaneous administrative and technical\n   information
    related to a specific entity.\n\n   This document defines how X.509 certificates
    associated with a given\n   OpenID Federation Entity can be issued by an X.509
    Certification\n   Authority through the ACME protocol to the organizations which
    are\n   part of a federation built on top of OpenID Federation 1.0.\n\n\t "

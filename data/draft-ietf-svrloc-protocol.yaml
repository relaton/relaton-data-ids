  content: "The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the discovery
    and selection of network services.  Using this protocol, computers using the Internet
    no longer need so much static configuration of network services for network based
    applications.  This is especially important as computers become more portable,
    and users less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system administration.

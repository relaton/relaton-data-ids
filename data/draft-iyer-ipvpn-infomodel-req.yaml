  content: "This document defines the requirements for a policy information model
    \nthat should help service providers in dynamically provisioning IP \nVirtual
    Private Networks (VPN). From this perspective, this draft \naims at identifying
    the basic capabilities that need to be supported \nby an IP VPN service offering
    and thus reflected in an IP VPN policy \ninformation model, so that IP VPN networks
    may be dynamically \ndeployed according to the corresponding configuration information.\n\t "

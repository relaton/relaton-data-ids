  script: Latn
  content: "   The purpose of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications, even on\n
    \  IPv4-only networks.  A specific area of concern is that of peer-to-\n   peer
    protocols such as SIP or document exchange during a chat\n   session.  Such protocols
    are designed to run in any environment,\n   which means that they cannot rely
    on IPv6 for themselves, or for\n   their peers.  The 6bed4 tunnel mechanism ensures
    that IPv6 can be\n   assumed on all peers.\n\n   The 6bed4 mechanism is meant
    as a fallback mechanism for IPv6\n   connectivity on networks that do not support
    it natively, by running\n   a tunnel over UDP and IPv4.  The IPv4 address is used
    to support\n   traceability of the traffic originator, which means that no user\n
    \  account or other configuration is needed.\n\n   The tunnel mechanism encapsulates
    IPv6 in UDP/IPv4 and builds on\n   existing IPv6 mechanisms; it employs Stateless
    Address\n   Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to setup an IPv6 address on a 6bed4 Peer,\n
    \  and Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] to find the most direct route to a\n   remote
    6bed4 Peer.\n\n\t "

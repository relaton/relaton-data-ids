  content: "   The document defines how Geographically-Focused IETF Activities are\n
    \  organized and how IETF policies apply.  It is intended for eventual\n   publication
    as a BCP but this is currently an initial strawman\n   proposal based upon the
    existing variety of experience with the\n   experimental activities in this space
    over the past several years.\n\n\t "

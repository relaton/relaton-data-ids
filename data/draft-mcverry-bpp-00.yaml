abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the Bitcoin Price Protocol (BPP), a lightweight,
    peer-to-peer protocol for synchronising a high-confidence Bitcoin price across
    untrusted networks. Modeled after the Network Time Protocol (NTP, RFC 5905), BPP
    enables any Internet host to obtain a volume-weighted median USD/BTC price that
    is accurate to within a few dollars and fresh to within a few seconds, without
    trusting any single exchange, oracle, or API provider. BPP is deliberately off-chain,
    runs over UDP/QUIC, and requires no blockchain interaction. It is suitable for
    wallets, trading bots, payment processors, DeFi front-ends, and hardware devices
    that need "NTP-grade" price agreement.</p>

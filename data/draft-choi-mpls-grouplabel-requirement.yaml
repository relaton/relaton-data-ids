  content: "As the group communication become more important, the special label \nshould
    be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. \nThe allocation
    mechanism of a group label can be applied to a point-\nto-multipoint(P2MP) communication
    in MPLS networks. Currently used \nlabel is locally significant, while this group
    label should be common \nobject within a single MPLS domain. \nThis document presents
    a set of requirements for multicast service \nusing a group label over Multiprotocol
    Label Switching(MPLS). It \nidentifies functional and performance capabilities
    required to \nallocate a group label in master-slave network and peer to peer
    \nnetwork, which facilitates efficient and reliable group communication \nand
    Quality of Service(QoS) in MPLS domain. It also identifies \nfunctional capabilities
    required to implement several services \nrelated to Content Distribution Network(CDN)
    in master-slave network.\n\t "

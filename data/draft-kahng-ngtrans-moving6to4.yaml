  content: "This document specifies a new mechanism using 6to4 to solve mobility \nproblems
    in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks. This draft is \nbased on the Architecture
    of Hierarchical Dual Stack Mobility \nAgent(HDSMA) that supports the IP version-independent
    mobility of \nmobile node and improves the registration efficiency and the \nperformance[3].
    The aim is to support 6to4 mechanism for IPv6 \ntransition while mobile node only
    uses mobile IPv6 capability for \nmobility services.\n\t "

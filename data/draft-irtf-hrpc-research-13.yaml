  content: "   This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights\n   considerations,
    similar to the work done on the guidelines for\n   privacy considerations [RFC6973].
    \ If you want to apply this work to\n   your own, you can directly go to Section
    6.  The rest of the document\n   explains the background of the guidelines and
    how they were\n   developed.\n\n   This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is\n   published for informational purposes.\n\n   This
    informational document has consensus for publication from the\n   Internet Research
    Task Force (IRTF) Human Right Protocol\n   Considerations Research Group.  It
    is the first milestone in a longer\n   term research effort and has been reviewed
    both by the research group\n   and by individuals from outside the research group.
    \ Many of the\n   topics discussed are still under discussion in the research
    group and\n   will be subjects of continuing research.\n\n\t "

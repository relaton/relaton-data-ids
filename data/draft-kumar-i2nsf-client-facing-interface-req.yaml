  content: "   This document captures the requirements for the client-facing\n   interface
    to the security controller.  The interfaces are based on\n   user constructs understood
    by a security admin instead of a vendor or\n   a device specific mechanism requiring
    deep knowledge of individual\n   products and features.  This document identifies
    the requirements\n   needed to enforce the user-construct oriented policies onto
    network\n   security functions (NSFs) irrespective of how those functions are\n
    \  realized.  The function may be physical or virtual in nature and may\n   be
    implemented in networking or dedicated appliances.\n\n\t "

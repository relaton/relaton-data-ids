  content: "   This draft proposes an extension to the ACE framework with the Power\n
    \  of Attorney (PoA) based authorization.  This is proposed following\n   the
    identification of mutual authorization problem between the client\n   and the
    AS in the ACE framework, which demands secure registration of\n   the client to
    the AS and a mechanism for the client to validate the\n   AS.  The proposed system
    adds a new entity referred as the Device\n   Owner to the ACE framework that delegates
    the client device and\n   provides information (in a PoA) regarding the AS to
    which the client\n   is intended to communicate with.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposed a network-based mobility control scheme in\nwireless/mobile
    networks using the Locator-Identifier Separation\nProtocol (LISP). In the existing
    host-based mobility control, LISP\nTunnel Router (TR) is implemented at mobile
    node. In the proposed\nscheme, each TR is implemented at the first-hop access
    router that\nmobile nodes are attached to in the wireless network. For network-\nbased
    mobility control, we present the data delivery and handover\ncontrol operations.
    It is expected that the proposed network-based\nscheme can reduce implementation
    overhead and handover latency of MN,\ncompared to the existing host-based scheme.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability
    Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used to distribute a network
    topologies' link and node information. Links can be either physical links connecting
    physical nodes, or virtual paths between physical or abstract nodes. The network
    topology information is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol algorithms,
    operational experience, and administrative processes, such as inter-provider peering
    agreements. The BGP protocol carrying Link State information would provide a well-defined,
    uniform, policy-controlled interface from the network to outside servers that
    need to learn the network topology in real- time, for example an ALTO Server or
    a Path Computation Server. Having Traffic Engineering (TE) information from remote
    areas and/or Autonomous Systems would allow path computation for inter-area and/or
    inter-AS source-routed unicast and multicast tunnels.</p>"

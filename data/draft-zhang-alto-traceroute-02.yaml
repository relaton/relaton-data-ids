- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Most P2P system performance suffers from the mismatch between the \n   randomly
    constructed overlays topology and the underlying physical \n   network topology,
    causing a large burden in the ISP and a long RTT \n   time. This document describes
    how DHT overlay peers can interact with \n   the routers by traceroute to get
    the path information, and execute 2-\n   Means Classification, thereafter peers
    leverage the DHT itself to    build efficient \"closer\" cluster. This scheme
    only requires the \n   infrastructure to enable traceroute queries.\n\n\t "

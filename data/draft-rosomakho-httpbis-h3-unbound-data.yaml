abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new HTTP/3 frame type, UNBOUND_DATA, and a
    corresponding SETTINGS parameter that enables endpoints to negotiate its use.
    When an endpoint sends an UNBOUND_DATA frame on a request or response stream,
    it indicates that all subsequent octets on that stream are interpreted as data.
    This applies both to message body data and to octets transmitted after CONNECT
    or extended CONNECT. The use of UNBOUND_DATA removes the need to encapsulate each
    portion of the data in DATA frames, reducing framing overhead and simplifying
    transmission of long-lived or indeterminate-length payloads.</p>"

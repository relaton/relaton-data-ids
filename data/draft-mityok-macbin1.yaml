  content: "This draft is a targeted at the Macintosh Internet users to adopt the
    MacBinary II form of Macintosh file encoding for use on FTP sites as an alternative
    to BinHexing Macintosh files.                               The current standard
    file encoding method for Macintosh files placed on Internet FTP sites is BinHexing.
    The process converts binary data into a coded-text based format. While very popular
    and widely used this process increases the files size dramatically.                                     For
    example a self-extracting archive that is 389,089 byte in size will swell to 535,944
    bytes after being BinHexed. The resulting file is nearly 30% larger than its original
    version. This process is completely wasteful and totally unnecessary for FTP transfers.\n\t "

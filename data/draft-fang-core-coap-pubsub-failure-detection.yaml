  content: "   This document defines extensions to the Constrained Application\n   Protocol
    Publish/Subscribe function set, to make the protocol\n   suitable to address the
    use case of failure detection in a hyper-\n   scale system with millions of endpoints.
    Specifically, this document\n   defines a Last Will mechanism and a scheme to
    guarantee hot fail-over\n   of the pub/sub broker.\n\n\t "

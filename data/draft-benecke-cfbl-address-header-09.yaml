  content: "   This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to\n
    \  specify a complaint feedback loop (FBL) address as a message header\n   field.
    \ Also, it defines the rules for processing and forwarding such\n   a complaint.
    \ The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a\n   standardized and
    automated way to provide Mailbox Providers with an\n   address for a complaint
    feedback loop.  Currently, providing and\n   maintaining such an address is a
    manual and time-consuming process\n   for Message Originators and Mailbox Providers.\n\n
    \  It is unclear, at the time of publication, whether the function\n   provided
    by this document has widespread demand, and whether the\n   mechanism offered
    will be adopted and found to be useful.  Therefore,\n   this is being published
    as an Experiment, looking for a constituency\n   of implementers and deployers,
    and for feedback on the operational\n   utility.  The document is produced through
    the Independent RFC stream\n   and was not subject to the IETF's approval process.\n\n\t "

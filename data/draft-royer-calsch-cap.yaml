  content: "The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) described in this memo permits a Calendar
    User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent (CUA) to access an iCAL-based Calendar
    Store (CS).  At the time of this writing, three vendors are implementing CAP,
    but it has already been determined that some changes are needed.  In order to
    get implementation experience, the participants felt that a CAP specification
    is needed to preserve many years of work.  Many properties in CAP which have had
    many years of debate, can be used by other iCalendar protocols.  This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

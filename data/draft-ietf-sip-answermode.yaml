  script: Latn
  content: "This document extends SIP with two header fields and associated option
    tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey the requester's preference
    for user-interface handling related to answering of that request.  The first header,
    \"Answer-Mode\", expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface
    waits for user input before accepting the request or, instead, accepts the request
    without waiting on user input.  The second header, \"Priv-Answer-Mode\", is similar
    to the first, except that it requests administrative-level access and has consequent
    additional authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have
    applicability to applications such as push-to-talk and to diagnostics like loop-back.
    \ Usage of each header field in a response to indicate how the request was handled
    is also defined. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

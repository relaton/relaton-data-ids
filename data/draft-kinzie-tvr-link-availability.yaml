  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model that describes the times at\n
    \  which network links are available for use.  The model is intended for\n   use
    in networks where links can be predictably lost and re-\n   established, and neighbors
    may change as a function of time.  The\n   intent is for this information to be
    used by a Time-Variant Routing\n   (TVR) system which may route network traffic
    based on mobility,\n   energy costs or expected user data volumes, and handle
    such\n   predictable changes in a non-disruptive manner.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the problem of attack on authenticity users.\n
    \  The problem is discussed with respect to fog computing environment.\n   The
    threat exist when any user log in to access the service.\n   The two aspects are
    either the fog server is fake or the user node\n   is fake. The information stored
    on the server and transferred over\n   the connection. This information can be
    highly confidential and\n   sensitive. So to enhance security in this scenario,
    cloud server can\n   authenticate both the parties and establish the connection.
    There\n   are chances that it can get attacked and used by illegitimate users.\n
    \  Therefore, there was an utmost need to increase the security on\n   authentication
    of the users. This document discusses a novel\n   approach to overcome the problem
    by using a hybrid approach. The\n   technique is based on user authentication
    and fog authentication\n   by cloud server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t "

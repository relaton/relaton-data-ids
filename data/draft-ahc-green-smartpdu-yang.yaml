  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model for Smart Power Distribution\n
    \  Units (SmartPDUs).  SmartPDUs extend traditional PDUs by\n   incorporating
    telemetry and remote control functions that enable\n   detailed monitoring and
    management of energy consumption.  Current\n   SmartPDU solutions are largely
    proprietary, exposing heterogeneous\n   APIs and data formats that complicate
    integration and automation.\n   The proposed YANG model provides a vendor-neutral
    framework for\n   configuration, monitoring, and control of intelligent power\n
    \  distribution systems.\n\n   An initial version of the proposed YANG data model
    has been developed\n   during the GREEN Framework and Use Cases project at the
    Hackathon\n   performed during IETF 123 (July 2025).\n\n\t "

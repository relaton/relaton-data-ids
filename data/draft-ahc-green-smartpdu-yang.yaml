abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model for Smart Power Distribution
    Units (SmartPDUs). SmartPDUs extend traditional PDUs by incorporating telemetry
    and remote control functions that enable detailed monitoring and management of
    energy consumption. Current SmartPDU solutions are largely proprietary, exposing
    heterogeneous APIs and data formats that complicate integration and automation.
    The proposed YANG model provides a vendor-neutral framework for configuration,
    monitoring, and control of intelligent power distribution systems. An initial
    version of the proposed YANG data model has been developed during the GREEN Framework
    and Use Cases project at the Hackathon performed during IETF 123 (July 2025).</p>"

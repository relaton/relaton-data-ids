  content: "   Detecting and isolating network faults in IP networks has\n   traditionally
    been done using tools like ping and traceroute (see\n   [RFC7276]) or more complex
    systems built on similar concepts of\n   active probing and path tracing.  While
    using active synthetic probes\n   is proven to be helpful in detecting data-plane
    faults, isolating\n   fault location has proven to be a much harder problem, especially
    in\n   diverse networks with multiple active forwarding planes (e.g.  IP and\n
    \  MPLS).  Moreover, existing end-to-end tools do not generally support\n   functionality
    beyond dealing with packet loss - for example, they are\n   hardly useful for
    detecting and reporting transient (i.e. milli- or\n   even micro-second) network
    congestion.\n\n   Modern network forwarding hardware can enable more sophisticated\n
    \  data-plane functionality that provides substantial improvement to the\n   isolation
    and identification capabilities of network elements.  For\n   example, it has
    become possible to encode a snapshot of a network\n   elements forwarding state
    within the packet payload as it transits\n   the device.  One example of such
    device/network state would be queue\n   depth on the egress port taken by that
    specific packet.  When\n   combined with a unique device identifier embedded in
    the same packet,\n   this could allow for precise time and topological identification
    of\n   the the congested location within the network.\n\n   This document proposes
    a standard format for embedding telemetry\n   information in UDP-based probing
    packets, i.e. packets designated for\n   testing the network while not carrying
    application traffic.  These\n   active probes could be conveyed over multiple
    protocols (ICMP, UDP,\n   TCP, etc.) but this document specifically focuses on
    UDP, given its\n   simple semantics.  In addition this document provides recommendations\n
    \  on handling the active probes by devices that do not support the\n   required
    data-plane functionality.\n\n\t "

  content: "It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic\ncoming
    from unallocated IPv4 address space.  Now that there are no\nlonger any unallocated
    IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated,\nfragile and expensive.  Network
    administrators are advised to remove\nfilters based on the registration status
    of the address space.\n\nThis document explains why any remaining filters for
    unallocated IPv4\n/8s should now be removed on border routers and documents those
    IPv4\nunicast prefixes that should not be routed across the public\nInternet.\n\t "

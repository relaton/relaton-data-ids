  content: "        This document suggests an extension to the Post Office Protocol\n
    \       version 3 (RFC 1725) that adds an extra command to selective\n        compress
    the maildrop before transferring the mail to the\n        recipient.\n \n        Given
    the extensive and explosive growth of mobile uses of the\n        Internet especially
    the numbers of people who access their e-mail\n        via dialup modems, it does
    not make sense to have to transfer\n        e-mail to the client in uncompressed
    form.\n \n        This draft discusses a new command that will make the pop3 server\n
    \       to intelligently compress the maildrop into a single file and\n        then
    for it to be sent to the client.  The client will then\n        process the compressed
    mail accordingly.\n\t "

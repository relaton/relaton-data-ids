  content: "The K-12 community traditionally has not had this level of staffing available
    for telecommunications planning.  This document is intended to bridge that gap
    and provides a recommended technical direction, an introduction to the role the
    Internet now plays in K-12 education and technical guidelines for building a campus
    data communications infrastructure that provides internetworking services and
    connections to the Internet.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.\n\t "

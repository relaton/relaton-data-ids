  content: "The Adhoc Multicast Routing Protocol (AMRoute) allows for robust IP\nMulticast
    in mobile adhoc networks by exploiting user-multicast trees and\ndynamic cores.
    \ It creates a bidirectional shared-tree for data\ndistribution using only the
    group senders and receivers as tree nodes.\nUnicast tunnels are used as the tree
    links to connect neighbors on the\n'user-multicast tree.' Thus, AMRoute does not
    need to be supported by\nnetwork nodes that are not interested/capable of multicast,
    and cost is\nincurred only by group senders and receivers.  AMRoute makes certain
    nodes\n'core nodes' to initiate the signaling component of AMRoute, such as\ndetection
    of group members and tree setup.  Core nodes differ significantly\nfrom those
    in CBT and PIM-SM, since they are not a central point for data\ndistribution and
    can move dynamically among member nodes.  Since AMRoute is\nnot dependent on any
    specific unicast routing protocol, it can operate\nseamlessly over separate domains
    with different unicast protocols.\n\t "

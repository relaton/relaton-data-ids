  content: "(This document is a description of the decentralized viechle to\nviechle
    probe mechanism currently being prototyped.  The main purpose\nof disclosing this
    -00 document is to introduce the application idea\nand start discussion within
    the DTNRG.  Because of this, the current\nmechanism described in this docment
    does not conform to the protocols\ndefined in the DTNRG at this moment.  The mechanism
    should be updated\nbased on the discussion in this group.)\n\nThis document describes
    the transport protocol specification used for\nthe decentralized probe system
    for vehicles.  The probe system\nexchanges probe messages between vehicles using
    a wireless\ncommunication methods with low bandwidth and lossy properties.  The\ncommunication
    environment dynamically changes as vehicle moves.  The\nprotocol try to utilize
    the limited bandwidth as much as possible and\nincrease reachability rate by using
    sender-side error correction\nmechanism.\n\t "

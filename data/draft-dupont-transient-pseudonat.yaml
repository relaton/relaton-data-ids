  content: "When a 'NAT traversal' capability is added to a class of signaling\nprotocols
    which can control some traffic aggregation points, an\nattack based on a temporary
    access to the path followed by messages\nexists.\nMobile IP [1] with NAT traversal
    [5] or IKE [2] with NAT\ntraversal [6], including the IKEv2 [7] proposal, are
    potentially\naffected by this kind of attacks.\nThis document claims this vulnerability
    is an intrinsic property\nof the NAT traversal capability, so is another point
    where the\nusage of NATs is very damaging.\n\t "

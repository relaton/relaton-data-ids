  content: "   This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish\n
    \  a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation\n   information,
    colloquially termed a geolocation \"feed\".  Interested\n   parties can poll and
    parse these feeds to update or merge with other\n   geolocation data sources and
    procedures.  This format intentionally\n   only allows specifying coarse level
    location.\n\n   Some technical organizations operating networks that move from
    one\n   conference location to the next have already experimentally published\n
    \  small geolocation feeds.  At least one consumer (Google) has\n   incorporated
    these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline, and\n   is using it to allow
    ISPs to inform them where the prefixes live.\n\n   [RFC Ed - Please remove publication:
    The IETF Meeting network\n   currently publishes a feed in this format at:\n   https://noc.ietf.org/geo/google.csv
    -- this has significantly cut\n   down on the number of \"Gah!  Why does the network
    believe I'm in\n   Montreal, that was last meeting!  How am I supposed to find
    a pub?!\"\n   complaints.  A number of other meeting networks, including RIPE
    and\n   ICANN publish this information as well, see below. ]\n\n   [ Ed note:
    Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information, answers
    to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be removed
    before publication.]\n\n   [ This document is being collaborated on in Github
    at:\n   https://github.com/google/self-published-geo . The most recent\n   version
    of the document, open issues, etc should all be available\n   here.  The authors
    (gratefully) accept pull requests ]\n\n\t "

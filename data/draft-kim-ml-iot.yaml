  content: "   This document shares knowledge and insights regarding applying\n   machine
    learning techniques on wireless sensor networks.  It firstly\n   introduces advantages
    and difficulties in adopting machine learning\n   techniques on wireless sensor
    networks.  Though dynamicity and\n   unpredictability of wireless networks make
    it difficult to train the\n   model with various possible scenarios, it has strong
    ability in terms\n   of flexibility.  This document also overviews several works
    that\n   applied machine learning techniques on diverse research areas\n   including
    networking, communications and lossy environment.  The\n   ultimate purpose of
    this document is to discuss a proper research\n   direction aiming the realization
    of a system that detects, predicts\n   and recovers from abnormal situations on
    wireless sensor networks.\n\n\t "

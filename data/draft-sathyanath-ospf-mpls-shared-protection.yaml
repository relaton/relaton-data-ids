  content: "This document describes extensions to the OSPF[1]/OSPF-TE[2] protocol\nto
    support Sharing/Restoration information, using opaque LSAs.\nThe extension presented
    here enables the source router to obtain a\nbackup route to a destination such
    that minimal amount of protection\nbandwidth reservation is needed. In other words,
    we provide a method\nby which one may easily increase sharing of backup links\nsignificantly,
    without having to go through each and every possible\nbackup route.\n\t "

  content: "Any operating protocol functions on the basis of a communication\nstack.
    While a layered approach towards a comprehensive stack\ndevelopment amends itself
    very well to division of labour and\nabstraction of problems, care must be taken
    to ensure that layers\nare so designed that they leverage benefits of using one
    another.\nIn other words, layers should be so designed such that they are\nhighly
    optimised for usage with one another. An essential feature of \npervasive computing
    will be Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs).\nThe two primary constraints to system
    design in MANETs are bandwidth\nand energy. We bring out the essential properties
    of layers in any general stack which make it highly efficient and practicable.
    We call this a “stack aware” architecture. We go on to exemplify this with the
    \ncase of “helper nodes” in a MANET topology, and discuss the potential\nbenefits
    of having them as a necessary ingredient for routing. We also\nbring out their
    significance in every layer of the integrated stack,\nusing the OSI layers as
    a reference model. \n\t "

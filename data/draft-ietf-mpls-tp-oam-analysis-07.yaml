  content: "   This document provides an overview of the OAM toolset for MPLS based\n
    \  Transport Networks.  The toolset consists of a comprehensive set of\n   fault
    management and performance monitoring capabilities (operating\n   in the data-plane)
    which are appropriate for transport networks as\n   required in RFC 5860 and support
    the network and services at\n   different nested levels.  This overview includes
    a brief recap of\n   MPLS-TP OAM requirements and functions, and of generic mechanisms\n
    \  created in the MPLS data plane to allow the OAM packets run in-band\n   and
    share their fate with data packets.  The protocol definitions for\n   each of
    the MPLS-TP OAM tools are defined in separate documents (RFCs\n   or Working Group
    drafts) which are referenced by this document.\n\n   This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
    an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support
    the\n   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as\n   defined
    by the ITU-T.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Mobile IPv6 in route optimization mode reveals mobile node's care-of\n
    \  address to the correspondent node and hence cannot provide location\n   privacy.
    \ In contrast, Mobile IPv6 in bi-directional tunneling mode\n   can provide location
    privacy, but the resulting route may be far from\n   optimal, especially when
    correspondent node is mobile as well.  This\n   may be an issue for conversational
    mobile-to-mobile communication\n   scenarios, e.g., using VoIP.  The draft discusses
    the problem of\n   providing both location privacy and route optimization with
    Mobile\n   IPv6 and describes a solution in terms of an optional extension to\n
    \  Mobile IPv6.  The basic idea is that mobile nodes switch the reverse\n   tunnel
    endpoint in bi-directional tunneling mode from their home\n   agent to a so-called
    tunneling agent in an on-demand manner.  To\n   ensure location privacy, the tunneling
    agent selection is done by the\n   home agents.  The solution does not require
    the mobile node to change\n   its home address and does not rely on visited network
    support.\n\t "

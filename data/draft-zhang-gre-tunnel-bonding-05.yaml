abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an emerging demand for solutions that provide redundancy and
    load-sharing across wired and cellular links from a single Service Provider, so
    that a single subscriber is provided with bonded access to heterogeneous connections
    at the same time. In this document, GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel
    Bonding is specified as an enabling approach for bonded access to a wired and
    a wireless network in customer premises, e.g., homes. In GRE Tunnel Bonding, two
    GRE tunnels, one per network connection, are set up and bonded together to form
    a single GRE tunnel for a subscriber. Compared with each subconnection, the bonded
    connections promise increased access capacity and improved reliability. The solution
    described in this document is currently implemented by Huawei and deployed by
    Deutsche Telekom AG. This document will enable other developers to build interoperable
    implementations.</p>"

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Support for multi-tenancy has been the subject of recent work on P4\n
    \  switch programming.  This draft further describes a potential use\n   case
    where a tenant programs a virtual network built over a mobile\n   network, and
    discusses related requirements.  The use case is based\n   on the existing 5GLAN
    feature, since it is a well documented virtual\n   network architecture supported
    by 5G.\n\n\t "

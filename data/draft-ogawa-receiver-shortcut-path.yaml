  content: "     This memo defines the Receiver Initiated Shortcut Path (RISP)\n     protocol
    for NBMA networks.  The protocol extends the NHRP message\n     set by adding
    Callback Request and Reply messages to allow the\n     destination host (or its
    corresponding egress router) to establish\n     a shortcut path for a data flow,
    using the existing NBMA signaling\n     protocols.  Because of this receiver-initiated
    mechanism, a\n     shortcut-capable network can use just the NBMA ARP servers,
    such as\n     the ATMARP servers, instead of the more complex Next Hop\n     Servers.
    This draft also describes how to extend NHRP with the new,\n     receiver-initiated
    mechanism.\n\t "

  content: "There has been discussion within the IETF IPv6 community for some\ntime
    regarding whether or not to define Centrally Assigned Unique\nLocal Addresses
    (ULA-Cs).  Although many arguments both for and\nagainst the definition of ULA-Cs
    have been raised and repeated, our\ndiscussions have not resulted in consensus
    about whether or not to\ndefine this new address type.  This document will summarize
    the\narguments for and against the allocation of ULA-Cs, in an attempt to\nhelp
    the IETF IPv6 community reach a decision on this issue.\n\t "

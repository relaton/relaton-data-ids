  content: "This document describes the simulation setups and results for testing
    \nthe Three State PCN Marking approach. Simulations done to date, \ndemonstrate
    that the three state PCN marking approach has certain \nability to support admission
    control and flow termination of real-\n \n \n time application flows at the congestion
    point(s) of the PCN-enabled \nnetwork.  The real-time traffic used in the simulation
    covers voice \nand video traffic with large and small numbers of flows.  \n\nConventions
    used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [RFC2119].\n\t "

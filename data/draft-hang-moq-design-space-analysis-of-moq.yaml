  content: "   This document investigates potential solution directions within the\n
    \  charter scope of MoQ WG.  MoQ aims to provide low-latency, efficient\n   media
    delivery solution for use cases including live streaming,\n   gaming and video
    conferencing.  To achieve low-latency media transfer\n   efficiently, the network
    topology of relay nodes and the computation\n   done at the relay nodes should
    be considered carefully.  This\n   document provides the analysis of those factors
    which can help the\n   design of the MoQ protocols.\n\n\t "

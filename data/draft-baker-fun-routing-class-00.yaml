  content: "   This note addresses the concept of routing a traffic class.  This has\n
    \  many possible implementations, IGP and BGP, and link state as well as\n   distance
    vector.  The fundamental impetus is the question raised in\n   RFC 3704 and shim6
    of exit routing, the question raised by Mike\n   O'Dell of source/destination
    routing, and the \"fish\" problem, raised\n   in many networks, in which distinct
    traffic classes that could\n   conceivably use the same route predictably use
    different routes.\n   Instead of handling these as \"destination routing with
    a twist\", the\n   paper looks at the matter systemically.\n\nRequirements\n\t "

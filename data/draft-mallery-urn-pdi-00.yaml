  content: "   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Persistent\n
    \  Document Identifier (PDI) namespace within the URN framework\n   defined by
    RFC 2141 [17]. PDIs provide a means to refer to digital\n   objects and fragments
    that does not depend their storage location\n   or the protocol used to access
    them. Since 1994, several\n   large-scale applications with these requirements
    have used PDIs\n   [12] [21].\n \n   PDIs are intended primarily as permanent
    identifiers for archival\n   reference to long-lived documents.  PDIs have a fragment
    syntax to\n   allow permanent references to parts of documents (within specific\n
    \  formats) as well as a citation syntax to allow references to\n   appearances
    of such fragments in composite documents.\n \n   PDIs are most useful for any
    document series that is distributed via\n   multiple protocols, is available from
    multiple sources, migrates to\n   new locations, needs fragment references, or
    participates in\n   distributed assertion semantics related to collaboration or
    access\n   control.\n\n\t "

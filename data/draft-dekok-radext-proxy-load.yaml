  content: "   This document describes a few methods which can assist operators of\n
    \  proxies in the in the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service\n   (RADIUS)
    Protocol.  The methods described here improve proxy load\n   balancing and rate
    limiting, without requiring any changes to the\n   underlying protocol.  While
    these methods have been shown to work in\n   practice, there has been insufficient
    experience with them to publish\n   this document either as standards track, or
    as a best current\n   practice.\n\n\t "

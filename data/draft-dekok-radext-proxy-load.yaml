    proxies in the in the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Protocol.
    The methods described here improve proxy load balancing and rate limiting, without
    requiring any changes to the underlying protocol. While these methods have been

    publish this document either as standards track, or as a best current practice.</p>"

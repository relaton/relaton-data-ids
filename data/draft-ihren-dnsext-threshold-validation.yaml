  content: "This memo documents a proposal for a different method of validation\nfor
    DNSSEC aware resolvers. The key change is that by changing from\na model of one
    Key Signing Key, KSK, at a time to multiple KSKs it\nwill be possible to increase
    the aggregated trust in the signed\nkeys by leveraging from the trust associated
    with the different\nsignees. \nBy having multiple keys to chose from validating
    resolvers get the\nopportunity to use local policy to reflect actual trust in\ndifferent
    keys. For instance, it is possible to trust a single,\nparticular key ultimately,
    while requiring multiple valid\nsignatures by less trusted keys for validation
    to succeed.\nFurthermore, with multiple KSKs there are additional redundancy\nbenefits
    available since it is possible to roll over different KSKs\nat different times
    which may make rollover scenarios easier to\nmanage.\n\t "

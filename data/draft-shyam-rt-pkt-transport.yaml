  content: "   This document intends to find out the size of an IP packet at which\n
    \  VoIP applications will produce the best result. It emphasizes the\n   physical
    phenomenon because of which ATM networks perform better than\n   the IP switch
    based networks and tries to come out with an approach\n   by which IP switch based
    network can perform as good as ATM network\n   for the processing of real time
    traffic.\n\t "

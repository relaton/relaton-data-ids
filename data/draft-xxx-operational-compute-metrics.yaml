  content: "   Service providers are starting to deploy computing capabilities\n   across
    the network for hosting applications such as AR/VR, vehicle\n   networks, IoT,
    and AI training, among others.  In these distributed\n   computing environments,
    information about computing and communication\n   resources is necessary to determine
    both the proper deployment\n   location of each application and the best server
    location on which to\n   run it.  This information is used by numerous different\n
    \  implementations with different interpretations.  This document\n   proposes
    an initial approach towards a common understanding and\n   exposure scheme for
    metrics reflecting compute capabilities.\n\n\t "

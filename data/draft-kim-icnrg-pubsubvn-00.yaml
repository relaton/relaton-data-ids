  content: "   As autonomous vehicle is becoming a major research in automotive\n
    \  engineering, the importance of vehicular network is also increasing.\n   Content-oriented
    vehicular network requires new communication\n   architecture that is different
    from the existing IP-based\n   architecture. ICN is one of the best alternatives
    for vehicular\n   network to serve as communication infrastructure. ICN only supports\n
    \  pull-based communication. Therefore, an efficient communication\n   method
    is needed for disseminating safety information for vehicles,\n   and the publish/subscribe(pub/sub)
    system can be a good alternative.\n   This document proposes a pub/sub service
    architecture and procedures\n   for disseminating safety information between vehicles
    and\n   infrastructure.\n\n\t "

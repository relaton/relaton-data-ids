  content: "The deployment of new IP connectivity typically results in intermittent
    reachability for numerous reasons that are outside the scope of this document.
    \ In order to aid in the debugging of these persistent problems, this document
    proposes the creation of a new Routing Policy Specification Language attribute
    that allows a network to advertise an IP address that is reachable and can be
    used as a target for diagnostic tests (e.g., pings). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

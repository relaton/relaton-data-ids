- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   When an IPv6 prefix assigned to a link changes, hosts may not be\n
    \  explicitly notified about the change.  Similarly, in some scenario a\n   link
    attachement for the host may change without the host detecting\n   it.  In both
    cases the host does not receive any signals to trigger\n   the network stack configuration
    refresh, so it may continue to use\n   \"old\" addresses which are not valid for
    the link.  This leads to\n   packet loss and service disruption.  This document
    proposes a\n   mechanism to mitigate this issue.  Routers are advised to send
    Router\n   Advertisements containing distinct Prefix Information Options (PIOs)\n
    \  from different link-local addresses.  This, in conjunction with\n   RFC6724
    (Default Source Address Selection) Rule 5.5 and RFC8028\n   (first-hop selection
    requirements), enables hosts to detect prefix\n   changes more rapidly and select
    the correct source address, thereby\n   improving the robustness of SLAAC.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a general data certification service and the\nprotocols
    to be used when communicating with it.  The Data Certification\nServer  is a Trusted
    Third Party (TTP) that can be used as one component\nin building reliable non-repudiation
    services (see [ISONR]).  Useful\nData Certification Server responsibilities in
    a PKI are to validate\nsignatures and to provide up-to-date information regarding
    the status of\npublic key certificates.  We give examples of how to use the Data\nCertification
    Server to extend the lifetime of a signature beyond key\nexpiry or revocation
    and to query the Data Certification Server\nregarding the status of a public key
    certificate.\n\n      The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL\n
    \     NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED',  'MAY', and\n      'OPTIONAL'
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n      RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\n\t "

  content: "The IAB charset workshop [IAB-CHARSET] concluded that for human readable
    text there should always be a way to specify the natural language.  Many protocols
    are designed with an attribute-value model (including RFC 822, HTTP, LDAP, SNMP,
    DHCP, and ACAP) which stores many small human readable text strings.  The primary
    function of an attribute-value model is to simplify both extensibility and searchability.
    \ A solution is needed to provide language tags in these small human readable
    text strings, which does not interfere with these primary functions.                           This
    specification defines MLSF (Multi-Lingual String Format) which applies another
    layer of encoding on top of UTF-8 [UTF-8] to permit the addition of language tags
    anywhere within a text string.  In addition, it defines an alternate form which
    can be used to include alternative representations of the same text in different
    character sets.  MLSF has the property that UTF-8 is a proper subset of MLSF.
    This preserves the searchability requirement of the attribute-value model. Appendix
    F of this document includes a brief discussion of the background behind MLSF and
    why some other potential solutions were rejected for this purpose.\n\t "

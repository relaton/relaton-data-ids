  content: "A need has been identified to identify a strict subset of the PWE3 \n
    \ over MPLS pseudowire functionality suitable for the construction of \n  transport
    networks. This draft describes the IETF recommended profile \n  for such cases.
    This document describes the IETF-recommended profile \n  for such a configuration.
    In particular the profile of an RFC4448 \n  PWE3 Ethernet pseudowire that can
    be used to address these \n  requirements is described.\n\t "

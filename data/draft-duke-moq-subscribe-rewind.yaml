abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a Media Over Quic Transport (MOQT) extension
    that enables a new Subscription Filter, so that a subscriber can request that
    a finite number of past groups be delivered with SUBSCRIBE semantics (multiple
    streams, potentially incomplete) rather than FETCH semantics (single stream, complete,
    head-of-line- blocking). Service of this request is best-effort by the publisher.</p>"

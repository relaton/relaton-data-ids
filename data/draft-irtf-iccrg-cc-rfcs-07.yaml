abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an informational snapshot taken by the IRTF\\'s Internet
    Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG) in October 2008. It provides a survey
    of congestion control topics described by documents in the RFC series. This does
    not modify or update the specifications or status of the RFC documents that are
    discussed. It may be used as a reference or starting point for the future work
    of the research group, especially in noting gaps or open issues in the current
    IETF standards. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"

  content: "This document describes the structure of the control messages that were
    historically used with the Network Time Protocol (NTP) before the advent of more
    modern control and management approaches. These control messages have been used
    to monitor and control the NTP application running on any IP network attached
    computer. The information in this document was originally described in Appendix
    B of RFC 1305. The goal of this document is to provide an updated description
    of the control messages described in RFC 1305 in order to conform with the updated
    NTP specification documented in RFC 5905.\n\n The publication of this document
    is not meant to encourage the development and deployment of these control messages.
    This document is only providing a current reference for these control messages
    given the current status of RFC 1305.\n\t "

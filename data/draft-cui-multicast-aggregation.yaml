  content: "In this document, we present a novel scheme, called aggregated\nmulticast,
    to reduce multicast states ([FeiGI01] and [FeiNGC01]).\nThe key idea is that multiple
    groups are forced to share one\ndistribution tree, which we call aggregated tree.
    In our scheme, \ncore routers need to keep states only per aggregated tree instead
    \nof per group. This can significantly reduce the total number of \ntrees in the
    network and thus reduce forwarding states.\nWe investigate the implementation
    issues of aggregated multicast\nin different network scenarios. We also discuss
    the effects of \naggregated multicast on some important issues, such as QoS\nmulticast
    provisioning, mobility support and fault tolerance.\nThe scope of this paper is
    not to propose a detailed protocol, \nbut present the idea of aggregated multicast
    at high level and \nshow its merits.\n\t "

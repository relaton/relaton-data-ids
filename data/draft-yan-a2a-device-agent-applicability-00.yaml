  content: "   The evolution of network management towards autonomic operation\n   requires
    the deployment of AI agents at various hierarchical layers,\n   including directly
    on network elements.  This transformation shifts\n   network devices from passively
    managed resources to autonomous\n   entities capable of local decision-making
    and collaborative problem-\n   solving.\n\n   This document discusses the applicability
    of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A)\n   Protocol to the network management plane, specifically
    for\n   communication between Controller Agents (CAs) and Device Agents\n   (DAs).
    \ This indicates that the inherent characteristics of Device\n   Agents necessitate
    the adoption of the agent-to-agent communication\n   paradigm.  The document further
    explores generic workflows,\n   deployment scenarios, and the relationship of
    A2A with existing\n   network management protocols like NETCONF, RESTCONF, gNMI,and
    the\n   Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\n\t "

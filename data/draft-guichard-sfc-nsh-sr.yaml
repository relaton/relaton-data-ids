  content: "   This document describes two application scenarios where Network\n   Service
    Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR) techniques can be\n   deployed together
    to support Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an\n   efficient manner while maintaining
    separation of the service and\n   transport planes as originally intended by the
    SFC architecture.\n\n   In the first scenario, an NSH-based SFC is created using
    SR as the\n   transport between SFFs.  SR in this case is just one of many\n   encapsulations
    that could be used to maintain the transport-\n   independent nature of NSH-based
    service chains.\n\n   In the second scenario, SR is used to represent each service
    hop of\n   the NSH-based SFC as a segment within the segment-list.  SR and NSH\n
    \  in this case are integrated.\n\n   In both scenarios SR is responsible for
    steering packets between SFFs\n   along a given SFP while NSH is responsible for
    maintaining the\n   integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance context,
    and any\n   associated metadata.\n\n   These application scenarios demonstrate
    that NSH and SR can work\n   jointly and complement each other leaving the network
    operator with\n   the flexibility to use whichever transport technology makes
    sense in\n   specific areas of their network infrastructure, and still maintain
    an\n   end-to-end service plane using NSH.\n\n\t "

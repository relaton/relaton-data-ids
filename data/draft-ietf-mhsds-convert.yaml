  content: "User Agents have various capabilities for support of multimedia messages.
    \ To facilitate interworking between UAs of differing capabilities, it is useful
    for the MTS to be able to perform content conversion.  This document specifies
    an approach for X.400 Message Handling Systems to perform application level routing
    using the OSI Directory in order to support content conversion.  This document
    assumes MHS use of directory to perfom routing accoreding to ``MHS use of Directory
    to support MHS Routing''.                                                                 This
    draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a protocol standard.  Distribution
    of this memo is unlimited.  Please send comments to the author or to the discussion

  content: "    Since digital multichannel TV broadcasting services have been\n    started
    in many areas, low cost digital data receivers are\n    available. They can be
    used for not only TV broadcasting service but\n    also any kind of data communication
    services.\n \n    A low cost receiver can receive high bandwidth traffic from
    a feed,\n    while no bandwidth from the receiver to the feed is provided.\n    Therefore
    the connection between the feed and the receiver is\n    unidirectional. Current
    routing protocols stand on a fact that any\n    links are bidirectional even if
    the bandwidth in each direction may\n    be different. They can not handle unidirectional
    links.\n \n    This document defines an idea to use unidirectional links (UDLs)\n
    \   routing without any modifications of current routing protocols.\n\t "

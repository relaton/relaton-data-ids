  content: "Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a type of Layer-2 Provider \nProvisioned
    Virtual Private Network (L2 PPVPN) offered service, which \nhas been described
    in [PPVPN-FRWK]. If the Service Provider network \nprovides IP multicast functionality,
    then this network capability can \nbe leveraged in providing very efficient VPLS
    service and yet \nsimplifying the implementation of such service. This document
    describes \na solution for providing VPLS service based on IP multicast feature
    \nreferred to as Multicast Virtual Private LAN Service (MVPLS).\n\t "

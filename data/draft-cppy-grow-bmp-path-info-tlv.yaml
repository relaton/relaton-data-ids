  content: "   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining\n
    \  BGP path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP\n   Route
    Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension\n   to BMP to convey
    additional path information that is not already\n   encapsulated in the BGP Update
    PDU, e.g., BPG path status.  This\n   extension makes use of the TLV mechanims
    described in draft-grow-bmp-\n   tlv [I-D.grow-bmp-tlv].\n\n\n\t "

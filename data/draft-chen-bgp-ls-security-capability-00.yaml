  script: Latn
  content: "   The goal is to collect the security capabilities of nodes, which will\n
    \  be one of the factors to form the routing topology, and use the\n   routing
    programming capabilities to form a secure routing path.\n\n   The BGP-LS protocol
    is extended to carry the security capabilities of\n   the node.  The controller
    collects topology information, forms a\n   topology path with security capabilities
    according to security\n   requirements, and supports SRv6 path sending to execute
    node\n   forwarding through programming.\n\n\t "

  content: "Without a security solution, Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization function­\nality
    exposes the involved nodes as well as other nodes in the Inter­\nnet to various
    security attacks. Recent work in the area has produced\na number of proposals
    to solve these security issues. The proposals\nare, however, in many cases architecturally
    quite different from each\nother, and don't always describe more than a part of
    the solution. Due\nto the complexity of the problem, we feel that it is necessary
    to doc­\nument a higher level solution roadmap. We call this roadmap the 'Secu­\nrity
    Framework for Route Optimization'. It talks about the architec­\nture that a complete
    solution has, and the components that are needed.\nWe also discuss factors affecting
    the need for various components and\nparticular technical solutions for them.\n\t "

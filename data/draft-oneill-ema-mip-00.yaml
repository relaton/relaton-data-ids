  script: Latn
  content: "It is well recognised by all micro and macro-mobility routing\nprotocols
    that Mobile IP (MIP) is likely to be used to support\ninter-domain mobility. It
    is also widely accepted that Mobile IP\ncould be used as the basis for signalling
    between the mobile and the\nmicro-mobility domains for simplicity of the mobile
    terminal and\ninteroperability purposes. The Edge Mobility Architecture (EMA)\ndefines
    a generic IP hand-over model which operates in conjunction\nwith a Mobility Enhanced
    Routing (MER) protocol to provide large-\nscale, intra-domain, IP address mobility.
    The aim of this document\nis to describe the minimum MIP signalling requirements
    for EMA:MER,\nand to propose additional changes necessary to [MIPv6] and [MIPv4]\nfor
    them to support EMA:MER. The document deals with mobiles moving\ninside and between
    EMA:MER domains as well as coming and going\nfrom/to non-EMA:MER domains, demonstrating
    EMA/MIP interoperability\nand inter-domain hand-overs. The document also demonstrates
    the\nbenefits a mobile and an operator will see when a mobile host is\nwithin
    an EMA domain.\n\n\t "

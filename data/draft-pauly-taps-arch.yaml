    \  Services, a system for exposing the features of transport protocols\n   to
    applications.  This architecture serves as a basis for Application\n   Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) and implementations that provide\n   flexible transport networking
    services.  It defines the common set of\n   terminology and concepts to be used
    in more detailed discussion of\n   Transport Services.\n\n\t "

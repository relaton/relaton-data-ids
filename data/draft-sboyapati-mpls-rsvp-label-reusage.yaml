  content: "MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network.\nMPLS can
    carry any data payload which\ngives the flexibility to the service provider to
    provision\nnew service with any expense.\nIn a scaled MPLS RSVP router during
    MBB/Global repair, router needs to program large number of labels into PFE.\nThis
    operation results in lot of label re-computation and label programming.\nThis
    draft is proposing a solution to label reusage\n\n\n\n\t "

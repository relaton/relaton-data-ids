abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft is intended to be a proposal for updating the current\n'RIP
    version 2' RFC [1].\nThis necessity is due to a difference of behaviour between
    the RIP\nprotocol as described in [1] and the RIP protocol as implemented by\nmany
    vendors.\nIf all the vendors apply the same rule, no problem arises. But, on the\ncontrary,
    serious problems of interoperability can occur.\nWith some little changes in the
    text, this draft can be used as the new\n'RIP version 2' RFC. People just interested
    in the implementing protocols may simply go to paragraph 8 (Changing the current
    RFC) and skip all the others. The purpose of all the other paragraphs is to support
    the idea of changing the RFC.\n\n\t "

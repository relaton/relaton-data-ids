  content: "OSPF is a link state routing protocol used for IP-network \ntopology discovery
    using different types of Link State \nAdvertisements. The resulting Link State
    Database (LSDB) is\nused to compute IP address forwarding table based on \nshortest-path
    criteria. OSPF has been extended to support Traffic \nEngineering, QoS in packet
    and non-packet networks. These has\nbeen a serious concern regarding scalability
    and convergence of\ninformation in large networks. \nThis memo documents an optional
    OSPF capability to support TE only \nfunctionality. This OSPF TE Only option is
    to support existing and \nfuture Traffic Engineering extensions for packet and/or
    non-packet\nnetworks with out exchanging any hop-by-hop routing information. \nThis
    is accomplished by exchanging T-bit option in OSPF Hello \npackets. This gives
    flexibility of supporting larger TE areas,\nincreased scalability and improved
    convergence.\n\t "

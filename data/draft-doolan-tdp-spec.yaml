  content: "An overview of a  tag switching architecture is provided in [Rekhter].
    \ This document defines the Tag Distribution Protocol (TDP) referred to in [Rekhter].
    \                                                                TDP is a two
    party protocol that runs over a connection oriented transport layer with guaranteed
    sequential delivery.  Tag Switching Routers use TDP to communicate tag binding
    information to their peers. TDP supports multiple network layer protocols including
    but not limited to IPv4, IPv6, IPX and AppleTalk.                                                         We
    define here the PDUs and operational procedures for this TDP and specify its transport
    requirements. We also define aspects of the protocol that are specific to the
    case where it is run over an ATM datalink.\n\t "

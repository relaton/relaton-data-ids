  content: "This memo discusses policies that require certain labels to be inserted
    in the \"Subject:\" header of a mail message.  Such policies are difficult to
    specify accurately while remaining compliant with key RFCs and are likely to be
    ineffective at best.  This memo discusses an alternate, \\%standards-compliant
    approach that is significantly simpler to specify and is somewhat less likely
    to be ineffective.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of\nIPv4
    addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4 within\nan IPv6-only
    Network.  Nodes will still need to communicate with IPv4\nnodes that do not have
    a dual IP layer supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.\nThe Dual Stack Transition Mechanism
    (DSTM) is based on the use of\nIPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels to carry IPv4 traffic within
    an IPv6-only\nnetwork and provides a method to allocate a temporary IPv4 Address
    to\nIPv6/IPv4 nodes.  DSTM is also a way to avoid the use of Network\nAddress
    Translation for early adopter IPv6 deployment.\n\t "

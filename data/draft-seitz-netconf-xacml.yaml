  content: "   The NETCONF remote network configuration protocol currently lacks an\n
    \  access control model.  The need for such a model has been recognised\n   within
    the NETCONF working group.  The eXtended Access Control Markup\n   Language (XACML)
    is an XML-based access control standard, with\n   widespread acceptance from the
    industry and good open-source support.\n   This document proposes a profile that
    defines how to use XACML to\n   provide fine-grain access control for NETCONF
    commands.\n\n\t "

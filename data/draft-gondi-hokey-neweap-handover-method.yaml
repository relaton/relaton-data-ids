  content: "The increase in the use of different access networks which involves \ndifferent
    mechanisms for authentication and access authorizations, \ndemands the new mechanisms
    to roam at any time anywhere with low \nlatency. To overcome this process we need
    new mechanisms where a user \nterminal roams in different access networks with
    low latency and \n \n \n efficiently. There is a need for unified signaling mechanisms
    for \nchoosing and accessing networks. \n\nIn this draft we have discussed some
    of the processes involved in \nnetwork selection, mobility management, security
    management in detailed \nto perform handover. The Handover information is passed
    to home server \nusing the new handover method using EAP proposed vice versa in
    this \ndraft. Even though there are different mechanisms provide this support
    \nsuch as IAPP context transfer mechanisms for seamless mobility some of \nthe
    instances like supporting different access networks, roaming in \naccess networks
    etc is not considered. The proposed mechanism is \ninteroperable with the existing
    procedures involving security \nauthentication and mobility during roaming.\n\t "

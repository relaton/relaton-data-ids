abstract:
- content: "<p>While most of the work in the IETF is technical, the IETF should and
    does regularly examine itself, including its processes and goals, to determine
    if the technical community is truly serving the larger network engineering community
    effectively. Changes in this area tend to be incremental, as is fitting for an
    organization with decades of experience and history in developing and managing
    the process of building technical specifications. The rapid and ongoing changes
    in the world have recently caused a number of IETF participants to examine the
    current processes and operation of the IETF, particularly in the context of the
    culture of the IETF. This memo discusses some cultural and global trends in relation
    to the IETF's operating environment, how these trends might affect the operation
    of the IETF, and notes some topics for further exploration. Writing this memo
    has been inspired by involvement in various decisions that the IETF leadership
    has to take part in, often wishing to be able to draw more on understanding trends
    and their impact on the IETF. This memo is also input for discussion that the
    IETF community should have. The memo has no particular official standing, nor
    does it claim to represent more than the authors' thinking at the time of writing.
    There is no intent on the part of the authors for this to be published as a RFC.
    Please direct discussion about this topic to the ietf@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"

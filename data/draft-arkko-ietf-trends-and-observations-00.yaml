  content: "   While most of the work in the IETF is technical, the IETF should and\n
    \  does regularly examine itself, including its processes and goals, to\n   determine
    if the technical community is truly serving the larger\n   network engineering
    community effectively.  Changes in this area tend\n   to be incremental, as is
    fitting for an organization with decades of\n   experience and history in developing
    and managing the process of\n   building technical specifications.\n\n   The rapid
    and ongoing changes in the world have recently caused a\n   number of IETF participants
    to examine the current processes and\n   operation of the IETF, particularly in
    the context of the culture of\n   the IETF.  This memo discusses some cultural
    and global trends in\n   relation to the IETF's operating environment, how these
    trends might\n   affect the operation of the IETF, and notes some topics for further\n
    \  exploration.\n\n   Writing this memo has been inspired by involvement in various\n
    \  decisions that the IETF leadership has to take part in, often wishing\n   to
    be able to draw more on understanding trends and their impact on\n   the IETF.\n\n
    \  This memo is also input for discussion that the IETF community should\n   have.\n\n
    \  The memo has no particular official standing, nor does it claim to\n   represent
    more than the authors' thinking at the time of writing.\n   There is no intent
    on the part of the authors for this to be\n   published as a RFC.  Please direct
    discussion about this topic to the\n   ietf@ietf.org mailing list.\n\n\t "

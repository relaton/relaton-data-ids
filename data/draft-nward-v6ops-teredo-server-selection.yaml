  content: "   This document describes performance, reliability and privacy problems\n
    \  inherent when using a remotely situated vendor-provided Teredo\n   server,
    which is a common default in current implementations, and\n   then discussed why
    configuring servers manually is bad and difficult.\n   It recommends two partial
    solutions, and gives a final recommendation\n   combining both solutions using
    anycast IPv4 and a well known DNS\n   hostname.\n\n\t "

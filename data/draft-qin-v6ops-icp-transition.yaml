  content: "The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses is coming, while due to many\nreasons,
    no significant IPv6 deployment has occured.  The transition\nof users, networks
    and services from IPv4 to IPv6 is not so smoothly\nand expeditiously as expected.
    \ The solutions now available are not\nsufficient for all the scenarios, so the
    IPv6 deployment models are\nrevisited, and some new methods used for transition
    have been\ndeveloped to complement the existing ones.  This document discusses\nthe
    transition of services and the use of these new mechanisms from\nthe ISP's point
    of view to provide approaches to the transition for\nICPs.\n\t "

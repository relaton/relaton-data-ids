  content: "   This document describes a TLS ciphersuite which is based on the SIGMA\n
    \  protocol.  By its careful adoption in the TLS handshake protocol, the\n   proposed
    ciphersuite is able to inherit features of the SIGMA\n   protocol.  The ciphersuite
    provides active identity protection,\n   forward secrecy, deniability and adjustable
    security strength.  A\n   similar ciphersuite offering these features has not
    yet been proposed\n   so far.\n\n\t "

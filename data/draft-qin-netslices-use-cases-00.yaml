abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Slicing (NS) is widely discussed and considered in 5G communities
    and standard organizations as a key mechanism to meet diverse service requirements
    concurrently with the same physical network infrastructure. NS enables the operator
    to provide isolated platform for service verticals, and deploy new services without
    causing or experiencing any disruption to other already deployed services in the
    same physical network infrastructure. This document describes the typical use
    cases that could benefit from network slicing, to support each case, the corresponding
    requirements on 5G transport network will be analyzed.</p>"

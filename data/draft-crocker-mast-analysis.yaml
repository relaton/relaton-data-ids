  content: "An IP Address serves the dual roles as references to a 'place' on\nthe
    Internet and to a host on the Internet, labeled 'locator' and\n'identifier', respectively.
    Systems that use IP Addresses as\nidentifiers cannot support dynamic changes in
    the mapping between\nthe identifier and the locator. For a system to use a different\nIP
    Address pair, participants must initiate a new exchange.  In\nthe case of TCP,
    this means a new connection. In recent years,\nthere have been efforts to overcome
    this limitation, through\ndifferent approaches at different places in the Internet\narchitecture.
    This paper reviews the basic requirements for\nsupport of multiaddressing (mobility
    and multihoming), and the\nefforts to support them. Barriers to adoption, administrative\noverhead,
    and operational efficiency are of particular concern.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a new transport protocol TSMP, which seeks
    to\n   support data transfer for the emerging usage paradigm of \"single\n   user,
    multiple device\" in a TCP compatible manner.  Through its novel\n   proxy-based
    design, TSMP is able to retain the current client and\n   server protocol operations
    of the legacy TCP protocol and TCP-based\n   applications while placing new functions
    at the proxy.\n\n\t "

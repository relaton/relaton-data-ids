  content: "   This document defines version 3 of the Virtual Router Redundancy\n
    \  Protocol (VRRP) for IPv4 and IPv6.  It is based on VRRP (version 2)\n   for
    IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and in \"Virtual Router\n   Redundancy Protocol
    for IPv6\", and obsoletes the prevision\n   specification of this version documented
    in RFC 5798.  VRRP specifies\n   an election protocol that dynamically assigns
    responsibility for a\n   Virtual Router to one of the VRRP Routers on a LAN.  The
    VRRP Router\n   controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a Virtual\n
    \  Router is called the Active Router, and it forwards packets sent to\n   these
    IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Active Routers are configured with\n   virtual IPv4 or
    IPv6 addresses, and Backup Routers infer the address\n   family of the virtual
    addresses being advertised based on the IP\n   protocol version.  Within a VRRP
    Router, the Virtual Routers in each\n   of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families
    are independent of one another\n   and always treated as separate Virtual Router
    instances.  The\n   election process provides dynamic failover in the forwarding\n
    \  responsibility should the Active Router become unavailable.  For\n   IPv4,
    the advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher-availability\n   default path
    without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or\n   router discovery protocols
    on every end-host.  For IPv6, the\n   advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6
    is a quicker switchover to\n   Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard
    IPv6 Neighbor\n   Discovery mechanisms.\n\n   The VRRP terminology has been updated
    to conform to inclusive\n   language guidelines for IETF technologies.  The IETF
    has designated\n   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \"Guidance
    for\n   NIST Staff on Using Inclusive Language in Documentary Standards\" for\n
    \  its inclusive language guidelines.\n\n\t "

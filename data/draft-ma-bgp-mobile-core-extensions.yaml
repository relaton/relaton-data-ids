  content: "   This document describes a new route propagation and service discovery\n
    \  mechanism by proposing BGP extensions for mobile core network service\n   routing.
    \ The proposed solution introduces a Service Route Address\n   Family, hierarchical
    Network Identifier allocation, and path-aware\n   routing mechanisms that enable
    scalable inter-domain service\n   discovery while preserving compatibility with
    current 3GPP standards.\n   These extensions provide the foundation for efficient
    service\n   propagation, route aggregation, and loop-free routing in large-scale\n
    \  distributed mobile core deployments.\n\n\t "

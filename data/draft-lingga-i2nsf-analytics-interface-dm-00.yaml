abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an information model and a YANG data model
    for the Analytics Interface between an Interface to Network Security Functions
    (I2NSF) Analyzer and a Security Controller in an I2NSF system in a Network Functions
    Virtualization (NFV) environment. The YANG data model described in this document
    is based on the I2NSF NSF- Facing Interface and the I2NSF Monitoring Interface
    for enabling the delivery of analytics information based on monitoring data received
    from a Network Security Function (NSF).</p>"

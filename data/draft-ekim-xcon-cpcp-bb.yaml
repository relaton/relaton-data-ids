  content: "In a tightly coupled conference, conference participants can \ncommunicate
    with the conference policy server using a conference \npolicy control protocol
    (CPCP). This document generally describes \nhow to use CPCP to efficiently provide
    and augment interaction \nbetween clients and conference policy server. This document
    \ndescribes what information is needed for conference policy control, \nand what
    operation is needed to manipulate and interact with the \npolicy information.
    It is noted that the purpose of this draft is \nnot to suggest a new mechanism
    of CPCP, but to suggest building \nblock approach to CPCP work. \n\t "

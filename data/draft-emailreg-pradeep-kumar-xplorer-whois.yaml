  content: "    This document describes the need for a WHois email address service\n
    \   similar to the internet domainname WHois service. Theres a need for\n    a
    registered email address as opposed to non-registered email address\n    to fight
    internet SPAM, as well as encouraging email use for personal,\n    commercial
    and all kinds of purposes.An internet user\n    can have multiple email identities.
    This service implementation would also\n    help deliver a Single SignON solution
    for WWW services.\n\n\t "

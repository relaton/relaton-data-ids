  content: "This draft documents MPLS TE Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol \nmodifications
    extending the current concept of preemption with the goal \nof reducing/eliminating
    traffic disruption of preempted TE LSPs.  Under \npresent RSVP-TE signaling methods,
    LSPs are immediately displaced upon \npreemption.  The introduction of a new preemption
    pending flag helps \nmore gracefully mitigate the re-route process of displaced
    LSPs.  For \nthe brief period soft preemption is activated, reservations (though
    not \nnecessarily traffic levels) are in effect overbooked until the LSP can \nbe
    re-routed.  For this reason, the feature is primarily interesting in \npacket
    oriented MPLS networks with Diffserv and TE capabilities. \n\t "

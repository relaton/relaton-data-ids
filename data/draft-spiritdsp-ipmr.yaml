  content: "   This document describes IPMR, a scalable variable adaptive multi-\n
    \  rate speech and audio codec designed for use in IP based networks.\n   This
    codec is suitable for real time communications such as\n   telephony, voice&video
    conferencing.Four different sampling\n   frequencies are supported for encoding
    the audio input signal.\n   Adaptation to network characteristics is provided
    through control of\n   bitrate, packet rate, packet loss resilience and use of
    discontinuous\n   transmission (DTX).\n   IP-MR support different profiles for
    input signal content which\n   should be specified during codec initialization.
    It can be in Speech,\n   Audio or Auto-detection mode. In Auto-detection mode
    codec recognizes\n   type of input content automatically and switch to appropriate
    Speech\n   or Audio mode automatically.\n\n\n\n\t "

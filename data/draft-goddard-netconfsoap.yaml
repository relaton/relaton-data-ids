  content: "While the device management protocol NETCONF is generally well served\nby
    BEEP, there are environments where additional transports are\ndesirable.  The
    binding to SOAP described here may find application\nwhere SOAP-based tools and
    implementations are prevalent or where the\nnetwork configuration favors HTTP.
    \ When used with multiple HTTP\nconnections, SOAP over HTTP is sufficient for
    all NETCONF features\nexcept those involving asynchronous notification.\n\t "

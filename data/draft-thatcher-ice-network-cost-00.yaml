  content: "   This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity\n
    \  Establishment (ICE) that enables ICE agents to exchange information\n   about
    the relative cost of network interfaces and dynamically choose\n   the selected
    ICE candidate pair based on the cost of both the local\n   and remote network
    interfaces.  For example, if a cellular network\n   interface has a higher cost
    than a Wi-Fi network interface, the ICE\n   agents can use that information to
    prefer candidate pairs with Wi-Fi\n   rather than cellular when possible, and
    only use cellular when\n   necessary.\n\n   This document additionally describes
    a second piece of information,\n   network ID, that goes along with the network
    cost and can be used to\n   know when a network interface has changed, even if
    two network\n   interfaces have the same network cost.\n\n\t "

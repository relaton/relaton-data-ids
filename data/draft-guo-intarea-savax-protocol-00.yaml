abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   Because the Internet forwards packets according to the IP destination\n
    \  address, packet forwarding typically takes place without inspection\n   of
    the source address and malicious attacks have been launched using\n   spoofed
    source addresses.  The inter-domain source address validation\n   architecture
    is an effort to enhance the Internet by using state\n   machine to generate consistent
    tags.  When communicating between two\n   end hosts at different ADs of IPv6 network,
    tags will be added to the\n   packets to identify the authenticity of the IPv6
    source address.\n\n   This memo focus on the data plane of the SAVA-X mechanism.\n\n\t "

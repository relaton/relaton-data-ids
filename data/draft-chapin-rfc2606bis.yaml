  content: "   The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) defines a tree of names\n   starting
    with root, \".\", immediately below which are top level domain\n   (TLD) names
    such as \".com\" and \".us\".  RFC2606 reserved a small\n   number of TLD names
    for use in documentation examples, private\n   testing, experiments, and other
    circumstances in which it is\n   desirable to avoid conflict with current or future
    actual TLD names\n   in the DNS.  The evolution of Internet engineering and operation\n
    \  practices since RFC2606 was published in 1999, and the expected\n   addition
    of new TLD names to the DNS, recommend this update to the\n   list of reserved
    TLD names, and the creation of a \"reserved TLD name\n   registry\" to which additional
    names may be added as new requirements\n   arise.\n\n   It is important to note
    that TLD names may be reserved, in other\n   contexts, for policy, political,
    or other reasons that are distinct\n   from the IETF's concern with Internet engineering
    and operations.\n   This document reserves TLD names only for operational and
    engineering\n   reasons.\n\n\t "

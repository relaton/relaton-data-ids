  content: "   This document describes REBOOK, a resource reservation algorithm for\n
    \  deterministic and fast dynamic resource allocation and release.\n   Based on
    a stateful approach, it handles faults and network errors,\n   and recovers from
    route changes and unexpected flows shutdown.  The\n   distributed scheme used
    to store flows information have guaranteed\n   constant complexity.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   For a client to access a particular resource on the Web, a server\n
    \  must expend a certain amount of computational effort to respond to\n   the
    request.  In some cases this computational effort is sizeable and\n   the server
    may want to only respond to certain clients.  For example,\n   in a distributed
    denial-of-service attack, a server may require all\n   clients to expend a certain
    amount of resources via a client-run\n   proof-of-work algorithm to throttle the
    number of incoming requests\n   to a more manageable number.  This document details
    a new\n   authentication scheme for HTTP that may be used to request and\n   transmit
    proofs in HTTP headers.\n\n\t "

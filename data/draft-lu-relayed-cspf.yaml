- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   For LSPs that span across multiple areas or multiple autonomous\n   systems
    (AS), the path computation element (PCE) in each area or each\n   AS can cooperate
    and conclude the optimal results if so exist.  An\n   upstream PCE, though incapable
    to carry out the path computation for\n   the tailend outside of its domain, can
    provide the history of the\n   computation to its downstream PCEs which will assume
    the computation\n   job till it is accomplished or relay the baton to the next
    runner.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) has limitations to illustrate the\n
    \  network condition and to work with the OpenFlow protocol.  This\n   document
    extends ECS to improve the Application-Layer Traffic\n   Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    by (1) defining more types of endpoint\n   address such as port number, protocol
    type, domain and etc; (2)\n   adding flow constraints.\n\n\t "

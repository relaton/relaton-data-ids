  content: "This document describes a mechanism that can be used by FTP clients and
    servers to implement security and authentication using the TLS protocol defined
    by RFC 2246, \"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0.\", and the extensions to the FTP
    protocol defined by RFC 2228, \"FTP Security Extensions\". It describes the subset
    of the extensions that are required and the parameters to be used, discusses some
    of the policy issues that clients and servers will need to take, considers some
    of the implications of those policies, and discusses some expected behaviours
    of implementations to allow interoperation. This document is intended to provide
    TLS support for FTP in a similar way to that provided for SMTP in RFC 2487, \"SMTP
    Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security\", and HTTP in
    RFC 2817, \"Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1.\".\n\n This specification is in
    accordance with RFC 959, \"File Transfer Protocol\". It relies on RFC 2246, \"The
    TLS Protocol Version 1.0.\", and RFC 2228, \"FTP Security Extensions\". [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) is a popular forwarding paradigm for use in MPLS\n
    \  and IPv6 networks.  It is typically deployed in discrete domains that\n   may
    be data centers, access networks, or other networks that are\n   under the control
    of a single operator and that can easily be\n   upgraded to support this new technology.\n\n
    \  Traffic originating in one SR domain often terminates in another SR\n   domain
    but must transit a backbone network that provides\n   interconnection between
    those domains.\n\n   This document describes a mechanism for providing connectivity\n
    \  between SR domains to enable end-to-end or domain-to-domain traffic\n   engineering.\n\n
    \  The approach described allows connectivity between SR domains,\n   utilizes
    traffic engineering mechanisms (RSVP-TE or Segment Routing)\n   across the backbone
    network, makes heavy use of pre-existing\n   technologies, and requires the specification
    of very few additional\n   mechanisms.\n\n   This document provides some background
    and a problem statement,\n   explains the solution mechanism, gives references
    to other documents\n   that define protocol mechanisms, and provides examples.
    \ It does not\n   define any new protocol mechanisms.\n\n\t "

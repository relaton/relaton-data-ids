  content: "   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) operation is based on EID\n
    \  to RLOC mappings that are exchanged through a mapping system.  The\n   mapping
    system can use the RLOCs included in mapping registrations to\n   construct the
    complete set of RLOC addresses across all xTRs that are\n   members of the LISP
    deployment.  This set can then be made available\n   by the mapping system to
    all the member xTRs.  An xTR can use the\n   RLOC set to optimise protocol operation
    as well as to implement new\n   functionality.  This document describes the use
    of the LISP reliable\n   transport session between an xTR and a Map-Server to
    communicate the\n   contents of the RLOC membership set.\n\n\t "

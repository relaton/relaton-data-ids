abstract:
- content: "<p>The usage of multiple interfaces in a host causes other problems due
    to the multiplicity of available interfaces. If interface is changed during communication,
    the communication is disrupted. Multiple interfaces in a host do not support the
    simultaneous usage of multiple interfaces. In this document, we discuss how to
    solve the problems of interface change and simultaneous usage of multiple interfaces
    and propose a virtual interface which hides the multiple interfaces from the IP
    stack of host. And we describe the applicability of virtual interface into the
    problem of multiple interfaces in multiple interfaces PS document. This document
    provides the implementation guidelines of virtual interface for a multiple interface
    host.</p>"

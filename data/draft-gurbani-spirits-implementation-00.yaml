  content: "The SPIRITS protocol defines the mechanisms and the semantics to\nsubscribe
    to and convey certain PSTN events to interested Internet\nhosts for service execution
    [1].  This Internet-Draft describes our\ninitial implementation of a SPIRITS framework
    based on the\narchitecture and requirements outlined in [2] and [3], respectively.\nWe
    have implemented two services based on such an architecture: a\nSPIRITS-based
    presence service which provides a coarse-grained\npresence status for a user represented
    by a device (phone), and a\nSPIRITS-based Instant Messaging (IM) service whereby
    the PSTN sends a\nSIP IM to a SPIRITS User Agent (UA).  These services, the attendant\narchitecture
    and the relevant call flows are described next.\nIt is expected that the reader
    is conversant in the SPIRITS and SIP\nterminology.  For those who are not, [5,6]
    provide a good reference\nfor SIP and its event-based mechanism, and [1,2,3] provide
    a good\nreference for SPIRITS.\nIt is important to point out that the SPIRITS
    protocol [1] is not a\nstandard yet, it is still an Internet-Draft.  Thus, what
    is described\nin this draft is an early implementation designed to validate the\nsuitability
    of the protocol as well as provide some implementation\nexperience that will be
    leveraged in further refining the protocol.\n\n\t "

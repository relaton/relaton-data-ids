  content: "   The standard means within the Domain Name System protocol for\n   maintaining
    coherence among a zone's authoritative name servers\n   consists of three mechanisms.
    \ Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR) is\n   one of the mechanisms and originally
    was defined in RFC 1995.\n\n   This document aims to provide a more detailed and
    up-to-date\n   specification of the IXFR mechanism and to align it with the current\n
    \  specification of the primary zone transfer mechanism, AXFR, given in\n   RFC
    5936.  Further, based on operational experience, this document\n   juxtaposes
    to the original IXFR query a new query type, IXFR-ONLY,\n   that will likely be
    preferred over IXFR in specific deployments.\n\n   This document obsoletes and
    replaces RFC 1995.\n\n\t "

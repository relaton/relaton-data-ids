  content: "This RFC attempts to document various aspects of the IP service model
    and how it has evolved over time.  In particular, it attempts to document the
    properties of the IP layer as they are seen by upper- layer protocols and applications,
    especially properties that were (and, at times, still are) incorrectly perceived
    to exist as well as properties that would cause problems if changed.  The discussion
    of these properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or misconceptions.
    \ Finally, this document provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.
    \ This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.\n\t "

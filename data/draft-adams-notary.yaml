  content: "This document describes a general notary service and the protocols to\nbe
    used when communicating with it.  The Notary Authority is a Trusted\nThird Party
    (TTP) that can be used as one component in building reliable\nnon-repudiation
    services (see [ISONR]).  Useful Notary Authority\nresponsibilities in a PKI are
    to validate signatures and to provide up-\nto-date information regarding the status
    of certificates.  We give\nexamples of how to use the notary to extend the lifetime
    of a signature\nbeyond key expiry or revocation and to query the notary regarding
    the\nstatus of a certificate.\n\n\t "

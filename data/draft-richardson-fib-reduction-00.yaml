  content: "This document analyzes Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) flow
    within a router with emphasis on the Forwarding Information Base(s)--FIB(s)--and
    the effects of currently-implemented aggregation schemes on FIB size.  The conditions
    for reduction of FIB information before insertion into the kernel are considered,
    with preservation of routing a primary criteria (essentially deriving in a more
    structured manner the result that one wishes to remove extraneous routing information
    extant in the FIB(s)).  Finally, aggregation algorithms consistent with these
    conditions are presented.\n\t "

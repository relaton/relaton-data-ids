  content: "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been\nextended
    with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request\ninformation about
    DHCPv6 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to\nqueries for individual bindings.
    \ In some situations individual\nbinding queries may not be efficient, or even
    possible.  This\ndocument specifies extensions to the Leasequery protocol that
    add new\nquery types and allow for bulk DHCPv6 binding data transfer.\n\t "

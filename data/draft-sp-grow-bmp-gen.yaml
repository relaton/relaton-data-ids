  content: "   This document defines a new BMP message type: the Generic Event\n   Notification
    (GEN).  The BMP GEN message provides a flexible\n   mechanism for reporting a
    wide variety of events related to BGP at\n   different levels of hierarchy, such
    as routing instance, AFI/SAFI, or\n   peer level.  The BMP GEN message enables
    operators and automated\n   systems to receive detailed context for operational
    events, such as\n   policy triggers, administrative interventions, and state management\n
    \  notifications (e.g., RIB view unmonitor events).\n\n\t "

  content: "   An important Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)\n   requirement
    of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to\n   measure the throughput
    (i.e. bandwidth) of an MPLS-TP connection\n   which could be an MPLS-TP PseudoWire
    (PW), Label Switched Path (LSP)\n   or Section.  This document specifies the OAM
    packet formats and\n   procedures for both one-way and two-way throughput measurement
    in\n   MPLS-TP.\n\n\t "

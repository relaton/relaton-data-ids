  content: "When an IPv6 node receives a Router Advertisement, how does it \nknow
    that the node which sent the advertisement is authorized to \nannounce that it
    routes the prefix? When an IPv6 node receives a \nNeighbor Advertisement message,
    how does it know that the node \nsending the message is, in fact, authorized to
    claim the binding? \nThe answer is, in the absence of a preconfigured IPsec security
    \nassociation among the nodes on the link and the routers, they \ndon't. In this
    draft, a lightweight protocol is described for \nsecuring the signaling involved
    in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. The \nprotocol allows a node receiving a Router Advertisement
    or a \nNeighbor Advertisement to have the confidence that the message was \nauthorized
    by the legitimate owner of the address or prefix being \nadvertised without requiring
    a preconfigured IPsec security \nassociation. A certain degree of infrastructural
    support is \nrequired, but not any more than is currently common for public \naccess
    IP networks. The protocol is based on some results in \nidentity based cryptosystems
    that allow a publicly known \nidentifier to function as a public key.\n\t "

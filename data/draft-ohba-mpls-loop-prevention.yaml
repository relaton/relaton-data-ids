- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "    This paper presents a  simple mechanism,  based on 'threads',  which\n
    \   can  be  used to prevent MPLS  from  setting up  label switched path\n    (LSPs)
    which have loops.  The mechanism is compatible with, but does\n    not require,
    \ VC merge.  The mechanism  can be  used with either the\n    ordered  downstream-on-demand
    \   allocation  or  ordered  downstream\n    allocation.   The amount of  information
    \ that must  be passed in  a\n    protocol message is tightly bounded  (i.e.,
    no path-vector is used).\n    When a node needs to change its next hop, a distributed
    procedure is\n    executed,  but  only nodes which   are downstream of  the change
    are\n    involved.\n\n\t "

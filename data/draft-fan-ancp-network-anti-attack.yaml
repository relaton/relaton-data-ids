  content: "This document specifies an extension of Access Node Control Protocol\nto
    enforce security policy for network anti-attacking.  An access\nrouter or NAS
    uses the proposed mechanism to send security policy to\na layer 2 device which
    an attacking host may directly connects to.\nThe solution proposed here can be
    used in either public access\nnetworks or enterprise networks.\n\t "

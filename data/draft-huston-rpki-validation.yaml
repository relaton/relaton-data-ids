  content: "   This document reviews the certificate validation procedure specified\n
    \  in RFC6487 and highlights aspects of operational management of\n   certificates
    in the RPKI in response to the movement of resources\n   across registries, and
    the associated actions of Certification\n   Authorities to maintain certification
    of resources during this\n   movement.  The document describes an alternative
    validation procedure\n   that reduces the operational impact of certificate management
    during\n   resource movement.\n\n\t "

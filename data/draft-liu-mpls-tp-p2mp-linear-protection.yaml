  script: Latn
  content: "   In MPLS-TP requirement document(rfc5654), there is a requirement to\n
    \  support 1+1 and 1:n protection for p2mp connectivity.  The\n   requirement
    was described in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework\n   document(RFC 6372) and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework.
    \ The basic\n   protocol for linear protection was specified in the MPLS-TP Linear\n
    \  Protection document [RFC 6378] but is limited to 1+1 and 1:1\n   protection
    for p2p connectivity.  in addtion, The 1:N protection in\n   which all of working
    transport paths and the protection path have the\n   same end points was specified
    in MPLS-TP 1:N protection document\n   (draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection).This
    document applies the\n   existing PSC(RFC 6378) and extensive PSC protocol(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-\n
    \  1toN-protection) to support scenarios of protecting the p2mp path by\n   extending
    the existing p2p linear protection mechanism.  .\n\n\n   This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task\n   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union\n   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include\n
    \  an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures\n   to
    support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport\n   network
    as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t "

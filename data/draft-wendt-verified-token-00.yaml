  content: "   This memo defines a token format for verifying with non-repudiation\n
    \  the originator of a set of information.  The originator uses a\n   cryptographic
    signature generally with a key that proves\n   authorization from a trust anchor
    to prove to a terminating party\n   that the originator is both an authorized
    sender and the information\n   wasn't altered or modified in transit.  The token
    incorporates the\n   ability for the originator to assert a application specific
    but\n   extensible set of information that could include network identity,\n   device
    identity, realm of origin, and other metadata.  Verification\n   of this information
    in the telephony world is important for\n   validating telephone calls and the
    telephone numbers they are\n   presenting and can be utilized as an important
    tool for combat\n   spoofing of identity and other forms of impersonation.\n\n\t "

  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based localized mobility\nmanagement
    protocol that enables mobile devices to connect to a\nPMIPv6 domain and roam across
    gateways without changing their IP\naddresses.  PMIPv6 basic specification also
    provides limited multi-\nhoming support to multi-mode mobile devices.  The ability
    of movement\nof selected flows from one access technology to another is missing
    in\nbasic PMIPv6.  This document describes enhancements to the Proxy\nMobile IPv6
    protocol that are required to support flow mobility over\nmultiple physical interfaces.\n\t "

  content: "   With the advent of RFC8950, Internet Exchang Points (IXPs) are\n   enabled
    to rely solely on IPv6 addresses for adressing in their\n   peering LANs.  However,
    routers not supporting RFC8950 are a\n   technical roadblock.\n\n   It is easier
    to extend the capabilities of the IXP Route Server (RS)\n   instead of those of
    every unsupporting router.  Thus, this document\n   introduces the concept of
    Specific Local Address Tables (SLATs).\n   SLATs translate BGP next hops between
    all IXP members, regardless of\n   their RFC8950 support, paving the way for IPv6-only
    IXPs.\n\n   This document updates RFC 6890 by registering a special-purpose\n
    \  address, and RFC 7947 by specifying an allowed route modification at\n   the
    route server.\n\n\t "

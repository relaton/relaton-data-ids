  content: "The delivery and the adaptation of multimedia content in distributed,
    \nheterogeneous environments, involving device and/or application \nmobility,
    require flexible control and management mechanisms in the \nterminals and/or in
    media gateways. MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation \n(DIA) provides normative description
    formats supporting the \nadaptation of so-called Digital Items, but it does not
    define \ninteractions with existing transport and control technologies, in \norder
    to remain independent. This draft presents a practical approach \nfor harmonizing
    MPEG-21 DIA application with Session Description \nProtocol next generation (SDPng).
    The proposed mechanism allows the \ndefinition of system configurations, performance
    constraints and \nadaptation information within the scope of SDPng using the format
    of \nMPEG-21 DIA. Furthermore, the converged format enables the \nintegration
    of session management and negotiation protocols (e.g. \nSession Initiation Protocol
    - SIP) that use such enhanced SDPng \ndescriptions within an MPEG-21 conformant
    environment.\n\t "

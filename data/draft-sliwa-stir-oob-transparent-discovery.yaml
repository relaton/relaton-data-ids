  content: "   This document defines a Discovery Service for STIR Out-of-Band (OOB)\n
    \  Call Placement Services (CPS).  The Discovery Service enables\n   Authentication
    Services (AS) and Verification Services (VS) to\n   quickly determine which CPS
    is responsible for a given telephone\n   number (TN) or Service Provider Code
    (SPC), allowing retrieval of\n   PASSporTs even when SIP Identity headers are
    removed by non-IP or\n   hybrid network segments.  The Discovery Service leverages
    a CPS URI\n   certificate extension, which allows STIR Certificates or Delegate\n
    \  Certificates to embed an HTTPS URI for the CPS serving the TNs or\n   SPCs
    covered by the certificate.\n\n\t "

  content: "RFC 4364 and RFC 4659 define an approach to building provider-\nprovisioned
    Layer 3 VPNs for IPv4 and IPv6.  It may be desirable to\nuse RSVP to perform admission
    control on the links between CE and PE\nrouters.  This document specifies procedures
    by which RSVP messages\ntravelling from CE to CE across an L3VPN may be appropriately
    handled\nby PE routers so that admission control can be performed on PE-CE\nlinks.
    \ Optionally, admission control across the provider's backbone\nmay also be supported.\n\t "

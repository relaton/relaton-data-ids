  content: "RBridges provide the ability to have an entire domain, with multiple \nphysical
    links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows \nfor zero configuration
    of switches within an RBridge domain, optimal \npair-wise routing, safe forwarding
    even during periods of temporary \nloops, and potential additional advantages
    as well.  The design also\nsupports VLANs, allows forwarding tables to be based
    on destinations \nwithin the RBridge domain (rather than endnode destinations,
    allowing \ninternal forwarding tables to be smaller than in conventional bridge
    \nsystems).\n\nThe intent is to re-uses one or more existing routing protocols
    to\naccomplish these goals.\n\nThis document lays out the background and specific
    requirements of\npotential routing protocols to be considered for use in this
    design.\nIn particular, this document defines what is needed to accomodate\nthis
    design using IS-IS (or OSPF) as a basis for RBridge protocols.\n\t "

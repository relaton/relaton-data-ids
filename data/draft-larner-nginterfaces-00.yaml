  script: Latn
  content: "Part of the charter of the Protocol Design Group of the HTTP-NG project
    is to\nidentify a set of formal interfaces that will allow the current functionality
    of\nthe Web to be captured, as well as support future needs. Before delving into
    the\nspecific interfaces, the kinds of concepts involved need to be described.
    The\nactual interface descriptions here are cast in terms of distributed object\nsystems,
    the merits of which as a foundation for the Web have been discussed in\n'Migrating
    the Web toward Distributed Objects'\n(ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/webilu.html)
    and elsewhere. The intent is\nnot to imply that what is presented here is complete
    or final, but rather to\nprovide a starting point for how the Web should look
    in the future.\n\n\t "

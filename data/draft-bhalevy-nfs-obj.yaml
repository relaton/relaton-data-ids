  script: Latn
  content: "   Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) to\n
    \  allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used by the\n   NFSv4
    server.  This ability to bypass the server for data access can\n   increase both
    performance and parallelism, but requires additional\n   client functionality
    for data access, some of which is dependent on\n   the class of storage used,
    a.k.a. the Layout Type.  The main pNFS\n   operations and data types in NFSv4
    Minor version 1 specify a layout-\n   type-independent layer; layout-type-specific
    information is conveyed\n   using opaque data structures whose internal structure
    is further\n   defined by the particular layout type specification.  This document\n
    \  specifies the NFSv4.1 Object-Based pNFS Layout Type as a companion to\n   the
    main NFSv4 Minor version 1 specification.  Version 2 of this\n   layout type introduces
    the use of the Network File System protocol as\n   an object-storage protocol
    in addition to the T-10 OSD protocol.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Today there is a growth in the number of blockchain and decentralized\n
    \  ledger networks (DLN) around the world, and interoperability across\n   different
    networks represents a challenge for the value proposition\n   of these networks.\n\n
    \  One approach for blockchain interoperability to be achieved is to\n   employ
    gateways that permit assets to flow across the relevant\n   networks of blockchains.\n\n
    \  However, a core requirement for interoperability is the correct\n   identification
    of computer systems that act as gateways and the\n   correct validation of the
    ownership of the gateway.  A secondary\n   requirement is for a gateway to inquire
    as to the existence of an\n   entity address (public key) within a given decentralized
    ledger\n   network.\n\n   This memo discusses options with regards gateway identification
    and\n   verification strategies.  It looks at addressing the problem from the\n
    \  application layer and from the network layer.  It also discusses\n   other
    options, such as relying on a third-party blockchain-registered\n   identifiers
    and resolver services\n\n\t "

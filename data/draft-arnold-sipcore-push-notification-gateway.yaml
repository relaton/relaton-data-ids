  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes how a Push Notification Gateway (PNG) network\n
    \  element can be used to allow SIP User Agents (UA) to run on devices\n   where
    background processing and monitoring is limited.  In these\n   circumstances,
    it cannot be assumed that the SIP UA can regularly\n   REGISTER with the network
    or be able to detect inbound messages.  A\n   PNG stores details provided to it
    by the UA during registration to\n   prompt a Push Notification Service (PNS)
    to generate a real-time\n   notification for the UA to REGISTER with the network
    and therefore be\n   available for inbound SIP messages.\n\n\t "

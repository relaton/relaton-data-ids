abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The objective of this proposal is to enable ID and Locator namespace\n
    \  split in the CCN protocol that has several applications such as\n   towards
    Interest routing optimization, mobility, handling\n   indirections in manifests,
    and routing scalability.  We enable this\n   through the notion of forwarding-label
    (FL) object, which is an\n   optional hop-by-hop payload in the Interest message
    with a locator\n   name which identifies a network domain, router, or a host.
    \ Depending\n   on the application and trust context, an FL object can be subjected\n
    \  to policy based actions by the forwarders such as invoking security\n   verification
    or enabling other service-centric actions such as FL\n   object replacement.  FL
    object can be inserted by the applications or\n   by the network.  To enable dynamic
    name resolution FL objects can\n   also be modified in the network by designated
    points such as the edge\n   routers.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In this draft, we present FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr\n
    \  Threshold signature scheme that reduces network overhead during\n   signing
    operations while protecting against forgery attacks\n   applicable to prior similar
    threshold and multisignature\n   constructions.\n\n   FROST can be safely used
    without limiting concurrency of signing\n   operations yet allows for true threshold
    signing, as only a threshold\n   number of participants are required for signing
    operations.  Here, we\n   define FROST as a two-round protocol, but it can be
    optimized to a\n   single-round single-round signing protocol as the first round
    can be\n   performed as a batched pre-processing stage.\n\n\t "

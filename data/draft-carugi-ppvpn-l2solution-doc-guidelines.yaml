  content: "This document provides guidelines on how to structure a PPVPN Layer 2
    \nsolution document.  \nThe intent is to provide a common way of describing the
    various \nfunctional components of a Layer 2 solution, making easier their \nidentification
    as well as the mechanisms providing those \nfunctionalities, and, possibly, facilitating
    further convergence in \nthe solution space. \nThese guidelines have been discussed
    internally to the PPVPN Layer 2 \ndesign team and agreed as a recommendation,
    although not mandatory, \nto authors of PPVPN L2 solution drafts. \n\t "

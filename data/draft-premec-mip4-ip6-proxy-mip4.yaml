  content: "The IPv6-based end-user device is commonly not able to utilize the \nadvantages
    introduced by the mobile IP protocols. However, this \nspecification describes
    how an end-user device supporting only IPv6 \nprotocol stack may be provided with
    a mobility service by the mobile \nIPv4-based access network. The unaltered end-user
    device relies on \nthe functionalities of the two network-side entities, the Home
    Agent \nand the new Proxy Mobile Node, acting on its behalf and providing the
    \nIP layer mobility management. \n\n\n\t "

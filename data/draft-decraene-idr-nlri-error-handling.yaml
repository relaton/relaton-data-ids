abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 7606 partially revises the error handling for BGP UPDATE messages.
    It reduces the cases of BGP session reset by defining and using less impactful
    error handling approaches, such as attribute discard and treat-as-withdraw when
    applicable. The treat-as-withdraw approach requires that the entire NLRI field
    of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute be successfully parsed. This typically means parsing
    errors in MP_REACH_NLRI cannot be handled by any means short of session reset.
    This is exacerbated by the use of non-key data within NLRI, which introduces parsing
    complexity and additional error cases. This specification defines a non-transitive
    BGP attribute, the "Treat-As-Withdraw Attribute", to encode NLRIs as per the format
    of MP_UNREACH_NLRI. This attribute is used to allow the treat-as- withdraw error-handling
    approach to be used in case an error in the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute prevents
    the parsing of its NLRIs. This document updates RFC 7606 by mandating that the
    Treat-As- Withdraw Attribute appear before the MP_REACH_NLRI (or any other) attribute
    in an UPDATE message.</p>

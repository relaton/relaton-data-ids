  content: "   This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail user\n
    \  agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a\n   message
    after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.\n   This content-type
    is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional\n   message header fields are
    also defined to permit Message Disposition\n   Notifications (MDNs) to be requested
    by the sender of a message.  The\n   purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support
    functionality often\n   found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the
    proprietary\n   \"LAN-based\" systems, and often referred to as \"read receipts,\"\n
    \  \"acknowledgements\", or \"receipt notifications.\"  The intention is to\n
    \  do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been\n   expressed
    when such functions have been discussed in the past.\n\n   Because many messages
    are sent between the Internet and other\n   messaging systems (such as X.400 or
    the proprietary \"LAN-based\"\n   systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be
    useful in a multi-\n   protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol
    described\n   in this memo provides for the carriage of \"foreign\" addresses,
    in\n   addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.  Additional\n   attributes
    may also be defined to support \"tunneling\" of foreign\n   notifications through
    Internet Mail.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 3798 and updates RFC 2046, RFC
    3461 and\n   replaces MDN definition in RFC 6533.\n\n   Note: This draft shows
    how a combined MDN and EAI MDN document might\n   look like.  This work represents
    opinion of editors about possible\n   future direction for a combined specification
    and is not the result\n   of consensus of any IETF WG.  This draft can be used
    as a replacement\n   or update to draft-melnikov-mdn-3798bis-eai.\n\n\t "

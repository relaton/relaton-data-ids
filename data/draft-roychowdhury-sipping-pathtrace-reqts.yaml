  content: "There is no defined mechanism today by which SIP proxies can insert\npath
    related information in a SIP message that is being routed\nacross a network.\nAs
    an example, a network administrator may want to trace the path as\na  SIP message
    traverses across her network to detect failure\npoints.\nAs another example, a
    user may want to discover capabilities of\nservers in the path of a call. Although
    there is an informal mention\nof using the OPTIONS method to achieve the latter
    example [1], there\nis no defined way to achieve the same today.\n\n\t "

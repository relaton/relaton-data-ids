  content: "In-line network management prediction exploits fine-grained models of\nnetwork
    components, injected into the communication network, to\nenhance network performance.
    \ Accurate and fast prediction of local\nnetwork state enables more intelligent
    network control resulting in\ngreater performance and fault tolerance.  Accurate
    and fast\nprediction requires algorithmic capability.  Active and Programmable\nNetworking
    have enabled algorithmic information to be dynamically\ninjected into the network
    allowing enhanced capability and\nflexibility.  One of the new capabilities is
    enhanced network\nmanagement via in-line management code, that is, management\nalgorithms
    embedded within intermediate network devices.  In-line\nnetwork management prediction
    utilizes low-level algorithmic\ntransport capability to implement low-overhead
    predictive management.\nA secondary purpose of this document is to provide general\ninteroperability
    information for the injection of general purpose\nalgorithmic information into
    network devices.  This document may help\nin some manner to serve as a temporary
    bridge between Internet\nProtocol and Active  and Programmable Network  applications.
    \ This\nmay stimulate some thought as to the content and format of\n'standards'
    information potentially required for Active Networking.\nManagement of the Internet
    Protocol and Active and Programmable\nNetworking is vital.  In particular, coexistence
    and interoperability\nof active networking  and Internet Protocol management is
    specified\nin order to implement the injection of algorithmic information into
    a\nnetwork.\n\n\n\t "

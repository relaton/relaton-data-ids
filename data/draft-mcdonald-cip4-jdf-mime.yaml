  content: "The International Cooperation for the Integration of Processes in\nPrepress,
    Press, and Postpress (CIP4) is an international worldwide\nstandards body located
    in Switzerland.  The purpose of CIP4 is to\nencourage computer based integration
    of all processes that have to be\nconsidered in the graphic arts industry.  CIP4
    has defined two\ndocument formats that are encoded in W3C Extensible Markup Language\n(XML):
    \ \n(1) CIP4 Job Definition Format (JDF) - an open standard for\nintegration of
    all computer aided business and production\nprocesses around print media; \n(2)
    CIP4 Job Messaging Format (JMF) - an open standard for job\nmessaging using Hyper
    Text Transport Protocol/1.1 (HTTP/1.1,\nRFC2616) that defines Query, Command,
    Response, Acknowledge, and\nSignal message families.  \nThis document defines
    two new MIME sub-types for IANA registration:  \n(1) 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml'
    for CIP4 Job Definition Format; \n(2) 'application/vnd.cip4-jmf+xml' for CIP4
    Job Messaging Format.  \n\t "

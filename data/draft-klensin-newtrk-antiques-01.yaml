  content: "RFC 2026 and some of its predecessors require that Proposed and Draft\nStandards
    either advance in grade within a reasonable period of time\nor that they expire
    and be moved to Historic.  That procedure has\nnever been followed on a systematic
    basis.  A new procedure has been\nproposed that would make that action easier
    for protocols that have\nnot gotten any real acceptance.  In the interest of symmetry,\nfairness,
    and an orderly attic, it is worth noting that there are a\nnumber of protocol
    descriptions which have been at less than Full\nStandard level for a long time
    but which have proven their value by\nthe traditional criteria of multiple interoperable
    implementations\nThis document provides a procedure for upgrading such documents
    to\nFull Standards without creating an unreasonable burden on authors\npurely
    to meet the needs of procedural rituals or placing an\nunreasonable load on groups
    charged with performing other tasks in\nthe IETF.\n\t "

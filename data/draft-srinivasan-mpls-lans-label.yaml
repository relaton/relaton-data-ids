  content: "Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) refers to a forwarding paradigm\n
    \  for routed networks which combines the speed and simplicity of link\n   layer
    switching with the scalability and control of network layer\n   forwarding.  Routers
    which support MPLS are referred to as Label\n   Switching Routers (LSRs).  MPLS
    requires the distribution labels\n   between peer LSRs based on routing and traffic
    information.  These\n   labels are then carried in packets and are used for making
    high speed\n   forwarding decisions at the routers by eliminating the need for\n
    \  conventional network layer header processing.  This note discusses\n   the
    format and encapsulation of labels when using MPLS on LAN media.\n\t "

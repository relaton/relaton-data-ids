  content: "   An OAuth 2.0 client requires specific information to interact with
    an\n   authorization server, including a client identifier registered with\n   the
    authorization server.  The OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration\n   Protocol
    [RFC7591] defines a mechansim for dynamic client\n   registration that removes
    the need for manual registration.  This\n   provides a more scalable mechanism
    that can be used by clients that\n   do not have a pre-existing relationship with
    an authorization server,\n   or where manually configuring such relationships
    is prohibitive from\n   a cost and scale perspective.  Examples of deployments
    that benefit\n   from dynamic client registration includes modern cloud architectures\n
    \  where microservices are created on demand to meet scale requirements\n   or
    for use with emerging protocols like the Model Context Protocol\n   (MCP) [MCP]
    which requires clients to register with an authorization\n   server even if they
    do not have a predefined relationship with the\n   authorization server.  Similar
    to modern cloud native workloads, MCP\n   service integrations may be ephemeral
    in nature.  The OAuth 2.0\n   Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591] defines
    a software\n   statement that includes metadata about the client and is signed
    by a\n   developer or trusted third party.  This specification describes the\n
    \  use of specific third party credentials issued to workloads and\n   applications
    as software statements.  The specification describes two\n   types of credentials
    that may be used as software statements.  The\n   first is Secure Production Identity
    Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE)\n   credentials.  The second is the use of JWT
    representation of a\n   Verifiable Credentials [VC-JWT]\n\n\t "

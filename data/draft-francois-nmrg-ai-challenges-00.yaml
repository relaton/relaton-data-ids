  content: "   This document is intended to introduce the challenges to overcome\n
    \  when network management problems may require to be couple with AI\n   solutions.
    \ On one hand, there are many difficult problems in Network\n   Management that
    to this date have no good solutions, or where any\n   solutions come with significant
    limitations and constraints.\n   Artificial Intelligence may help produce novel
    solutions to those\n   problems.  On the other hand, for several reasons (computational\n
    \  costs of AI solutions, privacy of data), distribution of AI tasks\n   became
    primordial.  It is thus also expected that network SHOULD be\n   operated efficiently
    to support those tasks.\n\n   To identify the right set of challenges, the document
    defines a\n   method based on the evolution and nature of NM problems.  This will\n
    \  be done in parallel with advances and the nature of existing\n   solutions
    in AI in order to highlight where AI and NM have been\n   already coupled together
    or could benefit from a higher integration.\n   So, the method aims at evaluating
    the gap between NM problems and AI\n   solutions.  Challenges are derived accordingly,
    assuming solving\n   these challenges will help to reduce the gap between NM and
    AI.\n\n\t "

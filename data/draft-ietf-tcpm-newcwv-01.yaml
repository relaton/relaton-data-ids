  content: "   This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that\n
    \  arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where\n   the
    sending rate is limited by the application rather than the\n   congestion window.
    \ It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart\n   quickly following either
    an idle or rate-limited interval.  This\n   method is expected to benefit applications
    that send rate-limited\n   traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate
    response if\n   congestion is experienced.\n\n   It also evaluates the Experimental
    specification of TCP Congestion\n   Window Validation, CWV, defined in RFC 2861,
    and concludes that RFC\n   2861 sought to address important issues, but failed
    to deliver a\n   widely used solution.  This document therefore recommends that
    the\n   status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental to Historic, and that\n
    \  it is replaced by the current specification.\n\n   NOTE: The standards status
    of this WG document is under review for\n   consideration as either Experimental
    (EXP) or Proposed Standard (PS).\n   This decision will be made later as the document
    is finalised.\n\n\t "

  content: "   To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, [RFC6424] has been\n   determined
    as a base solution. This solution requires all the LMA to\n   forward multicast
    packets to MAG via PMIPv6 tunnel. This approach\n   creates a tunnel convergence
    problem. To resolve the issue, the\n   current MULTIMOB WG charter is trying to
    draw a solution about how to\n   separate multicasting routing from a mobility
    anchor. To address the\n   issue, we propose the local routing approach that makes
    the direct\n   connection between MAG and multicast router. The advantages of
    the\n   proposed local routing solution are compared with the base solution\n
    \  and dedicated LMA approach. In addition, we present the applicability\n   of
    local routing solution depending on several constraints.\n\n\n\t "

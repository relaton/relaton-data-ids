    triggering DNS queries to the servers in lieu of user requests\n   and returning
    responses without an explicit requests from clients.\n   This functionality can
    be achieved by multiple approaches at HTTP and\n   Domain Name System [DNS] Protocols,
    this document specifies approach\n   that shall be employed at HTTP protocol [RFC
    2616].\n   Methods/approaches pertaining to DNS shall be documented in [draft-\n
    \  pchowdaiah-dns-without-explicit-query.txt].\n\n\n\t "

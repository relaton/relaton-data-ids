  content: "The increasing deployment of both, IP multicast and mobility, rises\n
    the problem of delivering  IPv6 multicast traffic to mobile nodes.\n This document
    proposes an approach to the problem, named\n Decentralized Mobile Multicast, that
    combines tunnelling and dynamic\n subscription to the multicast groups. The proposed
    solution aims to\n reduce handover time, and to diminish the overhead produced\n
    by multicast subscriptions. As a consequence of the decentralized\n selection
    of multicast routers, a single point of failure is\n eliminated.\n\t "

  content: "The Request For Comments document series has defined the ARPAnet and later
    the Internet community as strongly as any other feature of the social fabric.
    \ While it has served the community far beyond any imaginable measure of success,
    the recent influx of those unfamiliar with the culture has left it vulnerable
    to confusion ranging from misunderstanding to misrepresentation.  This document
    proposes a new family of documents which, one hopes, keeps the spirit of the RFCs
    alive while updating the packaging to be a bit more tamper-proof. This proposal
    is not made lightly, or even very willingly, but it is a response to a very real
    problem.\n\t "

  content: "   Computing in the network may require the embedded computing\n   capability
    in the network device, such as gateway, switch, etc, and\n   there might be so
    much distributed computing task in the network.\n   Some new applications like
    AR/VR, motion control put forward higher\n   demand of network than before, and
    AI is also considered to be used\n   in the app and network.\n\n   In order to
    satisfy their demands, network may not only need to\n   reserve bandwidth resource,
    but also reserve computing resource.\n   This document analyzes the requirements
    of Serial distributed\n   computing model and give some reference solutions.\n\n\n\t "

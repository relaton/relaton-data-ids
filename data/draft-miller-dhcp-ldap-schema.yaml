  content: "This document defines a schema for Dynamic Host Configuration\nProtocol
    (DHCP).  This schema makes it possible to integrate\nDHCP servers with an LDAP-based
    directory service, allowing an\norganization to maintain a single store of IP
    addresses and\nother configuration data provided to clients using the DHCP\nprotocol.
    Integration of DHCP into LDAP directories is\ndesirable since it reduces administrative
    overhead and\neliminates the need to maintain multiple server centric\nconfiguration
    databases.\n \nIt is anticipated that this schema will be useful for\nproviding
    a standardized format for the representation of\nattributes needed by DHCP implementations
    within LDAP-based\ndirectory services.\n\n\t "

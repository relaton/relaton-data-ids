  content: "   Mobile devices sometimes want to give temporary access to their\n   presence
    and location information to third parties that may not have\n   a trust relationship
    with their presence server.  Also, in addition\n   to other mechanisms, application-layer
    location configuration\n   protocols are helpful in building location-based systems.
    \ This\n   document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package,\n
    \  locationref, that periodically delivers randomized presence URLs to\n   the
    target, which the target can then hand to call recipients and\n   other parties.\n\t "

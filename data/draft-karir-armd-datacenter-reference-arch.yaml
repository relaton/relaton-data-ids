  content: "   The continued growth of large-scale data centers has resulted in a\n
    \  wide range of architectures and designs.  Each design is tuned to\n   address
    the challenges and requirements of the specific applications\n   and workload
    that the data is being built for.  Each design evolves\n   as engineering solutions
    are developed to workaround limitations of\n   existing protocols, hardware, as
    well as software implementations.\n\n   The goal of this document is to characterize
    this problem space in\n   detail in order to better understand if there is any
    gap in making\n   address resolution scale in various network designs for data\n
    \  centers.  In particular it is our goal to peel back the various\n   optimization
    and engineering solutions to develop generalized\n   reference architectures for
    a data center.  We also discuss the\n   various factors that influence design
    choices in developing various\n   data center designs.\n\n\n\t "

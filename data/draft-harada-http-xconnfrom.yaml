  content: "        HTTP/1.1 defines a Connection header, allowing 'the sender\n        to
    specify options that are desired for that particular\n        connection and MUST
    NOT be communicated by proxies over\n        further connections.'  Because HTTP/1.0
    proxies would\n        normally forward the Connection header without obeying
    its\n        specification, a Connection header received in an HTTP/1.0\n        message
    must normally be treated as if it had been\n        forwarded in error.  This
    document defines an X-Connfrom\n        header that identifies the sending host,
    and so is safe to\n        use in HTTP/1.0 messages.  This might be useful in\n
    \       experimenting with HTTP/1.0 implementations of applications\n        of
    the HTTP/1.1 Connection mechanism.\n\t "

  content: "   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n   protocol
    supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches\n   including point-to-point
    links and multi-access LAN (Local Area\n   Network) links that can have multiple
    TRILL switches and end stations\n   attached. TRILL uses IS-IS (Intermediate System
    to Intermediate\n   System) routing. This document specifies the establishment,\n
    \  reporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacency between TRILL switches,\n   also
    known as RBridges. It also concerns four other link-local\n   aspects of TRILL:
    Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU (Maximum\n   Transmission Unit) testing,
    pseudonode creation, and BFD (Bi-\n   Directional Forwarding Detection) session
    bootstrapping in connection\n   with adjacency. State diagrams are included where
    appropriate.  This\n   document obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates RFC 6325.\n\n\n\n\t "

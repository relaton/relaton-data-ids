  content: "This document specifies the Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol,
    used for interaction between iSNS servers and iSNS clients, which facilitates
    automated discovery, management, and configuration of iSCSI and Fibre Channel
    devices (using iFCP gateways) on a TCP/IP network.  iSNS provides intelligent
    storage discovery and management services comparable to those found in Fibre Channel
    networks, allowing a commodity IP network to function in a capacity similar to
    that of a storage area network.  iSNS facilitates a seamless integration of IP
    and Fibre Channel networks due to its ability to emulate Fibre Channel fabric
    services and to manage both iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices.  iSNS thereby provides
    value in any storage network comprised of iSCSI devices, Fibre Channel devices
    (using iFCP gateways), or any combination thereof. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

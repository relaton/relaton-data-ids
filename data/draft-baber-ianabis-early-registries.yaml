  content: "   This memo describes the requirements for publishing a registry on the\n
    \  IANA website before the IETF Stream document that creates the\n   registry
    is approved for publication as an RFC.  This process can be\n   used when a Working
    Group needs to coordinate allocations among\n   multiple documents or with an
    organization outside the IETF.\n\n\t "

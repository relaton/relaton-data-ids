  content: "This document discusses the expected use of the Provider Independent \naddress
    format discussed in the companion document GEO [1] in the \nInternet. Several
    parties have expressed interest in using this \napproach as a good fit for managing
    their networks. With the long \ntimeframe that the shim6 effort will take, this
    approach provides a \nscalable multi-homing approach for use in the interim. In
    addition \nto covering implementations where it adds value in managing the \ngrowth
    of the Internet routing tables, the document will discuss \nimplementations that
    should be avoided due to the negative impact on \nthe routing tables.  \n\n\t "

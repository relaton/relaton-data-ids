  content: "    With the introduction of NAIs for identifying Mobile Nodes, RFC \n
    \   2794 also enabled the Home Agents to be able to assign IP addresses \n    to
    the Mobile Nodes during the initial registration. Though the \n    concept of
    NAI-based home address assignment is referenced in both \n    RFC 2794 and RFC
    3344, a comprehensive procedure for achieving such \n    a NAI-based home address
    assignment has not been outlined. More \n    particularly, the lifetime of the
    assigned address is undefined and\n    the address status when deregistering from
    the HA, such as when\n    returning to the home network, is also undefined. This
    document\n    first defines a default address lifetime for RFC3344 MIP entities\n
    \   to resolve this ambiguity. The document then specifies a dynamic\n    home
    address leasetime, as well as two new MIP extensions and \n    associated procedures
    to facilitate management of a dynamic home \n    address leasetime between the
    MN and the HA.  \n\t "

  content: "This document defines the format of network news articles.\nNetwork news
    articles resemble mail messages but are broadcast to\npotentially large audiences,
    using a flooding algorithm that\npropagates one copy to each interested host (or
    group thereof),\ntypically stores only one copy per host, and does not require
    any\ncentral administration or systematic registration of interested\nusers. Network
    news originated as the medium of communication for\nUsenet, circa 1980. Since
    then Usenet has grown explosively, and many\nInternet sites participate in it.
    In addition, the news technology is\nnow in widespread use for other purposes,
    on the Internet and\nelsewhere.\nThis document defines the format of network news
    articles in the\ncontext of the Internet Message Format, and adds Multipurpose\nInternet
    Mail Extensions (MIME) support for multimedia and\ninternationalized message bodies.\n\n\t "

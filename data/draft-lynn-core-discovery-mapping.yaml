  content: "   Resource and service discovery are complimentary.  Resource discovery\n
    \  provides fine-grained detail about the content of a server, while\n   service
    discovery can provide a scalable method to locate servers in\n   large networks.
    \ This document defines a method for mapping between\n   CoRE Link Format attributes
    and DNS-Based Service Discovery fields to\n   allow either method to be used to
    locate service interfaces down to\n   the granularity of function sets in mixed
    HTTP/CoAP environments.\n\n\t "

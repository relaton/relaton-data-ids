  script: Latn
  content: "   Large-scale supercomputing and AI data centers utilize multipath to\n
    \  implement load balancing and improve link reliability.  Adaptive\n   routing
    (AR), which is widely used in direct topology such as\n   dragonfly, can dynamically
    adjust routing policies based on path\n   congestion and failures.  When congestion
    or failure occurs, in\n   addition for the local node to apply AR, the congestion/failure\n
    \  information also needs to be sent to other nodes in a timely and\n   accurate
    manner, so as to enforce AR in other nodes to avoid\n   exacerbating congestion
    on the path.  This document specifies\n   Adaptive Routing Notification (ARN)
    for disseminating congestion\n   detection and congestion elimination proactively.\n\n\t "

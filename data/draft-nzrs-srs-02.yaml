  content: "This document describes the typical usage and communication protocol\nof
    a client/server shared registry system for management of domain\nname registrations.
    \ The system described is a \"thick registry\"\nsystem, providing support for
    the storage and management of both the\ntechnical and the registrant contact information
    concerning domain\nregistrations.  The system relies on the existing HTTP and
    HTTPS\ninfrastructure for transport and secure transfer to avoid having to\nimplement
    a dedicated protocol and server environment.  A bespoke XML\nformat is used to
    communicate between clients and the SRS server.\n\nComments are solicited and
    should be addressed to the author:\nmatt@nzrs.net.nz\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new routing and\n
    \  addressing architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer\n   packets
    within outer network layer headers using a non-broadcast,\n   multiple access
    (NBMA) virtual interface model.  The IKEv2 Mobility\n   and Multihoming Protocol
    (MOBIKE) allows a Virtual Private Network\n   (VPN) client to keep a connection
    to a VPN gateway active across\n   multiple network points of attachment or while
    moving from one\n   network point of attachment to another.  This document examines
    the\n   similarities between IRON and MOBIKE, and observes that they are\n   addressing
    the same fundamental networking objectives.  It further\n   proposes ways in which
    the basic MOBIKE model could be extended\n   through adoption of IRON architectural
    constructs.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes and defines shim6 as a mobility solution for\nname-based
    sockets.  Using names rather than pseudo IP addresses,\nshim6 can handle a more
    diverse set of mobility scenarios.  These\nchanges allow a shim6 session to persist
    even through cases where one\nnode has no working locators to its correspondent
    node.  If the name\nis also a resolvable fully qualified domain name, the connection
    can\nbe kept alive even if neither node have a working locator to the\ncorresponding
    node.  As can be the case if both nodes are mobile\nsimultaneously.\n\t "

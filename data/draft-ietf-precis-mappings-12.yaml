  content: "The framework for the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized
    strings (PRECIS) defines several classes of strings for use in application protocols.
    \ Because many protocols perform case-sensitive or case-insensitive string comparison,
    it is necessary to define methods for case mapping.  In addition, both the Internationalized
    Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement describe
    mappings for internationalized strings that are not limited to case, but include
    width mapping and mapping of delimiters and other special characters that can
    be taken into consideration.  This document provides guidelines for designers
    of PRECIS profiles and describes several mappings that can be applied between
    receiving user input and passing permitted code points to internationalized protocols.
    \ In particular, this document describes both locale-dependent and context-depending
    case mappings as well as additional mappings for delimiters and special characters.\n\t "

  content: "Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse and\n   integrate
    Layer 2 and Layer 3.  ATM Label Switching Router (ATM-LSR)\n   is one of the major
    applications of label switching.  Some ATM-LSRs\n   will need to support ATM SVC
    services, which requires signaling to\n   establish VCs before employing them
    and to release VCs after\n   utilizing them.  This document proposes procedures
    to deal with ATM\n   SVCs between ATM-LSRs.\n\t "

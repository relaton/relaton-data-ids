  content: "   Future networks that support advanced services, such as those enabled\n
    \  by 5G mobile networks, envision a set of overlay networks each with\n   different
    performance and scaling properties.  These overlays are\n   known as network slices
    and are realized over a common underlay\n   network.  In the context of IETF technologies,
    they are known as IETF\n   network slices.\n\n   In order to support IETF network
    slicing, as well as to offer\n   enhanced VPN services in general, it is necessary
    to define a\n   mechanism by which specific resources (buffers, queues, scheduling\n
    \  policies, etc.) of specific network topology components (links and/or\n   nodes)
    of an underlay network can be used by a specific network\n   slice, VPN, or set
    of VPNs.  These collections of resources are known\n   as Network Resource Partitions
    (NRPs).\n\n   This document sets out such a mechanism for use of BGP-LS to\n   construct
    and operate NRPs in Segment Routing networks.\n\n\t "

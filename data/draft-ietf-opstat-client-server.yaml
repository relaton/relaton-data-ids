  content: "Network administrators gather data related to the performance, utilization,
    usability and growth of their data network.  The amount of raw data gathered is
    usually quite large, typically ranging somewhere between several megabytes to
    several gigabytes of data each month.  Few (if any) tools exist today for the
    sharing of that raw data among network operators or between a network service
    provider (NSP) and its customers.  This document defines a model and protocol
    for a set of tools which could be used by NSPs and Network Operation Centers (NOCs)
    to share data among themselves and with customers.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "For many carrier's, the implementation of Virtual Private Network\n   (VPN)
    services using current IP Tunneling technology is problematic\n   because of onerous
    configuration requirements. The VPMT is an\n   protocol for the dynammic distribution
    of VPN information throughout\n   a shared network, which in turn allows the automatic
    formation of\n   point to multi-point tunnels between VPN routers.\n \n   The
    method described in this internet draft  is intended for single\n   AS where the
    AS administrator is a trusted third party.  Traffic\n   seperation is maintained
    between VPNs.\n\t "

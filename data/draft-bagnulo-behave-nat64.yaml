  content: "NAT64 is a mechanism for translating IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and\nvice-versa.
    \ DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from\nA records.  These two
    mechanisms together enable client-server\ncommunication between an IPv6-only client
    and an IPv4-only server,\nwithout requiring any changes to either the IPv6 or
    the IPv4 node,\nfor the class of applications that work through NATs.  They also\nenable
    peer-to-peer communication between an IPv4 and an IPv6 node,\nwhere the communication
    can be initiated by either end using\nexisting, NAT-traversing, peer-to-peer communication
    techniques.\nThis document specifies NAT64, and gives suggestions on how they\nshould
    be deployed.\n\t "

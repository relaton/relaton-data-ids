  content: "   This document discusses privacy properties of the SCONEPRO metadata\n
    \  or network-to-host signals.  This covers questions that were raised\n   during
    the IETF 119 BoF and subsequent discussions.  It is not\n   intended to be published
    as a separate RFC but might be incorporated\n   as a part of the security considerations
    or other content within\n   eventual SCONEPRO RFCs together with other documents
    covering\n   security considerations.  Other documents will address additional\n
    \  aspects of the security considerations for SCONEPRO metadata.\n\n\t "

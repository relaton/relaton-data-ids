abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how to use Media over QUIC Transport (MOQT) as
    the underlying transport protocol for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP is
    a protocol that enables seamless integration between language model applications
    and external data sources and tools. MOQT provides efficient, low-latency, publish-subscribe
    media delivery over QUIC and WebTransport. This specification describes the mapping
    of MCP messages onto MOQT objects and defines the procedures for establishing
    and maintaining MCP sessions over MOQT.</p>"

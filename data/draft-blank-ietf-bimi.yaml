  content: "   Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) permits Domain\n
    \  Owners to coordinate with Mail User Agents (MUAs) to display brand-\n   specific
    Indicators next to properly authenticated messages.  There\n   are two aspects
    of BIMI coordination: a scalable mechanism for Domain\n   Owners to publish their
    desired Indicators, and a mechanism for Mail\n   Transfer Agents (MTAs) to verify
    the authenticity of the Indicator.\n   This document specifies how Domain Owners
    communicate their desired\n   Indicators through the BIMI Assertion Record in
    DNS and how that\n   record is to be interpreted by MTAs and MUAs.  MUAs and mail-\n
    \  receiving organizations are free to define their own policies for\n   making
    use of BIMI data and for Indicator display as they see fit.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft specifies SWAN, a stateless network protocol which uses \ndistributed
    control algorithms to deliver service differentiation in \nMANETs. SWAN uses rate
    control for UDP and TCP best-effort traffic, \nand source-based admission control
    for UDP real-time traffic. SWAN \nalso uses explicit congestion control notification
    (ECN) to dynamically \nregulate admitted real-time traffic in the face of network
    dynamics \nbrought on by mobility or traffic overload conditions. SWAN is designed
    \nto support real-time services over best effort MACs without the need to \ninstall
    and maintain costly QOS state at MANET nodes. This makes the SWAN approach to
    MANET QOS simple, scalable, and robust. The ns-2 simulation code is available
    from the web http://comet.columbia.edu/swan/).\n\t "

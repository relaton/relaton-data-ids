  content: "This I-D is to analyze the gaps in the ongoing work of the QoS \n   application
    in the DIME WG, discuss the extension of the scope of QoS \n   application to
    a generic resource control application for a variety \n   of network technologies
    and use cases, and investigate potential \n   mechanisms to support additional
    resource control scenarios.  The \n   current Diameter Quality of Service Application
    (draft-tschofenig-\n   dime-diameter-qos-01.txt) is limited to an environment
    where network \n   elements triggered by certain mechanisms (e.g. path-coupled
    QoS \n   signaling such as RSVP or NSIS initiated by end-hosts) can request \n
    \  QoS authorization of network resources. It does not address \n   environments
    where end-hosts and/or network elements is unable to \n   issue a resource request
    initiatively. In such environments, a \n   different mode of operations is needed
    to allow an authorizing entity \n   to not just authorize QoS resources upon the
    receipt of the request \n   from network elements but also directly authorize
    resources and \n   dictate routers/switches to enforce the decisions without the
    request \n   from network elements. The new mode of operations also lends itself
    \n   to address resource control in general. It can control resources for \n   the
    purpose beyond QoS support, such as NAPT, media latching, and \n   packet filtering.\n\t "

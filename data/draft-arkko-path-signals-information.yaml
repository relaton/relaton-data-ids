  content: "   Path signals are messages seen by on-path elements examining\n   transport
    protocols.  Current preference for good protocol design\n   indicates desire for
    constructing explict rather than implicit\n   signals to carry information.  For
    instance, the ability of various\n   middleboxes to read TCP messaging was an
    implicit signal that lead to\n   difficulties in evolving the TCP protocol without
    breaking\n   connectivity through some of those middleboxes.\n\n   This document
    discusses the types of information that could be passed\n   in these path signals,
    and provides some advice on what types of\n   information might be provided in
    a beneficial manner, and which\n   information might be less likely to be revealed
    or used by\n   applications or networks.\n\n\t "

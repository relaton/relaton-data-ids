  content: "This document defines a mark and drop mechanism called Multimedia\nColor
    Marker or mmCM. This mechanism, based on the Three Color Marker\n[trTCM], can
    be used as a component of a Diffserv traffic conditioner\nfor CBR Audio/Video
    flows. In addition to the functions performed by\na color aware trTCM, the mmCM
    performs rate control and reactive\ndiscard. Rate control protects TCP flows from
    unresponsive UDP\nstreams. Rate control is performed by introducing a third Token\nBucket
    to the trTCM model with a small bucket size. Reactive discard\nis used to increase
    the probability of delivery for low precedence\npackets. Reactive discard is performed
    by demoting or dropping yellow\nand red packets in reaction to a green packet
    demotion at the marker.\nHierarchically coded Audio/Video flows can benefit of
    this\nfunctionality if the coder pre-marks the stream to reflect the\nrelative
    value of the information transported in each IP packet. It\nis assumed that the
    mmCM is used in conjunction with AF-based\nservices.\n\n\t "

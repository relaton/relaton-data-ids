  content: "   This document describes the data plane of the path-aware, inter-\n
    \  domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and\n   Isolation
    On Next-generation networks).  One of the basic\n   characteristics of SCION is
    that it gives path control to endpoints.\n   The SCION control plane is responsible
    for discovering these paths\n   and making them available as path segments to
    the endpoints.  The\n   responsibility of the *SCION data plane* is to combine
    the path\n   segments into end-to-end paths, and forward data between endpoints\n
    \  according to the specified path.\n\n   The SCION data plane fundamentally differs
    from today's IP-based data\n   plane in that it is _path-aware_: In SCION, interdomain
    forwarding\n   directives are embedded in the packet header.  This document first\n
    \  provides a detailed specification of the SCION data packet format as\n   well
    as the structure of the SCION header.  SCION also supports\n   extension headers
    - these are described, too.  The document then\n   shows the life cycle of a SCION
    packet while traversing the SCION\n   Internet.  This is followed by a specification
    of the SCION path\n   authorization mechanisms and the packet processing at routers.
    \ SCION\n   also includes its own protocol to communicate failures to endpoints,\n
    \  the SCION Control Message Protocol (SCMP).  This protocol will be\n   described
    in a separate document, which will follow later.\n\n\t "

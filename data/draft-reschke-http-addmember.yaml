  content: "Frequently, servers may want to allow resource creation through HTTP,\n
    \  but are not able to support HTTP's PUT method for creating new\n   resources,
    as resource names are completely controlled by the server.\n   This document proposes
    a new HTTP method called 'ADDMEMBER' with\n   semantics similar to those of PUT,
    except for the fact that the\n   server chooses the URI for the newly created
    resource.\n\t "

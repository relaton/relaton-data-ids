  content: "   The traditional model for DNS is that authoritative servers would\n
    \  read DNS data from static zone files and use that to answer DNS\n   queries.
    \ Modern DNS servers do not act in this way, and their\n   answers are created
    dynamically - either periodically or at query\n   time.\n\n   This document presents
    a taxonomy breaking down the most common and\n   useful methods used to customize
    responses on the authortiative side,\n   as well as a survey of implementations
    by current large authoritative\n   operators.\n\n\t "

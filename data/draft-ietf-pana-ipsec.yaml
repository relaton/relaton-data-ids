  content: "PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a  \n
    \  protocol for authenticating clients to the access network using IP  \n   based
    protocols.  The PANA protocol authenticates the client and also  \n   establishes
    a PANA security association between the PANA client and  \n   PANA authentication
    agent at the end of a successful authentication.  \n   This document discusses
    the details for establishing an IPsec  \n   security association using the PANA
    security association for enabling  \n   IPsec based access control.\n\t "

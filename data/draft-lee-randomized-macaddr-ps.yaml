- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   MAC Addresses are Link Layer addresses used in IEEE Ethernet, WiFi,\n
    \  and other link layer protocols.  A MAC Address is a fixed locally\n   unique
    address assigned by the Network Interface Card (NIC)\n   manufacturer, though
    they may be modified by an operating system, and\n   they enable a device to connect
    to a network.  Due to the static\n   nature of a MAC Address, it raises some privacy
    concerns that have\n   led to randomization of MAC Addresses by operating systems.
    \ This\n   draft documents the impacts of MAC Address randomization to existing\n
    \  use cases of network and application services and proposes few next\n   steps
    IETF may consider working on.\n\n\t "

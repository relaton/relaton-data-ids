abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In real networks, the link between two adjacent nodes always has\n
    \  multi-fibers.  The condition above happens more frequently especially\n   for
    the gateway nodes in the multi-domain network.  Moreover, the\n   number of links
    between two adjacent domains is always more than one.\n   From the view of parent
    PCE, the two conditions above will be\n   regarded as the problem of multi-fiber
    between adjacent nodes.\n   However, most route computing algorithms always can
    not solve the\n   problem of multi-fiber between adjacent nodes.  As a result,
    parent\n   PCE will not compute the route sequence with specific fibers.  It\n
    \  brings distress and problems when parent PCE computing the loose\n   route
    sequence.\n\n   In order to solve the problems existing in real networks, an\n
    \  efficient solution will be proposed for parent PCE facing the multi-\n   fiber
    between adjacent nodes.  Some interface and structure will be\n   expanded in
    this proposal.\n\n\t "

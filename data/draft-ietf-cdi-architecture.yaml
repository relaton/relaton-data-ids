  content: "There is wide interest in the technology for interconnecting Content\nNetworks,
    variously called 'Content Peering' or 'Content\nInternetworking'.  We present
    the general architecture and core\nbuilding blocks used in the internetworking
    of Content Networks.  The\nscope of this work is limited to external interconnections
    with\nContent Networks and does not address internal mechanisms used within\nContent
    Networks, which for the purpose of the document are\nconsidered to be black boxes.
    \ This work establishes an abstract\narchitectural framework to be used in the
    development of protocols,\ninterfaces, and system models for standardized Content\nInternetworking.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an alternative way of providing Internet addressing
    and access.  The addressing scheme builds on the idea of an 'IP Network Address
    Translator (NAT) [1], and relies on the Internet Service Provider's, gateway systems
    (hosts/routers) providing dynamic address translation from a pool of IP addresses.
    \                                  The access scheme splits each country/region
    into areas that are covered by local service providers who provide a Point of
    Presence (PoP) to the Internet.  The areas will be defined by grouping together
    telephone area dial codes.  Each area would be allocated to a service provider
    in much the same way as an independent radio station is licensed to use a given
    frequency.  The dial-up users will gain access to their local service providers'
    PoP by calling a national 'local' number.  The PTT's will direct all the calls
    to the service provider that has the concession for the users' area.   Overall
    it is hoped that the proposals within this memo will act as a catalyst towards
    resolving the IP addressing problems and provide a foundation towards improving
    and rationalising dial-up access to the Internet.\n\t "

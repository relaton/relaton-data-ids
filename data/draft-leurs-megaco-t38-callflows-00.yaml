  content: "This document describes the handling of realtime fax calls in\nMegaco/H.248
    controlled MGs. The call setup and capability\nnegotiation is done with support
    of the control domain with Megaco\ncommands. The switch over to fax or modem,
    upon detection of the\nrelevant tones, is done in an autonomous way, without intervention\nof
    the control domain.\nIn the Appendix, the Megaco messages for a call setup scenario
    with\ncapability negotiation are shown, to point out the structure of the\nto
    the transmitting MG. Switching to T.38 is done after reception of\nV.21 flags.\nIn
    the other flows, T.38 is not enabled, both MGs switch to the\nfallback case, fax
    pass-through mode.\nThis document is based on the superior framework (reference
    [2]).\nThe reader should be familiar with [2].\nSDP sessions in the local and
    remote descriptors.\nCall flow diagrams are given as example:\nIn the first flow,
    a T.30 CNG tone is generated by the transmitting\nterminal, the transmitting MG
    signals the detection towards the\nreceiving MG. Switching to T.38 is done by
    both MGs as soon as\npossible.\nIn the second example, a T.30 CED tone is sent
    by the receiving\nterminal. As this tone is no clear indication that a FAX will
    be\nsent, the receiving MG will switch to VBD after signaling this event\n\n\t "

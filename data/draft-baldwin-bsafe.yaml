  content: "This Internet-Draft describes protocols, procedures, and conventions\nto
    be employed by peers implementing a generic cryptographic\napplication program
    interface. Version 4.0 of this API was\nimplemented inside RSA Data Security,
    Inc.'s BSAFE product. The API\nprovides a model for implementing symmetric ciphers,
    message digests,\nmessage authentication, random number generation, public-key\nalgorithms,
    digital signatures, and secret sharing. The API is\ndocumented here for the benefit
    of others who might also adopt and\nuse the API, thus providing increased portability
    of security\napplications.\n\n\n\t "

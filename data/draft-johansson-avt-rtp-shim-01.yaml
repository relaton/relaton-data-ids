  content: "\n   This document provides a general mechanism to provide with compact\n
    \  and efficient inband signaling mechanisms for VoIP applications using\n   the
    RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol).  It provides the option to\n   include a few
    additional inband signaling bytes in between the RTP\n   header and the RTP payload.
    \ The intention of using Shim is to enable\n   a fast inband signaling channel
    that can be used for adaptation\n   purposes.\n\n   The intention of the proposed
    inband signaling is that it should act\n   as a wrapper around the actual payload.
    \ For instance if the payload\n   is AMR-NB (RFC 3267), shim will encapsulate
    the payload in a fashion\n   similar to RCF2198.  In order to distinguish this
    encapsulated\n   payload from a \"normal\" payload, necessary attributes are specified\n
    \  in SDP.\n\n   The main application is for two party teleconferencing but the\n
    \  presented mechanism can be used for multi party teleconferencing\n   applications
    as well.  The name Shim is to refer to the \"little thing\n   something that one
    put in between\".\n\n   The name Shim is to refer to the \"little thing something
    that one put\n   in between\".\n\n\t "

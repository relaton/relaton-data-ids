  content: "The main focus of this draft is to incorporate certain level of session\ncontrol
    mechanism within a RTP session. One of the high demands of\ncurrent IP network
    is to provide high performance for instant\nmessaging, push to talk and other
    applications along those lines. For\nall of these kinds of services, it is better
    not to go through the\nout-of-band session control path and control the session
    within RTP\nsession. Here the suggestion is to define an extension of RTCP.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Almost every protocol needs authentication.  However, there does not\nexist
    an authentication mechanism suitable for all organizations, nor\nis it likely
    that a small fixed set of authentication mechanisms will\nremain suitable.  SASL
    [SASL] provides the on-the-wire framework for\nauthentication (and a security
    layer) which separates the design of\nauthentication mechanisms from the protocols
    in which they're used.\nThe SASL protocol model suggests a software architecture
    where\napplication protocols call a generic API to authenticate which in\nturn
    calls a generic plug-in interface for extensible authentication\nmodules.  This
    memo documents the API used in one implementation of\nthis architecture in the
    hope that it will be useful to others.  An\nassociated memo documenting the plug-in
    interface is forthcoming.\n\t "

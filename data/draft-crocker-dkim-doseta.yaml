  content: "DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism that\nenables
    development of a security-related service, such as\nauthentication or encryption,
    with keys based on domain names; the\nname owner can be any actor involved in
    the handling of the data,\nsuch as the author's organization, a server operator
    or one of their\nagents.  The DOSETA Library provides a collection of common\ncapabilities,
    including canonicalization, parameter tagging, and\nretrieval of self-certified
    keys.  The DOSETA Signing Template\naffixes a signature to data that is in a \"header/content\"
    form.\nDefining the meaning of the signature is the responsibility of the\nservice
    that incorporates DOSETA.  The signature is validated through\na cryptographic
    signature and querying the signer's domain directly,\nto retrieve the appropriate
    public key.\n\t "

  content: "   There are many situations where organizations want to protect\n   information
    with robust access control, either for implementation of\n   intellectual property
    right protections, enforcement of information\n   contractual confidentiality
    agreements or because of externally\n   imposed legal regulations.  The Enhanced
    Security Services (ESS) for\n   S/MIME defines an access control mechanism which
    is enforced by the\n   recipients client after decryption of the message. The
    ESS mechanism\n   therefore is dependent on the correct access policy configuration
    of\n   every recipients client. This mechanism also provides full access to\n
    \  the data to all recipients prior to the access control check which is\n   considered
    to be inadequate for due to the difficulty in\n   demonstrating policy compliance.\n\n
    \  This document lays out the deficiencies of the current ESS security\n   label,
    and presents requirements for new model for doing access\n   control to messages
    where the access check is performed prior to\n   message content decryption. This
    new model also does not require\n   policy configuration on the client to simplify
    deployment and\n   compliance verification.\n\n   The proposed model additionally
    provides a method where non-X.509\n   certificate credentials can be used for
    encryption/decryption of\n   S/MIME messages.\n\n\t "

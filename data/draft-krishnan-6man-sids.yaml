  content: "   The data plane for Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) [RFC8754] is\n
    \  built using IPv6 as the underlying forwarding plane.  Due to this\n   underlying
    use of IPv6, Segment Identifiers (SIDs) used by SRv6 can\n   resemble IPv6 addresses
    and behave like them [RFC8754][RFC8986] while\n   exhibiting slightly different
    behaviors in some situations.  This\n   document intends to explore the characteristics
    of SRv6 SIDs and to\n   clarify the relationship of SRv6 SIDs to the IPv6 Addressing\n
    \  Architecture [RFC4291].\n\n\t "

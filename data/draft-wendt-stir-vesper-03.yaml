  content: "   This document formalizes a profile and a framework for the use of\n
    \  delegate certificates and authority tokens to strengthen the\n   association
    between telephone number assignments and the entities\n   that have the authoritative
    right to use them.  It defines a model in\n   which the TNAuthList Authority Token
    serves as a trusted\n   representation of telephone number assignment and right-to-use
    (RTU),\n   anchored by a Notary Agent that logs these associations through\n   verifiable
    transparency mechanisms.  The framework also extends the\n   use of authority
    tokens to support other PASSporT claims like Rich\n   Call Data (RCD) by defining
    a role for JWTClaimConstraint Authority\n   Tokens.  These tokens are issued by
    authoritative or recognized and\n   vetted claim agents within the ecosystem to
    assert information\n   associated with the entity assigned a telephone number.
    \ The Notary\n   Agent plays a critical role in recording these claims and their\n
    \  provenance, enhancing transparency and accountability.  Delegate\n   certificates
    encapsulate and incorporate both the telephone number\n   and associated information
    validated via authority tokens to the\n   certification authority issuing them,
    binding them to the\n   authenticated telephone number of the calling party.  These\n
    \  certificates are published to a certificate transparency log,\n   enabling
    relying parties to independently verify the integrity and\n   legitimacy of number
    use and related claims.  The VESPER (Verifiable\n   STI PERsona) approach utilizes
    STIR protocols and the ACME authority\n   token to formalizing a verifiable, auditable,
    and privacy-conscious\n   foundation for associating telephone numbers with vetted
    entities and\n   validated assertion of associated metadata.\n\n\t "

  content: "   QUIC ([RFC9000]) defines a RESET_STREAM frame to reset a stream.\n
    \  When a sender resets a stream, it stops retransmitting STREAM frames\n   for
    this stream.  On the receiver side, there is no guarantee that\n   any of the
    data sent on that stream is delivered to the application.\n   This document defines
    a new QUIC frame, the RELIABLE_RESET_STREAM\n   frame, that resets a stream, while
    guaranteeing reliable delivery of\n   stream data up to a certain byte offset.\n\n\t "

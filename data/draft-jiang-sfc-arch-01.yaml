  content: "   As network virtualization is opening the gate to much more innovative\n
    \  services for service providers, Service Function Chaining (SFC)\n   provides
    a flexible way of service provisioning and facilitates their\n   deployments.\n\n
    \  This document provides a general abstract architecture for service\n   chaining.
    It is a flexible and scalable architecture which can\n   fulfill requirements
    of SFC. Some solutions based on this\n   architecture are also discussed and compared.
    This architecture can\n   be used as a guideline and also a criterion for the
    design of SFC.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and the Multicast
    Listener Discovery Protocol Version 2 (MLDv2) are protocols that allow a host
    to inform its neighboring routers of its desire to receive IPv4 and IPv6 multicast
    transmissions, respectively.  Source-specific multicast (SSM) is a form of multicast
    in which a receiver is required to specify both the network-layer address of the
    source and the multicast destination address in order to receive the multicast
    transmission.  This document defines the notion of an \"SSM-aware\" router and
    host, and clarifies and (in some cases) modifies the behavior of IGMPv3 and MLDv2
    on SSM-aware routers and hosts to accommodate source-specific multicast.  This
    document updates the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

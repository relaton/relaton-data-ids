  content: "   In a BIDIR-PIM network, data packets could be forwarded from the\n
    \  source to the RP and then get dropped there because there is no\n   receiver
    on the other side of the distribution tree.  This document\n   specifies a way
    to prune the unnecessary traffic with minimum\n   additional states and procedures.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The congestion avoidance processes of transmission capacity sharing\n
    \  TCP flows tend to be synchronized among each other, so that the rate\n   variations
    of the individual flows do not compensate. In contrary,\n   they accumulate into
    large variations of the whole aggregate. The\n   effect is known as global synchronization.
    Large queuing buffer\n   demand and large latency and jitter are the consequences.
    Global\n   Synchronization Protection (GSP) is an extension of regular tail drop\n
    \  packet queuing schemes that prevents global synchronization. For\n   large
    traffic aggregates the de-correlation between the individual\n   flow variations
    reduces buffer demand and packet sojourn time by an\n   order of magnitude and
    more. Even though quite simple, the solution\n   has a theoretical background
    and is not heuristic. It has been tested\n   with a Linux kernel implementation
    and shows equivalent performance\n   as other relevant AQM schemes.\n\n\t "

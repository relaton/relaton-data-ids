abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the deprecation of IPv6 extension headers on
    the Internet with the exception of Encapsulating Security Payload. Deprecation
    is motivated by three factors: 1) the data shows high discard rates for packets
    with extension headers sent over the Internet, 2) extension headers can be used
    for Denial of Service attack and are replete with other security vulnerabilities,
    3) the high loss rates are a disincentive to develop new extension headers or
    options that might be useful or fix known problems. This document recommends that
    extension headers, other than Encapsulating Security Payload, be relegated to
    use only in limited domains and that packets with extension headers should be
    discarded at boundary routers of limited domains.</p>"

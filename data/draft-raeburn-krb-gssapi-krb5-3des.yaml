  content: "The GSSAPI Kerberos 5 mechanism definition [GSSAPI-KRB5] specifically\nenumerates
    encryption and checksum types, independently of how such\nschemes may be used
    in Kerberos.  In the long run, a new Kerberos-\nbased mechanism, which does not
    require separately enumerating for\nthe GSSAPI mechanism each of the various encryption
    types defined by\nKerberos, is probably a better approach.  Various people have\nexpressed
    interest in designing one, but the work has not yet been\ncompleted.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "We propose here a service that would enable nodes located behind one \nor
    several IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling \npackets over UDP;
    we call this the Shipworm service. The \nestablishment of the tunnel is automatic,
    and does not require any \nconfiguration parameters on the client. Running the
    service requires \nthe help of 'Shipworm servers' and 'Shipworm relays'; the Shipworm
    \nservers are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of \nthe traffic
    between Shipworm clients; the Shipworm relays act as \nIPv6 routers between the
    Shipworm service and the 'native' IPv6 \nInternet.\n\n\t "

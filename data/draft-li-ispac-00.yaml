  content: "The introduction of CIDR [1, 2] substantially changed the way that address
    allocation was performed in the Internet.  The result is that address allocation
    is provider-based: the address used by a host depends on which service provider
    is used by the host.  One of the unfortunate implications is that if a host changes
    provider, it must renumber.  In many cases this is awkward, expensive, and difficult.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the changes between Unicode 12.0.0 and\n   Unicode
    17.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008.  Some additions and\n   changes have been made
    in the Unicode Standard that affect the values\n   produced by the algorithm IDNA2008
    specifies.  The review assigns the\n   derived property value \"UNDER REVIEW\"
    to certain code points.  This\n   is added as exceptions to the algorithm for
    IDNA2008 that allows\n   adding exceptions to the algorithm for backward compatibility\n
    \  exceptions.  This document provides the necessary tables to IANA to\n   make
    its database consistent with Unicode 17.0.0.\n\n\t "

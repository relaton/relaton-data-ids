  content: "   Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for\n
    \  network diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public\n   policy.
    \ To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data,\n   either on their
    own initiative or instructed by a measurement\n   controller, and then upload
    the measurement results to a designated\n   measurement server.  This document
    describes a logical architecture\n   and summarizes key requirements for protocols
    to connect the\n   components.  The system is designed to support residential
    and small-\n   enterprise networks, using either wired or wireless networks.  The\n
    \  architecture supports an extensible set of active and passive\n   measurements,
    but the details of the metrics themselves are beyond\n   the scope of this document.\n\n\t "

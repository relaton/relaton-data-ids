  content: "   [RFC0791] defines two IPv4 options called \"Strict Source Routing\"
    and\n   \"Loose Source Routing\".  Functionality provided by these options can\n
    \  be exploited in order to perform remote network discovery, to bypass\n   firewalls
    and to achieve packet amplification for the purposes of\n   generating denial-of-service
    traffic.  This document updates RFC 791\n   to deprecate the use of the IPv4 Strict
    Source Routing Option as well\n   as the IPv4 Loose Source Routing Option.\n\n\t "

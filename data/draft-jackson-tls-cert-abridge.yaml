  content: "   This draft defines a new TLS Certificate Compression scheme which\n
    \  uses a shared dictionary of root and intermediate WebPKI\n   certificates.
    \ The scheme smooths the transition to post-quantum\n   certificates by eliminating
    the root and intermediate certificates\n   from the TLS certificate chain without
    impacting trust negotiation.\n   It also delivers better compression than alternative
    proposals whilst\n   ensuring fair treatment for both CAs and website operators.
    \ It may\n   also be useful in other applications which store certificate chains,\n
    \  e.g.  Certificate Transparency logs.\n\n\t "

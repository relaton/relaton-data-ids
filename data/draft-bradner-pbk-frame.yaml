  content: "This memo considers the need to authenticate the source of a network\ncommunication
    where the actual identity of the source is not\nimportant but it is important
    and that successive messages in the\ncommunication come from the same source.
    \ This memo defines the use\nof specially generated public/private key pairs,
    known as Purpose-\nBuilt Keys (PBKs), to provide this assurance.  This memo is
    not a\nfull specification of a PBK protocol, but rather a model or framework\nfor
    development of PBK in applications\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The current state of the Internet only supports a single class of\n
    \  service.  To further the success of the Internet, new capabilities\n   must
    be deployed which allow for deterministic end to end behavior\n   irrespective
    of location or the number of domains along the path.\n   Experience with existing
    signaling based protocols have proven diffi-\n   cult to deploy due to technical
    and economic factors.  This document\n   proposes using in-band frame marking
    to support a diverse set of ser-\n   vices.  In addition, the mechanisms described
    here will provide end\n   users and/or enterprise backbones with new capabilities
    such as ser-\n   vice validation, congestion localization, and uniform service\n
    \  irrespective of the type of service contract.  For ISPs this document\n   proposes
    mechanisms providing more available bandwidth by creating\n   strong incentives
    for adaptive behavior in applications as well as\n   mechanisms for providing
    both sender based and receiver based service\n   contracts.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This specification indicates circumstances in which the sending of
    am\n   unscheduled TC message by an OLSRv2 router is recommended or required\n
    \  rather than optional.  It is motivated by the possible responsive use\n   of
    OLSRv2 in a mostly stable network.  The cases in which the message\n   sending
    would be required are limited to such cases, and would\n   require administrative
    configuration to establish such a network.\n\n   This specification updates RFC
    7181 \"The Optimized Link State Routing\n   Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)\".\n\n\t "

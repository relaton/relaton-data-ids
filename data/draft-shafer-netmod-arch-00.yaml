  content: "NETCONF and YANG are pieces of an ambitious plan to improve network\nmanagement.
    \ NETCONF gives access to native capabilities of the\ndevices within a network,
    defining methods for manipulating\nconfiguration databases, retrieving operational
    data, and invoking\nspecific operations.  YANG provides the means to define the
    content\ntrafficked via NETCONF, both data and operations.  Using both\ntechnologies,
    the standards modules can be defined to give\ninteroperability and commonality
    to devices, while still allowing\ndevices to express their unique capabilities.\n\nThis
    document describes how NETCONF and YANG help build network\nmanagement applications
    that meet the needs of network services\nproviders.  An architecture is described
    which is friendly to both\ndevices and applications, to vendors and standards
    bodies, to young\nand to old, to red states and to blue states.  It's a startling\nvision,
    coming to networks near you starting August, 2009.\n\t "

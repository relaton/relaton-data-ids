  script: Latn
  content: "The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\n
    \  protocols intentionally separate the handling of prefixes for their\n   purposes:
    these prefixes can be different for the same link even if\n   it may be uncommon
    in practice; validation for these purposes is\n   expected to be performed separately
    and independently.  Despite the\n   revised text of the latest versions of these
    protocol specifications,\n   it appears that the idea of this separation can still
    be easily\n   misunderstood.  This document clarifies the idea even more explicitly\n
    \  in order to set the common understanding of the intent of the current\n   specifications.\n\t "

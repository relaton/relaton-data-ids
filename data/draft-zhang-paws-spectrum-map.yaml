  content: "       White space allocation and reutilization has attracted increasing\n
    \      attention since they allow a more efficient way to gather spectrum\n       usage
    information and keep assigning a proper spectrum to a\n       secondary user.
    This document provides an extended protocol to\n       construct a specific white
    space usage map with better interaction\n       between devices and spectrum database.
    By this mechanism, the Master\n       device or Slave Device sends the environmental
    spectrum to the\n       Database and obtains more frequency points to select the
    most\n       appropriate white space spectrum it could use in the local\n       regulatory
    domain. With regard to White Space Database, more white\n       space information
    can be recorded for devices to choose. The\n       mechanism is an extension of
    protocol to access spectrum database.\n       We develop extended protocol data
    models under different scenarios\n       to enhance interaction of these networks.\n\n\t "

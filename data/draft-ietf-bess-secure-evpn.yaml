  content: "   The applications of EVPN-based solutions (BGP MPLS-based Ethernet VPN\n
    \  and Network Virtualization Overlay Solution using EVPN) have become\n   pervasive
    in Data Center, Service Provider, and Enterprise segments.\n   It is being used
    for fabric overlays and inter-site connectivity in\n   the Data Center market
    segment, for Layer-2, Layer-3, and IRB VPN\n   services in the Service Provider
    market segment, and for fabric\n   overlay and WAN connectivity in Enterprise
    networks.  For Data Center\n   and Enterprise applications, there is a need to
    provide inter-site\n   and WAN connectivity over public Internet in a secured
    manner with\n   same level of privacy, integrity, and authentication for tenant's\n
    \  traffic as IPsec tunneling using IKEv2.  This document presents a\n   solution
    where BGP point-to-multipoint signaling is leveraged for key\n   and policy exchange
    among PE devices to create private pair-wise\n   IPsec Security Associations without
    IKEv2 point-to-point signaling or\n   any other direct peer-to-peer session establishment
    messages.\n\n\t "

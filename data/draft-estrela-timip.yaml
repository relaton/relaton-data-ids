  content: "All IP mobility protocols currently proposed on the IETF assume that \nthe
    mobile nodes always have a mobility-aware IP stack, which is \nstill a scenario
    that can seldom be found nowadays. Most terminals, \nincluding the laptops and
    PDAs which most would benefit of the \nmobility support, still use legacy IP stacks,
    limiting their use to \nlayer-2 mobility within a single IP subnet.  \nThis document
    presents Terminal Independent Mobile IP (TIMIP), which \nsupports IP micro-mobility
    of all possible existing legacy IP \nterminals, while fully interoperating with
    Mobile IP to provide \nmacromobility across IP subnets for all terminals. \n\n\t "

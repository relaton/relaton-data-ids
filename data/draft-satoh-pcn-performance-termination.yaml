  content: "Pre-congestion notification (PCN) gives information to support\nadmission
    control and flow termination in order to protect the\nquality of service (QoS)
    of inelastic flows.  [I-D.taylor-cl-edge-\nbehaviour] describes one boundary node
    behaviours for three-state\nmeasurement-based load control, known informally as
    CL [I-D.briscoe-\ntsvwg-cl-phb].  In [I-D.taylor-cl-edge-behaviour], flow termination\nis
    required if excess-traffic-marked packets were observed and the\nend of one measurement
    period MUST be the beginning of the next one,\nindependently of current flow conditions.
    \ According to this\ntermination, PCN-flows in some ingress-egress (IE) pairs
    may be\nterminated during measurement period of other IE pairs unless round-\ntrip
    times (RTT) of all the IE pairs are the same.  We illustrate\nthat this can lead
    to over-termination.  Our simulation confirms that\naccuracy of termination is
    improved when no PCN-flows in some IE\npairs are terminated during measurement
    period of other IE pairs.\n\t "

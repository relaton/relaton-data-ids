  content: "    Several algorithms have been proposed to deal with the multicast key
    \nmanagement problem. An efficient multicast key management in the case of \nlarge
    dynamic group with preplanned eviction is MARKS in which one \nreceiver's join
    or preplanned leave has no side effect on other \nreceivers. However, there is
    no effective mechanism in MARKS to expel a \nmalicious member dynamically. An
    improved MARKS in which a malicious \nmember can be expelled scalablely by rekeying
    an intermediate key is \nintroduced. And a two-layer Logical Key Tree based on
    coincident leave \ntime (called TR-LKH) which is used to maintain the intermediate
    key is \nproposed here. The described approach has outstanding performance in
    \nterms of scalability, where one member's join or preplanned leave has no \nside
    effect on other members, furthermore, the number of rekeying \nmessages needed
    to expel a member depends little on the group size. \n\n\n\t "

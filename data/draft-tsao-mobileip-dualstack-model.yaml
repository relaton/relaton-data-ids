  content: "To support IP mobility, mobile IPv4 was designed for IPv4 network \nand
    the mobility extension for IPv6 has been also drafted. However, \nmobile IPv4
    and mobile IPv6 are not compatible to each other so \nthat a mobile IPv4 host
    can not function properly while it changes \nits point of attachment to IPv6 networks
    and vice versa. The \ndocument specifies an architecture and mechanisms to solve
    mobility \nproblems in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks. The solution \npresents
    a dual stack model that implements a new address mapper \non mobile hosts. The
    address mapper on a mobile host associates the \nhome address in one protocol
    such as IPv4 with a care-of-address \nin the other protocol, i.e. IPv6. It dispatches
    IPv4/IPv6 packets \nto proper layers of the protocol stack, and provides transparent
    \nservices to upper layers regardless of the attached networks. \nTherefore, the
    new architecture facilitates the mobility of hosts \nin IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected
    networks.\n\t "

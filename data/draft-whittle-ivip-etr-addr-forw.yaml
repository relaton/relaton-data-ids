  content: "ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) is a novel method by which an IPv4 Core-\nEdge
    Separation solution to the Internet's routing scaling problem\ncan tunnel packets
    from an ITR to an ETR.  EAF involves using 31 bits\nof the IPv4 header for new
    purposes: bit 48, the More Fragments flag,\nthe Fragment Offset field and the
    Header Checksum field - to carry a\n30 bit ETR address.  Consequently, packets
    in this format need to be\nhandled by routers with upgraded functionality.  EAF
    is an\nalternative to encapsulation and has advantages including: simpler\nITRs
    and ETRs, direct support for conventional RFC 1191 PMTUD, no\nencapsulation overhead
    and full compatibility with IPsec AH and\nTraceroute.  This I-D also briefly explores
    an alternative to this\napproach: a new header, of the same length and different,
    with a\ndifferent 4 bit Version, to carry 31 bits of ETR address.\n\t "

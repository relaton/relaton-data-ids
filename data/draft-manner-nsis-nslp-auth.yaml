  content: "Signaling layer protocols in the NSIS working group may rely on GIST\nto
    handle authorization.  Still, the signaling layer protocol itself\nmay require
    separate authorization to be performed when a node\nreceives a request for a certain
    kind of service or resources.  This\ndraft presents a generic model and object
    formats for session\nauthorization within the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols.
    \ The goal of\nsession authorization is to allow the exchange of information between\nnetwork
    elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a\nservice and to coordinate
    actions between the signaling and transport\nplanes.\n\t "

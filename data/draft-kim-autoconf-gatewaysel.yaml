  content: "   The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a rapidly configurable multi-hop
    \n   wireless network without an infrastructure and originally proposed \n   for
    the military use. In order to make the MANET a more commonly used \n   network
    in our daily lives, it may be necessary to connect the MANET \n   to the global
    Internet. A MANET node can communicate with an Internet \n   node via the Internet
    gateway. To support fault tolerance and \n   increase the bandwidth, multiple
    Internet gateways can be deployed \n   within a MANET and, in this case, the network
    performance can be \n   improved by balancing the load among Internet gateways.
    In this draft, \n   we propose load-balancing Internet gateway selection mechanisms
    for \n   the MANET with multiple stationary Internet gateways. In addition to
    \n   this, we propose a scheme that reduces the routing control message \n   overhead
    in the MANET when a MANET node sets up the route to Internet \n   gateway using
    global address. \n\n\t "

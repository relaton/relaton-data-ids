  content: "Exchange of routing information between IPsec security gateways, \nusing
    standard routing protocols across IPsec tunnels, can be a \nstraightforward operation.
    Using the routing information to choose \nthe proper path is also straightforward,
    when routing is \nfunctionally separated from the IPsec gateway operation. One
    of the \nmost significant obstacles to widespread implementation of dynamic \nrouting
    in IPsec VPNs has been agreement on a way to exchange and \nuse the routing information.
    This document describes a simple and \nsecure method of exchanging dynamic routing
    information between \nIPsec security gateways, using standard IPsec messages.
    This method \nis currently in use in a large number of installations, and has
    been \ndemonstrated to be interoperable across several IPsec \nimplementations
    from different vendors.\n\t "

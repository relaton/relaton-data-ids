  content: "   This document defines an extension to the Location to Service\n   Translation
    (LoST) protocol (RFC5222) that allows planned changes to\n   the data to be handled
    smoothly.  This extension is only useful with\n   the validation function of LoST.
    \ It is beneficial for LoST\n   validation clients to be aware of planned changes,
    as records that\n   previously were valid may become invalid at a known future
    date, and\n   new locations may become valid after the date.  This extension adds\n
    \  an element to the <findService> request: a date that allows the LoST\n   client
    to request that the server perform validation as of the date\n   specified.  It
    adds an optional Time-To-Live element to the response,\n   which informs clients
    of the current expected lifetime of a\n   validation.  It also adds a separate
    interface to the LoST server\n   that allows a client to poll for planned changes.
    \ Additionally, this\n   document provides a conventional XML schema for LoST,
    as a backwards\n   compatible alternative to the RelaxNG schema in RFC5222.\n\n\t "

  content: "The purpose of this document is twofold.  First, it describes various
    alternatives for exchanging inter-domain routing information across domain boundaries,
    where one of the peering domain is CIDR-capable and another is not.  Second, it
    addresses the implications of running CIDR- capable inter-domain routing protocols
    (e.g., BGP-4, IDRP) on intra- domain routing.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.\n\t "

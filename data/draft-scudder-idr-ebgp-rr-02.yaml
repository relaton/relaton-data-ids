  content: "   Although originally conceived of as a purely IBGP device, in some\n
    \  cases a route reflector may function as an EBGP speaker in addition\n   to
    its role as envisioned in RFC 4456.  When it does so, just like\n   any other
    EBGP speaker it must advertise its routes to its IBGP\n   peers.  This document
    updates RFC 4456 by explaining what behavior is\n   required of a route reflector
    that also functions as an EBGP speaker.\n   It also clarifies the use of the ORIGINATOR_ID
    and CLUSTER_LIST\n   attributes in this environment.\n\n\t "

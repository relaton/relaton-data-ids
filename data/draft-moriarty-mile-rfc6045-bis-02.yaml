  content: "   This document moves Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) [RFC6045]\n
    \  to Historic status as it provides minor updates.  Security incidents,\n   such
    as system compromises, worms, viruses, phishing incidents, and\n   denial of service,
    typically result in the loss of service, data, and\n   resources both human and
    system.  Service providers and Computer\n   Security Incident Response Teams need
    to be equipped and ready to\n   assist in communicating and tracing security incidents
    with tools and\n   procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack.  Real-time\n
    \  Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network\n   communication
    method to facilitate sharing incident handling data\n   while integrating existing
    detection, tracing, source identification,\n   and mitigation mechanisms for a
    complete incident handling solution.\n   Combining these capabilities in a communication
    system provides a way\n   to achieve higher security levels on networks.  Policy
    guidelines for\n   handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by
    a\n   consortium using the security recommendations and considerations.\n\n\t "

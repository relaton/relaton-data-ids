  content: "This draft present an alternative to NXT records, used to achieve\nauthenticated
    denial of existence of a domain name, class and type. \nProblems with NXT records,
    as specified in RFC 2535, are identified.\nOne solution, the NO record, is presented.\nThe
    NO record differ from the NXT record by using a cryptographic\nhash value instead
    of the domain name.  This prevent an adversery\nfrom collecting information by
    'chaining' through a zone.  It also\nremove delegation point concerns in NXT records.
    \ The document also\ndescribe hash truncation and record merging that reduces\nstorage/network
    load.\n\t "

  content: "The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows
    a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  IMAP4rev1
    permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally
    equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline
    client to resynchronize with the server.  IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating,
    deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing
    messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching,
    and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages
    in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.  These numbers are either message
    sequence numbers or unique identifiers.  IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A
    mechanism for accessing configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1
    servers is discussed in RFC 2244.  IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting
    mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "Every year the IETF's Nominating Committee (Nomcom) reviews and\n   selects
    half of the IETF's leadership on the IESG, IAB and IAOC/\n   Trust.  In the 18
    years since the inception of the Nomcom process,\n   the Internet industry and
    the IETF have gone through many changes in\n   funding, participation and focus,
    but not in the basic formation,\n   structure or operation of Nomcom.  This paper
    explores challenges\n   that have emerged in the conduct of Nomcom activities,
    particularly\n   due to changing IETF demographics.  The paper reviews the nature,\n
    \  causes and consequences of these challenges, and proposes a number of\n   specific
    changes.  The changes provide better communication of Nomcom\n   institutional
    memory, enhance Nomcom membership expertise, and\n   produce stronger confidentiality
    and etiquette practices among Nomcom\n   participants.  Some changes require formal
    modification to Nomcom\n   rules; others can be adopted immediately.\n\t "

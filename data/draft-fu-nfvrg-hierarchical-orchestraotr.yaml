  content: "   This document discusses about the framework of Orchestrator in the\n
    \  NFV deployment.  A hierarchical framework of Orchestrator is then\n   proposed.
    \ Such framework is very important for large scale NFV\n   deployment in Operator
    networks, since multi-site of NFV deployment\n   and management should be considered.
    \ This draft will further discuss\n   the responsibilities of the multi-layers
    of the Orchestrator and the\n   interfaces between them.\n\n\t "

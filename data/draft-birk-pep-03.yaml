  content: "   The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) protocols describe a set of conventions\n
    \  for the automation of operations traditionally seen as barriers to\n   the
    use and deployment of secure end-to-end interpersonal messaging.\n   These include,
    but are not limited to, key management, key discovery,\n   and private key handling
    (including peer-to-peer synchronization of\n   private keys and other user data
    across devices). pEp also introduces\n   means to verify communication peers and
    proposes a trust-rating\n   system to denote secure types of communications and
    signal the\n   privacy level available on a per-user and per-message level.\n
    \  Significantly, the pEp protocols build on already available security\n   formats
    and message transports (e.g., PGP/MIME), and are written with\n   the intent to
    be interoperable with already widely-deployed systems\n   in order to facilitate
    and ease adoption and implementation.  This\n   document outlines the general
    design choices and principles of pEp.\n\n\t "

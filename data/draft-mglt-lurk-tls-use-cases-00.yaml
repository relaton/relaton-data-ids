  content: "   TLS as been designed to setup and authenticate transport layer\n   between
    endpoints.\n\n   A lot of applications are using TLS in order to set communications\n
    \  between the applications end points.\n\n   As long as applications end points
    and transport end points were\n   combined into the same host, application authentication
    could be\n   combined with the transport authentication.\n\n   As the current
    internet is decoupling the transport and application\n   layers, such model may
    not be applicable anymore.  In other words,\n   TLS authentication cannot be handled
    on behalf of the application\n   authentication.\n\n   This document describes
    use cases where the authentication of the\n   transport layer differs from the
    authentication performed at the\n   application layer.\n\n\t "

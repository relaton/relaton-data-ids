abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In this draft, we address to potential adapt authorization frameworks\n
    \  for the future AI agent.  An extension is proposed in the OAuth 2.0\n   protocol
    with an optional field *target_id* for granular\n   authorization.  It can be
    seen useful for the future virtual/physical\n   AI agents.  By explicitly identifying
    the target during\n   authorization, the draft aims to support precise permission\n
    \  management and enhance traceability.  Serveral risks can be mitigated\n   through
    the proposed extension, such as potential unauthorized or\n   malicious behavior
    of AI components in the netowrk, while the\n   compatibility of existing OAuth
    2.0 workflows is still maintained.\n\n\n\t "

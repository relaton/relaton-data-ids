  content: "The Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a technology to separate local\ndesktop
    and remote computing and storage resources, which was\ninitially derived from
    the remote desktop administration but with new\nbusiness models and very different
    use cases.  Most of existing VDI\nsystems are based on proprietary implementation,
    and positioning\ndifferent market with different features.  Since virtual desktop\ntechnology
    is believed that it will become a mainstream application\ndelivery method similar
    to the http protocol with regard to web\napplications, so it's important to make
    the virtual desktop access\nprotocol open and standard.  This draft summarizes
    the limitations of\nexisting virtual desktop systems, and proposes the intent\nstandardization
    work in IETF.\n\t "

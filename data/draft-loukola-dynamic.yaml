  content: "   This document defines a general use Differentiated Services (DS)\n
    \  [Blake] Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) Group called Dynamic RT/NRT (DRT) PHB\n   Group.
    \ This PHB Group provides delivery of real-time and non-real-\n   time IP traffic.
    \ DRT introduces two independently forwarded classes:\n   a real-time (RT) class,
    and a non-real-time (NRT) class.  Within each\n   class an IP packet can be assigned
    one of six different levels of\n   drop precedence.  These levels have a relative
    order so that a single\n   service (RT / NRT) is formed inside which the packet
    loss of lower\n   levels does not have any significant effect on upper levels.
    \ This\n   concept introduces dynamic RT and NRT services that allow the user
    to\n   dynamically adjust the packet loss probability in response to the\n   varying
    network load.  A DS node does not re-order IP packets of the\n   same microflow
    if they belong to the same DRT class.  Recommended\n   codepoints for this PHB
    Group are given.\n\n\t "

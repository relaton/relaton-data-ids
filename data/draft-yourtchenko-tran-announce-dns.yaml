  content: "While TCP has enjoyed many enhancements over the decades, it is\nuseful
    to allow applications to use new transports, such as SCTP.  It\nis inefficient
    to naively probe the server using the new transport\nprotocol.  This document
    proposes a new DNS resource record which\nprovides an efficient way to query which
    protocols are supported by a\nserver.  The presence of this record will allow
    the client to avoid\nthe excessive probing.\n\t "

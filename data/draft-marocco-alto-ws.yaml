- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is\n   designed
    to allow entities with knowledge about the network\n   infrastructure to export
    such information to applications that need\n   to choose one or more endpoints
    to connect to among large sets of\n   logically equivalent ones.  The base protocol
    specification adopts a\n   simple pull-based model, according to which the client
    retrieves the\n   information encoded as JSON objects over HTTP directly from
    the\n   server.\n\n   This document proposes (for discussion) a mechanism for
    providing\n   server-initiated information update notifications through a\n   WebSocket-based
    ALTO protocol extension that easily integrates in the\n   basic protocol model.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Flexible Algorithm is a solution that allows some routing protocols\n
    \  (e.g., OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user-\n   defined
    (and hence, flexible) constraints and metrics.  The\n   computation is performed
    by routers participating in the specific\n   network in a distributed manner using
    a Flexible Algorithm\n   Definition.  This Definition is provisioned on one or
    more routers\n   and propagated through the network by OSPF and IS-IS flooding.\n\n
    \  BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection of various topology\n   information
    from the network.  RFC9351 introduced BGP-LS support for\n   the advertisement
    of Flexible Algorithm Definition as a part of the\n   topology information from
    the network.  This document specifies the\n   advertisement of further Flexible
    Algorithm related extensions in\n   BGP-LS.\n\n\t "

  content: "Many domain registries, especially sponsored TLDs and ccTLDs, have\nspecific
    policy that calls for the server to perform additional\nbackend processing before
    it completes a transform operation on an\nobject requested by a client. When the
    pending action is completed,\nthe server must notify the client about the outcome.
    However, current\nEPP core specifications do not address the notification messaging
    in\na generic way.  As a result, a registry has to resort to defining a\nnew schema
    as extension to the object mapping concerned for this\npurpose.\nInspired by recent
    discussions on the 'ietf-provreg' mailing list on\nrelated topics, this draft
    presents a strawman proposal for uniform\ntreatment of server notification for
    pending action in the base EPP\nprotocol. A new OPTIONAL child element is added
    to <poll> response as\nbasic notification content, which consists of the transaction
    ID that\ntriggered the pending action and the outcome of the pending action.\nIn
    addition, object specific data and extension information can be\npiggybacked in
    existing child elements of <response>.  The required\nmodification to the EPP
    base protocol is kept to the minimum and\nincurs no change to the EPP base object
    mappings. Most importantly,\nthe proposed solution is applicable to any object
    mapping, ensuring\nEPP's extensibility beyond domain registry applications.\nStrong
    interests by the registry community in deploying this feature\nwarrant that it
    be best handled as a generic but optional feature in\nthe EPP base protocol. This
    allows any registry to handle pending\naction without the need to define a new
    schema, eliminating the\nproliferation of ad hoc object extensions repetitively
    defined by\ndisparate registries for the very same purpose.\n\n\n\t "

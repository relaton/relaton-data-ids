  content: "Today, the wireless network arena is made up of different types of\naccess
    (TDMA, CDMA, GSM, etc) and core network technologies (IS-41\nand MAP over SS7,
    etc). The heterogeneous nature of today's\nwireless and wireline packet data networks
    limits the scope of\nmobility between these heterogeneous networks. However, as
    these\nheterogeneous networks evolve, the mobility management provided by\nthem
    must evolve to ensure seamless roaming between the networks.\nWith the convergence
    of voice and data, networks of the future will\nbe built on IP packet switched
    technology, mostly due to inherent\nadvantages offered by the technology.\nThis
    document identifies several drivers that provide input for an\nIP Mobility based
    network and also describes a high level IP\nMobility architecture that extends
    the current third generation\nIMT2000 wireless architecture and builds on Mobile
    IP concepts.\n\t "

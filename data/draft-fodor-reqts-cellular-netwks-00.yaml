  content: "We consider access technology agnostic applications that use IP level\nQoS
    primitives to specify their QoS requirements. In future wireless\nsystems (beyond
    what is often referred to as 3G), where mobile nodes\nmay access an IP backbone
    over diverse access networks, the IP level\nQoS primitives are not only used to
    specify the requested IP level\nservice, but also (through an access specific
    translation function)\nto help the mobile node's wireless link manager to configure
    the\nwireless bearer service. In such a scenario, the IP level QoS\nprimitives
    must meet special requirements in order to support the\nspectrum efficient management
    of the wireless resources.\n\t "

  content: "When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send a\nrequest,
    they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral\nport. The SIP protocol
    includes mechanisms which insure that\nresponses to a request, and new requests
    sent in the original\ndirection reuse an existing connection.  However, new requests
    sent\nin the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existing\nconnection.
    \ This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use one\nconnection for requests
    sent in each direction, and can result in\npotential scaling and performance problems.
    \ This document proposes\nrequirements and a mechanism which address this deficiency.\n\t "

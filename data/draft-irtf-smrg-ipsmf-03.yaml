- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The guiding principles in the design of IP network management were \nsimplicity
    and no centralized control.  The best effort service \nparadigm was a result of
    the original management principles and the \nother way around.  New methods to
    distinguish the service given to \none set of packets or flows relative to another
    are well underway. \nHowever, as IP networks evolve the management approach of
    the past \nmay not apply to the QoS-capable network envisioned by some for the
    \nfuture.  We examine some of the areas of impact that QoS is likely \nto have
    on management and look at some questions that remain to be \naddressed.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a policy and accounting information exchange\n
    \  mechanism between a DIAMETER policy server and a SIP proxy server.\n   A DIAMETER
    server is responsible for maintaining a user policy and\n   accounting database
    and a means to update it.  A SIP proxy server\n   needs to contact a DIAMETER
    server during multimedia session setup\n   and teardown time to perform admission
    control and accounting tasks.\n \n   To provide proper data-forwarding level service
    guarantees to the SIP\n   sessions, the DIAMETER servers are also responsible
    for interfacing\n   with the network resource management database.  However, this
    is\n   beyond the scope of this document.\n \n   The objectives of the proposed
    DIAMETER extension are 1) providing\n   accurate accounting information, 2) flexible
    and 3) simple to\n   implement.  The protocol does not make any assumption about
    policy\n   and billing algorithms at DIAMETER servers.\n\n\t "

  content: "Point-to-point Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized  \nMPLS
    (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs)      \nmay be established
    using signaling techniques, but their paths may   \nfirst be determined.  The
    Path Computation Element (PCE) has been    \nidentified as an appropriate technology
    for the determination of the \npaths of P2MP TE LSPs.                                               \n\nThis
    document describes extensions to the PCE Communication Protocol PCEP) to handle
    requests and responses for the computation of paths for P2MP TE LSPs.\n\t "

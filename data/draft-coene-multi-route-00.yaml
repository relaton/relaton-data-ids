  content: "This document describes a way to loadshare the different paths of a\nmultihomed
    SCTP association at the same moment while keeping\ncongestion control per path.
    \ The document also describes a possible\nsolution to multihoming which would
    require no routing tables on the\nhost and which would try to guarantee non-overlapping
    multihomed\npaths. It could possibly reduce the growth of the routing table in
    a\nrouter. The selection of which link to take would be a local\none. The solution
    is similar to the use of links and linksets within\na routeset in SS7.\n\t "

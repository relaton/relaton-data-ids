  content: "This note describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start for\nuse
    with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  For TCP\nconnections that
    are able to use congestion windows of thousands (or\ntens of thousands) of MSS-sized
    segments (for MSS the sender's\nMAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start
    procedure can result in\nincreasing the congestion window by thousands of segments
    in a single\nround-trip time.  Such an increase can easily result in thousands
    of\npackets being dropped in one round-trip time.  This is often counter-\nproductive
    for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard on the rest of\nthe traffic sharing
    the congested link.  This note describes Limited\nSlow-Start as an optional mechanism
    for limiting the number of\nsegments by which the congestion window is increased
    for one window\nof data during slow-start, in order to improve performance for
    TCP\nconnections with large congestion windows.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a novel communication approach which reasons\n
    \  about WHAT is being communicated (and invoked) instead of WHO is\n   communicating.
    \ Such approach is meant to transition away from\n   locator-based addressing
    (and thus routing and forwarding) to an\n   addressing scheme where the address
    semantics relate to services\n   being invoked (e.g., for computational processes,
    and their generated\n   information requests and responses).\n\n   The document
    introduces Routing on Service Addresses (ROSA), as a\n   realization of what is
    referred to as 'service-based routing' (SBR),\n   to replace the usual DNS+IP
    sequence, i.e., the off-path discovery of\n   a service name to an IP locator
    mapping, through an on-path discovery\n   with in-band data transfer to a suitable
    service instance location\n   for a selected set of services, not all Internet-based
    services.\n\n   SBR is designed to be constrained by service-specific parameters
    that\n   go beyond load and latency, as in today's best effort or traffic\n   engineering
    based routing, leading to an approach to steer traffic in\n   a service-specific
    constraint-based manner.\n\n   Particularly, this document outlines sample ROSA
    use case scenarios,\n   requirements for its design, and the ROSA system design
    itself.\n\n\t "

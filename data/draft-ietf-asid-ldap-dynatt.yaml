  content: "   This document defines dynamic attributes and the fashion in which they\n
    \  are being set and used on entries in the directory.  This document\n   builds
    heavily on the dynamic extensions to LDAP infrastructure as\n   defined in [1].\n
    \n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [2] supports\n   lightweight
    access to static directory services, allowing relatively\n   fast search and update
    access.  Static directory services store\n   information about people that persists
    in its accuracy and value over\n   a long period of time.\n\n   The dynamic extension
    to LDAP as defined in [1] added the concept of\n   dynamic entries that only persist
    in the directory, when they are\n   periodically refreshed.  This document takes
    this approach one step\n   farther and defines how dynamic attributes can be used,
    on either\n   static or dynamic entries, to handle up-to-date and dynamic\n   information
    about an entry in the directory.  An example use will be a\n   client or a person
    that has a static entry in the directory and\n   sometimes goes online, which
    is reflected in the 'online' attribute\n   for the entry.  To specify whether
    this person is online or offline -\n   an attribute that changes frequently, a
    client application will have\n   to modify this attribute relatively frequently.
    \ The current location\n   of a person is another attribute that may change frequently.\n
    \n   Dynamic attributes must be periodically refreshed.  Otherwise, they\n   will
    disappear from the directory over time.\n\n\n\t "

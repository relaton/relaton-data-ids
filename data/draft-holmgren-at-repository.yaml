  content: "   This document specifies the repository and synchronization semantics\n
    \  for Authenticated Transfer (AT), a protocol for cryptographically-\n   verifiable
    storage and distribution of structured user-controlled\n   data.  It defines the
    AT repository that serves as the fundamental\n   data storage model.  It further
    specifies synchronization mechanisms\n   that allow efficient distribution of
    repository changes to interested\n   parties.\n\n   This document specifically
    deals with the repository and sync\n   protocol.  Overall network architecture
    is described further in\n   [AT-ARCH].\n\n\t "

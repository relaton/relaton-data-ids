abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the repository and synchronization semantics
    for Authenticated Transfer (AT), a protocol for cryptographically- verifiable
    storage and distribution of structured user-controlled data. It defines the AT
    repository that serves as the fundamental data storage model. It further specifies
    synchronization mechanisms that allow efficient distribution of repository changes
    to interested parties. This document specifically deals with the repository and
    sync protocol. Overall network architecture is described further in [AT-ARCH].</p>"

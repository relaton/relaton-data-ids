  content: "   This memo presents a method for allowing an HTTP server to provide\n
    \  hints in its HTTP responses to a user-agent that indicate the user\n   could
    be better off connecting to a different IP than what they are\n   currently connected
    to.  This is highly relevant in a multi-homed\n   server world where DNS may not
    have all of the relevant state\n   necessary to make a proper routing decision.
    \ Additionally it is done\n   in a manner that does not require application level
    changes as could\n   be the case for an application level redirect such as a 3xx
    response\n\n\t "

  content: "The provider provisioned VPN solutions has attracted a great deal\nof
    interest. Memos proposing different and overlapping solution\nhave been discussed
    on the PPVPN mailing list and in the Working\nGroup meetings. This has lead to
    a development of a partly new\nset of concepts used to describe the set of VPN
    services. To a\ncertain extent there are more than one term covering the same\nconcept
    and sometimes the same term covers more than on concept.\nThe terminology needs
    to be made clearer and more intuitive. This\ndocument seeks to fill at least part
    of that need.\n\t "

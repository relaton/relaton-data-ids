  content: "   The MPLS Network Action (MNA) framework provides a general mechanism\n
    \  for the encoding and processing of network actions and their data.\n   This
    document introduces a network action to the MPLS Network Action\n   (MNA) framework
    for stack management operations including MOVE-N-LSE\n   and POP-N-LSE.  The MOVE-N-LSE
    operation elevates a specified number\n   of LSEs within the stack and the POP-N-LSE
    operation removes a\n   specified number of LSEs.  The stack management operations
    can be\n   used to facilitate various applications.  As an example, a mechanism\n
    \  called HBH preservation which reduces the readable label depth (RLD)\n   requirement
    in nodes is presented.\n\n\t "

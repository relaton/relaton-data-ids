  content: "   Group communication for CoAP can be secured using Group Object\n   Security
    for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE).  A\n   Group Manager is responsible
    to handle the joining of new group\n   members, as well as to manage and distribute
    the group key material.\n   This document defines a RESTful admin interface at
    the Group Manager,\n   that allows an Administrator entity to create and delete
    OSCORE\n   groups, as well as to retrieve and update their configuration.  The\n
    \  ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization is used to enforce\n   authentication
    and authorization of the Administrator at the Group\n   Manager.  Protocol-specific
    transport profiles of ACE are used to\n   achieve communication security, proof-of-possession
    and server\n   authentication.\n\n\t "

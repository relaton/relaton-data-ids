  content: "This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Networks.  This document
    addresses the security aspects that are relevant in the context of MPLS and GMPLS.
    \ It describes the security threats, the related defensive techniques, and the
    mechanisms for detection and reporting.  This document emphasizes RSVP-TE and
    LDP security considerations, as well as inter-AS and inter-provider security considerations
    for building and maintaining MPLS and GMPLS networks across different domains
    or different Service Providers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

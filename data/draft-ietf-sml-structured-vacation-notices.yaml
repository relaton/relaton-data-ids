  content: "   This document describes a machine-readable format for conveying\n   unavailibility
    information in email messages.  This includes\n   \"vacation notices\" of persons
    but also different forms of\n   unavailibility for emails sent by programs.\n\n
    \  Structured vacation notices are supposed to be used in conjunction\n   with
    conventional, human-readable vacation notices in most cases.\n   They are based
    on the forthcoming \"structured email\" specification\n   defined in [I-D.ietf-sml-structured-email-03]
    and related drafts.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver
    a\n   Layer 2 Provider Provisioned VPN service.  These services include\n   Virtual
    Private Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN service\n   (VPLS).  This
    model is intended to be instantiated at management\n   system to deliver the L2VPN
    service, and is not a configuration model\n   to be used directly on network elements.\n\n
    \  This model provides an abstracted view of the Layer 2 VPN service\n   configuration
    components.  It will be up to a management\n   system(orchestrator) to take this
    as an input and use specific\n   configurations models to configure the different
    network elements to\n   deliver the service.  It is called as north bound L2VPN
    Service YANG\n   data model.  How configuration of network elements is out of
    scope of\n   the document, and is defined in document[I-D.shah-bess-l2vpn-yang].\n\n\t "

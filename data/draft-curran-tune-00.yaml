- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memo proposes a strategy for providing TCP and UDP services over
    _multiple_ network services in a manner compatible with existing TCP/IP applications.
    By introducing network-independent endpoint identifiers for transport entities,
    TUNE makes it possible to change network addresses (and potentially network protocols)
    without impact to the application layer.  While this paper describes the use of
    Connection-Less Network Protocol [1] as a possible long-term network service for
    the Internet, the overall approach differs from the 'TCP & UDP with Bigger Addresses'
    [2] initiative due to the addition of network-independent endpoint identifiers.
    \ TUNE also provides network layer programming interfaces which are unchanged
    from those of the current Internet Protocol (IP) suite and hence alleviate the
    need for application code changes during initial deployment.                                                                Comments
    should be sent to the author (jcurran@nic.near.net).\n\t "

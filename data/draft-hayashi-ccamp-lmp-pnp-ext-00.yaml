  content: "Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane \n   (c-plane)
    is expected to reduce operational expenditure (OPEX). \n   Currently we need to,
    however, manually configure interface \n   addresses of links before we advertise
    the link-state using a \n   GMPLS routing protocol for an automatic topology discovery
    \n   mechanism. Especially in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) \n   networks,
    there are a number of optical fibers between neighbor \n   nodes, each of which
    again carries a bunch of wavelength links. It \n   is a tedious task to configure
    interface addresses of wavelength \n   links between neighbor nodes.\n\n   In
    order to suppress the tasks of configuring addresses of \n   wavelength links
    between neighbor nodes, an optical plug and play \n   (PnP) technique is effective.
    Optical PnP includes automatic \n   assignment of interface addresses, parameter
    information exchange \n   between neighbor nodes, database construction, and so
    on.\n\n   This document assumes to use extended version of LMP (link \n   management
    protocol) for information exchange and describes LMP \n   extension necessary
    for applying to the optical PnP.\n\t "

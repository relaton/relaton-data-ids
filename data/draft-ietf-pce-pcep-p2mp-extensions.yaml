  content: "Point-to-point Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may be established
    using signaling techniques, but their paths may first need to be determined. The
    Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate technology
    for the determination of the paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs.\n\n
    This document describes extensions to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) to
    handle requests and responses for the computation of paths for P2MP TE LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

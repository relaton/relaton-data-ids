  content: "   When a standard Mobile IP node (MN) changes its wireless network \n
    \  attachment point (performs a handover), it gets new IP layer \n   configuration
    information (a new network prefix and address of a new \n   default gateway) from
    a new access router and tries to know whether \n   it has moved to other subnet.
    If it has, it changes its IP layer  \n   configuration. During such a handover
    process,it cannot send and  \n   receive IP packets from its corresponding node(CN),
    so a service \n   disruption is caused. In this document, we introduce new DHCP
    \n   options. With them, DHCP servers can send new information before a  \n   handover
    to be used after the handover, and MNscan reduce handover   \n   process time.\n\t "

  content: "This document presents an ISAKMP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for \nsecure
    group communications.  The 'GDOI,' or 'Group ISAKMP,' borrows \ndefinitions from
    GSAKMP [HH], incorporates the Phase 1 SA of the \nInternet DOI [RFC2407, RFC2409],
    and proposes new payloads and \nexchanges according to the ISAKMP standard [RFC2408,
    p.14].  Group \nISAKMP manages group security associations, which are used by
    security \nprotocols running at the IP [RFC2406] or application layers [AMESP].
    \ \nThese security associations protect one or more key-encrypting keys, \ntraffic-encrypting
    keys, or data shared by group members.\n\nComments on this document should be
    addressed to smug@cs.umass.edu.\n\t "

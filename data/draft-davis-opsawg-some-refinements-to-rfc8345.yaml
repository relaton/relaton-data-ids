- language: en

  content: "   This draft provides a brief analysis of the current unidirectional\n
    \  point-to-point approach to modeling of the link in RFC8345,\n   highlights
    why this is not sufficient and makes a proposal to enhance\n   RFC8345 YANG to
    support multipoint uni/bi links.  The two alternative\n   enhancement approaches
    proposed are backward compatible.  The\n   enhancement is such that it provides
    a uniform solution to modeling\n   all links that could, over time, replace the
    current unidirectional\n   point-to-point approach.  The rationale for the change
    is based on\n   many years of practical experience, including challenges using\n
    \  RFC8345 in actual solution development, and insight gained through\n   other
    standardisation efforts and deployments.\n\n\t "

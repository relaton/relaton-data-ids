  content: "This document defines a mechanism to route RFC 822 using the OSI Directory.
    \ The basic mechanisms are being developed for routing X.400.  These offer a number
    of benefits relative to the the current mechanisms available for RFC 822 routing.
    \ The prime goal of this specification is to provide integrated routing management
    for sites using both RFC 822 and X.400.                                                                     This
    draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a protocol standard.  Distribution
    of this memo is unlimited.  Please send comments to the author or to the discussion
    group <mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com>.\n\t "

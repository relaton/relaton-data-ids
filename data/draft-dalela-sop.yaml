  content: "   Cloud services need to interoperate across cloud providers, service\n
    \  vendors and private/public domains. To enable this interoperability,\n   there
    is need for a standard wire-format for exchanging service\n   information. This
    document describes a Service Orchestration Protocol\n   (SOP) to be used as a
    standard wire-format for cloud exchanges.\n   Similar to widely used protocols
    like HTTP, SIP and SMTP, SOP uses\n   text-based messages, which are easily extensible
    and may be inspected\n   at cloud proxies. While SOP carries service-independent
    information,\n   service-dependant information is attached as a Service Description\n
    \  Framework [SDF] payload to SOP packets. This is similar to how HTML\n   is
    transported over HTTP. SDF is a XML schema for describing\n   services. SOP and
    SDF enable any kind of service to be discovered and\n   orchestrated across private
    and public domains. Simple protocol\n   compliance tests can be employed to ensure
    interoperability across\n   domains. SOP wire-formats can be used with existing
    cloud APIs. Using\n   these, it would be possible to interoperate diverse APIs
    and cloud\n   services across service providers, service vendors and service users.\n\n\t "

  content: "If Internet Telephony is to offer a full replacement for traditional\ntelephone
    services, it needs to provide emergency call services. In\nthe United States,
    emergency calls are known as 911 services, based\non the number dialed. This note
    desccribes some options for providing\nenhanced emergency service, i.e., emergency
    calls that allow\nemergency response centers to determine the address where the
    caller\nis located. This is made more difficult by the temporary nature of IP\naddresses,
    the large number of ISPs and their lack of legal\nresponsibility for emergency
    services and the ability of many\nInternet terminals to be connected to the Internet
    at different\nlocations. This note explores some of the requirements and design\nchoices.\n\t "

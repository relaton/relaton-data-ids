- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Many protocols currently being developed for seamless IP-level\nhandovers,
    such as fast handovers and context transfers, possess an\ninherent requirement
    that the mobile node and/or it's current access\nrouter have a priori knowledge
    concerning the target of the handover.\nIn particular, the target access router
    (TAR) should be known to have\nthe appropriate set of capabilities necessary to
    meet the requirements\nof the mobile node.  Although the TAR selection process
    occurs at or\nnear the time of handover, applicable candidate access routers (CARs)\ncan
    be identified in advance.  In this draft, we propose a dynamic,\ndistributed protocol,
    dyCARD, which allows geographically adjacent\nrouters to exchange capability information,
    thus providing critical\ninformation to the target selection process.\n\t "

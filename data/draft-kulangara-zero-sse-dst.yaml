  content: "   This document specifies a universal, tunnel-less mechanism for Secure\n
    \  Service Edge (SSE) steering based on a new SSE Identification Header\n   (SSE-ID).
    The architecture enables endpoints, OS network stacks, and\n   enterprise SD-WAN
    edge devices to signal the intent for traffic to be\n   routed to an SSE provider
    without using GRE or IPsec tunnels.\n\n   This document also defines an SD-WAN
    extension called the Direct\n   Switchover Token (DST). DST provides a vendor-agnostic
    mechanism\n   enabling SD-WAN spokes to establish direct, encrypted, spoke-to-spoke\n
    \  paths for traffic that does not require SSE inspection. DST is issued\n   by
    a central controller after initial packets reach a hub or the\n   controller and
    after evaluating policy and SSE requirements.\n\n   Additionally, this document
    introduces (a) a Participating ISP\n   routing model using an SSE-Only Public
    Pool (SOPP) and an SSE POP ID\n   (SPID) to locate and route to SSE edges on SSE-enabled
    circuits, and\n   (b) a Merger & Acquisition (M&A) access mode that allows two\n
    \  enterprises to access resources via the SSE cloud using Enterprise\n   IDs;
    in this mode, traffic is spliced inside the SSE fabric by EID,\n   with address-domain
    isolation to avoid IP conflicts.\n\n   Together, SSE-ID and DST—augmented with
    SOPP/SPID and M&A mode—\n   provide a unified, interoperable, and tunnel-less
    architecture for\n   SSE integration, SD-WAN optimization, inter-domain routing,
    and\n   enterprise-to-enterprise access.\n\n\t "

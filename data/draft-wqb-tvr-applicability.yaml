  content: "   This document provides an applicability statement on how the Time-\n
    \  Variant Routing (TVR) data model may be used for scheduling in\n   specific
    time variant network cases, to meet the requirements of a\n   set of representative
    use cases described in the \"TVR (Time-Variant\n   Routing) Requirements\" (I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements).\n\n
    \  It also presents a framework that elucidates various scheduling\n   scenarios
    and identifies the entities involved in requesting\n   scheduled changes of network
    resources.\n\n\t "

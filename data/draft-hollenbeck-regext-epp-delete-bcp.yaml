  content: "   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes commands for\n
    \  clients to delete domain and host objects, both of which are used to\n   publish
    information in the Domain Name System (DNS).  EPP includes\n   guidance concerning
    those deletions that is intended to avoid DNS\n   resolution disruptions and maintain
    data consistency.  However,\n   operational relationships between objects can
    make that guidance\n   difficult to implement.  Some EPP clients have developed
    operational\n   practices to delete those objects that have unintended impacts
    on DNS\n   resolution and security.  This document describes best practices to\n
    \  delete domain and host objects that reduce the risk of DNS resolution\n   failure
    and maintain client-server data consistency.\n\n\t "

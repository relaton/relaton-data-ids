  content: "   This document describes how to transport CCNx packets inside an\n   encrypted
    session between peers - a sender and receiver - that share\n   a traffic secret,
    such as that which is derived from [CCNxKE].  The\n   peers create an outer naming
    context to identify the encryption\n   session in one direction between the sender
    and the receiver.  The\n   sender issues encrypted Interest messages to the receiver,
    who\n   responds with encrypted Content Objects.  Inside the outer context,\n
    \  the sender sends Interests with different names, for which the\n   receiver
    may reply to or send InterestReturns in response.  There\n   does not need to
    be a naming relationship between the outer names and\n   the inner names.  The
    inner content is still protected by normal CCNx\n   authentication mechanisms
    and possibly encrypted under other schemes.\n\n\t "

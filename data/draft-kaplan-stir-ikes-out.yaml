  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a mechanism and format for signing source\n
    \  identity information of communication requests, in a manner capable\n   of
    crossing multiple communication protocol types - even if the\n   origin's protocol
    type is unknown.  This is useful for providing\n   E.164 and other forms of Caller-ID
    reputability for various\n   communication protocols, such as SIP, XMPP, WebRTC,
    H.323, and\n   SS7/ISUP.\n\n\n\t "

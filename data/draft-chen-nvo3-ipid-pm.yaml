  content: "   IP Identification(IPID)is a field in IP header primarily used to\n
    \  uniquely identify the group of fragments of a single IP packet. The\n   value
    of IPID field in a packet from a specific traffic flow or\n   source IP address
    keeps increasing until wrapped-around.\n\n   This document specifies a method
    by carefully examining IPID value to\n   monitor the performance of VxLAN network.
    In this memo packet loss\n   measurement is mainly considered. This method requires
    no extra\n   hardware support, which means it is compatible with most of the\n
    \  deployed routers or switches. Such a mechanism is applicable to IPv4\n   network
    and potential useful in overlay network with different data\n   encapsulation.\n\n\n\t "

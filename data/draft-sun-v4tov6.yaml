    more and more popular, it is important to ensure that IPv6-\n   only content can
    be reachable from legacy IPv4-only clients via some\n   IPv4-only network.  This
    document proposes an approach for IPv4-only\n   users to access IPv6-only content,
    and can also achieve address\n   sharing in the server side.  It is designed to
    cover the Scenario 2\n   in [RFC6144].\n\n\t "

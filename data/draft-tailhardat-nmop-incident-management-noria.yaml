  content: "   Operational efficiency in incident management in networking requires\n
    \  correlating and interpreting large volumes of heterogeneous technical\n   information.
    \ Knowledge Graphs (KG) can provide a unified view of\n   complex systems through
    shared vocabularies.  YANG data models enable\n   describing network configurations
    and automating their deployment.\n   However, both approaches face challenges
    in vocabulary alignment and\n   adoption, hindering knowledge capitalization and
    sharing on network\n   designs and best practices.  To address this, the concept
    of a IT\n   Service Management Knowledge Graph (ITSM-KG) is introduced to\n   leverage
    existing network infrastructure descriptions in YANG format\n   and enable abstract
    reasoning on network behaviors.  The key\n   principle to achieve the construction
    of such ITSM-KG is to transform\n   YANG representations of network infrastructures
    into an equivalent\n   knowledge graph representation, and then embed it into
    a more\n   extensive data model for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Risk Management\n
    \  applications.\n\n   In addition to use case analysis and design pattern analysis,
    an\n   experiment is proposed to assess the potential of the ITSM-KG in\n   improving
    network quality and designs.\n\n\t "

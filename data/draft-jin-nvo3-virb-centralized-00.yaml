abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The network in datacenter is required to provide a tenant network,\n
    \  which should be virtualized, and be able to provide L2 switching or\n   L3
    routing capability.  A combined L2&L3 solution could provide great\n   scalability
    for both Layer2 and Layer3 switching.  In this document,\n   we propose to apply
    centralized server to be the control plane of the\n   combined L2&L3 solution,
    to provide better scalability for the\n   control plane.  The combined L2&L3 solution
    in this draft is named\n   Virtualized Integrated Routing&Bridging (shorted as
    VIRB).\n\n\t "

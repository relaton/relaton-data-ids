  content: "Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP\nprinciples
    where a given mobility anchor maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs)\nbinding up-to-date.
    \ Data traffic is then encapsulated between the\nmobility anchor and the MN or
    its Access Router.  These approaches\nare usually implemented on a centralised
    architectures where both MN\ncontext and traffic encapsulation need to be processed
    at a central\nnetwork entity, i.e. the mobility anchor.  However, one of the trend\nin
    mobile network evolution is to \"flatten\" mobility architecture by\nconfining
    mobility support in the access network, e.g. at the access\nrouters level, keeping
    the rest of the network unaware of the\nmobility events and their support.  This
    document discusses the\ndeployment of a Proxy Mobile IP approach in such a flat
    architecture.\nThe solution allows to dynamically distribute mobility functions\namong
    access routers.  The goal is also to dynamically adapt the\nmobility support of
    the MN's needs by applying traffic redirection\nonly to MNs' flows when an IP
    handover occurs.\n\t "

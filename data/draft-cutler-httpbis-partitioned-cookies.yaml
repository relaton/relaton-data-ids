  content: "   This document updates RFC6265bis, defining a new attribute,\n   Partitioned,
    which restricts the contexts in which a cookie is\n   available to only those
    whose top-level document is same-site with\n   the top-level document that initiated
    the request that created the\n   cookie.  These cookies are referred to as \"partitioned
    cookies\" and\n   allow embedded sites which are cross-site with the top-level
    frame to\n   have access to HTTP state which cannot be used for tracking across\n
    \  multiple top-level sites.\n\n\t "

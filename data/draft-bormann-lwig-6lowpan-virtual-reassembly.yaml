  content: "   When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be\n
    \  beneficial for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in\n   its
    entirety before forwarding it.\n\n   This has been always possible with the original
    fragmentation design\n   of RFC 4944.  Apart from a brief mention of the way to
    do this in\n   Section 2.5.2 of the 6LoWPAN book, this has not been extensively\n
    \  described in the literature.  The present document attempts to fill\n   that
    gap.\n\n\t "

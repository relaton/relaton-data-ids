- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This Internet Draft discusses three possible forms of interaction\namong
    IPsec Policies referred to as Policy Resolution, Policy\nCorrelation and Policy
    Reconciliation.  It also proposes two\noperators, Policy Composition (*) and Policy
    Difference (-), to\ndeduce the results of policy interactions.  The definitions
    of these\noperators establish an algebraic semantics of IPsec Policies based\non
    partially ordered set theory. This formal semantics can be used\nto ensure consistency
    of IPsec Policy processing.\n\n\t "

  content: "The current proposal for IP-layer key management [ISAKMP, OAKLEY, ISAOAK]
    has fairly high overhead.  Before a security association can be established, at
    least one pair of messages need to be exchanged between the communicating peers.
    \ For efficiency, this suggests that ISAKMP setup should be infrequent.  However,
    general principles of key management suggest that individual keys should be used
    as little as practical and changed as frequently as possible.  Steve Bellovin
    has suggested that, ideally, different security associations should be used for
    each different transport-level connection[BADESP]. This document discusses a way
    of structuring a protocol to permit this to happen with minimal overhead, both
    in round-trip delay at connection setup, and in bandwidth once the connection
    is established.          The general concept of inline or in-band keying here
    was inspired by SKIP[SKIP].  However, SKIP's approach is burdened by the addition
    of an extra intermediate header of perhaps 20 to 28 bytes to every protected packet,
    which doubles the bandwidth overhead of protected traffic compared with ESP with
    fixed keying.  In order to minimise the per-packet overhead, an inline keying
    header\n\t "

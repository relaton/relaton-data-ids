  content: "   Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly\n   indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An\n   SR policy is a set
    of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more\n   segment lists with necessary
    path attributes. The headend of an SR\n   Policy may learn multiple candidate
    paths for an SR Policy.\n   Candidate paths may be learned via a number of different
    mechanisms,\n   e.g., CLI, NetConf, PCEP, or BGP.\n\n   The Path Computation Element
    (PCE) provides path computation\n   functions in support of traffic engineering
    in Multi Protocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\n
    \  Currently, when a controller uses BGP to deploy an SR Policy, there\n   is
    no way to encode PCE delegation related options. The only way to\n   import a
    PCE delegation is through local configuration management,\n   e.g., Netconf, CLI
    or gRPC.\n\n   This document defines extensions to BGP to distribute PCE\n   delegation
    information within an SR policy.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a new Packetization Layer MTU probing\nalgorithm
    which is not subject to the problems associated with the\ncurrent path MTU discovery
    algorithms [RFC1191, RFC1981, RFC2923].\nThe general strategy of the new algorithm
    is to start with a small\nMTU and probe upward, testing successively larger MTUs
    by probing\nwith single packets.  If the probe is successfully delivered, then\nthe
    MTU is raised.  If the probe is lost, it is treated as an MTU\nlimitation and
    not as a congestion signal.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document presents a new algorithm method for rekeying multicast\ngroups.
    It takes advantage of the mathematical properties of modular\nreduction in order
    to reduce the number of messages needed for rekeying.\nMoreover the technique
    is very suitable for batch processing. It\nachieves greater bandwidth reduction
    than other existing batch \ntechniques. Batch processing techniques are specially
    suitable for \nbenchmarks scenarios where a great amount of users can join or
    leave \nthe group at once (typically single source broadcast). One of the most\nimportant
    items to take into account when performing batch rekeying is\nthat key trees must
    be kept balanced all the time. Current methods for\nbatch rekeying assure tree
    balancing by adding  an additional method to\nusual rekeying. We propose a batch
    rekeying  method that allows members\nto change their position in the key tree.
    This change has to be notified\nto single members with the updated keys. An adaptation
    of the GDOI\nprotocol in order to contain this information is finally proposed.\n\n\t "

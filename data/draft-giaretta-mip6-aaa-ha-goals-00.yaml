  content: "   In commercial deployments Mobile IPv6 can be a service offered by a
    \n   Mobility Services Provider (MSP). In this case all protocol \n   operations
    may need to be explicitely authorized and traced. A \n   convenient approach to
    do that is to define an interface between the \n   Home Agent (HA) and the AAA
    infrastructure of the MSP, which stores \n   user's credentials and service profiles.
    The availability of this \n   interface can be useful also to enable dynamic Mobile
    IPv6 \n   bootstrapping on both the mobile node and the designated HA. \n   This
    document describes various scenarios where an interface between \n   the HA and
    the AAA infrastructure of the MSP is required. \n   Furthermore, a list of design
    goals for this interface is provided.\n\t "

  content: "   TLVs (type-length-value structures) as defined by RFC5444 have both
    a\n   type (one octet) and a type extension (one octet), together forming a\n
    \  full type (of two octets).  RFC5444 sets up IANA registries for TLV\n   types,
    specifying that an allocation of a TLV type entails creation\n   of an IANA registry
    for the corresponding type extensions.\n\n   In some cases, reserving all 256
    type extensions for use for a common\n   purpose for a given TLV is meaningful,
    and thus it makes sense to\n   record a common name for such a TLV type (and all
    of its type\n   extensions) in the corresponding IANA registries.  An example
    of such\n   is a LINK_METRIC TLV Type, with its type extensions reserved for use\n
    \  to be indicating the \"kind\" of metric expressed by the value of the\n   TLV.\n\n
    \  In some other cases, there may not be 256 full types that share a\n   common
    purpose and, as such, it is not meaningful to record a common\n   name for all
    the type extensions for a TLV type in the corresponding\n   IANA registries.  Rather,
    it is appropriate to record an individual\n   name per full type.\n\n   This document
    reorganizes the naming of already allocated TLV types\n   and type extensions
    in those registries to use names appropriately.\n   It has no consequences in
    terms of any protocol implementation.\n\n   This document also updates the Expert
    Review guidelines from RFC5444,\n   so as to establish a policy for consistent
    naming of future TLV type\n   and type extension allocations.\n\n\t "

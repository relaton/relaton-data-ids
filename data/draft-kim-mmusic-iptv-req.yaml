  content: "This document specifies requirements for implementation of Internet \nMedia
    Guide (IMG) over Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) because \nthere are still
    different concepts about applications and technical \nimplementation of IMG. Triple
    Play Services (TPS) for IPTV need more \nefficient and integrated IMG than existent
    IMG for ordinary TV. Such \nvariations raise not only the question of compatibility
    between \ndifferent vendors of IMG systems, but bring the confusion at consumer
    \nside: which one system is most suitable to viewers and what are the \ncriteria
    for suitability of IPTV IMG system for viewers. These \nrequirements are designed
    to guide choice and development of IMG \nfeature.\n\t "

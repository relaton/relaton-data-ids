  content: "   The Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a dominant paradigm in\n   transformer-based
    artificial intelligence (AI) large language models\n   (LLMs).  It is widely adopted
    in both distributed training and\n   distributed inference.  Furthermore, the
    disaggregation of the\n   prefill and decode phases is highly beneficial and is
    considered a\n   best practice for distributed inference models; however, this\n
    \  approach depends on highly efficient Key-Value (KV) cache\n   synchronization.
    \ To enable efficient expert parallelization and KV\n   cache synchronization
    across dozens or even hundreds of Graphics\n   Processing Units (GPUs) in MoE
    architectures, an ultra-high-\n   throughput, ultra-low-latency AI scale-up network
    (SUN) that can\n   efficiently distribute data across all network planes is critical.\n
    \  This document describes how to extend the Weighted Equal-Cost Multi-\n   Path
    (WECMP) load-balancing mechanism, referred to as Fully Adaptive\n   Routing Ethernet
    (FARE), which was originally designed for scale-out\n   networks, to scale-up
    networks.\n\n\n\t "

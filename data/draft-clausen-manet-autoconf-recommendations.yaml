  content: "This document describes a pragmatic set of configuration\nrecommendations
    for MANETs, as well as provides a rationale for why\nthese recommendations are
    sound.  While there may be other equally\nvalid ways of configuring a MANET, the
    recommendations in this\ndocument have the merit of being supported by an existence
    proof\n(there're running networks in existence, configured according to\nthese
    recommendations), and they require neither modifications to the\nIP stack nor
    to upper-layer protocols or applications.\n\t "

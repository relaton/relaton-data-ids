abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by a DNSSEC
    enabled Recursive Nameserver configured as a forwarder to send a single DNS query
    requesting to receive a complete validation path along with the regular DNS answer,
    without the need to rapid-fire many UDP requests in an attempt to attain a low
    latency.</p>"

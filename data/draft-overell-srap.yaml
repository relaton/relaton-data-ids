  content: "   The Simple Roaming Authentication Protocol is intended to provide an\n
    \  authentication facility for other non-authenticated protocols.  It\n   utilises
    registered SASL [SASL] mechanisms.\n \n   This protocol has been developed in
    order that an ISP's roaming\n   customers can be authenticated when connecting
    via other networks or\n   ISPs.  Rather than deploying new client software to
    handle\n   authenticating versions of all protocols (SMTP, POP3, NNTP etc) a\n
    \  single SRAP applet is deployed that handles the authentication for\n   all
    other protocols.\n \n   When the server of a non-authenticated protocol wishes
    to\n   authenticate a client the server starts another connection back to\n   the
    client using SRAP.  The SRAP conversation authenticates the\n   client to the
    server.  The original non-authenticated protocol can\n   now proceed.\n \n   For
    example with SMTP consider two machines Alice's and Bob's.\n   Alice's runs an
    SMTP client and a SRAP authenticatee; Bob's runs an\n   SMTP server and a SRAP
    authenticator.  Alice's machine connects to\n   Bob's using SMTP.  SMTP does not
    support authentication so another\n   connection is made back from Bob's machine
    to Alice's, this time\n   using SRAP.  The SRAP conversation authenticates Alice
    to Bob.  The\n   SMTP conversation can now proceed.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of label\nswitched
    paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and with\nbandwidth guarantees (for
    label switched paths). The reliability of\nthese LSPs can be increased by providing
    a backup LSP onto which\ntraffic can be switched upon failure of an element in
    the path of the\nactive LSP. Backup LSPs can be routed in a way that bandwidth
    can be\nshared between backup links of more than one active path while still\nguaranteeing
    recoverability for a set of failures. This sharing \ngreatly increases the network
    efficiency, thereby increasing the \nnumber of LSPs that can be carried while
    maintaining guarantees. \nAlgorithms which can route such recoverable LSPs while
    using only \naggregate network usage information are being developed.\n\t "

  content: "   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web\n
    \  transfer protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks.\n   It
    is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally\n   operate in groups
    (e.g., in a building automation scenario all lights\n   in a given room may need
    to be switched on/off as a group).  This\n   specification defines how the CoAP
    protocol should be used in a group\n   communication context.  An approach for
    using CoAP on top of IP\n   multicast is detailed based on both existing CoAP
    functionality as\n   well as new features introduced in this specification.  Also,
    various\n   use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate\n
    \  important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in\n   various
    network topologies.\n\n\t "

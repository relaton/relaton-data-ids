  content: "   The need for high quality routing for Low power and Lossy Network\n
    \  (L2N) such as sensor networks comprised of highly constrained devices\n   (CPU,
    memory, ...) in sometimes unstable wireless environments is\n   critical now and
    will continue to increase.  Interest in this class\n   of applications has grown
    dramatically in recent years and a routing\n   solution addressing the specific
    environments of such networks is\n   highly required considering the numerous,
    incompatible open-source\n   and proprietary routing protocols as well as several
    industrial\n   forums.  The aim of this document is to define the routing\n   requirements
    for Sensor Networks at the IP layer.  Such routing\n   protocol(s) would need
    to address several unique aspects of this\n   class of embedded devices and would
    operate in networks comprising\n   links of various nature.\n\n\t "

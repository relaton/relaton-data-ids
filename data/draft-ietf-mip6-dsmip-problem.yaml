  content: "This document discusses the issues associated with mobility management
    for dual stack mobile nodes.  Currently, two mobility management protocols are
    defined for IPv4 and IPv6.  Deploying both in a dual stack mobile node introduces
    a number of problems.  Deployment and operational issues motivate the use of a
    single mobility management protocol.  This document discusses such motivations.
    \ The document also discusses requirements for the Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and Mobile
    IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol so that they can support mobility management for a dual
    stack node.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

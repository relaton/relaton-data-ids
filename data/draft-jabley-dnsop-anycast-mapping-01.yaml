  content: "   Anycast is a deployment technique commonly employed for\n   authoritative-only
    servers in the Domain Name System (DNS).  L-Root,\n   one of the thirteen root
    servers, is deployed in this fashion.\n\n   Various techniques have been used
    to map deployed anycast\n   infrastructure externally, i.e. without reference
    to inside knowledge\n   about where and how such infrastructure has been deployed.\n
    \  Motivations for performing such measurement exercises include\n   operational
    troubleshooting and infrastructure risk assessment.  In\n   the specific case
    of L-Root, the ability to measure and map anycast\n   infrastructure using the
    techniques mentioned in this document is\n   provided for reasons of operational
    transparency.\n\n   This document describes all facilities deployed at L-Root
    to\n   facilitate mapping of its infrastructure and serves as documentation\n
    \  for L-Root as a measurable service.\n\n\t "

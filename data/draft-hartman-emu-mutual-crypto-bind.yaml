- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers\n
    \  rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server.  EAP\n   extensions
    such as channel binding or network posture information are\n   often carried in
    tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this\n   information.  [RFC 3748]
    is a facility that protects tunnel methods\n   against man-in-the-middle attacks.
    \ However, cryptographic binding\n   focuses on protecting the server rather than
    the peer.  This memo\n   explores attacks possible when the peer is not protected
    from man-in-\n   the-middle attacks and recommends mutual cryptographic binding,
    a new\n   form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer and server.\n\n\t "

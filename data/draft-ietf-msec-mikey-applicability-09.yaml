  content: "Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol that can
    be used for \\%real-time applications. In particular, it has been defined focusing
    on the support of the Secure \\%Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). MIKEY itself
    is standardized within RFC 3830 and defines four key distribution methods. Moreover,
    it is defined to allow extensions of the protocol. As MIKEY becomes more and more
    accepted, extensions to the base protocol arise, especially in terms of additional
    key distribution methods but also in terms of payload enhancements.\n\n This document
    provides an overview about the MIKEY base document in general as well as the existing
    extensions for MIKEY, which have been defined or are in the process of definition.
    It is intended as an additional source of information for developers or architects
    to provide more insight in use case scenarios and motivations as well as advantages
    and disadvantages for the different key distribution schemes. The use cases discussed
    in this document are strongly related to dedicated SIP call scenarios providing
    challenges for key management in general, among them media before Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) answer, forking, and shared key conferencing. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

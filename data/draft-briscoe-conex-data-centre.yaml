  content: "   This document describes how a multi-tenant (or multi-department) data\n
    \  centre operator can isolate tenants from network performance\n   degradation
    due to each other's usage, but without losing the\n   multiplexing benefits of
    a LAN-style network where anyone can use any\n   amount of any resource.  Zero
    per-tenant configuration and no\n   implementation change is required on network
    equipment.  Instead the\n   solution is implemented with a simple change to the
    hypervisor (or\n   container) beneath the tenant's virtual machines on every physical\n
    \  server connected to the network.  These collectively enforce a very\n   simple
    distributed contract - a single network allowance that each\n   tenant can allocate
    among their virtual machines, even if distributed\n   around the network.  The
    solution uses layer-3 switches that support\n   explicit congestion notification
    (ECN).  It is best if the sending\n   operating system supports congestion exposure
    (ConEx).  Nonetheless,\n   the operator can unilaterally deploy a complete solution
    while\n   operating systems are being incrementally upgraded to support ConEx\n
    \  and ECN.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases on IP-\n
    \  based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of\n   Intelligent
    Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main scenarios of\n   vehicular communications
    are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-\n   infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X) communications.\n   First, this document surveys use cases using V2V, V2I,
    and V2X\n   networking.  Second, it analyzes proposed protocols for IP-based\n
    \  vehicular networking and highlights the limitations and difficulties\n   found
    on those protocols.  Third, it presents a problem exploration\n   for key aspects
    in IP-based vehicular networking, such as IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery, Mobility
    Management, and Security & Privacy.  For\n   each key aspect, this document discusses
    a problem statement to\n   evaluate the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques
    and\n   requirements in IP-based vehicular networking.\n\n\t "

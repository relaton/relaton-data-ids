  content: "   This document describes a Fully-Specified FEC scheme for the Reed-\n
    \  Solomon forward error correction code and its application to reliable\n   delivery
    of data objects on the packet erasure channel.\n\n   The Reed-Solomon codes belong
    to the class of Maximum Distance\n   Separable (MDS) codes, i.e, they enable a
    receiver to recover the k\n   source symbols from any set of k received symbols.\n\n
    \  The implementation described here is compatible with the IPR-free\n   implementation
    described in [5].\n\t "

  content: "   The intend of this memo is to set up an IANA registry that collects\n
    \  best current practices in terms of reporting IP Performance Metrics\n   (IPPM)
    measurements for composition, to users and to end-users.  It\n   proposes default
    values for well known usages and focuses on the\n   identification of the information
    that should be reported to increase\n   interoperabilty between standard metrics
    measurements and to\n   facilitate the exchange of measurements results through
    measurement\n   applications.\n\n\t "

  content: "Many solutions have been proposed to enable Automatically Switched \nTransport
    Networks (ASTN). This document describes an IP/MPLS based intra-domain control
    plane architecture that can be applied to different circuit switching technologies
    (including OTN, PDH and SONET/SDH). This memo includes generic procedures, key
    concepts, and technical considerations for the common control plane architecture.
    It is intended to accentuate understanding of the application domains, create
    architectural alignment, and serve as guide for protocol engineering.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document exemplifies how the various data models that are\n   produced
    in the IETF can be combined in the context of Network Slice\n   Services delivery.\n\n
    \  Specifically, this document describes the relationship between the\n   Network
    Slice Service models for requesting Network Slice Services\n   and both Service
    (e.g., the L3VPN Service Model, the L2VPN Service\n   Model) and Network (e.g.,
    the L3VPN Network Model, the L2VPN Network\n   Model) models used during their
    realizations.  In addition, this\n   document describes the communication between
    a Network Slice\n   Controller (NSC) and the network controllers for the realization
    of\n   Network Slices.\n\n   The Network Slice Service YANG model provides a customer-oriented\n
    \  view of the intended Network slice Service.  Thus, once an NSC\n   receives
    a request for a Slice Service request, the NSC has to map it\n   to accomplish
    the specific objectives expected by the network\n   controllers.  Existing YANG
    network models are analyzed against\n   Network Slice requirements, and the gaps
    in existing models are\n   identified.\n\n\t "

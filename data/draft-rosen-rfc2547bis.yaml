  content: "This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use\nan
    IP backbone to provide VPNs for its customers.  MPLS is used for\nforwarding packets
    over the backbone, and BGP is used for\ndistributing routes over the backbone.
    \ The primary goal of this\nmethod is to support the case in which a client obtains
    IP backbone\nservices from a Service Provider or Service Providers with which
    it\nmaintains contractual relationships.  The client may be an\nenterprise, a
    group of enterprises which need an extranet, an\nInternet Service Provider, an
    application service provider, another\nVPN Service Provider which uses this same
    method to offer VPNs to\nclients of its own, etc.  The method makes it very simple
    for the\nclient to use the backbone services.  It is also very scalable and\nflexible
    for the Service Provider, and allows the Service Provider to\nadd value.\n\t "

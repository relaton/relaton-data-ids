  content: "This memo discusses strategies for supporting 'DNS searching' --\nfinding
    of names in the DNS, or references that will ultimately point\nto DNS names, by
    a mechanism layered above the DNS itself that\npermits fuzzy matching, selection
    that uses attributes or facets, and\nuse of descriptive terms. Demand for these
    facilities appear to be\nincreasing with growth in the Internet (and especially
    the web) and\nwith requirements to move beyond the restricted subset of ASCII
    names\nthat have been the traditional contents of DNS 'Class=IN'.  This\ndocument
    proposes a three-level system for access to DNS names in\nwhich the upper two
    levels involve search, rather than lookup\n(exactly known target), functions.
    It also discusses some of the\nissues and challenges in completing the design
    of, and deploying,\nsuch a system.\n\t "

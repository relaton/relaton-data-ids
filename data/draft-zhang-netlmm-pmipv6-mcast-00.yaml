- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "With the development of various mobile technologies, mobile multicast
    becomes a research hotspot. Several mobile multicast schemes were \nproposed,
    but most of them are based on the Mobile IPv6 and its \nalternatives. Recently,
    the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) was         proposed to provide the mobility support
    for mobile node without mobility function. However, the PMIPv6 mainly concerns
    on the unicast \ntransmission support, and little considers the multicast routing.
    So, in this memo, we propose two mobile multicast mechanisms, the MAG- based method
    and LMA-based method to support the multicast routing in \nPMIPv6.\n\t "

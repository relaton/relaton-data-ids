  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any\n
    \  path.  SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e., instructions)\n   that
    represent a source-routed policy.  The packets steered into an\n   SR Policy carry
    an ordered list of segments associated with that SR\n   Policy.  An SR Policy
    can be instantiated SR-MPLS and SRv6 data\n   planes.\n\n   Maximum SID Depth
    (MSD) specifies the maximum number of SIDs that a\n   Path Computation Client
    (PCC) is capable of imposing on a packet.\n   The number of SIDs in an SR-TE path
    computed by the PCE on behalf of\n   a PCC is dictated by the MSD value at the
    PCC.  This draft specifies\n   some MSD considerations PCE needs to take into
    account when computing\n   the number of SIDs in an SR-TE path.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an extensible mechanism that allows a \nRIPv2
    [RIP2] speaker to advertise summarized routes to its peers \nwithout changing
    the format of the RESPONSE message. \nSummarized routes are carried in RESPONSE
    message like normal\nRIPv2 routes. Summarized routes are treated as normal routes
    on \nthe receiving side. No extra provisions are required to discriminate\nbetween
    summarized and normal routes.\nThe mechanisms described in this document is OPTIONAL
    and is \napplicable to all RIPv2 speaking routers, with some modifications \nin
    the routing information base and output processing for storing \nand advertising
    summary routes. This mechanism cannot be applied to \nRIPv1 [RIP1].\n\n\t "

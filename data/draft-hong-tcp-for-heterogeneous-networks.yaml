  content: "   Based on incorporating the ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification\n
    \  [RFC3168] and the end-to-end Available Bandwidth Estimation,\n   TCP for heterogeneous
    networks accommodates a way for\n   TCP sender to be ability of distinguishing
    the wireless packet \n   losses from the congestion packet losses, as well as
    estimating of\n   the available bandwidth to adjust transmission rate when the
    neworks\n   become congested.\n\t "

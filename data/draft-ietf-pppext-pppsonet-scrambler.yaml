  content: "This Internet Draft addresses the PPP/SONET interface defined\nin the
    IETF RFC 1619 and its application in public Internet backbone\nnetworks. By experimental
    analysis it is found that this SONET interface\nspecification is deficient in
    providing payload transparency. This\ndeficiency leads to deleterious effects
    in providing reliable network\noperations. A simple SONET payload scrambler enhancement
    is proposed to overcome this deficiency. This work has been brought to the\nANSI
    T1X1.5 as an action item for the addition of the RFC 1619 mapping\nto T1.105 with
    a scrambler to be determined by T1X1.\n \nWe are submitting the same proposal
    to IETF now with the interest to\nenhance RFC-1619 accordingly and achieve alignment
    with ANSI T1 standards.\nTo facilitate this alignment, we have recommended that
    T1X1 establish a\nformal liaison with IETF in regard to IP/SONET interface standards\nand
    associated IP transmission standards development.\n\t "

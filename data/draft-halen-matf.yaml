  content: "   This informational independent submission to the RFC series describes\n
    \  a means to use TLS 1.3 to perform machine-to-machine mutual\n   authentication
    within federations.  This memo is not a standard.  It\n   does not modify the
    TLS protocol in any way, nor does it require\n   changes to common TLS libraries.
    \ TLS is specified and standardized\n   by the IETF's TLS working group.\n\n   The
    framework enables interoperable trust management for federated\n   machine-to-machine
    communication.  It introduces a centrally managed\n   trust anchor and a controlled
    metadata publication process, ensuring\n   that only authorized members are identifiable
    within the federation.\n   These mechanisms support unambiguous entity identification
    and reduce\n   the risk of impersonation, promoting secure and policy-aligned\n
    \  interaction across organizational boundaries.\n\n\t "

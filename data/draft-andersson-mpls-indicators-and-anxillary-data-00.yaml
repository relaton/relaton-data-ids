  content: "   This document is a living document, meaning that during the life\n
    \  timme of the MPLS Open Design Team we will to survey the relationship\n   between
    indicators and anxillary dat.\n\n   Ideally when the Design Team is closed this
    document will be empty,\n   or maybe we just add a pointer to where the answer
    to quesstion is\n   documented.  Thus this document will never go on to become
    an RFCc.\n\n\t "

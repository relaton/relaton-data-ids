  content: "This document specifies method for verifying the connection of an \nMPLS
    Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Label Switched Path (LSP) for \nmanagement purpose.
    The proposed extension is based on MPLS \nOperation, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM). The goal is to \nverify that an MPLS-TP LSP is properly setup in both control
    and data \n\n planes, as well as to record the identities of all the LSRs along
    the \npath of MPLS-TP LSP.\n\t "

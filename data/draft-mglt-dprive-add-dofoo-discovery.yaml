  content: "   This document describes a mechanism that enables a DNS client to\n
    \  discover other DNS alternatives such as DoT or DoH for one specific\n   domain.
    \ This document also extends this discovery mechanism to an\n   Internet wide
    of open resolvers search - though this is expected to\n   be described further
    in a separate document.  While search are always\n   initiated by the DNS client,
    this document also indicates how a\n   resolver MAY indicate a DNS client its
    preference for using\n   alternative flavors of transport layer.\n\n\t "

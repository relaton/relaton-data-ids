  content: "       Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been used\n
    \      extensively by the service providers. However, when TE links are\n       bundled,
    identification of label resource in Record Route object\n       (RRO) is not sufficient
    to determine the component link within a TE\n       link that is being used by
    a given LSP. In other words, when link\n       bundling is used, resource recording
    requires mechanisms to specify\n       the component link identifier, along with
    the TE link identifier and\n       Label. As it is not possible to record component
    link in the RRO,\n       this document defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209]
    and\n       [RFC3473] to specify component link identifiers for resource\n       recording
    purposes.\n\n\t "

  content: "There has been substantial work within the IETF to define Internet Fax
    \nservices based on an SMTP based store and forward model. This \ntransmission
    model has imposed some limitations of the quality and type \nof content transmitted.
    \n\nA secondary issue with email based Internet fax is the inherent \ndifficulty
    of ascertaining the capabilities of a recipient in advance of \nsending.\n\t "

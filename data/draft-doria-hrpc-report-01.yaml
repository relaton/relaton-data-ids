  content: "   This document presents an overview snapshot of the HRPC project to\n
    \  map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related to\n   human
    rights, with a focus on the promotion and protection of the\n   freedom of expression
    and of association.\n\n   It provides a framework while reporting on the study
    including:\n   theoretical background, results and basic considerations.  It will\n
    \  reference the detailed work being done on terminlogy and case studies\n   documented
    in the research draft.  It also folds in discussions from\n   the research literature.
    \ The documents, [HRPC-Research] and this\n   document, form an interrelated set
    that may later be combined into a\n   single document.\n\n   This draft is still
    in very early stages and welcomes further\n   contribution.  Text is solicited.\n\n
    \  Discussion on this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org //\n   https://www.irtf.org/mailman/admindb/hrpc\n\n\t "

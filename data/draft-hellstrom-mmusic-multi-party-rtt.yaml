  content: "   This memo specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media handling\n
    \  in multi-party calls.  The main RTT transport is to carry Real-Time\n   text
    by the RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103\n   RFC 4103
    [RFC4103] .  The mechanisms enable the receiving application\n   to present the
    received real-time text medium separated per source,\n   in different ways according
    to user preferences.  Some presentation\n   related features are also described
    explaining suitable variations of\n   transmission and presentation of text.\n\n
    \  Call control features are described for the SIP environment.  A\n   number
    of alternative methods for providing the multi-party\n   negotiation, transmission
    and presentation are discussed and a\n   recommendation for the main one is provided.
    \ The main solution for\n   centralized multi-party handling of real-time text
    is achieved\n   through a media control unit coordinating multiple RTP text streams\n
    \  into one RTP stream.\n\n   Alternative methods using a single RTP stream and
    source\n   identification inline in the text stream are also described, one of\n
    \  them being provided as a lower functionality fallback method for\n   endpoints
    with no multi-party awareness for RTT.\n\n   Bridging methods where the text stream
    is carried untouched by the\n   bridge are also discussed.\n\n   Brief information
    is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC\n   environment.\n\n\t "

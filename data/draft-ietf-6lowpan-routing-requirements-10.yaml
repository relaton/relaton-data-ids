- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) are formed
    by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However, neither
    the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format specification defines how mesh
    topologies could be obtained and maintained. Thus, it should be considered how
    6LoWPAN formation and multi-hop routing could be supported.\n\n This document
    provides the problem statement and design space for 6LoWPAN routing. It defines
    the routing requirements for 6LoWPANs, considering the low-power and other particular
    characteristics of the devices and links. The purpose of this document is not
    to recommend specific solutions but to provide general, layer-agnostic guidelines
    about the design of 6LoWPAN routing that can lead to further analysis and protocol
    design. This document is intended as input to groups working on routing protocols
    relevant to 6LoWPANs, such as the IETF ROLL WG. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

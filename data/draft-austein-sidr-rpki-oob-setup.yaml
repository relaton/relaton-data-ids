  content: "   This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of\n
    \  the RPKI provisioning and publication protocols between two parties.\n   The
    protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can\n   be passed
    back and forth by any mutually agreeable secure means.\n\n   This setup protocol
    is not part of the provisioning or publication\n   protocol, rather, it is intended
    to simplify configuration of these\n   protocols by setting up relationships and
    exchanging BPKI keying\n   material.\n\n\t "

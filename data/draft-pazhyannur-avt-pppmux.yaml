- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes a scheme to increase the capacity of low-speed\ntransmission
    links, T-1/E-1 or smaller, to transport low-bit rate\nvoice applications over
    PPP. Given the relatively small payload size\nof the voice packets (average of
    8 bytes for certain cellular\nnetworks) protocol overheads due to PPP, IP, UDP,
    and RTP are\nsignificant in determining the link capacity. The scheme proposed\nhere
    is to multiplex compressed RTP/UDP packets into a single PPP\nframe. As a result,
    the PPP overhead (5-7 bytes) is distributed over\nmultiple compressed RTP/UDP
    packets.\n\t "

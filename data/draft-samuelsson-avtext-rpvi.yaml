  content: "   This document specifies an extension to the feedback messages defined\n
    \  in the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF). The new Reference\n   Picture
    Verification Information (RPVI) feedback message conveys\n   information about
    available reference pictures in the decoded picture\n   buffer of a video decoder
    in the receiver of an RTP video stream.\n\n   By including information related
    to Decoded Picture Hash (DPH)\n   values, media senders and media receivers can
    verify that reference\n   pictures used for prediction by the video encoder and
    the video\n   decoder are aligned. It is also possible to use the RPVI feedback\n
    \  message to indicate that a specific reference picture has incorrect\n   sample
    values (i.e. a mismatch in the DPH value between encoder and\n   decoder) or that
    a specific reference picture has been lost.\n\n\t "

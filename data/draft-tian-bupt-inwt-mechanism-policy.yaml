  content: "   This document describes INT-path, a cost-effective network-wide\n   telemetry
    framework based on INT (In-band Network Telemetry), by\n   decoupling the network
    monitoring system into a routing mechanism and\n   a routing path generation policy.
    \ INT-path embeds SR (Source\n   Routing) into INT probes to allow specifying
    the route that the probe\n   packet takes through the network.  Above this probing
    path control\n   mechanism, an Euler trail-based path planning policy is developed
    to\n   generate non-overlapped INT paths that cover the entire network with\n
    \  a minimum path number, reducing the overall telemetry overhead.  INT-\n   path
    is very suitable for deployment in data center networks thanks\n   to their symmetric
    topologies.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo suggests a protocol for messaging notification in\nwhich a messaging
    system (e.g. email server, voice mail system, \netc.) notifies a notification
    service, and through it the user,\nthat changes have occurred in a user's mailbox
    (new message\narrived, mailbox is full, etc.). The protocol aims to provide the\nend-user
    with unified notification of events occurring on different\nmessaging systems.\nA
    mailing list has been established to discuss this draft and\npromote the issue
    of Notification to RFC. To subscribe, send\nemail with 'subscribe snap' to majordomo@lists.neystadt.org\nor
    using web at http://www.neystadt.org/cgi-bin/majordomo.\n\t "

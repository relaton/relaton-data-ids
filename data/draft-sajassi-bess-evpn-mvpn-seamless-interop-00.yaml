  content: "   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming\n   pervasive
    for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data\n   center (DC) networks
    and as the next generation VPN services in\n   service provider (SP) networks.\n\n
    \  As service providers transform their networks in their COs toward\n   next
    generation data center with Software Defined Networking (SDN)\n   based fabric
    and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), they want to\n   be able to maintain
    their offered services including multicast VPN\n   (MVPN) service between their
    existing network and their new SPDC\n   network seamlessly without the use of
    gateway devices. They want to\n   have such seamless interoperability between
    their new SPDCs and their\n   existing networks for a) reducing cost, b) having
    optimum forwarding,\n   and c) reducing provisioning. This document describes
    a unified\n   solution based on RFC 6513 for seamless interoperability of multicast\n
    \  VPN between EVPN and MVPN PEs. Furthermore, it describes how the\n   proposed
    solution can be used as a routed multicast solution in data\n   centers with EVPN-IRB
    PEs per [EVPN-IRB].\n\n\t "

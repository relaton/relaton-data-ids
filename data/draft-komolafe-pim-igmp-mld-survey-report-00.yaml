  content: "   The PIM WG intends to progress IGMPv3 and MLDv2 from Proposed\n   Standards
    to Internet Standards.  The WG decided to conduct a survey\n   of operators, vendors
    and implementors of these and related protocols\n   to gather information about
    their implementation and deployment.\n   This document presents the results of
    the survey and briefly\n   summarizes the key findings.  The survey indicates
    that there is\n   widespread deployment and usage of of IGMPv3 and MLDv2, with
    numerous\n   independent implementations interoperating successfully.  No major\n
    \  issues with either protocol were identified and, similarly, no major\n   unused
    features in the specifications were highlighted.  These\n   findings suggest that
    IGMPv3 and MLDv2 are indeed ready for\n   progression to Internet Standards.\n\n\t "

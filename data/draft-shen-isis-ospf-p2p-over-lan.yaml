  content: "Two different circuit types are commonly used by link state routing\nprotocols:
    point-to-point and broadcast. It is important to identify\nthe correct circuit
    type in forming adjacency with neighbors,\nin flooding link state database packets,
    in representation of the\ncircuit subnet. This document describes a simple mechanism
    to treat\nthe broadcast media as point-to-point connection from IP routing\nprotocol
    point of view if there are only two devices on the LAN\nmedia.\n\t "

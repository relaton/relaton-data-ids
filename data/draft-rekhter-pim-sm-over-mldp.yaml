  content: "   When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in ASM mode need to pass\n
    \  through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to\n   Point-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Paths. This document describes how\n   to accomplish this in the
    case where such Point-to-Multipoint Label\n   Switches Paths are established using
    mLDP.\n\n\nSpecification of Requirements\n\t "

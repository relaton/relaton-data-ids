  content: "   Privacy is an important issue for many governments and users where\n
    \  its importance becomes more evident every day. Nodes might change\n   their
    IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked by\n   attackers and which
    also results in the prevention of information\n   being leaked from their nodes.
    In IPv6 networks there is currently\n   one solution for maintaining privacy for
    nodes when IPv6 StateLess\n   Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC-4662) is
    used. Unfortunately\n   this solution, i.e., Privacy Extension (RFC-4941), has
    some problems,\n   such as not generating a new Interface ID (IID) after changing
    the\n   router prefix. The RFC also gives no explanation as to how to use CGA\n
    \  in its randomizing solution. The purpose of this document is to\n   address
    these issues and to update the current RFC.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes the SAVNET-based Anti-DDoS Architecture\n   (SADA),
    which can efficiently detect, mitigate, and traceback Denial-\n   of-Service (DDoS)
    attacks that spoof source addresses.  The SADA\n   consists of a distributed DDoS
    detection mechanism based on\n   honeynets, a multi-stage DDoS mitigation mechanism,
    and a suspect-\n   based DDoS traceback mechanism.  By adopting the Source Address\n
    \  Validation (SAV) technique of SAVNET and introducing the data plane\n   and
    the control plane, the SADA makes minor changes to the SAVNET\n   while providing
    major benefits.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast\n
    \  ReRoute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic\n   (and
    MPLS LDP traffic by extension).  Following first deployment\n   experiences, this
    document provides operational feedback on LFA,\n   highlights some limitations,
    and proposes a set of refinements to\n   address those limitations.  It also proposes
    required management\n   specifications.\n\n   This proposal is also applicable
    to remote LFA solution.\n\n\n\t "

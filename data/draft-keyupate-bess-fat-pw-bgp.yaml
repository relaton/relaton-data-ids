abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   [RFC6391] describes a mechanism that uses an additional label (Flow\n
    \  Label) in the MPLS label stack that allows Label Switch Routers to\n   balance
    flows within Pseudowires at a finer granularity than the\n   individual Pseudowires
    across the Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs)\n   that exists within the Packet
    Switched Network (PSN).\n\n   Furthermore,[RFC6391] defines the LDP protocol extensions
    required to\n   synchronize the flow label states between the ingress and egress
    PEs\n   when using the signaling procedures defined in the [RFC4447].\n\n   This
    draft defines protocol extensions required to synchronize flow\n   label states
    among PEs when using the BGP-based signaling procedures\n   defined in [RFC4761].
    \ These protocol extensions are equally\n   applicable to point-to-point L2VPNs
    defined in [RFC6624].\n\n\t "

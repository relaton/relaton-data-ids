  content: "This document extends BFD mechanism to support detection function for\npackets
    with variable lengths.  Through dynamically changing the\nlength of BFD packets,
    it can detect both traditional faults such as\nlink failure or route fault, as
    well as non-forwarding problem for\npackets with a length in a special range,
    which maybe caused by\nequipment's internal defects.\n\t "

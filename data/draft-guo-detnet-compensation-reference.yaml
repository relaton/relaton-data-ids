  content: "   This document describes several methods for obtaining reference delay\n
    \  applicable to different scenarios. These methods are in conjunction\n   with
    mechanisms aimed at reducing end-to-end delay jitter in a\n   scalable deterministic
    network. The goal is to meet specific business\n   requirements and provide greater
    flexibility in the multipath\n   planning for service protection.\n\n\t "

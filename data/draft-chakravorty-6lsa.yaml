  content: "This specification provides an architectural framework, called IPv6\nLabel
    Switching Architecture or 6LSA, for an end-to-end, IP-centric\npacket transmission
    technique that uses the IPv6 packet header Flow\nLabel to establish IPv6-based
    label switched paths.  The label\nswitched paths, called 6LSPs, provide application
    and user specified\nroutes for efficient transport of packets and as means for
    quality of\nservice (QoS) delivery, IPv4 tunneling, VPN and other mechanisms.\nThrough
    look-ups of 20-bit labels instead of 128-bit IPv6 addresses,\nthe architecture
    may provide potential memory and processing savings,\nthe latter through significantly
    reduced address fetches for the low-\npowered, handheld devices.  The label has
    two components comprising\nGlobal Label value and Local Label value.  The Global
    Label value\nfrom the source is delivered to the destination unmodified.  However,\nthe
    intermediate network nodes in 6LSA are allowed to temporarily\nreplace the Local
    Label value with a value of local significance.\nThis enables 6LSA flows to be
    hop-specific although session-based and\nas such a unique QoS delivery technique
    for bandwidth constrained\nmedia. 6LSA also enhances security since label generation
    and\nassignment algorithms can be modified periodically.\n\nFinally, it must be
    pointed out that the 6LSA concept of temporary\nflow label assignment is applicable
    to the 6LSA domain only.  The\nconcept is not applicable to domains outside the
    6LSA.\n\t "

  content: "This document extends VRRP mechanism to support fast transition of\nnon-master
    router to master when the original master router (is not\nfunctioning or) becomes
    unavailable.  Through introducing another\nstate of router, named alternate state,
    when the failure of master\nrouter is detected by alternate router with fast detection\ntechnology,
    such as BFD, it will transmit to master immediately.\nThen the new master will
    inform other routers in its VRRP group to\nelect a new alternate router, and a
    fast detection session will be\nestablished between alternate and master routers,
    through which the\navailability of the master can be detected by alternate router.\n\t "

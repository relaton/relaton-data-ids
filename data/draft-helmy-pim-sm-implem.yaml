  content: "This document describes the details of the PIM-SM [1,2,3] version 2 implementation
    for UNIX platforms;  namely SunOS and SGI-IRIX. A generic kernel model is adopted,
    \ which is protocol independent, however some supporting functions are added to
    the kernel for encapsulation of data packets at user level and decapsulation of
    PIM Registers.                  Further, the basic model for the user level,  PIM
    daemon (pimd), implementation is described.                                               Implementation
    details and code are included in supplementary appendices.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a new Mechanism and DNS resource record (RR)
    type to carry information about energy-related characteristics for end-to-end
    internet access. The "EE" ("Energy Efficiency") record allows the network to provide
    different levels of energy-saving service. By providing more energy information
    to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer
    potential benefits to enhancements on energy as service criteria.</p>

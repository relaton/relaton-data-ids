- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There is a need in the Internet community for an encryption algorithm
    that provides interoperable operation with existing deployed commercial cryptographic
    applications.  This interoperability will allow for a smoother transition to protocols
    that have been developed through the IETF standards process.  This document describes
    an existing algorithm that satisifies this requirement.\n\t "

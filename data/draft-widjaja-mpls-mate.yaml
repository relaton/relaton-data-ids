  content: "This document describes an MPLS Adaptive Traffic Engineering scheme,\n
    \  called MATE. The main goal of MATE is to avoid network congestion by\n   balancing
    the loads among the LSPs.  MATE makes minimal assumptions\n   in that the intermediate
    LSRs are not required to perform traffic\n   engineering activities or measurements
    beside forwarding packets.\n   Moreover, MATE does not impose any particular scheduling,
    buffer\n   management, architecture, or a priori traffic characterization, on\n
    \  the LSRs.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern cloud and distributed environments face significant risks from
    stolen bearer tokens, protocol replay, and trust gaps in transit. This document
    presents a framework for modernizing workload security through cryptographically
    verifiable geofencing, proof-of-possession, and protocol-aware residency enforcement.
    By binding workload identity to both geographic and host attributes, and supplementing
    bearer tokens with verifiable, location- and host- bound claims, the framework
    addresses the challenges of bearer token theft, proof-of-possession and trust-in-transit
    for all networking protocols. Leveraging trusted hardware, attestation protocols,
    and geolocation services, this approach ensures that only authorized workloads
    in approved locations and environments can access sensitive data or services,
    even in the presence of advanced threats.</p>"

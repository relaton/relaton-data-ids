  content: "   This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor\n
    \  version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS\n   version
    4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and\n   protocol extensions
    made as part of Minor Version 1.  The later minor\n   version has no dependencies
    on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and\n   was, until recently, documented as a
    completely separate protocol.\n\n   This document is part of a set of documents
    which collectively\n   obsolete RFCs 8881 and 8434.  In addition to many corrections
    and\n   clarifications, it will rely on NFSv4-wide documents to substantially\n
    \  revise the treatment of protocol extension, internationalization, and\n   security,
    superseding the descriptions of those aspects of the\n   protocol appearing in
    RFCs 5661 and 8881.\n\n\t "

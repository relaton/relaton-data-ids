  content: "   This document first analyzes the critical issues of bottlenecks in\n
    \  existing tunneling and translation technologies, which can be solved\n   by
    proper load balancing mechanisms(e,g., scalability, availability,\n   and single
    point of failure).  Then, several key factors in designing\n   a valid load balancing
    mechanism are described.  Solutions to\n   specific load balancing requirements
    can be drawn out by considering\n   these factors.  At last, current efforts about
    load balancing are\n   introduced.\n\n\t "

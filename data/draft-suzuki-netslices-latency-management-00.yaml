  content: "   This draft provides a use case that addresses the need for latency\n
    \  management for end-to-end data transmissions through multiple\n   domains.
    \ Specifically, examples of latency management schemes are\n   described.  In
    addition, the necessity of a common latency management\n   framework and of interfaces
    to gather latency information between\n   edges in each domain and to determine
    data transmission paths is\n   addressed.\n\n\t "

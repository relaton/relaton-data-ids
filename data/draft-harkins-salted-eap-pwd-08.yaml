  content: "EAP-pwd is an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method that utilizes
    a shared password for authentication using a technique that is resistant to dictionary
    attacks.  It includes support for raw keys and double hashing of a password in
    the style of Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MSCHAPv2),
    but it does not include support for salted passwords.  There are many existing
    databases of salted passwords, and it is desirable to allow their use with EAP-pwd.\n\t "

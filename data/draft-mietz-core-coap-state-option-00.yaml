  content: "   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices which\n
    \  are often equipped with sensors measuring a physical phenomenon such\n   as
    temperature on a precise scale.  These sensor values are made\n   available by
    a resource on the CoAP endpoint.  However, for many\n   applications it is not
    necessary to have the full precision a sensor\n   can provide.  It's often even
    enough to only have some high-level\n   states instead of raw values.  This document
    presents a new option\n   for CoAP to dynamically create new resources for a sensor
    which\n   provides user-defined high-level states instead of raw sensor values.\n\n\t "

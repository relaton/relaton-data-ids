  content: "This internet-draft proposes a general approach for adding flow support
    to CLNP. This is useful both for reservation of resources in routers for support
    of applications with specific application service requirements, and for coordination
    with subnet connections when operating over connection oriented subnets (for example
    for operation of CLNP over ATM). Futher work is needed to define the protocol
    in detail.\n\t "

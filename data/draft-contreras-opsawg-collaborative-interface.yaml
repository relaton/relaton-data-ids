  content: "   The absence of appropriate mechanisms for information exchange\n   between
    Network Operators and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and\n   content providers
    leads to avoidable inefficiency for the delivery of\n   contents to end users
    in situations like congestion, selection of\n   best distributed delivery end
    point, etc.\n\n   This document describes the need of an information exchange
    interface\n   between Network Operators and CDNs to collaborate in order to provide\n
    \  the best service quality to the end users.\n\n\t "

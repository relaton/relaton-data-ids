abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The label distribution protocol specified in [1] describes a\nmechanism
    whereby one label switched router informs another of the\nmeaning of labels used
    to forward traffic between and through them.\nThis draft proposes a label aggregation
    technique to reduce the\nnumber of labels that need to be exchanged between two
    LSRs running\nLDP.\nThis includes a method of signalling that LSRs are capable
    of label\naggregation, determining when a label request can be aggregated on to\nan
    existing LSP and a method of signalling to upstream LSRs that the\nresulting label
    mapping is an aggregate.\n\n\t "

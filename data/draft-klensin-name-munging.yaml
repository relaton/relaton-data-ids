  content: "As one works on internationalization issues for DNS, email, and other\nprotocols,
    it becomes clear that the various encodings and\ntransformations required, while
    not intrinsically difficult, can be\nan impediment to rapid conversion of applications
    to international\nform and to rapid prototyping of new applications.  This document\nproposes
    a new, lightweight, protocol that can be used to make such\nconversions, rather
    than incorporating the needed tables and\nalgorithms into each application.\n\t "

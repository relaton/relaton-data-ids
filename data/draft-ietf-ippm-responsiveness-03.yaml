  content: "   For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called lag,\n   latency,
    or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but\n   common, symptom
    in today's networks.  Even after a decade of work on\n   standardizing technical
    solutions, it remains a common problem for\n   the end users.\n\n   Everyone \"knows\"
    that it is \"normal\" for a video conference to have\n   problems when somebody
    else at home is watching a 4K movie or\n   uploading photos from their phone.
    \ However, there is no technical\n   reason for this to be the case.  In fact,
    various queue management\n   solutions have solved the problem.\n\n   Our networks
    remain unresponsive, not from a lack of technical\n   solutions, but rather a
    lack of awareness of the problem and\n   deployment of its solutions.  We believe
    that creating a tool that\n   measures the problem and matches people's everyday
    experience will\n   create the necessary awareness, and result in a demand for
    solutions.\n\n   This document specifies the \"Responsiveness Test\" for measuring\n
    \  responsiveness.  It uses common protocols and mechanisms to measure\n   user
    experience specifically when the network is under working\n   conditions.  The
    measurement is expressed as \"Round-trips Per Minute\"\n   (RPM) and should be
    included with throughput (up and down) and idle\n   latency as critical indicators
    of network quality.\n\n\t "

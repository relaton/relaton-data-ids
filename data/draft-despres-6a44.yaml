  script: Latn
  content: "In customer sites having IPv4-only Customer Premises Equipment (CPE),
    Teredo (RFC 4380, RFC 5991, RFC 6081) provides last-resort IPv6 connectivity.
    \ However, because it is designed to work without the involvement of Internet
    Service Providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native
    addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses
    fails for some combinations of NAT types).  6a44 is a complementary solution that,
    being based on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of
    6a44 IPv6 addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix, present at the
    beginning of Teredo IPv6 addresses, with network-specific /48 prefixes assigned
    by local ISPs (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment
    on IPv4 Infrastructures)).  The specification is expected to be complete enough
    for running code to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally
    deployed and used.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

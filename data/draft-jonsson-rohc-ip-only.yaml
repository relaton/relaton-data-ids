- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC, RFC 3095, defines\na
    framework for header compression, along with compression protocols\n(profiles)
    for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP, IP/UDP, and also for uncompressed\npacket streams. However,
    no profile was defined for compression of IP\nonly, which has been identified
    as a flaw in RFC 3095. This document\naddresses that problem and defines a ROHC
    compression profile for IP,\nsimilar to the IP/UDP profile defined by RFC 3095,
    but simplified to\nexclude UDP.\n\n\t "

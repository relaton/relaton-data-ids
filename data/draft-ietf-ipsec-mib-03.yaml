  content: "   This document defines monitoring and status MIBs for IPSec. It does\n
    \  not define MIBs that may be used for configuring IPSec\n   implementations
    or for providing low-level diagnostic or debugging\n   information. Further, it
    does not provide policy information. Those\n   MIBs may be defined in later versions
    of this document or in other\n   documents.\n \n   The purpose of the MIBs is
    to allow system administrators to\n   determine operating conditions and perform
    system operational level\n   monitoring of the IPSec portion of their network.
    Statistics are\n   provided as well.\n\n\t "

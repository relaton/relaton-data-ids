- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy, distributing traffic to a\ncluster
    of multiple downstream servers, can use the DNS SRV mechanism\nto perform load
    balancing.  However, the \"weight\" field in the DNS\nSRV mechanism is intended
    for static server selection.  Over time,\nthe traffic arriving at the downstream
    SIP servers may cause them to\nenter an overload condition, adversely impacting
    the throughput of\nthe SIP cluster.  This document proposes to impart the dynamic
    load\nof each SIP server to the load distributing SIP proxy, thereby\nallowing
    it to load balance the traffic so as to reduce --- or even\nprevent --- an overload
    condition.\n\t "

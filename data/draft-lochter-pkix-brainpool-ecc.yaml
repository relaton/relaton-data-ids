- language: en

  content: "This memo proposes several elliptic curve domain parameters over finite
    prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  The domain parameters are
    consistent with the relevant international standards, and can be used in X.509
    certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs), for Internet Key Exchange
    (IKE), Transport Layer Security (TLS), XML signatures, and all applications or
    protocols based on the cryptographic message syntax (CMS).  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

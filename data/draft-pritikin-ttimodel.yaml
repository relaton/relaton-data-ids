  content: "   We describe the 'out-of-band' exchange of data in a classical\n   enrollment
    protocol as a Trusted Transitive Introduction (TTI)\n   between two end entities
    and an introducer, thus distinguishing\n   introduction from enrollment. This
    document describes the three\n   system entities in the trusted transitive introduction
    model and the\n   data exchanges between them. Three introduction stages are defined\n
    \  and examined in the context of a 'TTI over HTTP' introduction.\n\t "

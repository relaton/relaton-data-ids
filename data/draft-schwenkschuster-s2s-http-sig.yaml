  content: "   This document defines an HTTP Message Signatures-based profile for\n
    \  workload-to-workload authentication within the WIMSE (Workload\n   Identity
    in Multi System Environments) architecture.  This profile\n   uses the Workload
    Identity Token (WIT) combined with HTTP Message\n   Signatures to provide cryptographic
    proof of possession and message\n   integrity protection.  The profile leverages
    RFC 9421 to sign HTTP\n   requests and optionally responses, ensuring that workloads
    can\n   authenticate each other and verify message integrity at the\n   application
    level, particularly in environments where end-to-end TLS\n   is not feasible due
    to middleboxes or other infrastructure\n   constraints.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an HTTP Message Signatures-based profile for
    workload-to-workload authentication within the WIMSE (Workload Identity in Multi
    System Environments) architecture. This profile uses the Workload Identity Token
    (WIT) combined with HTTP Message Signatures to provide cryptographic proof of
    possession and message integrity protection. The profile leverages RFC 9421 to
    sign HTTP requests and optionally responses, ensuring that workloads can authenticate
    each other and verify message integrity at the application level, particularly
    in environments where end-to-end TLS is not feasible due to middleboxes or other
    infrastructure constraints.</p>"

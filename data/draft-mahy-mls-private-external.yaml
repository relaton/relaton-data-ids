abstract:
- content: "<p>MLS groups that use private handshakes lose member privacy when sending
    external proposals. This document addresses this shortcoming by encrypting external
    proposals using an HPKE public key derived from the epoch secret. It also provides
    a mechanism to share this key and protect it from tampering by a malicious intermediary.</p>"

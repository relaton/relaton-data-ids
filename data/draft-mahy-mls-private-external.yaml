  content: "   MLS groups that use private handshakes lose member privacy when\n   sending
    external proposals.  This document addresses this shortcoming\n   by encrypting
    external proposals using an HPKE public key derived\n   from the epoch secret.
    \ It also provides a mechanism to share this\n   key and protect it from tampering
    by a malicious intermediary.\n\n\t "

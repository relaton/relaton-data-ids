- language: en

  content: "   IP makes certain assumptions about the L2 forwarding behavior of a\n
    \  multi-access IP link.  However, there are several forms of\n   intentional
    partitioning of links ranging from split-horizon to\n   Private VLANs that violate
    some of those assumptions.  This document\n   specifies that link behavior and
    how IP handles links with those\n   properties.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines an extension to the FTP service whereby an FTP client
    may indicate an authentication mechanism to the server, perform an authentication
    protocol exchange, and optionally negotiate a protection mechanism for subsequent
    protocol interactions.  This extension is a counterproposal to the extensions
    documented in the work-in-progress draft-ietf-cat-ftpsec-NN.txt and is offered
    to the IETF CAT working group for consideration as a replacement for that work-in-progress.
    \ The authentication and protection mechanisms used by this extension are those
    used by the IMAP4 protocol.\n\t "

  content: "   Communications security has been at the center of many security\n   improvements
    in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that\n   communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers.\n   This document recommends that this
    is no longer alone sufficient to\n   cater for the security and privacy issues
    seen on the Internet today.\n   For instance, it is often also necessary to protect
    against endpoints\n   that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply
    do not\n   align with the interests of users.  While such protection is\n   difficult,
    there are some measures that can be taken.  It is\n   important to consider the
    role of data passed to various parties -\n   including the primary protocol participants
    - and balance the\n   information given to them considering their roles and possible\n
    \  compromise of the information.\n\n\t "

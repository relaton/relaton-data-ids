  content: "This memorandum discusses the requirements for telephony\nsignaling and
    device control over the Internet from the\nperspective of meeting the needs of
    Internet service providers\n(ISPs) and telecom carriers wishing to provide Internet
    services\nthat include telephony. The requirements apply equally to various\nInternet
    telephony and non-Internet telephony devices. For the\npurpose of this Internet
    draft, the notion of telephony is\nbroadened to include control of other types
    of streaming media\nsessions, such as RTSP based media server device control.
    Rather\nthan severely restricting the device control framework to a\nparticular
    set of devices, such as IP telephony gateways and\ntelephony network access servers,
    this Internet draft presents\nrequirements that are broad enough to satisfy the
    needs of any\ndevice that is expected to provide telephony and related\nservices
    on the Internet.\n\n\t "

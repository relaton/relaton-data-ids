  content: "The purpose of this document is to inform the Internet community of\nthe
    TCP optimization techniques that were found useful for\ntransmitting data over
    the CDMA2000 1x network. Our recommendations\nare based on lab measurements and
    simulations of FTP data\ntransmissions over the CDMA2000 1x systems. Same recommendations\ncould
    be applicable to networks with similar characteristics (e.g.,\nW-CDMA, GPRS, etc.)
    and therefore could be incorporated into the\nexisting document addressing performance
    implications of 2.5G/3G\nnetworks [3].\nThis document does not specify an Internet
    standard and it does not\npropose any changes to an Internet standard.\n\t "

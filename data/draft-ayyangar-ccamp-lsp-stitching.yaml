  content: "In certain scenarios, there may be a need to combine together two\ndifferent
    Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label\nSwitched Paths (LSPs)
    such that in the data plane, a single end-to-end\n(e2e) LSP is achieved and all
    traffic from one LSP is switched onto the\nother LSP. We will refer to this as
    \"LSP stitching\". This document\ncovers cases where: a) the node performing the
    stitching does not\nrequire configuration of every LSP pair to be stitched together
    b) the\nnode performing the stitching is not the egress of any of the LSPs c)\nLSP
    stitching not only results in an end-to-end LSP in the data plane,\nbut there
    is also a corresponding end-to-end LSP (RSVP session) in the\ncontrol plane. It
    might be possible to configure a GMPLS node to switch\nthe traffic from an LSP
    for which it is the egress, to another LSP for\nwhich it is the ingress, without
    requiring any signaling or routing\nextensions whatsoever, completely transparent
    to other nodes. This will\nalso result in LSP stitching in the data plane. However,
    this document\ndoes not cover this scenario of LSP stitching.\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option type used as an\nexplicit
    security label. The hosts supporting Labeled Security\nadd this option to the
    packets they originate in order to convey the \nsensitivity of the data. The routers
    that recognize this\noption will use it to make routing decision, in conformance
    with a\npre-established policy. The IPSec protection requirements and a\ntransition
    scheme from the existing IPv4 security options to the LS\noption are also proposed.\n\n\t "

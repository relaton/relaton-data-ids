  content: "The text/plain media type is defined to represent plain text where\n     the
    CRLF sequence represents a line break [MIME-IMT].  Many modern\n     computer
    systems have a different concept of ``plain text'' from\n     the systems where
    the text/plain media type originated.  These\n     modern systems usually use
    a proportional-spaced font and use CRLF\n     to represent paragraph breaks.  Numerous
    software products have\n     erroneously labelled this media type as text/plain.
    \ In order to\n     correct this interoperability problem, the text/paragraph
    media\n     type is defined.\n \n     [NOTE: This proposal may be discussed publicly
    on the ietf-\n     822@imc.org mailing list.  The subscription address is ietf-822-\n
    \    request@imc.org.]\n\t "

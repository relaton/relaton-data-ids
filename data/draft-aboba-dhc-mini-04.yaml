  content: "Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is a need for\nsimple
    mechanisms of IPv4 address allocation and name resolution. This\ndocument describes
    the behavior of the mini-DHCP server, a small scale\nDHCP server that is typically
    implemented as part of a home gateway.\n\nAs described in this document, the mini-DHCP
    server is capable of\nallocating addresses either in single or multi-segment networks.
    It\nsupports dynamic DNS, and is capable of automatically detecting the\npresence
    of a full-fledged DHCP server, or other mini-DHCP servers, and\nshutting down
    as required.\n\t "

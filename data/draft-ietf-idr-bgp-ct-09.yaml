  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as \"Intent Driven\n
    \  Service Mapping\" to express association of overlay routes with\n   underlay
    routes satisfying a certain SLA using BGP.  The document\n   describes a framework
    for classifying underlay routes into transport\n   classes and mapping service
    routes to a specific transport class.\n\n   The \"Transport class\" construct
    maps to a desired SLA and can be used\n   to realize the \"Topology Slice\" in
    5G Network slicing architecture.\n\n   This document specifies BGP protocol procedures
    that enable\n   dissemination of such service mapping information that may span\n
    \  multiple cooperating administrative domains.  These domains may be\n   administered
    by the same provider or by closely co-ordinating\n   provider networks.\n\n   A
    new BGP transport layer address family (SAFI 76) is defined for\n   this purpose
    that uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI\n   encoding.  This new
    address family is called \"BGP Classful\n   Transport\", aka BGP CT.\n\n   BGP
    CT makes it possible to advertise multiple tunnels to the same\n   destination
    address, thus avoiding need of multiple loopbacks on the\n   egress node.\n\n
    \  It carries transport prefixes across tunnel domain boundaries (e.g.\n   in
    Inter-AS Option-C networks), which is parallel to BGP LU (SAFI 4).\n   It disseminates
    \"Transport class\" information for the transport\n   prefixes across the participating
    domains, which is not possible with\n   BGP LU.  This makes the end-to-end network
    a \"Transport Class\" aware\n   tunneled network.\n\n   Just like BGP LU (SAFI
    4), BGP CT family (SAFI 76) is used in inter-\n   AS option-C networks.  The Service
    Mapping procedures described in\n   this document apply in the same manner to
    Intra-AS service endpoints\n   as well as Inter-AS option-A, option-B, option-C
    variations.\n   Examples of these variations are given in Appendix A.\n\n\n\t "

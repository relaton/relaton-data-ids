  content: "   Current debate on pervasive monitoring often focus on passive attacks\n
    \  on the protocol and transport layers but even if these issues were\n   eliminated
    through the judicious use of encryption, roughly the same\n   information would
    still be available to an attacker who is able to\n   (legally or otherwise) obtain
    access to linked data sets which are\n   being maintained by large content and
    service providers.\n\n\t "

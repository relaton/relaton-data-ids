  content: "   The traditional hierarchical structure of cellular networks has led\n
    \  to deployment models which are heavily centralized.  Mobility\n   management
    with centralized mobility anchoring in existing\n   hierarchical mobile networks
    is quite prone to suboptimal routing and\n   issues related to scalability.  Centralized
    functions present a\n   single point of failure, and inevitably introduce longer
    delays and\n   higher signaling loads for network operations related to mobility\n
    \  management.  This document defines the requirements for distributed\n   mobility
    management for IPv6 deployment.  The objectives are to match\n   the mobility
    deployment with the current trend in network evolution,\n   to improve scalability,
    to avoid single point of failure, to enable\n   transparency to upper layers only
    when needed, etc.  The distributed\n   mobility management also needs to be compatible
    with existing network\n   deployments and end hosts, and be secured.\n\n\t "

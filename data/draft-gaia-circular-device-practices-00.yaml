  content: "   This document systematizes operational practices observed across\n
    \  multiple community-centred deployments that aim to improve meaningful\n   connectivity
    and digital sovereignty through the circular management\n   of end-user and network
    devices.  It is published as an Informational\n   RFC on the IRTF stream and does
    not define Internet standards or\n   protocol requirements.\n\n   The document
    addresses a foundational but often overlooked dependency\n   of Internet access
    deployments: the availability, repairability,\n   governance, and lifecycle management
    of network and user devices\n   required to meaningfully use access networks.
    \ It is based on\n   operational experience from deployments in Spain, Argentina,
    and\n   Senegal—including eReuse.org, EKOA/UNLP, Solidança, TAU/RAEE, and\n   Hahatay.
    \ It describes practices that have demonstrated positive\n   access, social, and
    environmental outcomes.\n\n   These practices are presented as descriptive guidance
    derived from\n   operational experience rather than as normative requirements.
    \ They\n   complement research within the IRTF GAIA Research Group by\n   documenting
    reproducible approaches that improve the sustainability,\n   autonomy, and long-term
    viability of Internet access in underserved\n   contexts.\n\n\t "

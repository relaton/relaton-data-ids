  content: "   To build digital twin networks based on the digital twin network\n
    \  architecture in [DTNConcept], modeling of digital twins and virtual-\n   physical
    mapping are critical.  There are many ways to construct\n   network twins, and
    they have different ways to realize virtual-\n   physical mapping and information
    exchange between twins.\n   Constructing a twin of network element that has communication\n
    \  requirement and function like a physical entity is a kind of network\n   modeling.
    \ In this scenario, when implementing virtual-physical\n   mapping and information
    exchange between twins based on network layer\n   communication, It faces problems
    such as large addressing space\n   consumption and low addressing efficiency.\n\n
    \  This document describes an idea to using flexible addressing and\n   protocol
    techniques in digital twin network architecture that can\n   help reduce the complexity
    of digital twin network implementations\n   and improve digital twin network efficiency
    and security.\n\n\t "

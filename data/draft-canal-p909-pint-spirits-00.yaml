  content: "This  document  is  intended  to  provide  input  to the IETF SPIRITS\nWorking
    Group(SPIRITS WG) and to the IETF PINT  Working  Group  (PINT\nWG)  from  the
    \ viewpoint  of  European  network  operators  that are\ninvolved in EURESCOM
    \ P909  Project  'Enabling  Technologies  for  IN\nEvolution and IN-Internet Integration'.
    The input is based on current \nresults that were achieved in the project.  As
    the project title says \nP909 project  deals with IN-Internet integration issues.
    \ The project\nhas defined an architecture for IN-Internet inte gration and  it
    \ has\nselected  and  described  some  IN-Internet  services  which  can  be\ninteresting
    from the business perspective and  challenging  from  the\ntechnical perspective.
    \ \nSome  of  these  services  are 'officially' chartered in IETF: ICW in\nSPIRITS,
    \ Click-to-Dial  (Request  to  Call)  as  well  as   proposed\nConference Service
    in PINT. However, there are additional IN-Internet \nconvergence  services that
    P909 studies and that are included in this\ndocument only as examples.\n\t "

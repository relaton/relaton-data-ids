  content: "   IPFIX protocol has been used to carry Information Elements, which are\n
    \  defined to measure the traffic information and information related to\n   the
    traffic observation point, traffic metering process and the\n   exporting process.
    \ Network or device status are checked through\n   analysing neccessary observed
    information.  Although most of the\n   existing Information Elements are useful
    for network security\n   inspection, they are still not sufficient to determine
    the reasons\n   behind observed events such as for DDOS attack, ICMP attack, and\n
    \  fragment attack.  To allow administrators making effective and quick\n   response
    to the attacks, this document extends the standard\n   Information Elements and
    describes the formats for inspecting network\n   security.\n\n\t "

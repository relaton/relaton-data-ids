  content: "Test engineers take pains to declare all factors that affect a given measurement,
    including intended load, packet length, test duration, and traffic orientation.
    \ However, current benchmarking practice overlooks two factors that have a profound
    impact on test results.  First, existing methodologies do not require the reporting
    of addresses or other test traffic contents, even though these fields can affect
    test results.  Second, \"stuff\" bits and bytes inserted in test traffic by some
    link-layer technologies add significant and variable overhead, which in turn affects
    test results.  This document describes the effects of these factors; recommends
    guidelines for test traffic contents; and offers formulas for determining the
    probability of bit- and byte-stuffing in test traffic.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

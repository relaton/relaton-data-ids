  content: "   Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings (NOMADv6) introduces a set of \n   extensions
    for MIPv6 protocol that allows for intelligent use of \n   multiple points of
    attachment simultaneously, on a mobile node.  It \n   specifies a set of rules
    (filters) communicated to binding agents \n   using binding updates. In turn,
    binding agents use this information \n   to determine whether and where to route
    flows associated with the \n   mobile node. In this manner, it is possible for
    a mobile node to \n   distribute flows or packets of a flow among its available
    points of \n   attachment or to request that such flow is dropped before traversing
    \n   the Internet fabric, with or without notification to their source. \n   These
    extensions mirror a similar extension defined for Mobile IPv4 \n   (NOMADv4) but
    has been extended to cater to the behavior of IPv6. \n\t "

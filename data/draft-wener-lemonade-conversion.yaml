  content: "   This document describes an IMAP extension that allows a client to\n
    \  convert and retrieve message MIME parts on demand. The conversion\n   would
    be from one Content-Type to another. The client can discover\n   the conversion
    set the server supports. It is assumed that there are \n   two distinct phases:
    one, server conversion capability discovery, \n   and two, client retrieval of
    a converted MIME part. In addition\n   to MIME type conversion this document allows
    for compressed body \n   part retrieval as a special case of conversion.\n\t "

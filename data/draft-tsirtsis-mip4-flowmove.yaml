  content: "   Mobile IPv4 allows Mobile Nodes (MN) to create mobility bindings\n
    \  between their Home Address (HoA) and their current Care-of Address\n   (CoA)
    in a Home Agent (HA) so that the HA can redirect traffic for\n   the MN to its
    current location.  This draft extends MIPv4 so that the\n   binding granularity
    is on a per flow basis.  Extensions are defined\n   to allow the registration
    of multiple CoAs and the definition of\n   individual flows.  Individual flows
    can then be pointed to the\n   registered CoAs.\n\n\t "

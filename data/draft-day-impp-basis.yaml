  content: "As of this writing, the IMPP working group has largely reached\nconsensus
    on the requirements for IMPP [Reqts]. In addition, Hudson\n[Issues] has catalogued
    a set of design issues discussed on the\nmailing list.\nThis document proposes
    a starting point for further discussions about\nthe design of the Instant Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (IMPP). It\nis not a fully-specified protocol, but a summary
    of design decisions\non which the authors were able to reach agreement during
    two full days\nof discussion. Our discussions drew on knowledge of operational
    and\narchitectural aspects of Activerse Ding!, Lotus Sametime, Microsoft\nExchange
    instant messaging, MSN Messenger, and Zephyr, among other\ndiverse, widely-deployed
    systems supporting presence and/or instant\nmessaging.  We believe that the issues
    on which we reached agreement\nare issues on which the working group as a whole
    should be able to\nquickly reach rough consensus.  We hope that the working group
    will be\nable to adopt these decisions as the basis for further work on\ndesigning
    IMPP; of course, we recognize the possibility that strong\ntechnical arguments
    not hitherto considered may cause the group to\narrive at different decisions
    in some instances.\nWe also identified some areas, primarily related to security,
    in which\nwe were lacking enough information or experience to make a solid\nrecommendation.
    We draw the working group's attention to these issues\nin the hope that others
    can contribute.  \nAlthough we have treated presence and instant messaging in
    the same\ndocument, we believe that these design decisions allow implementors
    to\noffer either service independently of the other.\n\t "

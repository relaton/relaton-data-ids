  content: "   This document proposes a new FADVISE operation for NFSv4.2 to support\n
    \  the posix_fadvise function.  FADVISE will communicate expected\n   application
    behavior to the server, allowing servers to optimize\n   future I/O requests for
    a file.  The posix_fadvise function is\n   supported in Linux and many other operating
    systems and is starting\n   be widely used by applications. In addition, the FADVISE
    operation\n   can communicate other application directions such as the use of\n
    \  direct I/O.\n\n\t "

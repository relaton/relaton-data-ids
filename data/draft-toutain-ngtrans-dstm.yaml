  content: "The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of\nIPv4
    addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4. Nodes\nwill be able
    to be deployed with IPv6 addresses, but will still need\nto communicate with IPv4
    nodes that do not have a dual IP layer\nsupporting both IPv4 and IPv6. This specification
    defines a\nmechanism called 'Assignment of IPv4 Global Addresses to IPv6 hosts'\n(AIIH),
    which will assign an IPv6 host a temporary IPv4 Global\nAddress, which can be
    used to communicate with a host that supports\nIPv4 or IPv4/IPv6. This document
    includes also the definition of a \nDynamic Tunneling Interface (DTI) to ease
    the automatic IPv4 address\nassignment and to remove the IPv4 routing table from
    routers. \nAnother objective is to demonstrate that IPv6 Addresses can\nbe deployed
    now instead of non-Global IPv4 Addresses within an\nIntranet.\n\n\t "

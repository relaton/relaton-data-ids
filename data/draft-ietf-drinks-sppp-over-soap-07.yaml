  content: "   The Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP) is an XML protocol\n
    \  that exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment data\n   into
    Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.\n   Sending XML data
    structures over Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)\n   and HTTP(s) is a widely
    used, de-facto standard for messaging between\n   elements of provisioning systems.
    \ Therefore the combination of SOAP\n   and HTTP(s) as a transport for SPPP is
    a natural fit.  The obvious\n   benefits include leveraging existing industry
    expertise, leveraging\n   existing standards, and a higher probability that existing\n
    \  provisioning systems can be more easily integrated with this\n   protocol.
    \ This document describes the specification for transporting\n   SPPP XML structures
    over SOAP and HTTP(s).\n\n\t "

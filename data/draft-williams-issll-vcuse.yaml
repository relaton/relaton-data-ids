  content: "In this document we present a specification for associating RSVP flows
    with Virtual Connections on an ATM network.  The text in this document is meant
    as an addendum to the text in Subsection 3.2 ``Sending RSVP Messages'' of the
    RSVP specification [Bzb+96].  This document specifies a usage of the Logical Interface
    Handle (LIH) in the RSVP_HOP Class Object when either a host or a router is attached
    to an ATM network.  This document also specifies ATM UNI [For94] signaling semantics
    for associating a switched ATM connection with RSVP flows.  These ATM UNI semantics
    use the Broadband High Layer Information (BHLI) Information Element.\n\t "

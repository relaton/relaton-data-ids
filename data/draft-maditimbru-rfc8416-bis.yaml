  content: "   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a global\n   authorization
    infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet\n   Number Resources (INRs)
    to make verifiable statements about those\n   resources.  Network operators, e.g.,
    Internet Service Providers\n   (ISPs), can use the RPKI to validate BGP route
    origin assertions.\n   ISPs can also use the RPKI to validate the path of a BGP
    route.\n   However, ISPs may want to establish a local view of exceptions to the\n
    \  RPKI data in the form of local filters and additions.  The mechanisms\n   described
    in this document provide a simple way to enable INR holders\n   to establish a
    local, customized view of the RPKI, overriding global\n   RPKI repository data
    as needed.\n\n\t "

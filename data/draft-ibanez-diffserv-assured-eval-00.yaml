  content: "This draft presents a simulation analysis of Assured Service, an end-to-end\nservice
    based on the differentiated services enhancements for IP. Assured\nService has
    been the subject of much discussion in the past year in the IETF,\nbut solid information
    on its applicability to the entire Internet has been\nlacking. This report is
    aimed at providing a first step in this direction.\nAssured Service requires an
    active queue management algorithm with preferential\npacket drop. The RIO algorithm
    (an extension of the RED algorithm) has been\nthe primary method suggested and
    is the one evaluated here. Our results show\nthat Assured Service does not provide
    clearly defined and consistent rate\nguarantees; the advantage gained by connections
    using Assured Service is not\na quantifiable one. Further work would be required
    to determine an appropriate\nuse of the Assured Service. A pdf version of this
    document is available and\nrecommended for the figures it contains.\n\n\t "

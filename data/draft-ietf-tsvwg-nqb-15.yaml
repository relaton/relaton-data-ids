  content: "   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non-\n
    \  Queue-Building Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The purpose of this NQB\n   PHB
    is to provide a separate queue that enables smooth, low-data-\n   rate, application-limited
    traffic flows, which would ordinarily share\n   a queue with bursty and capacity-seeking
    traffic, to avoid the\n   latency, latency variation and loss caused by such traffic.
    \ This PHB\n   is implemented without prioritization and can be implemented without\n
    \  rate policing, making it suitable for environments where the use of\n   these
    features is restricted.  The NQB PHB has been developed\n   primarily for use
    by access network segments, where queuing delays\n   and queuing loss caused by
    Queue-Building protocols are manifested,\n   but its use is not limited to such
    segments.  In particular,\n   applications to cable broadband links, Wi-Fi links,
    and mobile\n   network radio and core segments are discussed.  This document\n
    \  recommends a specific Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to\n   identify
    Non-Queue-Building flows.\n\n\t "

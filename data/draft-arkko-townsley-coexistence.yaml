  content: "When IPv6 was designed, it was expected that the transition from IPv4
    to IPv6 would occur more smoothly and expeditiously than experience has revealed.
    The growth of the IPv4 Internet and predicted depletion of the free pool of IPv4
    address blocks on a foreseeable horizon has highlighted an urgent need to revisit
    IPv6 deployment models. This document provides an overview of deployment scenarios
    with the goal of helping to understand what types of additional tools the industry
    needs to assist in IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence and transition.\n\n This document
    was originally created as input to the Montreal co- existence interim meeting
    in October 2008, which led to the rechartering of the Behave and Softwire working
    groups to take on new IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence work. This document is published
    as a historical record of the thinking at the time, but hopefully will also help
    readers understand the rationale behind current IETF tools for co-existence and
    transition. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

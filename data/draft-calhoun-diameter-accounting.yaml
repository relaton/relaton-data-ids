  content: "The DIAMETER protocol provides Authentication and Authorization for\nnetwork
    access technologies, such as NASREQ, ROAMOPS and Mobile IP.\nThe ROAMOPS WG has
    been working on an accounting data format, called\nAccounting Data Interchange
    Format (ADIF), as a method to transfer\naccounting information over a wide variety
    of transports.\nThis extension describes how accounting records can be securely\ntransmitted
    over the DIAMETER protocol. When combined with the\nStrong Security extension,
    accounting records MAY traverse\nintermediate proxies in a secure fashion and
    is compatible with\nthe referral broker model. This extension allows for both\nreal-time
    and batched accounting transfers.\n\t "

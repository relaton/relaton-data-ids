  content: "   Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network\n
    \  domain that utilizes a set of policies to select network resources\n   and
    obtain a view of potential connectivity across the network.\n\n   Network slicing
    is an approach to network operations that builds on\n   the concept of network
    abstraction to provide programmability,\n   flexibility, and modularity.  It may
    use techniques such as Software\n   Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) to\n   create multiple logical or virtual networks, each
    tailored for a set\n   of services share the same set of requirements.\n\n   Abstraction
    and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) is\n   described in RFC 8453.
    \ It defines an SDN-based architecture that\n   relies on the concept of network
    and service abstraction to detach\n   network and service control from the underlying
    data plane.\n\n   This document outlines the applicability of ACTN to transport
    network\n   slicing in a Traffic Engineering (TE) network that utilizes IETF\n
    \  technology.  It also identifies the features of network slicing not\n   currently
    within the scope of ACTN, and indicates where ACTN might be\n   extended.\n\n\t "

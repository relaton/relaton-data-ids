  content: "This document proposes an extension of  the Quality of Service  (QoS)\narchitecture
    to support differentiated resilience requirements of  IP\nservices.\nSeveral  architectures
    \ offering  Quality  of  Service  in   IP-based\nnetworks are defined by  the
    IETF community.  The two most  important\nof  them  are  the  Integrated  Services
    \ (IntServ)  model  with  the\nResource Reservation  Protocol (RSVP)  as the  recommended
    \ signaling\nprotocol and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) model.  Recently,\nMultiprotocol
    Label  Switching  (MPLS) emerged  introducing  extended\ntraffic engineering methods
    \ into IP and  therefore also may  support\nQoS.\nDue to  the growing  commercial
    importance  of the  Internet and  the\ntransport of mission-critical services,
    \ survivability became a  main\nservice requirement in addition to the traditional
    QoS.\n\t "

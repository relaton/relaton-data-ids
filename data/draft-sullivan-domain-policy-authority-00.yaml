abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Some Internet client entities on the Internet make inferences about\n
    \  the administrative relationships among services on the Internet based\n   on
    the domain names at which they are offered.  At present, it is not\n   possible
    to ascertain organizational administrative boundaries in the\n   DNS, therefore
    such inferences can be erroneous in various ways.\n   Mitigation strategies deployed
    so far will not scale.  The solution\n   presented in this memo is to provide
    a means to make explicit\n   assertions regarding certain administrative relationships
    between\n   domain names.\n\n\t "

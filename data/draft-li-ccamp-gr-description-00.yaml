  content: "The Hello message for the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) has \n
    \  been defined to establish and maintain basic signaling node \n   adjacencies
    for Label Switching Routers (LSRs) participating in a \n   Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) traffic engineered (TE) \n   network. The Hello message has been
    extended for use in Generalized \n   MPLS (GMPLS) network for state recovery of
    control channel or nodal \n   faults. \n\n   GMPLS protocol definitions for RSVP
    also allow a restarting node to \n   learn the label that it previously allocated
    for use on a Label \n   Switching Path (LSP). \n\n   Further RSVP protocol extensions
    have been defined to enable a \n   restarting node to recover full control plane
    state by exchanging \n   RSVP messages with its upstream and downstream neighbors.
    \ \n\n   This document provides an informational clarification of the \n   control
    plane procedures for a GMPLS network when there are \n   multiple node failures,
    and describes how full control plane state \n   can be recovered in different
    scenarios where the order in which \n   the nodes restart is different. \n\n   This
    document does not define any new processes or procedures. All \n   protocol mechanisms
    are already defined in the referenced documents.\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes an extension to the SIP specification.  This\nextension
    adds a new message header that is used to specify the\nduration of a requested
    session.\n \nThe session timer can be used to control the duration of a session\nif,
    for instance, one of the participants in the session wants to\nlimit the cost
    of the session.  It can also be used by stateful SIP\nProxy Servers to track the
    status of sessions for which session state\nexists on the servers. Currently a
    stateful SIP Proxy Server that is\nnot handling the media stream(s) for the session
    has no mechanism to\ndefinitively determine the state of all sessions for which
    it has state.\nWhile the SIP Specification does provide the BYE method for terminating\nthe
    session, there is no mechanism for a SIP Proxy Server to detect the\nend of a
    session when the BYE message is not sent or is lost due to\nnetwork problems.\n\t "

  content: "   Over the past decade, SIP has become a major signaling protocol for\n
    \  voice communications, one which has replaced many traditional\n   telephony
    deployments.  However, interworking SIP with the\n   traditional telephone network
    has ultimately reduced the security of\n   Caller ID systems.  Given the widespread
    interworking of SIP with the\n   telephone network, the lack of effective standards
    for identifying\n   the calling party in a SIP session has granted attackers new
    powers\n   as they impersonate or obscure calling party numbers when\n   orchestrating
    bulk commercial calling schemes, hacking voicemail\n   boxes or even circumventing
    multi-factor authentication systems\n   trusted by banks.  This document therefore
    examines the reasons why\n   providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet
    has proven\n   so difficult, and shows how changes in the last decade may provide
    us\n   with new strategies for attaching a secure identity to SIP sessions.\n\n\t "

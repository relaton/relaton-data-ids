  content: "This is a brief note about pricing the Internet. The focus is the use
    of pricing for usage of the infrastructure for transmitting and receiving IP packets,
    rather than of services such as WWW, FTP, Archie, Gopher etc. In this we propose
    subscription based pricing, and a mechanism based on dynamic host address allocation
    drawn from a set of seperately routed addresses to give priority levels.                                         The
    idea of subscriptions here is not that all service pricing should be achieved
    through subscriptions per se. They are seen as a way of policing priority access
    to service bottlenecks, and thus can be deployed incrementally at weak interconnection
    points in a network, or between ISPs. Users of these subscriptions could easily
    be entire organisations (represented by network numbers, or CIDRized collections
    of network numbers, or ASs and so on). These organisations could employ refinement
    techniques to provide more usage oriented charging if needed.\n\t "

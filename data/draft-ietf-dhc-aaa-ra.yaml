  content: "Recently there has been interest in using DHCP for configuring \nclients
    accessing the Internet through some form of high-speed access \ntechnology such
    as cable or ADSL [DHC-AGENT]. In addition, although \nDHCP was initially designed
    for configuring fixed hosts, proposals \nare being made to enhance DHCP to support
    roaming/mobile clients \n[DHC-ENHANCE]. These two trends have put in evidence
    the need for a \ncoupling between AAA and DHCP. Some initial requirements for
    DHCP/AAA \nhave been proposed in [DHC-AAA]. \nThis document proposes a different
    model in which AAA procedures are \ninvoked not from a DHCP server but from a
    DHCP relay agent to make \nsure that ALL the Internet Access features supported
    by the PPP model \ncan be replicated in a DHCP based Internet Access environment.

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft proposes a unified method to perceive and advertise the\n
    \  running status of computing resources in a Service Awareness Network\n   by
    introducing a distributed database.  The forwarding operation in a\n   fine-grained
    service routing policy is correspondingly defined which\n   is completely decoupled
    from conventional IP routing.  In the scheme\n   proposed, the impact of high
    frequency changes of computing resources\n   is avoided and the compatibility
    of the network is enhanced.\n\n\t "

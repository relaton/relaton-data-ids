  script: Latn
  content: "This document identifies requirements for an end-to-end negotiation\nof
    the Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of each media component of a\nmulti-media
    session at the application level, before requesting the\ntransport layer for bearer
    setup.\nIt is believed that in the future, QoS will be one of the major\ndifferentiators
    in the context of a new generation of multi-media\nservices based on the IP technology.
    As such, QoS cannot be\nconsidered anymore as a matter of bearer handling only,
    but it has\nalso to include the application layer. Moreover, QoS has to be\nconsidered
    as part of the media component description, and\ntherefore, to be negotiated or
    re-negotiated during the session\nlife.\n\t "

  content: "Location-based services, navigation applications, emergency services,\n
    management of equipment in the field, and other location-dependent\nservices need
    geographic location information about a target (user,\nresource or other entity).
    \ There is a need to securely gather and\ntransfer location information for location
    services, protecting the\nprivacy of the individuals involved.\nThis document
    describes the requirements for the geopriv Location\nObject (used to transfer
    location data and perhaps some other\ninformation) and for further IETF protocols
    that use this Location\nObject as an embedded protocol. We focus on authorization,
    integrity\nand privacy requirements.\n\n\t "

  content: "When one extrapolates from the ongoing evolutionary trends of IP \nrouter
    / switch development and its role in the build-out of optical \ncore, edge, access
    and enterprise networks, it is reasonable to \nreach the almost inescapable conclusion
    that within a few years, \nthere will be a complete physical separation of the
    commercial \nequipment embodying various concerns, aspects, roles and functions
    \nof data communications, Namely, \n1. Separate equipment for transport (transmission,
    switching and \nmultiplexing) and traffic forwarding. \n2. Separate equipment
    concerned with control, signaling, traffic \nengineering, provisioning, protection
    and restoration control, as \nwell as, traffic and flow management, (generalized
    'softswitches'). \n3. Separate equipment for network management, operations support,
    \nmeasurement & metering, OAMP, inter-OSS, engineering management \n(including
    performance management, availability management, security \nmanagement, accounting
    management), as well as life cycle support.\n\t "

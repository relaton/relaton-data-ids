  script: Latn
  content: "   Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match the rates\n
    \  of the Ethernet PHY(s).  OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3] was\n   the
    first step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY\n   rates.  OIF
    has recently approved another implementation agreement\n   [OIFFLEXE1] which allows
    complete decoupling of the MAC data rates\n   and the Ethernet PHY(s) that support
    them.  This includes support for\n   (a) MAC rates which are greater than the
    rate of a single PHY\n   (satisfied by bonding of multiple PHY(s)), (b) MAC rates
    rates which\n   are less than the rate of a PHY (sub-rate), (c) support of multiple\n
    \  FlexE client signals carried over a single PHY, or over a collection\n   of
    bonded PHY(s).  This draft catalogs the usecases that are\n   encountered when
    these Flexible rate Ethernet client signals are\n   transported over OTN networks.\n\n\t "

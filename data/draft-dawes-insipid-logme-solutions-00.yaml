  content: "   SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user\n   reported
    problem and for regression testing if network or user agent\n   software is upgraded.
    \ As networks grow and become interconnected,\n   including connection via transit
    networks, it becomes impractical to\n   predict the path that SIP signalling will
    take between user agents,\n   and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling
    end-to-end.\n\n   This draft describes potential solutions to meet requirements
    for\n   adding an indicator to the SIP protocol which can be used to mark\n   signalling
    as of interest to logging.  Such marking will typically be\n   applied as part
    of network testing controlled by the network operator\n   and not used in regular
    user agent signalling.  However, such marking\n   can be carried end-to-end including
    the SIP user agents, even if a\n   session originates and terminates in different
    networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Segment Routing allows a node to steer a packet through an ordered\n
    \  list of instructions, called segments.  The ingress node prepends a\n   SR
    header to a packet containing a set of \"segments\".  A segment can\n   represent
    any instruction topological or service-based.  Segment\n   Routing can be applied
    to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of\n   routing extension header.  A
    segment is encoded as an IPv6 address.\n   An ordered list of segments is encoded
    as an ordered list of IPv6\n   addresses in the routing extension header.  The
    segment to process is\n   indicated by a pointer in the routing extension header.
    \ Upon\n   completion of a segment, the pointer is incremented.  This document\n
    \  describes how to decrease the length of the IPv6 list with ListID\n   carried.\n\n\t "

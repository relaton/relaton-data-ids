  content: "   This document is a historical record of discussions about extending\n
    \  the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol to provide\n   additional
    capabilities to handle Graceful Restart.\n\n   These discussions took place in
    the context of the IETF's BFD working\n   group, and the consensus in that group
    was that these extensions\n   should not be made.\n\n   This document presents
    a summary of the challenges to BFD in\n   surviving a graceful restart, and outlines
    a potential protocol\n   solution that was discussed and rejected within the BFD
    working\n   group.  The purpose of this document is to provide a record of the\n
    \  work done so that future effort will not be wasted.  This document\n   does
    not propose or document any extensions to BFD, and there is no\n   intention that
    it should be implemented in its current form.\n\n\n\t "

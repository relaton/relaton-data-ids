  content: "This document describes a policy, procedure, and control structure for
    the allocation of additional top-level domains The Appendix A.1 of this document
    discusses the issues surrounding additional international top level domains (iTLDs)
    and registries.                                   This document describes policies
    and procedures to o allow open competition in domain name registration in the
    iTLDs,                  o and provide the IANA with a legal and financial umbrella
    \                 Note that while cooperation between competing iTLD registries
    is allowed, it is not required.  This is specifically not assumed in this proposal,
    and is considered to be an operational aspect of a registry best determined, and
    coordinated, by contractual agreements between private interests.\n\t "

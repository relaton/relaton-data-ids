  content: "   The Internet Message Access Protocol requires a client to poll the\n
    \  server for changes to the selected mailbox (new mail, deletions).\n   It's
    often more desirable to have the server transmit updates to the\n   client in
    real time.  This allows a user to see new mail immediately.\n   It also helps
    some real-time applications based on IMAP, which might\n   otherwise need to poll
    extremely often (such as every few seconds).\n   (While the spec actually does
    allow a server to push EXISTS responses\n   asynchronously, a client can't expect
    this behaviour and must poll.)\n   This document specifies the syntax of an IDLE
    command, which will\n   allow a client to tell the server that it's ready to accept
    such\n   real-time updates.\n\t "

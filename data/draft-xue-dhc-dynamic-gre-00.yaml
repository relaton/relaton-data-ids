  content: "   Specifically, WiFi has emerged as an important access technology for\n
    \  Multiple Service Operator (MSO) and mobile service provider.  For\n   mobile
    service provider, WiFi is preferred as a trusted access\n   technology for service.
    \ It has became important to provide simple\n   transition method expected for
    service via WiFi access.  For example,\n   tunnelling on the customer side aims
    at conveying WiFi service\n   between a hotspot and the Service Gateway.  GRE
    tunnel is an\n   increasingly popular encapsulation choice because of simple\n
    \  encapsulation and easy implementation, especially in aforementioned\n   environments.
    \ However, manual configuration is not suitable if there\n   are large numbers
    of the end-points of GRE tunnels.  This document\n   proposes a dynamic-configured
    stateless GRE tunnel, which does not\n   modify encapsulation format of GRE, but
    adds signaling for tunnel\n   parameters discovery, such as address, GRE key etc.\n\n\n\t "

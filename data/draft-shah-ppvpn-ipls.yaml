  content: "A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS] is used to interconnect \nsystems
    across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it \nappear to those systems
    as if they are interconnected on a private \nLAN.  The systems which are interconnected
    in this way may \nthemselves be LAN switches.  If, however, the interconnected
    systems \nare NOT LAN switches, but rather are IP hosts or IP routers, certain
    \nsimplifications are possible.  We call this simplified type of \nvirtual private
    LAN service an 'IP over LAN Service' (IPLS).  In \nIPLS, as in VPLS, LAN interfaces
    are run in promiscuous mode, and \nframes are forwarded based on their MAC Destination
    Addresses. \nHowever, the maintenance of the MAC forwarded tables is done via
    \nsignaling, rather than via the 'MAC Address Learning' procedures of \nIEEE 802.1D.
    \ Further, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages \nare proxied, rather than
    being carried transparently. This draft \nspecifies the protocols and procedures
    for support of the IPLS \nservice.\n\t "

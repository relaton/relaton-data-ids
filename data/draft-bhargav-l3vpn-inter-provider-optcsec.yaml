  content: "   In certain models of inter-provider Multi-Protocol-Label-Switching\n
    \  based Virtual Private Networks (MPLS-VPNs), spoofing attacks against\n   VPN
    sites is a key concern. Unidirectional attacks towards VPN sites\n   can compromise
    servers at the VPN sites and cause Denial-of-Service\n   (DoS) situations. Currently,
    the inner labels associated with VPN\n   sites are not encrypted during transmission.
    The Provider Edge (PE)\n   router at the end to which the VPN customer is attached
    accepts any\n   data packet with a valid label. This enables a man-in-the-middle\n
    \  attacker to spoof a packet to a specific site of a VPN. In this\n   paper,
    we propose some secure techniques which provide security\n   against such label-spoofing.
    These techniques ensure that an attacker\n   would not be able to spoof labeled
    data packets. In order to make the\n   proposed scheme robust, some additional
    steps are proposed over and\n   above the initial steps specified. This makes
    the attacker to spend\n   non-linear time to guess the right label for his unidirectional\n
    \  attacks to succeed. Our proposed technique can be applied to a\n   specific
    type of inter-provider Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) based\n   MPLS VPN and other
    existing variant where Multi-Protocol exterior-\n   BGP (MP-eBGP) multi-hop is
    used. In future, if any other variant is\n   proposed to use MP-eBGP multi-hop,
    our scheme can be used to protect\n   against spoofing attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

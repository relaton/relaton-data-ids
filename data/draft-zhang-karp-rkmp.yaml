- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   When running routing protocols such as BGP or RSVP-TE, two routers\n
    \  need to exchange routing messages in a unicast (one-to-one) fashion.\n   In
    order to authenticate these messages using symmetric cryptography,\n   a secret
    key needs to be established.  This document defines a Router\n   Key Management
    Protocol (RKMP) for establishing and managing such\n   keys for routing protocols.\n\n\n\t "

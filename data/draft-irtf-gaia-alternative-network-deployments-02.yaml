  content: "   This document presents a taxonomy of \"Alternative Network\n   deployments\",
    and a set of definitions and shared properties.  It\n   also surveys the technologies
    employed in these network deployments,\n   and their differing architectural characteristics.\n\n
    \  The term \"Alternative Network Deployments\" includes a set of network\n   access
    models that have emerged in the last decade with the aim of\n   bringing Internet
    connectivity to people, using topological,\n   architectural and business models
    different from the so-called\n   \"traditional\" ones, where a company deploys
    or leases the network\n   infrastructure for connecting the users, who pay a subscription
    fee\n   to be connected and make use of it.\n\n   Several initiatives throughout
    the world have built large scale\n   Alternative Networks, using predominantly
    wireless technologies\n   (including long distance) due to the reduced cost of
    using the\n   unlicensed spectrum.  Wired technologies such as fiber are also
    used\n   in some of these alternate networks.\n\n   The emergence of these networks
    can be motivated by different causes\n   such as the reluctance, or the impossibility,
    of network operators to\n   provide wired and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote
    areas.  In\n   these cases, the networks have self sustainable business models
    that\n   provide more localized communication services as well as Internet\n   backhaul
    support through peering agreements with traditional network\n   operators.  Some
    other times, networks are built as a complement and\n   an alternative to commercial
    Internet access provided by\n   \"traditional\" network operators.\n\n   The present
    classification considers different existing network\n   models such as Community
    Networks, which are self-organized and\n   decentralized networks wholly owned
    by the community; networks owned\n   by individuals who act as Wireless Internet
    Service Providers\n   (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased out to
    network\n   operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved\n
    \  population, and finally there are networks that provide connectivity\n   by
    sharing wireless resources of the users.\n\n   Different criteria are used in
    order to build a classification as\n   e.g., the ownership of the equipment, the
    way the network is\n   organized, the participatory model, the extensibility,
    if they are\n   driven by a community, a company or a local stakeholder (public
    or\n   private), etc.\n\n   According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization
    of each kind\n   of network is presented in terms of specific network characteristics\n
    \  related to architecture, organization, etc.\n\n\t "

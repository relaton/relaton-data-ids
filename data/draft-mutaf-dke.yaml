  content: "This document describes a verbal key exchange protocol in which a\nshort
    fingerprint is used to represent a \"one-time\" public key\nfingerprint.  The
    one-time public key is immediately used for key\nexchange, before an attacker
    has time to find a public/private key\npair that gives the same fingerprint and
    mount a Man-in-the-Middle\nattack.  The protocol, however, requires that both
    users be present\nfor fingerprint verification, making it suitable for mobile
    users\nonly.\n\t "

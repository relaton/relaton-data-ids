  content: "   Over the last year of work, the SIMPLE group has tried to answer the\n
    \  question of \"what is a tuple\".  This document tries to answer that\n   question
    by proposing an abstract data model for presence, and then\n   mapping that data
    model onto the Presence Information Data Format\n   (PIDF).  It then discusses
    the operations of publication,\n   composition, filtering as they relate to presence
    data processing.\n\t "

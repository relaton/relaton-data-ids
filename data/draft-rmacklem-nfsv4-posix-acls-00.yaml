  content: "   This document describes the addition of three new attributes that are\n
    \  used by servers to support POSIX ACLs.  The term POSIX ACLs refers to\n   the
    ACL component of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)\n   1003.1e draft
    17 [IEEE] document for which sponsorship was withdrawn\n   in January 1998.  Although
    the draft POSIX standard that describes\n   these ACLs was never ratified, several
    POSIX based operating systems,\n   such as Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD include
    support for them.  The NFS\n   Version 4 ACLs described in [RFC8881] henseforth
    referred to as NFSv4\n   ACLs, use a different model and attempts to map between
    the ACLs of\n   these two models has not been completely successful.  As such,
    this\n   document proposes three new attributes that may optionally be used by\n
    \  an NFSv4.2 server to support ACLs that conform the afor mentioned\n   POSIX
    1003.1e draft 17.\n\n\t "

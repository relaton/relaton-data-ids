  content: "   This memo explains why the 6to4 specifications are being reclassified\n
    \  as Experimental protocols.  It also makes recommendations for\n   limiting
    the scope of continued use of 6to4 for those wishing to use\n   it.  These recommendations
    are being made in light of decreasing\n   applicability of 6to4 and of operational
    problems associated with its\n   use.\n\n\t "

  content: "Current SIP messages are text based and inherently large, especially\nwhen
    these messages are to be transmitted over the bandwidth-strained\nwireless access
    technologies (a typical orginiating SIP Invite is \nabout 1200 bytes). \n\nFor
    most wireless technologies, transmitting the session initiation \nmessages (such
    as SIP Invite) over the signaling channel can reduce \nthe call setup time substantially.
    The size limitation of these \nwireless signaling channels are typically very
    small (~210 bytes in \nthe uplink and ~110 bytes in the downlink).\nTo address
    this problem, a new function called Encoding Assitant    \n(EA) has been introduced
    in the User Agent (UA) and in the \nSIP Proxy server within the network. Additionally,
    the method \nprovided in this document defines new SIP option tags and headers.
    \nThese new option tags and headers allow the UA and a SIP Proxy \nserver within
    the network (such as the P-CSCF), to exchange \ninformation using the signaling
    channels supported by most wireless \naccess networks.\n\n\t "

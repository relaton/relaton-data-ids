  content: "Endpoint congestion avoidance and control mechanisms typically rely\non
    measured network performance parameters such as the round-trip-\ntime and packet
    loss seen by the receiver, without any explicit help\nfrom the network. Packet
    loss being the primary congestion indicator,\nthese approaches first need to exceed
    the available network capacity\nto obtain the information needed to react. Additionally,
    relying on\npacket loss leads to misinterpretation of transmission errors as a\nsign
    of congestion.\n\t "

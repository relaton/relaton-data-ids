abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been much discussion over the last years about the overall
    scalability of the Internet routing system. Some have argued that the resources
    required to maintain routing tables in the core of the Internet are growing faster
    than available technology will be able to keep up. Others disagree with that assessment.
    This document attempts to describe the factors that are placing pressure on the
    routing system and the growth trends behind those factors.</p>"

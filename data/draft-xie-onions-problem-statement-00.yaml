abstract:
- content: "<p>YANG-based service APIs are widely used to expose network and service
    abstractions to external systems such as controllers, orchestration platforms,
    and OSS/BSS applications. Despite the availability of numerous YANG data models
    and YANG-to-API tools, operators continue to face significant challenges in operationalizing
    these APIs in a consistent, scalable, and interoperable manner. APIs derived from
    similar YANG models often differ in semantics, lifecycle behavior, observability,
    and consumption patterns, complicating automation and cross-vendor integration.
    This document describes the problem space associated with operationalizing YANG-based
    service APIs, drawing on operator experience, IAB workshop findings, and IETF
    applicability studies to highlight gaps in current practices and motivate requirements
    for improving API predictability and operational effectiveness, without defining
    specific solutions, protocols, or tools.</p>"

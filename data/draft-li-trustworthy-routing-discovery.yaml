  content: "   End users with high security and privacy requirements expect their\n
    \  data to be transmitted only through trusted devices to mitigate the\n   risk
    of data leakage.  Therefore, the development of trustworthy\n   routing mechanisms
    is anticipated to be a key trend in the future\n   evolution of the internet.
    \ This specification describes a network\n   architecture that supports trustworthy
    routing and a scheme for\n   carrying trustworthy routing information (TRI) using
    the BGP and\n   BGPsec protocols.\n\n\t "

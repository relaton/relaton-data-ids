  content: "This contribution proposes modifications to the LDP and CR-LDP \nprotocols
    that allow an LDP or CR-LDP session to be reestablished \nusing a new TCP connection
    if the old TCP connection goes down \nunexpectedly. It also proposes that, in
    certain situations, an LSR \ncontinue to use the label bindings associated with
    a session for a \nshort time after the session goes down, to allow forwarding
    to \ncontinue uninterrupted while the two peer LSRs attempt to \nreestablish the
    session. These modifications allow an LSR to easily \nimplement hitless software
    upgrades and hitless activity switches.\n\n\t "

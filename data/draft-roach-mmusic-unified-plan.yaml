  script: Latn
  content: "   A recurrent theme in emerging real-time communications use cases,\n
    \  such as RTCWEB, has been the need to handle very large numbers of\n   media
    flows.  Unfortunately, naive uses of SDP do not handle this\n   case particularly
    well.  This document describes a modest set of\n   extensions to SDP which allow
    it to cleanly handle arbitrary numbers\n   of flows while still retaining a large
    degree of backward\n   compatibility with existing and non-RTCWEB endpoints.\n\n\t "

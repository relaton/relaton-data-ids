  content: "   In cognitive sensor networks, the cooperative spectrum sensing can\n
    \  effectively improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing. However, it is\n   also
    facing with the security issues caused by attacks of potential\n   malicious  users.
    \ Lots  of  algorithms  are  proposed  in  existing\n   literatures  to  cope
    \ with  the  potential  attacks.  However,  the\n   traditional strategies are
    mainly suitable for relative simple and\n   ideal attack such as the all \"1\"
    or all \"0\" attack. Therefore, we\n   define a more universal anti Spectrum Sensing
    Data Falsification\n   (SSDF) framework in the document, which can better cope
    with the\n   probabilistic attacks and random attacks which are closer to the\n
    \  reality.\n\n\t "

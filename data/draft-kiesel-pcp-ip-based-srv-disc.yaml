  content: "   The Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how\n
    \  incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as Network\n   Address
    Translator IPv6/IPv4 (NAT64), Network Address Translator\n   IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44),
    IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices, and a mechanism to\n   reduce application keep
    alive traffic.\n\n   This document establishes a well-known IP address for the
    PCP Server\n   and documents how PCP clients embedded in endpoints can use it
    during\n   the discovery and regular operation phases.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document summarizes and standardizes methods for remotely\n   measuring
    a network's IP spoofing capability.  For outbound spoofing\n   capability measurement,
    i.e., whether the network allows IP spoofing\n   traffic to be sent from inside
    the network to the outside of the\n   network, DNS traceroute can be used to check
    whether spoofed packets\n   are generated in the network and sent to outside of
    the network.  For\n   inbound spoofing capability measurment, i.e., whether the
    network\n   allows IP spoofing traffic from the outside the network to arrive\n
    \  inside, DNS resolver and ICMPv6 rate limiting mechanism can be\n   utilized
    to check whether spoofed packets are received by devices in\n   the network.\n\n\t "

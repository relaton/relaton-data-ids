  content: "\n   ENUM possesses the feature of E.164 number authenticity, therefore
    by\n   being carried with initiation signal of application services, ENUM\n   number
    can be used to identify originer.\n\n   The service initiation signal includes
    sender's (originer's) un-\n   encrypted ENUM number and encrypted ENUM number,
    or some other\n   information needed by specific applications, then receiver decrypts\n
    \  encrypted ENUM number and compares decrypted result with the un-\n   encrypted
    ENUM number to authenticate the originer's identity.\n\n\t "

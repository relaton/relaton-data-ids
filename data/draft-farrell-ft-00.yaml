- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo proposes an optional fast-track way to get from a working\n
    \  group document to IESG review that can be used for cases when a\n   working
    group chair believes that there is open-source running code\n   that implements
    a working group Internet-Draft.  The basic idea is to\n   do all of working group
    last call, IETF last call and area director\n   review during the same two week
    period, and to impose a higher\n   barrier for comments that might block progress.
    \ The motivation is to\n   offer a reward for running code, consistent with the
    IETF's overall\n   philosophy of running code and rough consensus.  This version
    is an\n   initial draft solely proposed by the author (and not the IESG) to\n
    \  attempt to ascertain if there is enough interest in this to warrant\n   trying
    out the idea as an RFC 3933 process experiment.\n\n\t "

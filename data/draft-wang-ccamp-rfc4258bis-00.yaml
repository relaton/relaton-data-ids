  content: "   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of\n   protocols
    has been defined to control different switching\n   technologies as well as different
    applications.  These include\n   support for requesting Time Division Multiplexing
    (TDM) connections\n   including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous
    Digital\n   Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).\n\n   Along
    with the development of technology, some new routing\n   requirements which are
    addressed in G.7715.1 emerge.  This document\n   concentrates on the new routing
    requirements addressed in G.7715.1\n   and placed on the GMPLS suite of protocols
    in order to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities of an Automatically
    Switched Optical\n   Network (ASON) as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n\t "

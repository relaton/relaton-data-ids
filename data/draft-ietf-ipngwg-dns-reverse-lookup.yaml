  content: "     This document proposes a new mechanism to represent inverse address\n
    \    mapping in the Domain Name System (DNS) for IP version 6 (IPv6).\n     Documented
    in here are the changes needed for securing the binding\n     and delegation of
    address ranges, to facilitate queries for the\n     binding of address to host
    name. This document also defines a\n     mechanism for dumb resolvers to query
    directly for the binding.\n \n     The changes include a new resource record to
    delegate the address\n     space in segments based on arbitrary bit boundaries.
    This proposal\n     provides a mechanism that is self checking and can be traversed\n
    \    from both top and bottom. Additional processing requirements on\n     IPv6
    aware resolvers and servers are defined.\n\n\t "

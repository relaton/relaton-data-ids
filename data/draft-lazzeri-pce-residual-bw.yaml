  content: "      The PCEP protocol has objective functions to optimize path\n   attributes
    like the residual bandwidth. While this is enough for\n   some applications, it's
    not possible to return the computed values\n   of such attributes to the PCC,
    or put bounds on them.\n      This document describes extensions to the PCE Communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP) providing new path-related bandwidth metrics\n   allowing a
    PCE to compute paths taking into account and returning to\n   the PCC information
    about the remaining bandwidth along the computed\n   paths.\n\n\t "

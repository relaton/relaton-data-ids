  script: Latn
  content: "   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing\n
    \  multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session\n   invitation,
    and other forms of multimedia session initiation.\n   Together with Offer/Answer
    model it defines a mechanism, how two\n   entities can reach a common view of
    a multimedia session between\n   them.\n\n   In certain cases, there are dependencies
    between media streams, for\n   example a text stream for subtitling make sense
    only together with a\n   video stream.  To avoid senseless connections, the SDP
    mechanism can\n   be extended with a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-level\n
    \  attribute: \"dependency\".  The \"dependency\" attribute allows the\n   offerer
    to define dependencies of media streams.  The updated offer/\n   answer mechanism
    used with new \"dependency\" attribute can be used\n   furthermore, that in a
    multi-party SIP session all participants share\n   at least one common media type.\n\n\n\t "

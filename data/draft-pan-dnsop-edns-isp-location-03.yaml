  content: "   Nowadays, many Authoritative Nameservers support GeoIP feature, they\n
    \  guess the user's geolocation by the client subnet of EDNS Client\n   Subnet
    (ECS) or by the source IP address of DNS query, return tailor\n   DNS response
    based on the user's geolocation.  However, ECS raises\n   some privacy concerns
    because it leaks client subnet information on\n   the resolution path to the Authoritative
    Nameserver.\n\n   This document is inspired by EDNS Client Subnet (ECS), describes
    an\n   improved solution for GeoIP-enabled Authoritative Nameservers,\n   defines
    an EDNS ISP Location (EIL) extension to address the privacy\n   problem of ECS,
    tries to find the right balance between privacy\n   improvement and user experience
    optimization.\n\n   EIL is defined to convey isp location < COUNTRY, AREA, ISP
    >\n   information that is relevant to the DNS message.  It will directly\n   provide
    the same sufficient information for the GeoIP-enabled\n   Authoritative Nameserver
    as ECS, to decide the response without\n   guessing geolocation of the IP address.\n\n\t "

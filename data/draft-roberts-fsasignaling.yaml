  content: "The concepts in this document are based on work on\nQ.Flowstatesig in
    the ITU SG11/Q5. Flow State Aware Signaling\nhas been worked on in the ITU for
    the past 13 years. However,\nthis document stands on its own since no IETF compatible
    format\nhas yet been adopted. The goal of this protocol is to provide\n(1) a technique
    to have network nodes provide available rate\nflows (like TCP) rapid and periodic
    feedback to the sender as to\nthe maximum rate they should send and (2) to provide
    network\nfeedback to fixed rate flows (like UDP voice) if the peak rate\nthey
    require can be statistically assured. Network traffic using\nthis protocol should
    experience reduced response time, less\nqueuing delay and less packet discards.
    The use of this protocol\nis limited to bounded subnets at the network edge and
    is to be\nconverted to and from standard IP flows at the subnet\nboundaries.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes starting a work within the IETF to apply the\n
    \  Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane to\n   Ethernet
    Label Switching and to make extensions to the GMPLS control\n   plane protocols
    as necessary for this application.  This will be done\n   based on the protocols
    developed by the MPLS and CCAMP working groups\n   in the IETF.  Ethernet Label
    Switching will use the data plane\n   encodings as specified by the IEEE 802 standards.\n\n
    \  This document intends to gather the information necessary to have a\n   \"GMPLS
    Ethernet Label Switching\" BoF in Vancouver.\n\t "

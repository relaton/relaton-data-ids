  content: "This document presents an application of the BGP community attribute [2]
    in simplifying the implementation and configuration of routing policies in the
    multi-provider Internet. It shows how the community based configuration can be
    used to replace the AS-based customization of the BGP 'LOCAL_PREF' attribute,
    a common method used today.  Not only does the technique presented simplifies
    configuration and management at the provider level, it also represents a paradigm
    shift in that it gives the potential for the customer to control its own routing
    policy with respect to its service provider, as well as providing the ability
    for policy configuration to be done at a prefix based granularity rather than
    the more common AS based granularity.\n\t "

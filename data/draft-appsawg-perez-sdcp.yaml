  content: "   This memorandum describes SDCP, a protocol to control multimedia\n
    \  streaming in cases where streaming generation should be distributed\n   to
    improve performance.  This is especially useful for Human-Things\n   streams.
    \ Usually, real time applications such as virtual reality\n   generate a user-controlled
    multimedia streaming.  This is a time\n   continuous data flux that could be divided
    spatially to distribute\n   processing, memory or network resources.  This protocol
    does not\n   describe streaming communication, but the control of each single\n
    \  streaming generation in a best-effort by many nodes or things.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides additional informational material related to\n
    \  RBridges, which are devices that implement the TRILL protocol. It is\n   a
    supplement to the RBridges base protocol specification and includes\n   discussion
    of tradeoffs in some features and configurations of\n   RBridges. In addition,
    it provides a sketch of a proof that, with\n   reasonable assumptions, persistent
    loops do not occur in a TRILL\n   campus.\n\t "

  content: "In this memo, a mechanism that was developed for detection of network\nattachement
    is documented for future reference.  This memo is an\ninformational document and
    thus does not define a new standard.  The\nmechanism proposed in this experimental
    RFC requires the hosts to\nmonitor all the prefixes advertised on the link and
    use it for link\nidentification in the presence of non-DNAv6 routers is presented.
    \ A\nmore efficient link-identification mechanism requiring the DNAv6\nrouters
    to monitor the link for advertised prefixes to assist the\nhosts in link identification
    combined with a fast router\nadvertisement mechanism that selects the order of
    response for the\nrouter deterministically is also presented.\n\t "

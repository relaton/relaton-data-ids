- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Commonly used networking APIs are currently limited by the transport\n
    \  layer's inability to expose services instead of protocols.  An API/\n   application/user
    is therefore forced to use exactly the services that\n   are implemented by the
    selected transport.  This document surveys\n   networking APIs and discusses how
    they can be improved by a more\n   expressive transport layer that hides and automatizes
    the choice of\n   the transport protocol.\n\n\t "

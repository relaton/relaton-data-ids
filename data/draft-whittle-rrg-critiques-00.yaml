  content: "This ID will contain the full-length versions of all critiques which\nwere
    not included in full in the RRG Report.  It may also point to\ndiscussions I consider
    significant, and include any \"rebuttals\" or\n\"reflections\" which were not
    included in full in the Report.  This ID\nis to support and document the IRTF
    Routing Research Group\ndiscussions concerning scalable routing, in early 2010.
    \ It is not a\nformal product of the RRG.  To what extent its contents are supported\nby
    RRG consensus can only be determined by the co-chairs.\n\t "

  content: "Due to the extremely large scale of P2P overlay networks, complexity \nhas
    become a major issue. With the number of connected nodes reaching \ninto the millions,
    a platform which can accurately simulate an \noverlay  network  is  important.
    \ Many  freely  available  network \nsimulators exist, ranging from modelling
    networks at the packet level \nto  concentrating  purely  on  the  overlay  network.
    \ The  following \ndocument provides an overview of these simulators, documenting
    the \nmaximum number of simulated nodes achieved in experiments, the P2P \noverlay
    \ architectures  modelled  and  the  chosen  implementation \nlanguage. \n\n\t "

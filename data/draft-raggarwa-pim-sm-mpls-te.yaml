  content: "This document describes procedures for IP multicast over a MPLS\nTraffic
    Engineered (TE) core. The defined procedures apply when the\nProvider Edge (PE)
    routers are running PIM-SM to exchange multicast\nrouting information with the
    Customer Edge (CE) routers. Point to\nmultipoint (P2MP) MPLS TE LSPs are used
    in the network core. The\nprocedures described make use of the PIM-SM remote neighbor\nextensions
    described in [PIM-SM-REMOTE].\n\t "

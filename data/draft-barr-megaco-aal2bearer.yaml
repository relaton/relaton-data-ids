  content: "This document proposes specific procedures that Media Gateways (MGs) \nshall
    follow for AAL2 bearer-path establishment under the control of \nH.248 (Megaco)
    capable Media Gateway Controllers (MGCs).  The \nprocedures cover MGs which use
    provisioned VCCs and backward call \nsetup mode dynamic SVCs, and which do not
    use AAL2 signalling (i.e. \nno Q.2630.x). \nAlthough this document refers to the
    use of the H.248 (Megaco) \ngateway control protocol, many of the concepts and
    procedures are \nnot specific to this protocol.\n\t "

  content: "   When professionals travel for business, they carry identity\n   documents,
    such as passports, employer related payment capabilites,\n   such as corporate
    credit cards, and security keys that might be used\n   for both personal or professional
    reasons, such as hotel or car keys.\n\n   These credentials might be stored in
    a purse, briefcase or wallet.\n\n   Digital storage systems struggle to support
    the various credential\n   formats, physical proximity and remote presentation
    protocols, and\n   assurance capabilities needed to enable international business.\n\n
    \  Device capabilities, cost and power consumption can preclude access\n   and
    adoption of digital credentials, or exclude communities that\n   require higher
    than normal privacy, sustainability, or availability\n   guarantees.\n\n   This
    specification describes a scalable solution to digital\n   credentials, that is
    market friendly, transport agnostic, privacy\n   oriented, and accountable to
    users of digital credentials above all\n   other stakeholders.\n\n\t "

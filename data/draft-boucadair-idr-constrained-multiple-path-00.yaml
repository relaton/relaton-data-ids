  content: "It is commonly agreed the continuous increase of routing tables is a\nsensitive
    issue which may question the sustainability of the\nInternet.  This document describes
    a solution which makes use of\nmultiple paths without inducing drastic increase
    of routing tables.\nA constrained procedure to install additional paths in the
    RIB is\ndescribed.  Multiple paths are installed according to rules agreed\nbetween
    adjacent peers and also based on external events (e.g., pro-\nactive detection
    of link congestion).\n\t "

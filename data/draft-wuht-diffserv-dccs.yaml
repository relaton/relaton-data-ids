  content: "This draft considers the potentially negative impacts of an \nincreasing
    deployment of non-congestion-controlled or non-responsive \ntraffic on the Internet.
    Traffic unresponsiveness could bring \nextremely unfairness against responsive
    TCP traffic and great service \ndegradation. Differentiated Services (DS)[5,6],
    which has been \nproposed by IETF recently, aims to provide a scalable service
    \ndifferentiation in the Internet that can be used for differentiated \npayment.
    We argue that this could add the incentives of their \ncustomer to use unresponsive
    flow to achieve better service assurance \nagainst the competing traffic. \n\n\t "

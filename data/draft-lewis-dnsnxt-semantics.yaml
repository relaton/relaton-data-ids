  content: "In 'Domain Name System Security Extensions' (RFC 2065) the NXT Resource
    Record (along with SIG RR and KEY RR) is introduced to allow for secure denial
    of existence of either a domain name or a RRSet belonging to an existing domain
    name.  The set of NXT records within a zone create a virtual 'chain' of RRSets
    within a zone by indicating, for each name within a zone, the RRSets for which
    it owns records and the next name in the zone.                                                                  RFC
    2065 discusses security extensions for static DNS zones.  An Internet Draft, draft-ietf-dnssec-update-04.txt,
    becoming an RFC describes security in DNS zone which can be dynamically updated.
    \ In this document, the authors build upon them to:  - define some terms used
    colloquially in the working group - describe the semantics of the NXT record in
    greater detail than the two existing documents, in order to achieve interoperability
    \ - introduce and discuss unresolved issues involving NXT records\n\t "

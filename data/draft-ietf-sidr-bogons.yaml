  content: "This document defines a standard profile for Bogon Origin\nAttestations
    (BOAs).  A BOA is a digitally signed object that\nprovides a means of verifying
    that an IP address block holder has not\nauthorised any Autonomous System (AS)
    to originate routes that are\nequivalent to any of the addresses listed in the
    BOA.  A BOA also\nprovides a means of verifying that a BGP speaker is not using
    an AS\nwithout appropriate authority.  The proposed application of BOAs is\nintended
    to fit within the requirements for adding security measures\nto inter-domain routing,
    including the ability to support incremental\nand piecemeal deployment of such
    measures, and does not require any\nchanges to the specification of the Border
    Gateway Protocol.\n\t "

  content: "Since the introduction of private addresses[1] the use of NATs and \nfirewalls
    has introduced not only inability to communicate using \ncertain mechanisms, such
    as AH[2], ESP[3], and H.323[4], but also \ndifficulty in determining the reason
    for the failed communication.\n\nThis document specifies methods an intermediate
    device such as a \nrouter, a firewall, or a NAT may use to inform end hosts that
    a \nparticular type of communication is not possible.  It also \nrecommends practices
    for both the frequency of transmission of such \nerror notices, and their consumption
    by the end hosts.\n\nThis document is an outgrowth of the 'foglamps' discussion
    that \noccurred within the IETF between late 1999 and 2000, and is not the \nproduct
    of a working group.\n\n\t "

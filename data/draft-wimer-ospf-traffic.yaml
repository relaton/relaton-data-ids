  content: "   OSPF is a link-state IP interior routing protocol specified in [1].\n
    \  Several different extensions to OSPF have been proposed [2,3,5] to\n   support
    Traffic Engineering [4] and Quality of Service routing [5].\n   This document
    acknowledges all of this earlier work and proposes that\n   a single style of
    protocol encoding be used for all of the parameters\n   involved.\n \n   This
    document employs the OSPF Opaque LSA Option [6] and the TVLV\n   mechanism proposed
    in [3] to encode additional parameters describing\n   information about the state
    of an OSPF network.  This additional\n   information is useful for Traffic Engineering
    and QoS-based routing.\n\n\t "

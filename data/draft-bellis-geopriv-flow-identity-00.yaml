  content: "   Identity Extensions using an IP address and port number to request
    a\n   location based on an individual packet flow have been previously\n   specified
    by the GEOPRIV Working Group.\n\n   However certain kinds on NAT require that
    identifiers for both ends\n   of the packet flow must be specified in order to
    unambiguously\n   satisfy the location request.\n\n   This document specifieds
    a Flow Identity Extension for the HTTP-\n   Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) Protocol
    to support this\n   requirement.\n\n\t "

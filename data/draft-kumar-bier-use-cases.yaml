  content: "   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n   provides
    optimal multicast forwarding through a \"BIER domain\" without\n   requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain any multicast related per-\n   flow state.  BIER also does
    not require any explicit tree-building\n   protocol for its operation.  A multicast
    data packet enters a BIER\n   domain at a \"Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router\" (BFIR),
    and leaves the\n   BIER domain at one or more \"Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers\"
    (BFERs).\n   The BFIR router adds a BIER header to the packet.  The BIER header\n
    \  contains a bit-string in which each bit represents exactly one BFER\n   to
    forward the packet to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast\n   packet needs
    to be forwarded is expressed by setting the bits that\n   correspond to those
    routers in the BIER header.\n\n   This document describes some of the use-cases
    for BIER.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the ChaMeLeon Version 2 (CMLv2) routing protocol\n
    \  designed for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). CMLv2 is a multi-path,\n   hybrid
    routing protocol operating within a defined area denoted as the\n   Critical Area
    (CA). The main concept behind CMLv2 is the adaptability of\n   its routing mechanisms
    towards changes in the physical and logical state\n   of a MANET. For autonomous
    communications, there is a likelihood\n   that the network size will vary whenever
    more devices join or leave the\n   network. In addition, battery depletion of
    lightweight mobile\n   communication devices will stipulate another reason for
    changes in the\n   network size. Hence, CMLv2 adapts its routing behavior according
    to\n   changes in the network size within a pre-defined CA. For small networks,\n
    \  CMLv2 routes data proactively using the Optimized Link State Routing\n   version
    v2 (OLSRv2) protocol whereas for larger networks it utilizes the\n   reactive
    Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Version 2 (AODVv2) Routing\n   protocol. These
    transitions occur via the oscillation phase, which is\n   maintained from CMLv1.
    O-phase will be totally removed in the next\n   release of CMLv2.CMLv2 creates
    multi-path routes  for nodes with disjoint\n   paths thereby increasing the reliability
    of the network.\n\n\t "

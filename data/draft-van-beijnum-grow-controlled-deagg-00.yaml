  content: "   The use of IPv6 addresses by large organizations doesn't fit the\n
    \  commonly used PA/PI dichotomy.  Such organizations may hold a large\n   address
    block which is deaggregated into subprefixes that are\n   advertised by subunits
    of the organization.  This document proposes a\n   set of best practices to allow
    this deaggregation to be controlled\n   through filtering so that on the one hand,
    the size of the IPv6\n   global routing table isn't unduly inflated, while on
    the other hand\n   organizations that seek to deaggregate a large IPv6 address
    block\n   don't see their reachability limited by remote filters.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes manageable resources in ICN IoT deployments\n
    \  and a lightweight traffic classification method for mapping\n   priorities
    to resources.  Management methods are further derived for\n   controlling latency
    and reliability of traffic flows in constrained\n   environments.  This work includes
    a distributed management of the\n   heterogeneous resources (i) forwarding capacities,
    (ii) Pending\n   Interest Table (PIT) space, and (iii) in-network data storage.
    \ By\n   correlating these common ICN resources, performance measures can be\n
    \  optimized without sacrificing concurrent traffic demands.  Different\n   from
    the IP world, QoS in ICN can be benifical for all participants\n   and manage
    'quality instead of unfairness'.\n\n\t "

  content: "Spurious timeouts are not rare events in wireless wide-area network,\ne.g.
    GPRS or EDGE. It has been reported that spurious timeouts\ngreatly decrease TCP's
    performance in many aspects. It is not only\nbecause of the unnecessary retransmission
    of the last window of data,\nbut also the congestion control is falsely triggered.
    Existing\nproposals of detecting spurious timeouts either require additional\ninformation
    on each data packet, e.g., the timestamps option, or\nheuristically deduce spurious
    timeouts. These approaches need\nheuristic feedbacks from the receiver, and hence
    are vulnerable to\nmisbehaving receivers. In this document, a novel algorithm
    that\nreliably detects spurious TCP retransmission timeouts, called STODER,\nis
    presented. STODER is a TCP sender algorithm and does not require\nany information
    attached on data packets. STODER exploits TCP\nrepacketization to detect false
    retransmission and is well protected\nagainst malicious receivers. Therefore,
    a more aggressive response\nalgorithm can be safely applied along with the STODER
    algorithm.\n\t "

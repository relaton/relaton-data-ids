  content: "  The Secure Routing Protocol (SRP) is a secure and distributed\n  routing
    protocol designed for Delay and Tolerant Networks networks\n  of mobile nodes
    with location information. Commonly, each node\n  acquires its own geographic
    position using a mechanism such as the\n  Global Position System (GPS).\n\n  The
    SRP addresses each node using the hybrid of its multi-level\n  hierarchical address
    and unique identifier at the moment of network\n  initialization.\n\n  Certain
    measures were adopted to ensure security of the network.\n\n\t "

  content: "The intent of this document is to introduce an Architecture for Multi-\nLevel
    Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) into the IP realm. MLPP was \noriginally written
    to create 'a prioritized call handling service' [1] \nin  combination with ISDN
    supplementary services. MLPP has two very \nsimple concepts for voice (Real-Time)
    communications: \nA) setting or marking every session at inception with a \nPrecedence
    level relative to others within a known network \ndomain; and \nB) the end-stations
    or internetworking devices preempting \nlower relative priority sessions in order
    for higher \nrelative level sessions to pass or occur during times of \ncongestion
    at any point in that known, managed domain, \nincluding to the end-station (phone).\n\t "

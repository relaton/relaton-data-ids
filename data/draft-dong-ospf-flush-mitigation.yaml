  content: "   In OSPF protocol, LSAs with the LS age at MaxAge are not used in\n
    \  routing table calculation and MUST be flushed in the network.  In\n   some
    cases, the flushing of OSPF MaxAge LSAs may cause flooding storm\n   of OSPF packets
    and severely impact network stability and the\n   services provided by the network.
    \ This document specifies a backward\n   compatible mechanism to mitigate the
    impact of MaxAge LSA flushing in\n   OSPF networks.\n\n\n\t "

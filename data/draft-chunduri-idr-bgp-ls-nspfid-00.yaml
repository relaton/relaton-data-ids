  content: "   Non Shortest Paths (NSPs) used in routing protocols e.g.  by the link\n
    \  state routing protocols (IS-IS, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3) within IGP\n   topologies.
    \ NSPs help to reduce the data plane path overhead,\n   mitigate from MTU issues
    as well as performance related issues in\n   certain data planes and allows granular
    traffic accounting in the\n   network.  NSPs are created locally by operator or
    can be provisioned\n   through PCE or Yang from outside.  This document describes
    a\n   mechanism by which NSP information currently active in the network\n   using
    the BGP routing protocol by defining extensions to BGP Link-\n   state address-family.\n\n\n\t "

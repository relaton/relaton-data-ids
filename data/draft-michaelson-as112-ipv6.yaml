  script: Latn
  content: "   To reduce longterm traffic to the DNS root servers and the IP6.ARPA\n
    \  authoritative servers, the IAB is requested to instruct the IANA to\n   delegate
    a set of sub-domains of IP6.ARPA to the AS112 Project\n   [RFC6304].  These domains
    represent IPv6 address prefixes that are\n   not conventionally populated in the
    global reverse-DNS, including\n   IPv6 prefixes that are not globally scoped and
    certain prefixes used\n   in an anycast context.\n\n   The reverse DNS query load
    associated with these IPv6 address\n   prefixes appear to have unacceptable scaling
    consequences as IPv6\n   uptake increases.  By delegating these sub-domains to
    the AS112\n   project, the DNS query load can be passed to a distributed sink,\n
    \  reducing the query load on the root servers and the IP6.ARPA\n   authoritative
    servers.\n\n\t "

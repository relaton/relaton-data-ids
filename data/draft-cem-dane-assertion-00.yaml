  content: "   This document defines a new HTTP header that allows web host\n   operators
    to instruct user agents to remember the hosts' request for\n   DANE (DNS-Based
    Authentication of Named Entities) validation over a\n   period of time.  During
    that time, UAs will require that the host\n   presents a certificate chain that
    will authenticate the Transport\n   Layer Security connection using DANE.  By
    having hosts explicitly\n   state that they have adopted DANE, UAs will only expend
    resources\n   attempting DANE validation on hosts that request it.  Comments are\n
    \  solicited and should be addressed to the author\n\n\t "

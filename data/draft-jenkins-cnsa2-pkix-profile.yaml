  content: "   This document specifies a profile of X.509 v3 Certificates and X.509\n
    \  v2 Certificate Revocation Lists for applications that use Commercial\n   National
    Security Algorithm Suite published by the United States\n   Government.\n\n   The
    profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation\n   of all components
    of US National Security Systems that employ such\n   X.509 certificates.  US National
    Security Systems are described in\n   NIST Special Publication 800-59.  It is
    also appropriate for all\n   other US Government systems that process high-value
    information.\n\n   This memo is not an IETF standard, and does not represent IETF\n
    \  community consensus.  The profile is made publicly available for use\n   by
    developers and operators of these and any other system\n   deployments.\n\n\t "

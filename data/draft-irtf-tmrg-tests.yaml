  content: "This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initial\nevaluation
    of proposed TCP modifications.  The goal of the test suite\nis to allow researchers
    to quickly and easily evaluate their proposed\nTCP extensions in simulators and
    testbeds using a common set of well-\ndefined, standard test cases, in order to
    compare and contrast\nproposals against standard TCP as well as other proposed\nmodifications.
    \ This test suite is not intended to result in an\nexhaustive evaluation of a
    proposed TCP modification or new\ncongestion control mechanism.  Instead, the
    focus is on quickly and\neasily generating an initial evaluation report that allows
    the\nnetworking community to understand and discuss the behavioral aspects\nof
    a new proposal, in order to guide further experimentation that\nwill be needed
    to fully investigate the specific aspects of a new\nproposal.\n\t "

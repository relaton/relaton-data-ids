  content: "The ROLL Working Group was recently chartered by the IETF to define \nrouting
    characteristics for low power embedded devices.  ROLL would like \nto serve the
    Industrial, Commercial, Home and Urban markets.  Pursuant to \nthis effort, this
    document defines the functional and cost requirements \nfor installing integrated
    facility management systems in commercial \nfacilities. \n\nThe routing requirements
    for commercial building applications are \npresented in this document.  Commercial
    buildings have been fitted with \npneumatic and subsequently electronic communication
    pathways connecting \n\nMartocci\n\n\n\n\nExpires January 14, 2009\n\n\n\n\n [page

    to their controllers for over one hundred years.  Recent economic \nand technical
    advances in wireless communication allows facilities to \nincreasingly utilize
    a wireless solution in lieu of a wired solution; \nthereby reducing installation
    costs yet maintaining highly reliant \ncommunication.  Wireless solutions will
    be adapted from their existing \nwired counterparts in many of the building applications
    including, but \nnot limited to HVAC, lighting, security, fire, and elevator products.
    \ \nThese devices will be developed to reduce installation costs; while \nincreasing
    installation and retrofit flexibility.  Sensing devices may be \nbattery or mains
    powered.  Actuators and area controllers will be mains \npowered.\n\nTo meet the
    cost target, these devices must have a total installed cost \nbelow that of the
    traditional wired alternative; yet maintain reliability \non par with wired devices.
    \ The total installed cost includes the \ninfrastructure, product, installation,
    commissioning, labor and \noperational costs of the device over its 30 year lifespan.
    Except for \nspecial circumstances such as flexible installation (e.g. airports)
    or \ncosmetics (e.g. museums, there is nothing compelling about installing \nwireless
    solutions inside a building unless it can be accomplished below \nthe cost of
    a wired installation.  This document will define the \nrequirements necessary
    for wireless technology to displace wired \ninfrastructure and meet this objective.\n\t "

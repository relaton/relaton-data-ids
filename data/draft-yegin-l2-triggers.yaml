  content: "Wireless and mobile hosts are subject to changing their point of \nattachment
    from one access network to another. These changes result \nin link-layer events
    such as link up and link down. Information on \nthese events can be conveyed to
    interested parties in the form of \nlink-layer triggers. Primary consumers of
    this information are the \nmodules implementing mobility related network-layer
    protocols. When \nprovider and consumer of this information are co-located on
    the same \nIP node, required communication can take place via internal \nmechanisms.
    But when they are separate, as in the case of networks \nusing wired-to-wireless
    bridges, a transport mechanism is needed to \nconvey link-layer triggers. This
    draft defines a UDP based client-\nserver protocol for transporting link-layer
    triggers between two IP \nnodes.\n\t "

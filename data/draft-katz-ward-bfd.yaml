abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a protocol intended to detect faults in the\n
    \  bidirectional path between two forwarding engines, including\n   interfaces,
    data link(s), and to the extent possible the forwarding\n   engines themselves,
    with potentially very low latency.  It operates\n   independently of media, data
    protocols, and routing protocols.\n   Comments on this draft should be directed
    to rtg-bfd@ietf.org.\n\t "

  content: "In this paper, we discuss the delay-constrained energy efficient \n   multicast
    routing problem in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. A \n   cognitive radio ad
    hoc network is a wireless multi-hop network \n   established by secondary users
    on varying available spectrum bands. \n   The routing research is a hotspot in
    the field of cognitive radio \n   ad hoc networks. However, multicast routing
    algorithm study of \n   cognitive radio ad hoc networks is still in starting stage.
    In this \n   paper, we proposed a novel delay-constrained energy efficient \n
    \  multicast routing algorithm (DCEEMR) in cognitive radio ad hoc \n   networks.
    The DCEEMR guarantees that the multicast tree can be found \n   if it exists,
    and the multicast tree satisfies the delay bound and \n   has low energy consuming.
    The algorithm uses delay-energy function \n   to construct the multicast tree
    based on the spectrum selection. \n   Through an example with randomly network
    topology, we demonstrate \n   that our algorithm is better in terms of energy
    cost of multicast \n   tree as compared to the existing algorithm QoS Dependent
    Multicast \n   Routing (QDMR). Moreover, the algorithm does not suffer from high
    \n   complexity common to the algorithm QDMR. Experiment results by NS-2 \n   show
    that the delay and tree cost are lower than well-known \n   Multicast ad- hoc
    On-demand Distance Vector (MAODV) protocol. \n\t "

  content: "This Internet Draft describes the major carrier's optical service \nrequirements
    for the Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) \nfrom both an end-user's
    as well as an operator's perspectives. Its \nfocus is on the description of the
    service building blocks and \nservice-related control plane functional requirements.
    The management \nfunctions for the optical services and their underlying networks
    are \nbeyond the scope of this document.\n\t "

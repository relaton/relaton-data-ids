abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility support is an important network capability for mobile node,
    and 5G introduces the Mobility Pattern used by the Access and Mobility Management
    Function (AMF) to optimize mobility support provided to the UE. More specific,
    The AMF determines and updates Mobility Pattern of the UE according to the subscription
    of the UE, statistics of the UE mobility, network local policy, and the UE assisted
    information, or any combination of them with the help of NWDAF. Based on different
    requirements, multiple mobility management protocols have been developed under
    IPv6. However, different protocols have different functional requirements on the
    network element or the host and then a scheme should be used in order to support
    the negotiation and selection of adopted mobility management protocol when a host
    (or UE) accesses to a new network. In this draft, this issue is analyzed.</p>"

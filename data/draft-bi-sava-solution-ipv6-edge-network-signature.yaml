  content: "   Today's Internet is suffering from reflection-type DoS/DDoS attacks,\n
    \  such as TCP SYN flood, Smurf attack, DNS reflection, etc.  These\n   attacks
    often rely on the IP source address spoofing.  Current source\n   address spoofing
    prevention methods have a coarse granularity, and\n   the attackers can still
    in some cases launch reflection-type DoS/DDos\n   attacks or other attacks while
    being difficult to trace.  Aiming to\n   solve this problem, this document proposes
    a fine-granularity source\n   address spoofing prevention method, which can prevent
    the attackers\n   from forging source addresses that belong to the same edge network
    to\n   send packets to somewhere outside the IPv6 edge network.  The\n   proposed
    method includes source address authentication using session\n   key and hash digest
    algorithms and replay attack prevention by\n   combining a sequence number method
    with a timestamp method.\n\n\t "

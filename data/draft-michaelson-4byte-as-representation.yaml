  content: "   A taxonomy of textual representations for four-octet Autonomous\n   System
    (AS) numbers is defined.  The 'asdot' textual representation\n   is recommended.
    \ The syntax chosen avoids ambiguity with Border\n   Gateway Protocol (BGP) community
    string representation of AS numbers.\n   It is recommended that this textual representation
    be used by all\n   documents, systems and user interfaces referring to four-octet
    AS\n   numbers.\n\n\t "

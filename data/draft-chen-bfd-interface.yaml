  content: "   This document describes how application clients can request IP-based\n
    \  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) sessions while either being\n   IP
    agnostic themselves or while dealing with IP unnumbered\n   interfaces.\n\n   A
    dedicated well-known multicast IP address 224.XXX.XXX.XXX is used\n   as the destination
    IP address of the BFD packets when running BFD for\n   interface.  It allows for
    BFD sessions on interfaces that may have no\n   IP addresses, either because the
    interface is unnumbered or because\n   the layer 3 protocol status of the interfaces
    is not up yet.\n\n   One application of BFD for interface is to run BFD over LAG/Bundle\n
    \  component links.  An example will be given in this document.\n\n\n\t "

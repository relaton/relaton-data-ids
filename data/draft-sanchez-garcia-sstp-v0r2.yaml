  content: "This document describes SSTP, a protocol architecture that provides the\nsupport
    of SCCP and TCAP user applications over an IP network. The\npurpose of SSTP is
    to provide a standard tunneling protocol to convey\nSCCP messages over an IP based
    network. The core part of the SSTP\narchitecture is the specification of the SSTP
    (Simple SCCP Tunneling\nProtocol) adaptation layer, that provides adaptation between
    the SCCP\nlayer already defined in [3] and [4], and the IP family protocols IP,\nUDP,
    TCP and ICMP. TCP or UDP is used for SCCP class 0 messages. TCP is\nused for SCCP
    class 1, 2 or 3. SSTP provides similar primitives and\nparameters to SCCP than
    MTP, and provides seamless connection between\nnodes implementing SSTP and classical
    SS7 nodes by means of a SSTP\ngateway. The design of SSTP is oriented to fulfill
    the requirements of\nTCAP user applications running on a WAN.\n\n\t "

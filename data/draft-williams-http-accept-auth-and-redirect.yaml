  script: Latn
  content: "   The Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) offers several\n   authentication
    schemes, but many sites use redirection-based\n   protocols to authenticate users.
    \ Some servers are faced with a\n   connundrum, having to choose between two mutually-exclusive
    options:\n   redirect responses or 401 (authentication required) responses without\n
    \  knowing which the user-agent is most likely to support.\n\n   This document
    specifies new HTTP request headers by which many\n   applications can improve
    interoperability even without changing their\n   HTTP implementations.  These
    new headers allow user-agents to\n   advertise authentication- and redirect-related
    capbilities that\n   servers can use to better make authentication and/or redirect\n
    \  decisions.\n\n   Also specified is a new HTTP authentication scheme named \"Redirect\"\n
    \  that enables communication between redirecting and redirected\n   authorities
    via preservation of \"Authorization\" headers across\n   redirections.  This enables
    arbitrary authentication and\n   authorization protocols to work without requiring
    user-agent support\n   for them and without having to (ab)use URI query parameters.\n\n\t "

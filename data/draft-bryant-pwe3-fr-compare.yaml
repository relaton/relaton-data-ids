  content: "This document compares and contrasts four approaches to Frame Relay\nencapsulation
    over a pseudo-wire that have been proposed in the\nPseudo-Wire Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    IETF working group.  This document\nthen shows that the general-purpose encapsulation
    previously\nproposed for HDLC, Ethernet and VLAN is also the most efficient\napproach
    for Frame Relay.\n\n\t "

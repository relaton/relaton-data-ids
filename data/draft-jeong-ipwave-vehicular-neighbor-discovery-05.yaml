  content: "   This document specifies a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) as an\n
    \  extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP-based vehicular\n   networks.
    \ An optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate\n   Address Detection
    (DAD) mechanism are established for both operation\n   efficiency and the saving
    of wireless bandwidth and vehicle energy.\n   Also, the three new ND options for
    prefix discovery, service\n   discovery, and mobility information report are used
    to announce the\n   network prefixes and services inside a vehicle (i.e., a vehicle's\n
    \  internal network).  Finally, a mobility management scheme is proposed\n   for
    moving vehicles in vehicular environments to support seamless\n   communication
    for the continuity of transport-layer sessions (e.g.,\n   TCP connections).\n\n\t "

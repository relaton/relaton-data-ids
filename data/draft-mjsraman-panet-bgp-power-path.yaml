  content: "   In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power\n
    \  consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between\n   Autonomous
    Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS\n   and then use suitable
    modifications to the BGP path selection\n   algorithm to route the packets along
    the paths. Such low-power paths\n   can be identified by using the consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth\n
    \  (PWR) ratio as an additional parameter in the BGP Path Selection\n   Algorithm.
    For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power\n   paths, the power based
    best path is selected and advertised as per\n   the modified algorithm proposed
    in this document. Extensions to the\n   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used
    to disseminate the PWR\n   ratio metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative
    approach\n   to reduce the power consumption. The feasibility of our approaches
    is\n   illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.\n   The
    techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power\n   reduction require
    minimal modifications to the existing features of\n   the Internet. The proposed
    techniques can be extended to other levels\n   of Internet hierarchy, such as
    Intra-AS paths, through suitable\n   modifications. A recent addition is the use
    of this method in AIGP\n   domains and also the use of power source data in the
    calculation of\n   low power paths using the BGP path selection algorithm.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes PGMCC, a single rate multicast\ncongestion control
    scheme which is TCP-friendly and achieves\nscalability, stability and fast response
    to variations in\nnetwork conditions. PGMCC is suitable for both non-reliable\nand
    reliable data transfers.  It is mainly designed for NAK-\nbased multicast protocols,
    and uses a window-based, TCP-like\ncontrol loop using positive ACKs between one
    representative of\nthe receiver group (the ACKER) and the sender.  The ACKER is\nselected
    dynamically and may change over time.\nPGMCC is made of two components: a window-based
    control loop,\nwhich closely mimics TCP behaviour, and a fast and low-\noverhead
    procedure to select (and track changes of) the ACKER.\nThe scheme is robust to
    measurement errors, and supports fast\nresponse to changes in the receiver set
    and/or network\nconditions.\n\t "

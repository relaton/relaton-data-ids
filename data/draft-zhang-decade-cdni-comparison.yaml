  content: "   This document gives a brief comparison of DECADE and CDNi, two\n   working
    groups on content delivery.  CDNi aims at overcoming the\n   limited resource
    and footprints of a single CDN by interconnecting\n   multiple CDNs.  While DECADE
    is mainly concerned with reducing the\n   last-mile bandwidth bottleneck and inter-domain
    traffics with in-\n   network storage.  This in-network storage can also be utilized
    by\n   Content Service Providers (CSPs) as a CDN, whose footprints be across\n
    \  multiple Internet Service Providers (CSPs).  In this sense, DECADE\n   can
    also be a possible approach to overcome the limited footprints of\n   a single
    CDN.  This document attempts to gain some understanding on\n   the relationship
    of these two solutions.\n\n\t "

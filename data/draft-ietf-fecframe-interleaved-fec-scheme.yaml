  content: "This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media
    encapsulated in RTP.  The 1-D interleaved parity code is a systematic code, where
    a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent
    in a repair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.
    \ The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty packet
    losses at a cost of reasonable complexity.  The new payload format defined in
    this document should only be used (with some exceptions) as a part of the Digital
    Video Broadcasting-IPTV (DVB- IPTV) Application-layer FEC specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4\n   counterpart.
    \ The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)\n   accommodate approximately
    1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a\n   much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses)
    than their IPv4\n   counterparts.  As a result, it is widely assumed that it would
    take a\n   tremendous effort to perform address scanning attacks against IPv6\n
    \  networks, and therefore IPv6 address scanning attacks have long been\n   considered
    unfeasible.  This document analyzes how traditional\n   address scanning techniques
    apply to IPv6 networks, and also explores\n   a number of other techniques that
    can be employed for IPv6 network\n   reconnaissance.  Additionally, this document
    formally obsoletes RFC\n   5157.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a generic Cognitive Adaptive Module (CAM)\nthat
    can be utilized in conjunction with Mobile Ad hoc Network\n(MANET) routing protocols.
    The main concept behind CAM is the fact\nthat the provisioning of multimedia communications
    traditionally\nrequires routing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees [9]. Such
    a\ntask is NP Complete in MANETs when QoS optimization is subject to\nmore than
    one parameter [9]. Hence, the provisioning of soft QoS\nguarantees for effective
    and efficient routing in dynamic\nenvironments, as specified in [1], is the best
    alternative. However,\nthe latter cannot be optimally achieved by using a single
    metric\nbased path selection process or routing approach due to variations\nin
    both upper layer service QoS requirements and situational\nconstraints. CAM provides
    interfaces to routing components such that\nprotocols can be segmented into these
    components and can be easily\nmade configurable and adaptive. For instance, the
    route selection\nprocess can be done in an adaptive manner to satisfy the\nrequirements
    for effective and efficient routing. This is achieved\nby providing interfaces
    from the CAM core to various user defined\ncomponents (e.g. Repositories Component)
    such that all components\nand component parts (e.g. DYMO reactive routing logic)
    can inter-\ncommunicate.\n\t "

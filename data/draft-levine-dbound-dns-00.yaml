  content: "   The organization that manages a subtree in the DNS is often different\n
    \  from the one that manages the tree above it.  We describe an\n   architecture
    to publish in the DNS the boundaries between\n   organizations that can be adapted
    to various policy models and can be\n   queried with a small number of DNS lookups.\n\n\t "

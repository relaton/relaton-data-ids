  content: "Metering is typically performed at the edge of a Diffserv-aware \nnetwork
    where customer traffic is checked for conformance or else \nwhere networks interconnect
    using shaping/policing as a practical \nmatter in IP networks. This document describes
    the importance of the \nconsistent metering in Diffserv traffic conditioning.
    This document \nalso proposes the concepts and the associated details to be adapted
    \nby Diffserv informal model [DIFFSERV-MODEL] to achieve the desired \nconsistency.\n\t "

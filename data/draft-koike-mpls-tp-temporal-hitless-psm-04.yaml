  content: "   The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable\n
    \  carrier-grade packet transport and complement converged packet\n   network
    deployments. Among the most attractive features of MPLS-TP\n   are OAM functions,
    which enable network operators or service\n   providers to provide various maintenance
    characteristics, such as\n   fault location, survivability, performance monitoring,
    and\n   preliminary or in-service measurements.\n\n   One of the most important
    mechanisms which is common for transport\n   network operation is fault location.
    A segment monitoring function of\n   a transport path is effective in terms of
    extension of the\n   maintenance work and indispensable particularly when the
    OAM function\n   is effective only between end points. However, the current approach\n
    \  defined for MPLS-TP for the segment monitoring (SPME) has some fatal\n   drawbacks.\n\n
    \  This document elaborates on the problem statement for the Sub-path\n   Maintenance
    Elements (SPMEs) which provides monitoring of a portion\n   of a set of transport
    paths (LSPs or MS-PWs). Based on the problems,\n   this document specifies new
    requirements to consider a new improved\n   mechanism of hitless transport path
    segment monitoring.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network.\n\n\n\n\t "

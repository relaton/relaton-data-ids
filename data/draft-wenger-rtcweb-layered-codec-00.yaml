abstract:
- content: "<p>RTCWEB is in the process of developing a protocol infrastructure and
    a browser API to support browser-to-browser real-time communication over IP. Real-time
    communication necessarily requires the use of encoders and decoders (codecs) for
    media data. The document advocates mandating support for a class of codecs known
    as scalable or layered codecs, for their superior network adaptivity, error resilience,
    and application adaptivity. Examples are provided for use cases currently under
    discussion, focusing on video coding as the, perhaps, most challenging media type
    currently under consideration.</p>"

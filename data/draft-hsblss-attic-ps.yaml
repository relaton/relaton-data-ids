  content: "   This document attempts to make the case for new work involving\n   possibly
    a framework and protocols that need to be developed to be\n   used among various
    virtualized functions and the end user which may\n   be moving.  First a set of
    functional requirements are developed and\n   then these requirements are further
    elaborated in terms of potential\n   engineering and design constraints.  The
    need for the new work is\n   described next.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo suggest a radical and a generic approach in using the 20-bit
    IPv6 Flow label field to provide Quality-of-Service on the Internet. The approach
    is generic in the sense that it does not enforce any specific implementation features
    on the developers; the only thing that will have specific semantics is the flow-label
    field. The methods of information storage and processing in the routers are router
    specific and can be implemented in a number of ways. Thus the resulting mechanism
    suggested here is fully and easily implementable and unambiguous as may be required
    for real implementations.\n\n\n\t "

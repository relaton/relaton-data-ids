  content: "   DHCP has a length limit of 255 on individual options because of its\n
    \  one-byte length field for options.  To accommodate longer options,\n   splitting
    option data across multiple instances of the same Option\n   Type is defined by
    RFC 3396.  However, this mechanism was defined to\n   require support for all
    option types.  This has led to real-world\n   implementations in the years since
    the RFC was published to deviate\n   from these requirements to avoid breaking
    basic functionality.  This\n   document updates RFC 3396 to be more flexible regarding
    when DHCP\n   agents are required to concatenate options to reflect deployement\n
    \  experiences.\n\n\t "

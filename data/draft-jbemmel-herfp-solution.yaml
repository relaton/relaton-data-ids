  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a solution to the Heterogeneous Error\n   Response
    Forking Problem (HERFP), a situation in which a UAC remains\n   unaware of elements
    that are responding to its INVITE with a\n   'repairable' error response, because
    a forking proxy in the\n   signalling path only forwards what it considers the
    'best' final\n   response.  This issue may cause communication establishment to
    be\n   delayed or even fail.  To address this issue this document proposes a\n
    \  new method [preliminarily called 'FIX'] to be used by a forking proxy\n   that
    detects a HERFP to notify the UAC of a repairable error.\n\t "

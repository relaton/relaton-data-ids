  content: "GMPLS [2] has now been proposed as an extension to the MPLS\nframework
    to include non packet-switched optical technologies, such\nas time-division multiplexing
    (PDH/SDH/SONET) and wavelength\ndivision multiplexing (lambdas/fibers). This draft
    proposes an\nenhanced label request format for such optical technologies, which\naccounts
    for some special characteristics of these technologies\n(see, for instance, [3],
    [4], [5])that differentiate them from\npacket-switched technologies. When enumerating
    our encoding, we\nfocus, for clarity, on optical TDM technologies, since the standards\nfor
    these are well-defined, but it will be seen that the proposal\nhas very general
    applicability.\n\t "

  content: "This draft proposes a TDM emulation protocol for consideration by the
    \nPWE3 Working Group.  The protocol defines methods for transporting DS3, \nE3,
    DS1, E1, and NxDS0 circuits over packet switched networks.  It is \nbased on ATM
    Circuit Emulation, but optimized for variable length \npacket networks.  The intent
    is to provide a relatively simple but \nflexible method for transporting TDM signals
    over packet switched \nnetworks that also provides a path for interworking with
    ATM Circuit \nEmulation. \n\t "

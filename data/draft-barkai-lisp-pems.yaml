abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the interfaces and functionality of portable
    socket objects, each instantiated and delegated per Unicast/Multicast Endpoint
    Identifiers(EID), using eBPF like Unix stacks. Sockets are deployed across edge-compute
    locations and are used either as queues for assembling upstream point to point
    and multipoint to point frames, or as a channels, segmenting point to multipoint
    and multipoint to multipoint application frames. Portability of Unicast-queue
    and Multicast-channel sockets, as well as subscription and replication, is achieved
    using the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP).</p>"

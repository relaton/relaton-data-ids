- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a novel error and congestion control \n   algorithm
    for mobile Stream Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP).  \n   This algorithm
    is simple but very effective means to minimize the \n   lost packet recovery time
    as well as the handover latency by \n   capitalizing on the transport layer awareness
    of the mobility. \n\t "

  content: "This draft discusses the motivation for MPLS OAM functionality and\npossible
    requirements for OAM in MPLS networks. Examples of OAM\nfunctions include support
    for fault management, continuity checks,\nloopbacks, performance monitoring and
    protection switching. Such\ncapabilities may be useful in many applications of
    MPLS networks, but\na detailed set of requirements is currently not available.
    Further\ndiscussion and input is solicited, in particular from network\noperators
    and service providers.\n\n\n\t "

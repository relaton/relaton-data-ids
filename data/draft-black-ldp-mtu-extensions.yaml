  content: "Proper functioning of RFC 1191 path MTU detection requires that IP\nrouters
    have knowledge of the MTU for each link to which they are\nconnected.  As currently
    specified in [LDP], LDP does not have the\nability to signal the MTU for an LSP
    to ingress LSRs.\nThis document specifies extensions to the LDP label distribution\nprotocol
    in support of LSP MTU signalling.\n\t "

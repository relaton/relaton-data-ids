  content: "   This document describes the requirements for a protocol to control
    \ a\n   device  which  supports  telephone  lines  or  trunks on one side and\n
    \  packet network ports on the other.   The  primary  functions  of  the\n   device
    \ are  to  make,  modify,  and  break  media stream connections\n   between  these
    \ edge-points,  to  perform  operations  on  the  media\n   streams,  and  to
    \ detect  and report specific events associated with\n   those streams or the
    edge-points. This device may also terminate call\n   signalling  which  it  processes
    \ itself  and/or passes to the device\n   which controls it.  Using the terminology
    provided by  Cuervo  et  al\n   [1],  the device just described is a Media Gateway,
    and is controlled\n   by a Media Gateway Controller.\n \n   The requirements for
    the protocol  separate  into  two  major  parts:\n   operational   and   functional.
    \  The  operational  requirements  are\n   concerned with reliability and security
    of control messaging, control\n   session  startup  and takedown, handling of
    control session failures,\n   and control system performance.  The  functional
    \ requirements  cover\n   connection   control,   media  processing,  event  notification,
    \ and\n   resource status tracking.  They may also include signalling  backhaul\n
    \  from the Media Gateway to the Media Gateway Controller.\n \n   The protocol
    should extend to the control of  devices  which  contain\n   telephony edge-points
    only (such as digital cross-connects) or packet\n   network ports only (such as
    transcoders or announcement servers).\n\n\t "

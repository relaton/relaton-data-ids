  content: "   This informational document describes a method that allows for the\n
    \  automatic attachment of network objects (e.g. end stations, network\n   devices,
    sensors, automation elements) to a core network based on\n   the individual services
    that are run or configured on the objects,\n   and the mapping of the services
    to the managed paths in the network.\n   The framework proposed by this document
    describes the operations\n   that need to happen in order to have the network
    objects connected\n   to the network ('attached') in an automatic manner and start\n
    \  providing their functionality and services without any requirement\n   or dependency
    between the protocol stack on the network objects and\n   the method used to build
    the bridging or routing paths in the\n   network core.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Several mechanisms have been proposed for placing multilingual names\n(more
    properly, names normally written in non-ASCII character sets)\ninto the DNS or
    addressing the need for multilingual access to the\nInternet in other ways.  Most
    of them involve, to one extent or\nanother, workarounds to the current system.
    \ This document proposes a\n'go back and fix it' approach, replacing the 'IN'
    Class in the DNS with\none that is not limited to ASCII from its initial definitions.
    \ Some of\nthe deployment issues, politics, and other drawbacks are also briefly\ndiscussed.\n\t "

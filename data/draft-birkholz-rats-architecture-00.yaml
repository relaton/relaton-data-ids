  content: "   Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS), such as Remote Integrity\n   VERification
    (RIVER), the creation of Entity Attestation Tokens\n   (EAT), software integrity
    Measurement And ATtestation (MAAT), or the\n   attestation of device characteristics,
    in general, are based on\n   specific operations and qualities provided by hardware
    and software.\n   The RATS architecture maps corresponding functions and operation\n
    \  capabilities to specific RATS roles.  The goal is to enable an\n   appropriate
    conveyance of believable evidence about device health or\n   trusted claims about
    device capabilities via network protocols.  The\n   flows of data between these
    roles depend on the composition of RATS\n   roles and their location with respect
    to devices or services.  The\n   RATS architecture provides these roles as building
    blocks to enable\n   suitable composition, while remaining hardware-agnostic.
    \ This\n   flexibility is intended to address a significant majority of use\n
    \  cases or usage scenarios in the domain of RATS.  Examples include,\n   but
    are not limited to: financial transactions, voting machines,\n   critical safety
    systems, network equipment health, or trustworthy\n   end-user device management.\n\n\t "

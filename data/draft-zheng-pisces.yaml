  content: "   This document specifies the Pisces, an ensemble video transport\n   framework
    for real-time communication.  Pisces complements the\n   benefits of rule-based
    and learning-based approaches, without\n   modifying the codec layer.  Pisces
    uses an incremental and iterative\n   reinforcement learning model to adapt to
    the unseen environment.\n   When the real environment well matches the training
    environment, the\n   learning-based approach is actively working.  Otherwise,
    the rule-\n   based approach is used to ensure transport safety.  By simultaneously\n
    \  leveraging both rule-based logic and learning models to proactively\n   probe
    network capacity, Pisces achieves high efficiency in both\n   single-flow and
    cross-flow scenarios, while ensuring stable and fair\n   cross-flow convergence.
    \ Pisces can be deployed in WebRTC, which\n   replaces the default Google congestion
    control algorithm.\n\n\t "

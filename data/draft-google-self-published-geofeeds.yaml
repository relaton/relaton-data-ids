abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
    a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation information, colloquially
    termed a \"geolocation feed\". Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds
    to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures. This format
    intentionally only allows specifying coarse-level location.\n\n Some technical
    organizations operating networks that move from one conference location to the
    next have already experimentally published small geolocation feeds.\n\n This document
    describes a currently deployed format. At least one consumer (Google) has incorporated
    these feeds into a geolocation data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs
    are using it to inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.\n\t "

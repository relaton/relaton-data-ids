    \  graphical user interface (GUI) desktops and applications remotely,\n   either
    by a single remote user or embedded into a multiparty\n   conference.  The protocols
    are designed to allow sharing of, and\n   access to general windowing system applications
    that are not\n   expressly written to be accessed remotely.\n\t "

  content: "   Traffic flows may be categorized and described using \"Flow\n   Specifications\".
    \ RFC8955 defines the Flow Specification and\n   describes how Flow Specification
    components are used to describe\n   traffic flows.  RFC8955 also defines how Flow
    Specifications may be\n   distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows to
    be associated\n   with routes.\n\n   RFC 9168 specifies a set of extensions to
    PCEP to support the\n   dissemination of Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE
    to indicate\n   what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of.\n\n
    \  The extensions defined in this document extend the support for\n   tunneled
    traffic filtering rules.\n\n\t "

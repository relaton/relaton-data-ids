  content: "The Simple Scheduling Transfer Protocol (SSTP) provides a mechanism for
    the exchange of scheduling information between independent scheduling systems.
    \ This will allow users to schedule meetings with anyone, no matter what scheduling
    system they use.                                    It also allows user agents
    to access scheduling data that is stored in scheduling systems. This opens up
    scheduling data for much more sophisticated access, such as automated scheduling
    programs and network computers.\n\t "

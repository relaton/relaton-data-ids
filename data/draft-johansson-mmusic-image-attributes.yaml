abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes a new generic session setup attribute to make\nit
    possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image\nsize.  A possible
    use case is to make it possible for a e.g a low-end\nhand-held terminal to display
    video without the need to rescale the\nimage, something that may consume large
    amounts of memory and\nprocessing power.  The draft also helps to maintain an
    optimal\nbitrate for video as only the image size that is desired by the\nreceiver
    is transmitted.Requirements Language\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\t "

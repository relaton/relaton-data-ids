  content: "IETF RFC 2251 [RFC2251] provides a mechanism for indicating, given \nany
    particular entry in the directory tree, what entry in the \ndirectory tree holds
    the directory schema information for that \nparticular entry.  RFC 2251 does not,
    however, provide guidance on \nhow different directory servers, each of which
    might have their own \nactive directory schema, should “publicize” this directory
    schema \nsuch that the different active schemas are distinct from one another
    \nwhen viewing the entire directory name-space.  This document \ndescribes a way
    to name sub-schema sub-entry entries such that \ndifferent active schemas can
    be distinguished from one another \nacross the entire directory name-space.\n\t "

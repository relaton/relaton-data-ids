  script: Latn
  content: "   IPsec/ESP secure every single IP packets exchanged between two nodes.\n
    \  This makes security transparent to the applications, as opposed to\n   TLS
    or DTLS for example.\n\n   IPsec/ESP has not widely been used to secure application
    because\n   IPsec is implemented in the kernel space, and IPsec/ESP security\n
    \  rules are defined on the device -- similarly to firewall.  In\n   addition,
    IPsec/ESP introduces network overhead on an IP packet\n   basis, as opposed as
    TLS/DTLS that introduces network overhead on an\n   UDP or TCP segment basis.
    \ This mostly impacts devices that do not\n   perform IP fragmentation.\n\n   Such
    drawbacks are not anymore valid for IoT, and the IPsec/ESP may\n   even better
    fits IoT usage and security requirements.  IoT device are\n   usually hardware
    dedicated for a given task or a given application\n   which makes Kernel / user
    land split less significant.  IoT devices\n   send data that is most likely expected
    to fit in a single IP packet.\n   Eventually, configuring IPsec/ESP security rules
    provides the ability\n   to enforce the security of the device, as security is
    not handled on\n   a per-application basis.  Then the database structure of the
    IPsec/\n   ESP security policies perfectly match sleeping nodes.\n\n   This document
    defines Diet-ESP that adapts IPsec/ESP for IoT.  The\n   goal of Diet-ESP is to
    reduce the size of the IPsec/ESP packet sent\n   on the wire.  As a result Diet-ESP
    is expected to compress\n   traditional IPsec/ESP packet without impacting the
    security provided\n   by IPsec/ESP.\n\n\t "

  content: "   NTPv4 is defined by RFC 5905 [RFC5905], and it and earlier versions\n
    \  of the NTP Protocol have supported symmetric private key MAC\n   authentication.
    \ MACs pre-date the Extension Fields introduced in RFC\n   5905 [RFC5905], and
    as the number of Extension Fields grows there is\n   an increasing chance of ambiguity
    when deciding if the \"next\" set of\n   data is an Extension Field or a MAC.
    \ This proposal defines a new\n   Extension Field which is used to signifiy that
    it is the last\n   Extension Field in the packet.  If present, any subsequent
    data\n   SHOULD be considered to be a legacy MAC.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) message types make provision
    for data in Type, Length, Value (TLV) format. However, Route Monitoring messages
    (which provide a snapshot of the monitored Routing Information Base) and Peer
    Down messages (which indicate that a peering session was terminated) do not. Supporting
    (optional) data in TLV format across all BMP message types provides consistent
    and extensible structures that would be useful among the various use- cases where
    conveying additional data to a monitoring station is required. This document updates
    RFC 7854 [RFC7854] to support TLV data in all message types. Additionally, this
    document introduces support for enterprise- specific TLVs in the BGP Monitoring
    Protocol by defining an Enterprise Bit (E-bit) that allows usage of per-vendor
    Type values.</p>"

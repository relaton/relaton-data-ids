- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A spurious timeout in TCP forces the sender to unnecessarily\n   retransmit
    one complete congestion window of data into the network.\n   In addition, the
    congestion state of the network could change\n   substantially after a spurious
    timeout.  In this draft we propose a\n   conservative congestion response algorithm
    afert spurious timeout\n   that takes network state into account.\n\n\t "

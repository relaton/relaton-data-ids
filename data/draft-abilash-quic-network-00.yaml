  script: Latn
  content: "   QUIC aims to improve performance by multiplexing streams and various\n
    \  other enhancements [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].  QUIC performs better\n   than
    existing transport protocols in most cases.  However, its\n   performance suffers
    compared to HTTP under very high bandwidth when\n   large amounts of data needs
    to be downloaded [MEG2016].  This is\n   because QUIC is an end to end protocol
    and provides no means for the\n   intermediate network elements to contribute
    to QUIC improvements.\n   This draft proposes a change to the QUIC protocol header
    that will\n   allow session aware routers and other middleboxes to prioritize\n
    \  streams in QUIC packets, divert high priority streams to low loss\n   paths,
    and adjust packet pacing on a per stream basis.  This opens\n   the door to many
    possible future in-network enhancements.\n\n\t "

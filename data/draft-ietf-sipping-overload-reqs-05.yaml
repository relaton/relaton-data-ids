  content: "Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when proxies
    and user agents have insufficient resources to complete the processing of a request.
    \ SIP provides limited support for overload handling through its 503 response
    code, which tells an upstream element that it is overloaded.  However, numerous
    problems have been identified with this mechanism.  This document summarizes the
    problems with the existing 503 mechanism, and provides some requirements for a
    solution.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

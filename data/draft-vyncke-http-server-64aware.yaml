  script: Latn
  content: "Rather than forcing the client to decide whether IPv4 or IPv6 is more\nconvenient
    to reach a web server; this document proposes to let the\nweb server check whether
    there is IPv6 connectivity to the client;\nthen the web server can do a HTTP redirect
    to the force the client to\nuse IPv6.\n\nThis is done easily by a script within
    the server HTML pages and does\nnot require any change in the client applications
    or configuration.\nThe client still can control whether he/she wants to enabled
    IPv6.\n\nThis draft could be discussed on the Applications Discuss mailing\nlist,
    https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss.\n\t "

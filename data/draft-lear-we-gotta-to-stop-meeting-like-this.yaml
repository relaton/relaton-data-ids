  content: "   The IETF currently meets three times per year in various parts of the\n
    \  world.  Somewhere around 1,000 people all get into planes, consume\n   carbon,
    and then attend various meetings in what often is a jetlagged\n   stupor.  We
    gotta stop meeting like this.  This draft calls on the\n   LLC to research on
    the community's behalf new modalities for IETF\n   face-to-face meetings.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document presents an architecture and framework for IPv6 access\n
    \  networks that decouples the network-layer concepts of Links,\n   Interface,
    and Subnets from the link-layer concepts of links, ports,\n   and broadcast domains,
    and limits the reliance on link-layer\n   broadcasts.  This architecture is suitable
    for IPv6 over any network,\n   including non-broadcast networks, which is typically
    the case for\n   intangible media such as wireless and virtual networks such as\n
    \  overlays.  A study of the issues with IPv6 ND over intangible media\n   is
    presented, and a framework to solve those issues within the new\n   architecture
    is proposed.\n\n\t "

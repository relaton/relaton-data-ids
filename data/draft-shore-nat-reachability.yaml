  content: "     One of the most persistent, difficult problems introduced with NATs\n
    \    is voluntary reachability -- a NATted device making itself avail-\n     able
    to the public internet.  This paper is an overview of the cur-\n     rent status
    of reachability, a decomposition of the problem and a\n     proposal for going
    forward.\n\t "

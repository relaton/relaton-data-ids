  content: "   Route Optimization is a useful aspect of Mobile IPv6.  In Route\n   Optimization
    mode a Mobile Node (MN) can communicate with a\n   Correspondent Node (CN) without
    the involvement of the MN's home\n   agent.  However, there are some limitations
    to this feature,\n   including that the Mobile Node and the Correspondent Node
    must both\n   be capable of Route Optimization.  This document introduces a Route\n
    \  Optimization Proxy function that can be used to enable Route\n   Optimization
    between an MN and an arbitrary other IP CN - the Route\n   Optimization functions
    are delegated to the Proxy.  The Route\n   Optimization Proxy function may be
    implemented in the access router\n   attached to the CN or any other node present
    on both the path from\n   the MN to the CN and from the HA to the CN, and the
    Route\n   Optimization Proxy can conduct RO-related signaling and accomplish\n
    \  the Route Optimization procedure on behalf of the Correspondent Node.\n\n\t "

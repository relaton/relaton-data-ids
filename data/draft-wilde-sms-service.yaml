    \  (SMS) as a registered IANA service selector for Global Switched\n   Telephone
    Network (GSTN) numbers.  SMS is not available for all GSTN\n   subscribers, but
    it has proven very popular with users of the Global\n   System for Mobile Communications
    (GSM), and has also been adapted to\n   other telephone network technologies such
    as the Integrated Services\n   Digital Network (ISDN).\n\n\t "

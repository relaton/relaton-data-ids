  content: "   In DNS operations, automated scanners are commonly employed by the\n
    \  operator of a parent zone to detect the presence of specific records,\n   such
    as CDS or CSYNC, in child zones, indicating a desire for\n   delegation updates.
    \ However, the presence and periodicity of these\n   scanners are typically implicit
    and undocumented, leading to\n   inefficiencies and uncertainties.\n\n   This
    document proposes an extension to the semantics of the DSYNC\n   resource record,
    as defined in [RFC9859], allowing parent zones to\n   explicitly signal the presence
    and scanning interval of such\n   automated scanners.  This enhancement aims to
    improve transparency\n   and coordination between child and parent zones.\n\n
    \  TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/johanix/draft-berra-dnsop-announce-scanner\n
    \  (https://github.com/johanix/draft-berra-dnsop-announce-scanner).  The\n   most
    recent working version of the document, open issues, etc, should\n   all be available
    there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull\n   requests.\n\n\t "

  content: "Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) [2] provides a means for entities in\na
    VoIP network to advertise telephony routes to their peers. No\nassumption can
    be made about the treatment which is offered by an\nendpoint propagating a route
    - it could intend to terminate the call\nin some fashion or apply services to
    the call. This document proposes\nan optional ServiceCode attribute propagated
    along with such routes\nwhich provides more information about the services offered
    by the\noriginator.\n\t "

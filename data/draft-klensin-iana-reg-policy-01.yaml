  content: "   For many years, the IETF has maintained, via the IANA, registries of\n
    \  protocol and parameter names and numbers.  The primary purpose of\n   these
    registries is to ensure that different methods and options are\n   properly identified
    and distinguished.  Registration of such names or\n   numbers generally does not
    necessarily imply approval of the\n   technology in the corresponding protocol.
    \ Instead, registration\n   represents the desire to keep choices distinctly identified,\n
    \  separated, and public to avoid conflicts in use.  In recent years,\n   various
    changes in the nature of the instructions given to the IANA,\n   increased perceptions
    of scarcity in the number spaces associated\n   with some of the parameters, and
    other issues have led to a shift in\n   emphasis from \"registration to keep identifiers
    unique\" toward\n   evaluations of the quality of proposals for and preferences
    among\n   protocols.  This document argues that shift is undesirable.  It\n   articulates
    and clarifies the principles that the reasons for\n   evaluation of registration
    requests is to ensure a minimum quality of\n   definition, that any assertions
    of scarcity to restrict registrations\n   must be accompanied by a plan for evaluating
    and, if appropriate,\n   eliminating the scarcity problem, and that, if a \"no
    scarcity\" plan\n   is not possible, to establish criteria for making decisions
    that are\n   as specific and objective as possible.\n\n   This document is intended
    to update the general considerations of RFC\n   2434, the specific allocation
    rules of RFC 2780, and the evaluation\n   criteria associated with other documents
    that condition an IANA\n   registration on Expert Review with IESG oversight or
    on IESG or IETF\n   action.\n\t "

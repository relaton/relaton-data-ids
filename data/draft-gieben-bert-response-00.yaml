  content: "  This draft contains a number of loose ends and does not include any\n
    \ text on any (known) corner cases.  Its primary goal is to document\n  the choices
    the DNSEXT working group has on the subject of fixing the\n  NSEC enumeration
    in DNSSEC.  If at any point in time the working\n  group feels this idea needs
    further work, this draft will be updated.\n\n  DNSSECbis [RFC LIST] allow for
    zone enumeration by walking NSEC\n  chains.  It also has a large impact on the
    zone size at the initial\n  deployment stage.  This draft proposes a method to
    address these\n  issues by the use of online signing of negative and wildcard\n
    \ responses.\n\t "

  content: "   An overview of Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is provided in\n
    \  [FRAMEWORK] and a proposed architecture in [ARCH]. A fundamental\n   concept
    in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree\n   on the meaning
    of the labels used to forward traffic between and\n   through them. This common
    understanding is achieved by using the\n   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) referenced
    in [FRAMEWORK] and\n   [ARCH].  This document defines the LDP protocol.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A number of countermeasures for attacks against service provider\n
    \  backbone network infrastructure have been specified or proposed, each\n   of
    them usually targeting a subset of the problem space.  There has\n   never been
    a more generic analysis of the actual problems, and which\n   countermeasures
    are even necessary (and where).  This document tries\n   to provide that higher-level
    view.\n\n\t "

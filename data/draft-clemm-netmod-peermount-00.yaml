abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a mechanism, Peer-Mount, that allows YANG\n   datastores
    to reference and incorporate information from remote\n   datastores.  This is
    accomplished by extending YANG with the ability\n   to define mount points that
    reference data nodes in other YANG\n   subtrees and subsequently allowing those
    data nodes to be accessed by\n   client applications as if part of an alternative
    data hierarchy.  In\n   addition, means to manage and administer tho mount points
    are\n   provided.  This facilitates the development of applications that need\n
    \  to access network-wide data that treanscends individual network\n   devices
    while ensuring network-wide data consistency.  One example\n   concerns example
    applications that require a network inventory and/or\n   network topology with
    access to select management data within the\n   nodes that comprise it.\n\n   The
    concept of Peer-Mount was first introduced in an earlier Internet\n   Draft that
    was no longer pursued due to lack of interest at the time.\n   It is being revived
    now in light of renewed IETF interest in network\n   inventory, network topology,
    and related use cases, for which Peer-\n   Mount is of specific interest.  Other
    concepts defined in the earlier\n   draft, notably Alias-Mount, are not considered
    here since they\n   provide other capabilities that are less applicable to those
    topics.\n\n\t "

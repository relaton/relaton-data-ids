  content: "   As the Internet of Things (IoT) technology grows with the development\n
    \  of wireless communication and sensors, many people are interested in\n   Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), which is the representative\n   protocol of the IoT.
    In addition, attempts have been made to apply\n   CoAP to sensors that support
    existing real-time streaming services.\n   However, the CoAP is not suitable for
    services to support streaming\n   services such as smart band and CCTV. To overcome
    this drawback,\n   there is an extension called CoAP Observe, but streaming services\n
    \  using CoAP Observe imposes a load on the server, which is not\n   suitable
    for environments where low power devices act as servers,\n   such as data transfer
    between sensors and gateways. In this\n   specification, we are considering the
    situation in which the sensor\n   acts as a server, and in this environment, we
    define one mechanism to\n   provide efficient streaming service.\n\n\t "

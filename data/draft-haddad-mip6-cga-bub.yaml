  content: "   This memo describes a method to exploit the Cryptographically\n   Generated
    Address (CGA) features in highly mobile environment. \n   The draft introduces
    a new optimization to the \"Binding Update \n   Backhauling (BUB)\" proposal,
    which eliminates the need for \n   running a return routability (RR) procedure
    at the beginning \n   and improves its security.\n\t "

  content: "   In this draft context, things are powered by micro controllers units\n
    \  (MCU) comprising a set of memories such as static RAM (SRAM), FLASH\n   and
    EEPROM. The total memory size, ranges from 10KB to a few\n   megabytes. In this
    context code and data integrity are major\n   security issues, for the deployment
    of Internet of Things\n   infrastructure. The goal of the bijective MAC (bMAC)
    is to compute\n   an integrity value, which cannot be guessed by malicious software.\n
    \  In classical keyed MACs, MAC is computing according to a fixed\n   order.\n
    \  In the bijective MAC, the content of N addresses is hashed according\n   to
    a permutation P (i.e. bijective application).\n   The bijective MAC key is the
    permutation P.\n   The number of permutations for N addresses is N!. So the computation\n
    \  of the bMAC requires the knowledge of the whole space memory; this\n   is trivial
    for genuine software, but could very difficult for\n   corrupted software, especially
    for time stamped bMAC.\n\n\n\t "

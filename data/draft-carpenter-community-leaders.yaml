  content: "   This is a personal view of what the IETF community might expect of\n
    \  its members who serve in leadership positions such as Area Directors\n   and
    IAB members.  It is intended as personal input to the Nominating\n   Committee,
    but posted as a draft since there is nothing private about\n   it.  A particular
    emphasis is placed on the need for such members to\n   be responsive to the community
    as a whole rather than to impose\n   personal opinions.\n\n\t "

  content: "Several applications, such as peer-to-peer (P2P), content\ndistribution
    and realtime services rely on selection mechanisms in\norder to select the peer
    or server from which to request the service.\nExamples of such services are: file
    sharing, media streaming and\nvoice gateways.\n\nApplication-layer selection algorithms
    do not typically take into\naccount network-layer topology information; either
    that information\nis unavailable to them, or when such information is available
    (e.g.,\nfrom BGP Looking Glass servers), it does not include sufficient\ninformation
    about the local topology in the neighbourhood of the\napplication client(s).  Therefore,
    most applications today make their\nselection decisions based on performance measurements
    (combined with\nsome amount of random selection) and largely ignore network layer\nrouting.
    \ It has been demonstrated that by keeping the traffic local\n(e.g., within the
    same Autonomous System) both infrastructure\nutilization and application performance
    may be improved.\n\nBy enhancing selection algorithms through the use of accurate\nnetwork-layer
    topology, applications may improve performance while\nnetwork operators are also
    able to reduce the utilization of\ninfrastructure resources by application traffic.
    \ At the same time,\nexchange of information between the application and the network\nshould
    not be allowed to compromise confidentiality for either party.\nDetailed routing
    information owned by the service provider should not\nbe made publicly available,
    while detailed information about the\napplication should also not be made known
    to the service provider.\n\nThis draft introduces a signaling protocol which we
    call \"PROXIDOR\".\nThe PROXIDOR protocol is a request-response protocol in which
    a\nPROXIDOR Client (PxC) issues requests to and receives responses from\na PROXIDOR
    Server (PxS).  The questions of how a PxC discovers a PxS\nand how a PxS acquires
    network-layer topology information are beyond\nthe scope of this document.\n\t "

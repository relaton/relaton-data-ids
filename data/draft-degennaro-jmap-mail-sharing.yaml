abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the JSON Meta Application Protocol
    (JMAP) for Mail to enable sharing of mailboxes between users. Building upon the
    JMAP Sharing framework defined in [RFC9670], this specification extends the Mailbox
    data type defined in [RFC8621] with properties necessary to configure and manage
    access permissions for shared mailboxes. The extension introduces a new capability
    that indicates server support for mailbox sharing and defines the additional properties
    required to share mailboxes with other principals, including the ability to control
    which users may access a mailbox and what permissions they possess.</p>"

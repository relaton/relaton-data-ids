  content: "   Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security\n
    \  (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application\n   protocols
    such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the\n   last few years, several
    serious attacks on TLS have emerged,\n   including attacks on its most commonly
    used cipher suites and their\n   modes of operation.  This document provides recommendations
    for\n   improving the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS.\n   The
    recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases.\n\n\t "

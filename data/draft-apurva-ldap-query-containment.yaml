    at the backend of many internet and intranet applications. LDAP\nservers that
    cache entries which are returned as search results\n(queries) for recently evaluated
    search requests, can use the semantic\ninformation associated with these requests,
    to answer subsequent\nsearch requests which are contained in them. This document
    describes\nLDAP schema for representing the semantic information and for\nsupporting
    query containment of LDAP queries.  \n\t "

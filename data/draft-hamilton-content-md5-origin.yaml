  script: Latn
  content: "   The Content-MD5: header specified in RFC 1864 has not been widely\n
    \  deployed, though this would be highly desirable for a number of\n   reasons.
    \ The author conjectures that this lack of usage is due at\n   least in part to
    the requirement that only originating user agents\n   may add a Content-MD5: header.
    \ This proposal updates RFC 1864 to\n   remove that requirement, and defines the
    header Content-MD5-Origin:\n   for use by relaying hosts to indicate the point
    at which a Content-\n   MD5: header was added.\n\n\t "

  content: "User-Agent Display Attributes Headers provide a means for an HTTP client
    [3] and server to negotiate for content dependent on the client display capabilities.
    \ This memo describes feature tags for introducing this information into an HTTP
    transmission.  The intent is to present resource variants when available [5] such
    that a capable server may present documents in a preferred form to a client.  If
    such a preferred form is not available, the server should still provide the requested
    documents.  This specification is intended as an extension to HTTP/1.1 [4], to
    be implemented using the negotiation mechanism, transparent content negotiation
    [5].\n\t "

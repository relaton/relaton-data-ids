  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes the NSIS Signaling Layer protocol (NSLP) for\n
    \  network traffic authorization on the Internet, the Permission-Based\n   Sending
    (PBS) NSLP.  This NSLP aims to prevent Denial-of-Service\n   (DoS) attacks and
    other forms of unauthorized traffic.  PBS NSLP is\n   based on a hybrid approach:
    a proactive approach of explicitly\n   granting permissions and a reactive approach
    of monitoring and\n   countering attacks.  Signaling installs and maintains the
    permission\n   state of routers for a data flow.  A monitoring mechanism provides
    a\n   second line of defense against attacks.  PBS NSLP uses two security\n   mechanisms:
    message security for protecting the integrity of the\n   message on end-to-end
    traffic and channel security for protecting the\n   integrity and confidentiality
    between adjacent nodes.  To\n   authenticate data packets, the PBS NSLP requests
    a sender to use an\n   existing security protocol, the IPsec Authentication Header
    (AH).\n\n\t "

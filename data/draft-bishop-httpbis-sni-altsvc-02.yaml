  content: "   HTTP Alternative Services provides a mechanism for an origin to\n   declare
    that its content is accessible via some other combination of\n   host, port, and
    protocol.  In the process of using such an\n   alternative, an observer can identify
    that the client is requesting\n   resources from a particular hostname.\n\n   This
    document extends HTTP Alternative Services, in combination with\n   Secondary
    Certificate Authentication, to enable clients not to\n   disclose the origin to
    which they intend to connect.\n\n\t "

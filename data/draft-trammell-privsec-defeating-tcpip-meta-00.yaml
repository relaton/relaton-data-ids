  content: "   The TCP/IP stack provides protocol features that can potentially be\n
    \  abused by on-path attackers to inject metadata about a traffic flow\n   into
    that traffic flow in band.  When this injected metadata is\n   provided by an
    entity with knowledge about the natural person\n   associated with a traffic flow,
    it becomes a grave threat to privacy,\n   which we term a hypercookie.\n\n   This
    document defines a threat model for hypercookie injection and\n   hypercookie
    coercion attacks, catalogs protocol features that may be\n   used to achieve them,
    and provides guidance for defeating these\n   attacks, with an analysis of protocol
    features that are disabled by\n   the proposed defeat mechanism.\n\n   The deployment
    of firewalls that detect and reject abuse of protocol\n   features can help, but
    the relative ease of injecting metadata for\n   attackers on path, and trivial
    combination of metadata injection\n   attacks, leads to a recommendation to add
    cryptographic integrity\n   protection to transport layer headers to defend against
    injection\n   attacks.\n\n   tl;dr: at least with respect to metadata injection
    in the current\n   Internet protocol stack, everything is ruined.\n\n\t "

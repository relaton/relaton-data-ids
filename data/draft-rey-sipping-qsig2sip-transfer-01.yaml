  content: "This document specifies call transfer interworking between the \n   Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate \n   telecommunication networks
    (also known as enterprise networks). SIP \n   is an Internet application-layer
    control (signalling) protocol for \n   creating, modifying, and terminating sessions
    with one or more \n   participants. These sessions include, in particular, telephone
    calls. \n   QSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating
    \n   circuit-switched calls, in particular telephone calls, within Private \n
    \  Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number \n   of
    ECMA Standards and published also as ISO/IEC standards.\n\t "

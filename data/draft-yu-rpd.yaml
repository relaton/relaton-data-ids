  content: "This document proposes a syntax which would enable network administrators
    to express and describe their routing policy in a globally consistent manner and
    therefore to facilitate routing policy sharing, analysis, coordination, implementation
    and enforcement in the Internet.  At the same time, it also proposes and discusses
    a model for routing policy sharing and coordination based on the description of
    routing policies using such syntax.\n\t "

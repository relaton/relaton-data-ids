- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Route Target Constraints (RTC) is used to build a VPN route\n   distribution
    graph such that routers only receive VPN routes\n   corresponding to specified
    route-targets (RT) that they are\n   interested in.  This is done by exchanging
    the route-targets as\n   routes in the RTC address-family and a corresponding
    \"RT filter\" is\n   installed that influences the VPN route advertisement.  In
    networks\n   employing hierarchical Route Reflectors (RR) the use of RTC can lead\n
    \  to incorrect VPN route distribution and loss in connectivity as\n   detailed
    in an earlier draft . Two solutions were provided to\n   overcome the problem.\n\n
    \  This draft presents a method with suggested modifications to the RTC\n   RFC
    in order to solve the hierarchical RR RTC problem in an efficient\n   manner.\n\n\t "

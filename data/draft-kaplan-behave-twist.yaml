  content: "If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations it can be
    impossible \nfor that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers) located
    behind \nother NATs.  In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use
    the services \nof an intermediate node on the Internet that acts as a communication
    relay.  \nLikewise, if a host of one IP address family wants to communicate with
    the host of \nanother address family, through one or more NATs, an intermediate
    node may be \nnecessary.  This specification defines a protocol, called TWIST
    (Traversal With \nInternet Server Transports), that allows the host to control
    the operation of a \nTWIST relay and to exchange packets with its peers using
    the relay, or directly \nbetween each other. \n \nThis is similar to TURN, but
    defines an alternative mechanism which is more \nscalable, cheaper to deploy,
    and is thus more likely to succeed in achieving wide-\nspread use.  TWIST is not
    meant to replace TURN, but rather to provide an \nalternative.  This document
    is a straw-man proposal, to stimulate discussion, not \na fully defined draft.\n\t "

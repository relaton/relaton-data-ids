  content: "This document specifies a mechanism for Mobile IPv6 nodes of IPv6 \nSite
    to continue utilizing Mobile IPv6 services when they roam \ninto IPv4 domains.
    The mechanism is based on Mobile IPv6 and \nMobile IPv4 glued together by IPv4
    encapsulation for delivering \nIPv6 packets between the Mobile IPv6 nodes and
    their Mobile IPv6 \nhome agents. To support the mechanism specified in this draft,
    the \nMobile IPv6 nodes MUST be Mobile IPv4 capable and MUST NOT utilize \nMobile
    IPv6 route optimization when in IPv4 domain, and some of \nthe border routers
    of the site MUST be capable to act as Mobile \nIPv4 home agent(s). The IPv6 site
    does not need to run 6to4 \nprotocol, however.  \n\n\t "

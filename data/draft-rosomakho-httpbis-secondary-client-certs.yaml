  content: "   This document defines a mechanism for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 clients to\n
    \  provide additional certificate-based credentials after the TLS\n   handshake
    has completed, using TLS Exported Authenticators.  Unlike\n   traditional client
    authentication during the TLS handshake, this\n   mechanism allows clients to
    present multiple certificates over the\n   lifetime of a session.\n\n\t "

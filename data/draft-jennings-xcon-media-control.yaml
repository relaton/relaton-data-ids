  content: "   Conference servers have many controls that change how the media is\n
    \  combined for the various conference participants.  It is necessary to\n   describe
    these controls to the clients connected to a centralized\n   conference, so that
    the clients can render a user interface and allow\n   the user to manipulate them.\n\n
    \  This work is being discussed on the xcon@ietf.org mailing list.  This\n   draft
    has not changed since the 02 version.\n\t "

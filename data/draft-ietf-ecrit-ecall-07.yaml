  content: "   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n   mechanisms
    to support the next generation of the Pan European in-\n   vehicle emergency call
    service defined under the eSafety initiative\n   of the European Commission (generally
    referred to as \"eCall\"). eCall\n   is a standardized and mandated system for
    a special form of emergency\n   calls placed by vehicles.  eCall deployment is
    required in the very\n   near future in European Union member states, and eCall
    (and eCall-\n   compatible systems) are also being deployed in other regions.
    \ eCall\n   provides an integrated voice path and a standardized set of vehicle,\n
    \  sensor (e.g., crash related), and location data.  An eCall is\n   recognized
    and handled as a specialized form of emergency call and is\n   routed to a specialized
    eCall-capable Public Safety Answering Point\n   (PSAP) capable of processing the
    vehicle data and trained in handling\n   emergency calls from vehicles.\n\n   Currently,
    eCall functions over circuit-switched cellular telephony;\n   work on next-generation
    eCall (NG-eCall, sometimes called packet-\n   switched eCall or PS-eCall) is now
    in process, and this document\n   assists in that work by describing how to support
    eCall within the\n   IP-based emergency services infrastructure.\n\n   This document
    also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency\n   Call Additional Data Block
    for the eCall vehicle data.\n\n\t "

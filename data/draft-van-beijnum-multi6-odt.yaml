  content: "This document describes a protocol to negotiate and subsequently use\ntunnels
    on demand, and the use of such tunnels to achieve scalable\nmultihoming. The tunnels
    may run over either IPv4 or IPv6 transport,\nand the payload may consist of any
    upper layer protocol that can be\nused with IPv4 or IPv6. Tunnels are defined
    end-to-end, which means\nthat a single outer or 'locator' address pair maps to
    a single inner\nor 'identifier' address pair. In order to avoid unnecessary\noverhead,
    tunneled packets (in the absence of option headers) only\ncarry an outer header,
    an upper layer header and payload data. There\nis no inner header containing the
    original addresses; this\ninformation is reconstituted from the state associated
    with the\ntunnel where required. \n\nAdditional mechanisms are used to provide
    basic security for the\nmapping between inner and outer addresses and to avoid
    unnecessary\noverhead and delays for short-lived sessions, and to facilitate\nrehoming
    in the event of a reachability problem. \n\nThis document is a first draft, and
    as such doesn't contain a full\nprotocol specification as higher-level changes
    are expected. \n\n\t "

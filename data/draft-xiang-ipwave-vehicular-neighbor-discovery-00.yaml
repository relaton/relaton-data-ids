  content: "   This document specifies a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) as an\n
    \  extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP-based vehicular\n   networks.
    \ An optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate\n   Address Detection
    (DAD) mechanism are established for both operation\n   efficiency and the saving
    of wireless bandwidth and vehicle energy.\n   Also, the two new ND options for
    a rapid prefix and service discovery\n   are used to announce the network prefixes
    and services inside a\n   vehicle (i.e., a vehicle's internal network).  Finally,
    a mobility\n   management scheme is proposed for moving vehicles in vehicular\n
    \  environments to support seamless communication for the continuity of\n   transport-layer
    sessions (e.g., TCP connections).\n\n\t "

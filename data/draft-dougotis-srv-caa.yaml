  script: Latn
  content: "   Typical use of DNS records enables resolving a server address, but\n
    \  this record extension authorizes clients to initiate a specific\n   protocol.
    \ This document simply extends definitions for fields of a\n   DNS SRV record
    as defined in [RFC2782] and appends '_c' to the label\n   in the Proto field.
    \ This extension enables administrative control of\n   a domain referenced by
    a client as it enables verification of\n   permitted client addresses.  This record
    extension is useful to\n   authorize a client for a specific protocol and possibly
    useful for\n   confirming veracity of a return path also referenced by a client.\n
    \  Although an in-addr.arpa IP address reverse DNS query may assert a\n   domain,
    the domain referenced within client identification may be an\n   alias and thus
    not match.  In addition, specific protocol\n   authorization for the client can
    not be deduced and reverse DNS\n   information is optional, typically administered
    separately or not\n   delegated, and thus often providing information of limited
    value.\n\t "

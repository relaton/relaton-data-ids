  content: "Xcast+[2] is newly proposed multicast scheme to support\nIGMPv2/MLDv3
    in Explicit Multicast(Xcast)[1]. Xcast+ is suitable\nfor one-to-few multicast
    applications. In order to support few-to-\nfew communication naturally, the control
    plane of existing Xcast+\nshould be extended. In this document, a new control
    plane for few-\nto-few communication for Xcast+ is specified. In order to acheive\nthis,
    the concept of logical core (LC) is newly introduced.\n\n\n\t "

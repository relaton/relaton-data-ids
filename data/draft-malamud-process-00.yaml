  content: "This document is  a response to the  call for a working  group to examine
    the Process  for Organization of Internet  Standards (POISED). The document  contains
    one  possible set  of solutions  to the  issues examined by the POISED working
    group.   It does not reflect a position of the working group and is not necessarily
    a consensus view.                 The document suggests  the replacement of the
    \ current technology development bodies of  the Internet  (the IAB, IETF,  IESG,
    and  IRTF) with a new, streamlined structure.  We refer to this community  as
    the Technical Task Force of the Internet.                                       The
    document also deals at length the with questions of accountability  of boards
    to the general membership.  The document recommends a set of  procedures, such
    as open meetings,  and discusses ways of handling  the selection and approval
    process for personnel changes.    The document  considers many of these issues
    within the broader context of the Internet Society as well as the Technical Task
    Force.\n\t "

  content: "This draft considers the problem of limited bandwidth to NFS servers.
    \ \n   The bandwidth limitation exists because an NFS server has limited \n   network,
    CPU, memory and disk I/O resources.  Yet, access to any one \n   file system through
    the NFSv4 protocol requires that a single server \n   be accessed.  While NFSv4
    allows file system migration, it does not \n   provide a mechanism that supports
    multiple servers simultaneously \n   exporting a single writable file system.
    \n    \n   This problem has become aggravated in recent years with the advent
    of \n   very cheap and easily expanded clusters of application servers that \n
    \  are also NFS clients.  The aggregate bandwidth demands of such \n   clustered
    clients, typically working on a shared data set \n   preferentially stored in
    a single file system, can increase much more \n   quickly than the bandwidth of
    any server.  The proposed solution is \n   to provide for the parallelization
    of file services, by enhancing \n   NFSv4 in a minor version.\n\t "

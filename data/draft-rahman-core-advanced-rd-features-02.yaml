  content: "   The Resource Directory (RD) is a key element for successful\n   deployments
    of constrained networks.  Similar to the HTTP web search\n   engines (e.g.  Google,
    Bing), the RD for CoAP should also support\n   useful search query responses beyond
    a basic listing of relevant\n   links.  This document proposes several new features
    to be considered\n   for the RD.  The only goal of this document is to trigger
    discussion\n   in the CoRE WG so that all relevant features for RD evolution are\n
    \  taken into account during CoRE re-charter activities.\n\n\t "

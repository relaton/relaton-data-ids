  script: Latn
  content: "HYDRO is a hybrid routing protocol for Lossy and Low power Networks\n(L2Ns)
    that embraces centralized and distributed routing mechanisms.\nThrough the use
    of standard ICMP Route Advertisements and Route\nSolicitations, Node Routers build
    Default Routes to Border Routers.\nThese routes, which maintain multiple options
    per each Node Router\nwhen available, are maintained through data-driven link
    estimation.\nNode Routers periodically report a high-quality subset of their\nDefault
    Route Table to Border Routers, which then form a global view\nof the topology.
    \ When a Node Router attempts to route to another\nNode Router in the network,
    if no matching entry exists in the Node\nRouter's Flow Table, it forwards the
    packet to a Border Router, which\nthen installs the correct Flow Table Entries
    in the network to enable\nmore efficient subsequent routing.\n\t "

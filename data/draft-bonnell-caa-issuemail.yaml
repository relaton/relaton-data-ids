  content: "   The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS resource record\n
    \  type provides a mechanism for domains to express the allowed set of\n   Certification
    Authorities that may issue certificates for the domain.\n   The core CAA specification
    ([RFC8659]) solely defines Property Tags\n   that restrict the issuance of certificates
    that certify domain names;\n   it does not define a mechanism for domains to restrict
    the issuance\n   of certificates that include email addresses.  This specification\n
    \  defines a Property Tag that grants authorization to Certification\n   Authorities
    to issue certificates which certify email addresses.\n\n\t "

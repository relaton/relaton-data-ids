- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The IPv6 protocol includes a flow label in every packet header, but this
    field is not used in practice.  This paper describes the flow label standard and
    discusses the implementation issues that it raises.  It then describes various
    published proposals for using the flow label and shows that most of them are inconsistent
    with the standard.  Methods to address this problem are briefly reviewed.  We
    also question whether the standard should be revised.  This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "IPsec (IP Security) tunnel encapsulation and decapsulation were \nspecified
    prior to the addition of ECN (Explicit Congestion \nNotification) to IP, with
    the potential result that ECN congestion \nindications could be discarded by IPsec
    tunnel decapsulators.  The \ncurrent ECN specification includes two ECN operating
    modes for \nIPsec tunnels to avoid this situation, and IKEv1/ISAKMP (Internet
    \nKey Exchange/Internet Security Association and Key Management \nProtocol) negotiation
    extensions to enable ECN to be used correctly \nwith IPsec tunnels.  To simplify
    this situation, IKEv2 requires \nchanges to tunnel decapsulation that prevent
    discarding of ECN \ncongestion indication, obviating the need for multiple ECN
    \noperating modes and associated negotiation support.\n\t "

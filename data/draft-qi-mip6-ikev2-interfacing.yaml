  content: "This draft discusses the issues associated with interfacing between\nIKEv2/IPsec
    and MIPv6.  When mobile nodes bootstrap in foreign\nnetwork or handover to a new
    network, IKEv2/IPsec can not probe the\nchanging of care-of-address, which is
    related security associations.\nOne simple extension to the SADB_ACQUIRE in PF_KEY
    framework is\nproposed to support this interfacing.  And the operation modification\nof
    IKEv2 and MIPv6 are described in this proposal based on the\nSADB_ACQUIRE extension.
    \ A new mobility security reference database\nis created to store the temporary
    mobility parameters.\n\t "

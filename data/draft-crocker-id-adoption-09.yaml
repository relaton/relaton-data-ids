  content: "The productive output of an IETF working group is documents, as mandated
    by the working group's charter.  When a working group is ready to develop a particular
    document, the most common mechanism is for it to \"adopt\" an existing document
    as a starting point.  The document that a working group adopts and then develops
    further is based on initial input at varying levels of maturity.  An initial working
    group draft might be a document already in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet,
    wholly created by the working group, or it might represent any level of maturity
    in between.  This document discusses how a working group typically handles the
    formal documents that it targets for publication.\n\t "

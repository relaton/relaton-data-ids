  content: "Several Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and ISIS in the\n
    \  context of MPLS Traffic Engineering in order to convery some link\n   characteristics
    such as the available bandwidth, traffic enginering\n   metric, adminstrative
    group and so on.  There are various\n   circumstances where it would be useful
    to also know the number of\n   unconstrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched
    Path(s) (TE LSP).\n   This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering
    sub-TLV\n   used to advertise the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled\n
    \  across a specific link.\n\t "

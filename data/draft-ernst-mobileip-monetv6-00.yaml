  content: "This draft addresses the problems of routing datagrams to nodes\nlocated
    in an IPv6 mobile network. A mobile network is one or more\nIP-subnets attached
    to a mobile router and mobile as a unit. The\nmobile router dynamically changes
    its point of attachment.\nApplications of mobile networks include networks attached
    to people\n(PANs) and networks of sensors deployed in an aircraft, a boat, or
    a\ncar.\n\t "

  content: "Verified Hello (VHLO) is an SMTP extension for managing authorization\nby
    policy, as done for whitelisting messages.  The VHLO command verb\nprovides for
    weak authentication of SMTP clients and policy\nnegotiation.\n\nPolicies and reputation
    are being increasingly used to identify\nmessages worthiness.  However, they are
    currently enforced by\nrejecting SMTP transactions, or discarding messages.  Feedback
    is\nscarce, also because reply codes are difficult to interpret\nautomatically.
    \ Negotiation is not provided for.  VHLO is designed so\nthat servers can provide
    feedback to their clients about which\nvouching services or authentication methods
    they require.\nCredentials can also be negotiated on the fly, in order to allow\nclients
    to learn whether messages will be whitelisted by the\nreceiving server before
    actually transmitting them.  Negotiation and\nfeedback are intended to ease rapid
    diffusion of popular reputation\nsystems and authentication methods.  A IANA register
    is defined for\nextending the set of available methods.\n\nThe VHLO command is
    similar to EHLO, but accepts a series of\nparameters.  The sender communicates
    the mail domain name of the\norganization on whose behalf it operates, along with
    any vouching\nservices (VBR) for its reputation.  On the other hand, the sending\nhost's
    affiliation with that mail domain is checked by DNS lookups\n(MX, PTR, or SPF)
    or using DKIM.  DNSBLs and Greylisting are also\nconsidered.\n\nWeakly authenticated
    clients enjoy an intermediate level of trust:\nthey have no relying privileges,
    but may attempt to deliver mail to\nlocal users, are whitelisted from some filters,
    and may receive DSNs\nand feedback-loop abuse reports as needed.  However, failing
    to\nsuccesfully negotiate VHLO authentication does not preclude a\nclient's ability
    to relay mail: It may relay as usual; that is to\nsay, without knowing whether
    the credentials it tries to provide have\nany meaning for the receiving server.\n\t "

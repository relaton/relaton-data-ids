  content: "   This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR), a routing\n
    \  protocol mechanism to simplify the path description of data plane\n   traffic
    in Segment Routing (SR) deployments with OSPFv2 and OSPFv3\n   protocols.  PPR
    aims to mitigate the MTU and data plane processing\n   issues that may result
    from SR packet overheads; and also supports\n   further extensions along the paths.
    \ Preferred path routing is\n   achieved through the addition of path descriptions
    to the OSPF\n   advertised prefixes, and mapping those to a PPR data-plane\n   identifier.\n\n\n\t "

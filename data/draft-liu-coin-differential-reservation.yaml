  content: "   Computing in the network may require the embedded computing\n   capability
    in the network device, such as gateway, switch, etc, and\n   there might be so
    much distributed computing task in the network.\n   Some new applications like
    AR/VR, motion control put forward higher\n   demand of network than before, and
    AI is also considered to be used\n   in the app and network.  In order to satisfy
    the demands, it needs to\n   guarantee both the bandwidth resource and the computing
    resource\n   which is linked by the network.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes extensions to the Entity MIB to provide information about the state
    of physical entities.\n\n In addition, this memo defines a set of Textual Conventions
    to represent various states of an entity. The intent is that these Textual Conventions
    will be imported and used in MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
    representations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   In the context of vehicular networks for Intelligent Transportation\n
    \  Systems (ITS), vehicles that comprise in-vehicle networks require to\n   discover
    Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs) of other vehicles in order to\n   communicate with
    other vehicles or the roadside infrastructure on the\n   same wireless link.  This
    document proposes Mobile Network Prefix\n   Provisioning (MNPP), a solution to
    advertise an MNP assigned to a\n   vehicle to others in both a proactive or reactive
    fashion.\n\t "

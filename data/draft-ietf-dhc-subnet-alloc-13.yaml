abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a DHCPv4 option that currently exists and was previously
    privately defined for the operation and usage of the Cisco Systems' Subnet Allocation
    Option for DHCPv4. The option is passed between the DHCPv4 Client and the DHCPv4
    Server to request dynamic allocation of a subnet, give specifications of the subnet(s)
    allocated, and report usage statistics. This memo documents the current usage
    of the option in agreement with RFC 3942, which declares that any preexisting
    usages of option numbers in the range 128-223 should be documented and that the
    working group will try to officially assign those numbers to those options. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"

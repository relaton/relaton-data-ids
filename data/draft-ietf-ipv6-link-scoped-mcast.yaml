- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing architecture
    of the IPv6 protocol.  The extension allows the use of Interface Identifiers (IIDs)
    to allocate multicast addresses.  When a link-local unicast address is configured
    at each interface of a node, an IID is uniquely determined.  After that, each
    node can generate its unique multicast addresses automatically without conflicts.
    \ The alternative method for creating link-local multicast addresses proposed
    in this document is better than known methods like unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast
    addresses.  This memo updates RFC 3306. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

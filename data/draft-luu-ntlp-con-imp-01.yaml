  content: "  The working group NSIS (Next Step In Signaling) is created to define
    a \n  new signaling protocol.  This signaling protocol will be generic and \n
    \ applicable to the most of present and future signaling applications. \n  Some
    of these signaling applications are resource reservation, \n  communication protocol
    for middlebox, VPN, etc.\n\n  The intention of NSIS is to re-use, where appropriate,
    the protocol \n  mechanisms of RSVP while at the same time simplifying it and
    applying \n  a more general signaling model.\n\n  NSIS signaling protocol is composed
    of two layers. NTLP (NSIS \n  Transport Layer Protocol) layer is responsible for
    transporting \n  signaling messages. NSLP (NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol) is the
    upper \n  layer that contains functionality such as message formats and \n  sequences,
    specific to a particular signaling application.\n\nNSIS signaling protocol is
    composed of two layers. NTLP (NSIS\nTransport Layer Protocol) layer is responsible
    for transporting\nsignaling messages. NSLP (NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol) is
    the upper\nlayer which contains functionality such as message formats and\nsequences,
    specific to a particular signaling application.\n\nThis document outlines the
    proposal of implementation for NTLP which\ncan satisfy the requirements defined
    in the NSIS working group.\n\t "

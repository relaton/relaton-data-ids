  content: "This draft describes a simple, incremental, network-based protocol to\nimplement
    separation of Internet addresses into Endpoint Identifiers\n(EIDs) and Routing
    Locators (RLOCs).  This mechanism requires no\nchanges to host stacks and no major
    changes to existing database\ninfrastructures.  The proposed protocol can be implemented
    in a\nrelatively small number of routers.\n\nThis proposal was stimulated by the
    problem statement effort at the\nAmsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop
    (RAWS), which took\nplace in October 2006.\n\t "

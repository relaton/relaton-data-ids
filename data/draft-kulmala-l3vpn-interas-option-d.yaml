  content: "This document describes an additional option to the 'Multi-AS \nBackbones'
    section of [RFC4364]. This option combines per VPN VRFs at \nthe Autonomous System
    Border Router (ASBR) as described in 'Option A' \nwith the redistribution of labeled
    VPN-IPv4 routes as described in \n'Option B'. In addition, this option allows
    for a data plane consisting \nof two methods of traffic forwarding between attached
    ASBR pairs.  \n\nIn this Multi-AS option, the ASBR installs VPN-IPv4 routes into
    VRFs in \nthe same manner as described in [RFC4364] e.g. VPN-IPv4 routes are \nconverted
    back to IPv4 routes and imported into VRFs via Route Target \n(RT) based filtering
    policies. Once installed in a VRF, selected IPv4 \nroutes are converted to VPN-IPv4
    routes by the addition of Route \nDistinguisher (RD) values, along with one or
    more associated RTs as \nconfigured per VRF at the ASBR.  \n\nDependant on service
    provider preference, traffic forwarding between \nattached ASBRs is either via
    per VRF attachment circuits or a 'global' \n(non-VRF attachment circuit associated)
    IP interface. In both traffic \nforwarding cases, packets may be MPLS-labeled
    or non-labeled. \n\nIf attached ASBR pairs belonging to separate Autonomous Systems
    (AS) \nmake use of this Multi-AS option, then VRF based route filtering \npolicies
    via RTs is achieved directly between ASBR pairs, independent \nof PE based RT
    filtering within an AS. \n\t "

  content: "The purpose of this draft is to describe terminology specific to the \nbenchmarking
    of devices that support one or more routing protocols.  \nIt builds upon the tenets
    set forth in RFC 2544 and other IETF \nBenchmarking Methodology Working Group
    (BMWG) efforts.  This \ndocument seeks to extend these efforts to the router benchmarking
    \nparadigm.  \nThe BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking
    \nTerminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents. The \nTerminology
    documents present the benchmarks and other related \nterms.  The Methodology documents
    define the procedures required to \ncollect the benchmarks cited in the corresponding
    Terminology \ndocuments.\n\t "

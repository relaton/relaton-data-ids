abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of AI(Artificial Intelligence) technology, large
    model have shown significant advantages and great potential in recognition, understanding,
    decision-making, and generation, and can well match the self-intelligent network
    management requirements for the goal of autonomous network or Intent-based Networking,
    and can be used as one of the potential driving technologies to drive high-level
    autonomous networks. When introducing AI for network management, how to integrate
    AI technology and deal with the relationship with the existing network management
    entity (such as network controller) is the focus of research and standardization.
    This document presents the concept of AI based network management agent(NMA),
    provides the basic definition and reference architecture of NMA, discusses the
    relationship of NMA with traditional network controller or other network management
    entity by exploring the delpoyment mode of NMA, and proposes the comman processing
    flow and typical application scenarios of NMA.</p>"

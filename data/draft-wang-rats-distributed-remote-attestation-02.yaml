  content: "   In many deployments, remote attestation is performed within separate\n
    \  administrative and trust domains.  Each domain typically operates its\n   own
    management plane and a Remote Attestation Service (RAS) to obtain\n   verifier
    inputs (e.g., endorsement material and reference values) and\n   produce attestation
    results.  At scale, cross-domain scenarios face\n   two recurring challenges:
    (1) enabling policy-controlled transparency\n   so that verifiers or relying parties
    in one domain can discover and\n   retrieve selected attestation artifacts from
    other domains; and (2)\n   supporting many-to-many distribution and reuse of verifier
    inputs and\n   verifier outputs without requiring point-to-point integrations.\n\n
    \  This document describes Distributed Remote Attestation (DRA) patterns\n   that
    use a shared publication channel for selected artifacts with\n   provenance and
    access control in mind.  A Distributed Ledger (DL) is\n   discussed as one concrete
    instantiation of such a publication\n   channel, including an option to host verification
    logic on the DL.\n   The described patterns are intended to complement existing
    RATS\n   procedures and conceptual messages, and can be realized by other\n   tamper-evident
    publication channels with comparable properties.\n\n\t "

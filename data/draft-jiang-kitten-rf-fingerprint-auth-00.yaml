abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents the concept of RF fingerprint which is the unique
    identity characteristics of wireless device and can not be modified. Then, we
    give the method to get the RF fingerprint from the emitted wireless signal. At
    last, we tell how to use the RF fingerprint to carry out the authentication. Because
    of the non-replicable of RF fingerprint, the security of the authentication can
    be improved.</p>"

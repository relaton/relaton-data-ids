  content: "This document details an RSVP Policy Element that provides a\nmechanism
    by which RSVP reservation establishment can be reliably\nconfirmed, end-to-end.
    This Policy Element provides a status update\nwith each PATH message refresh,
    useful for determining the lifetime\nof a reservation end-to-end. Such a policy
    element will be useful\nfor accounting and billing applications that are interested
    in\nreliably knowing when a reservation has been successfully\nestablished end-to-end
    and when a reservation is finally removed.\n\n\t "

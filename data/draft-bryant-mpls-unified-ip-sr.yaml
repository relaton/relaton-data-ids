  content: "   Segment routing is a source routed forwarding method that allows\n
    \  packets to be steered through a network on paths other than the\n   shortest
    path derived from the routing protocol.  The approach uses\n   information encoded
    in the packet header to partially or completely\n   specify the route the packet
    takes through the network, and does not\n   make use of a signaling protocol to
    pre-install paths in the network.\n\n   Two different encapsulations have been
    defined to enable segment\n   routing in an MPLS network or in an IPv6 network.
    \ While\n   acknowledging that there is a strong need to support segment routing\n
    \  in both environments, this document defines a mechanism to carry MPLS\n   segment
    routing packets encapsulated in UDP.  The resulting approach\n   is applicable
    to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks without the need for any\n   changes to the IP
    or segment routing specifications.\n\n   This document makes no changes to the
    segment routing architecture\n   and builds on existing protocol mechanisms such
    as the encapsulation\n   of MPLS within UDP defined in RFC 7510.\n\n   No new
    procedures are introduced, but existing mechanisms are\n   combined to achieve
    the desired result.\n\n\n\t "

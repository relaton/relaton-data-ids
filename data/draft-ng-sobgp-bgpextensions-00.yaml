  script: Latn
  content: "   There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systems\n
    \  within the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway\n   Protocol
    [BGP], which is used to provide routing information between\n   autonomous systems.
    This document proposes a system where the origin\n   of any advertisement within
    BGP can be verified and authenticated,\n   preventing the advertisement of prefix
    blocks by unauthorized\n   networks, verifying that the final destination in the
    path is\n   actually within the autonomous system to which the packets are being\n
    \  routed, and proving the validity of the AS Path contained in the\n   update.\n\t "

  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (STD 94, RFC 8949)
    is\n   a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely\n
    \  small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without\n   the
    need for version negotiation.\n\n   In addition to the binary interchange format,
    CBOR from the outset\n   (RFC 7049) defined a text-based \"diagnostic notation\"
    in order to be\n   able to converse about CBOR data items without having to resort
    to\n   binary data.  RFC 8610 extended this into what is known as Extended\n   Diagnostic
    Notation (EDN).\n\n   This document consolidates the definition of EDN, sets forth
    a\n   further step of its evolution, and is intended to serve as a single\n   reference
    target in specifications that use EDN.  It updates RFC\n   8949, obsoleting its
    Section 8, and RFC 8610, obsoleting its\n   Appendix G.\n\n   It specifies an
    extension point for adding application-oriented\n   extensions to the diagnostic
    notation.  It then defines two such\n   extensions that enhance EDN with text
    representations of epoch-based\n   date/times and of IP addresses and prefixes
    (RFC 9164).\n\n   A few further additions close some gaps in usability.  The document\n
    \  modifies one extension originally specified in Appendix G.4 of RFC\n   8610
    to enable further increasing usability.  To facilitate tool\n   interoperation,
    this document specifies a formal ABNF grammar, and it\n   adds media types.\n\n\n
    \  // (This \"cref\" paragraph will be removed by the RFC editor:) The\n   //
    present revision -14 is intended to reflect the feedback on -13 as\n   // discussed
    during IETF 121.\n\n\t "

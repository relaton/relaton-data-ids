  content: "This document addresses a network side solution of fast handover in \nMobile
    IPv6. Existing FMIPv6 basically assumes the involvement of \nmobile nodes in handover
    procedure. However, in some cases, it may not \nbe easy to realize fast handover
    function into all mobile nodes. In \nthe case, a network operator may want to
    provide fast handover service         \nto users by using only networks entities.
    To achieve network side fast \nhandover, this document basically uses bi-directional
    tunnel between a \nprevious access router and new access router. The proposed
    fast \nhandover scheme has simpler procedure than the existing FMIPv6 and             \nmostly
    uses the existing messages. \n\t "

  content: "   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n   protocol
    provides support for flow level multi-pathing with rapid\n   failover for both
    unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks\n   with arbitrary topology
    between TRILL switches. Active-active at the\n   TRILL edge is the extension of
    these characteristics to end stations\n   that are multiply connected to a TRILL
    campus. This informational\n   document discusses the high level problems and
    goals when providing\n   active-active connection at the TRILL edge.\n\n\n\t "

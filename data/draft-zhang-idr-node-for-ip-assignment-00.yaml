  content: "   There is a great challenge in cabling deployment for an enterprise-\n
    \  scale data center. An error in wire-connection between switches could\n   lead
    to a reduction in network throughout or unreachable for some\n   routers within
    network in an even worse case. In addition, it is also\n   a tough task to find
    and repair the error connection among numerous\n   wires. A method to address
    this error in switch connection would save\n   a great amount of time and cost
    in modern data center construction.\n   Here, this draft introduces an approach
    for auto-assignment of IP\n   addresses for wired switches, which allows data
    to be transmitted via\n   a cable that is connecting two arbitrary interfaces
    from two\n   switches.\n\n\n\t "

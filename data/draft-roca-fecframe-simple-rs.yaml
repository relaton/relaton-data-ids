abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for Reed-\nSolomon
    codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 <= m <= 16, that can be used to\nprotect arbitrary
    media streams along the lines defined by the\nFECFRAME framework.  Reed-Solomon
    codes belong to the class of\nMaximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes which means
    they offer optimal\nprotection against packet erasures.  They are also systematic
    codes,\nwhich means that the source symbols are part of the encoding symbols.\nThe
    price to pay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the\nmaximum number
    of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity\nhigher than that of LDPC
    codes for instance.\n\t "

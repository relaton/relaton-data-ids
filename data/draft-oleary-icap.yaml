  content: "This Internet Calendar Access Protocol  (ICAP) allows a client to\naccess,
    manipulate and store Calendar information on a server. ICAP\nemploys the iCalendar
    format [ICAL] for interchange of calendaring\ninformation.\n \nICAP includes operations
    for creating Calendar stores on a server,\nopening them and retrieving information
    about them. When a\nCalendar Store has been opened, it can be bounded by start
    and end\ntimes so that the client can act on a smaller subset of Calendar\ninformation
    for more efficient operation. ICAP allows users to store\nnew Calendar Objects
    into their own Calendar store and Calendar\nstores owned by other users with a
    single operation.\n \nICAP supports searching iCalendar objects within a Calendar
    Store.\nSearches can be based on any iCalendar property and filtered by\niCalendar
    Component type.\n\n\t "

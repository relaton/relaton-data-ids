  content: "  This document discusses the problem of global IP mobility \n  management
    in a context where some mobile operators and service \n  providers are looking
    for adequate solutions to the inter-system \n  IP mobility problem. The document
    addresses the specific issue of \n  moving between IP access domains that use
    different mobility \n  management protocols and mechanisms. Indeed this type of
    movement \n  would be an important subset of global IP mobility scenarios. \n\n\t "

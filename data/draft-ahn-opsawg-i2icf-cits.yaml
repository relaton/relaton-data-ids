  content: "   This document specifies a structured framework for orchestrating,\n
    \  managing, and monitoring In-Network Computing Functions (ICFs) in\n   Cooperative
    Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS).  For example,\n   in the context of
    Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications,\n   efficient management of Vehicle-to-Vehicle
    (V2V) communications and\n   their integration with C-ITS can greatly benefit
    from in-network\n   computing.  By leveraging ICFs, it becomes possible to optimize
    real-\n   time communication, streamline traffic management, and enhance data\n
    \  processing and security services at the network edge.\n\n\n\t "

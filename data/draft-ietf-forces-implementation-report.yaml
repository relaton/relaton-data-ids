  content: "Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural
    framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between
    the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES network element (ForCES
    NE). RFC 3654 has defined the ForCES requirements, and RFC 3746 has defined the
    ForCES framework.\n\n This document is an implementation report for the ForCES
    Protocol, Model, and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol-based Transport
    Mapping Layer (SCTP TML) documents, and includes a report on interoperability
    testing and the current state of ForCES implementations. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

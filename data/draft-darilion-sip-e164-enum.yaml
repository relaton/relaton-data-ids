  content: "To determine which domain is allowed to claim ownership of a certain\ntelephone
    number is difficult.  This may cause problems when to\nauthenticate endpoints
    that use telephone number URIs and domain\nnames in their From address.  This
    document investigates a proposal\nthat stores a public key below the corresponding
    ENUM tree in the\nDNS.  The verifier can determine ownership by performing an
    ENUM\nlookup to retrieve the public key from the DNS and to use it for\nverifying
    the signature created as part of the SIP Identity\nmechanism.\n\nThis document
    is a contribution to the ongoing discussion on RFC 4474\nwhen used in combination
    with E.164 numbers.\n\t "

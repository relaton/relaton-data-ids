  content: "   A common problem for sensitive web services is informing the client,\n
    \  in a reliable fashion, when a password protected resource is no\n   longer
    valid because the user is logged out of the service.  This is,\n   in particular,
    considered a potential security problem by some\n   sensitive services, such as
    online banking, when the user navigates\n   the client's history list, which is
    supposed to display the resource\n   as it was when it was loaded, not as it is
    the time the user\n   navigates to it.\n\n   This document presents a method for
    collecting such sensitive\n   resources into a group, called a \"Cache Context\",
    which permits the\n   server to invalidate all the resources belonging in the
    group either\n   by direct action, or according to some expiration policy.  The\n
    \  context can be configured to invalidate not just the resources, but\n   also
    specific cookies, HTTP authentication credentials and HTTP over\n   TLS session
    information.\n\n\n\t "

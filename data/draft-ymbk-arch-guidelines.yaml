  content: "This document extends RFC 1958 by outlining some of the philosophical
    guidelines to which architects and designers of Internet backbone networks should
    adhere.  We describe the Simplicity Principle, which states that complexity is
    the primary mechanism that impedes efficient scaling, and discuss its implications
    on the architecture, design and engineering issues found in large scale Internet
    backbones.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

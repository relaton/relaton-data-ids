  content: "   This document provides environment security requirements for the I2RS\n
    \  architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent of\n   the
    protocol used for I2RS.  As a result, the requirements provided\n   in this document
    are intended to provide good security practise so\n   I2RS can be securely deployed
    and operated.\n\n   These security requirements are designated as environment
    security\n   requirements as opposed to the protocol security requirements\n   described
    in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].  The\n   reason to have separate
    document is that protocol security\n   requirements are intended to help the design
    of the I2RS protocol\n   whether the environment requirements are rather intended
    for\n   deployment or implementations.\n\n\t "

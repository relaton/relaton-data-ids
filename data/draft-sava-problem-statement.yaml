  content: "\n   This document outlines the problems that the Source Address\n   Verification
    Architecture (SAVA) initiative plans to solve.  It\n   examines the current state
    in the internet, looks at current best\n   practices, and discusses why the current
    approaches are unlikely to\n   ever solve the problem of IP address spoofing.
    \ It also discusses\n   some of the  problems that SAVA should NOT attempt to
    solve.\n\n\n\t "

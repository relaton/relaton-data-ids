  content: "   Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in\n
    \  routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for\n   being
    well-connected because topological richness amplifies the\n   number of update
    messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD\n   off.  Based on experimental
    measurement, this document recommends\n   adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants
    and limits, to reduce the\n   high risks with RFD, with the result being damping
    a non-trivial\n   amount of long term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes'\n
    \  normal convergence process.\n\n\n\t "

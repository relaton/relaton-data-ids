  content: "   One-way delay is a key indicator to measure network quality.  Some\n
    \  applications are one-way transmission in the network, such as some\n   high-definition
    video services, and are very sensitive to one-way\n   delay.  Excessive delay
    will affect user experience greatly.  To some\n   extent, the network can't even
    be used, so it is very important to\n   accurately measure the network transmission
    delay.  The current one-\n   way delay measurement method has problems such as
    high complexity and\n   low measurement accuracy.  In order to solve the problem
    of high-\n   precision one-way delay measurement, a one-way delay measurement\n
    \  method based on deterministic networking is proposed in this\n   document.
    \ The method takes advantage of the delay characteristics of\n   the deterministic
    networking and does not depend on precise time\n   synchronization.The method
    realizes the one-way delay measurement of\n   any service flow between any network
    elements.  Its technical\n   advantages are: the network does not need to send
    measurement\n   packets, can test all traffic types, does not change network status,\n
    \  does not change the format of traffic packets, and does not require\n   network
    elements to support time synchronization protocols.\n\n\t "

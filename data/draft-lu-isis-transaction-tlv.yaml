  content: "   ISIS local updates may require multiple LSPs to convey.  Receiving\n
    \  routers, whose decision processes are without such knowledge, may\n   generate
    incorrect routing table updates based on the partial set of\n   LSPs it receives
    and hence the traffic outage before they are\n   corrected by another run of the
    decision process.  This memo\n   describes a method that makes the decision process
    more informed so\n   that the interim results can be minimized or avoided.\n\n\t "

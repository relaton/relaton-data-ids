  content: "   The IPv6 header includes a 20-bit Flow Label field.  RFC 3697, \"IPv6\n
    \  Flow Label Specification\" [1] specified this field and minimum\n   requirements
    for using the field.  This document first identifies\n   several issues related
    to the current Flow Label specification; then\n   it discusses the limitations
    of the current specification and the\n   need for extending the definition to
    accommodate emerging\n   applications and protocols; finally, a new Flow Label
    specification\n   is proposed that enables more effective usage of this field.\n\t "

  content: "SMTP [SMTP] [HOST-REQ] and its service extensions [ESMTP] provide a mechanism
    for transferring mail reliably and efficiently.  The design of the SMTP protocol
    effectively requires the receiver-SMTP to manage a mail delivery queue.                                                            In
    some limited circumstances, outside the area of mail exchange between independent
    hosts on public networks, it is desirable to implement a system where a mail receiver
    does not manage a queue.  This document describes an extension command which modifies
    the SMTP protocol to accommodate this situation.                                                This
    extension is one which should be used only by specific prior arrangement and configuration.
    \ Its use by a sender-SMTP should not be triggered by availability, therefore
    the extension is not given an ESMTP EHLO keyword.\n\t "

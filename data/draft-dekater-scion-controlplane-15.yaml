  content: "   This document describes the Control Plane of the path-aware, inter-\n
    \  domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and\n   Isolation
    On Next-generation networks).  A fundamental characteristic\n   of SCION is that
    it gives path control to SCION-capable endpoints\n   that can choose between multiple
    path options, thereby enabling the\n   optimization of network paths.  The SCION
    Control Plane is\n   responsible for discovering these paths and making them available
    to\n   the endpoints.\n\n   The SCION Control Plane creates and securely disseminates
    path\n   segments between SCION Autonomous Systems (AS) which can then be\n   combined
    into forwarding paths to transmit packets in the data plane.\n   This document
    describes mechanisms of path exploration through\n   beaconing and path registration.
    \ In addition, it describes how\n   Endpoints construct end-to-end paths from
    a set of possible path\n   segments through a path lookup process.\n\n   This
    document contains new approaches to secure path aware\n   networking.  It is not
    an Internet Standard, has not received any\n   formal review of the IETF, nor
    was the work developed through the\n   rough consensus process.  The approaches
    in this work are offered to\n   the community for its consideration in the further
    evolution of the\n   Internet.\n\n\t "

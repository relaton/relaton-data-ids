  content: "   This document examines a P2PSIP architecture where the peer-to-peer\n
    \  (P2P) layer is separate from and lies below the SIP layer.  We\n   discuss
    the functions of the P2P layer in such an architecture, and\n   focus in on the
    Distributed Transport function - the function that\n   allows a peer to exchange
    messages with any other peer in the\n   overlay, even in the presence of NATs.
    \ We list the features that the\n\n\n   Distributed Transport function needs to
    provide, and observe that the\n   Host Identity Protocol (HIP) already provides
    a number of these\n   features.  We then propose extensions to HIP that allow
    it to provide\n   the missing features.  We discuss how a complete P2PSIP architecture\n
    \  can be built around HIP, and contrast this approach with other\n   approaches
    for implementing a P2P layer.  Two of the advantages of\n   HIP approach are that
    (a) most existing applications can run in an\n   overlay without needing any changes
    and (b) peer mobility and NAT\n   traversal are handled in a way that is transparent
    to most\n   applications.\n\n\t "

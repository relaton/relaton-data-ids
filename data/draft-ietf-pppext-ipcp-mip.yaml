  content: "Mobile IP [RFC 2002] defines media-independent procedures by which a Mobile
    Node can maintain existing transport and application-layer connections despite
    changing its point-of-attachment to the Internet and without changing its IP address.
    \ PPP [RFC 1661] provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol packets
    over point-to-point links.  As currently specified, Mobile IP Foreign Agents which
    support Mobile Node connections via PPP can do so only by first assigning unique
    addresses to those Mobile Nodes, defeating one of the primary advantages of Foreign
    Agents.  This documents corrects this problem by defining the Mobile-IPv4 Configuration
    Option to the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) [RFC 1332].  Using this
    option, two peers can communicate their support for Mobile IP during the IPCP
    phase of PPP.  Familiarity with Mobile IP [RFC 2002], IPCP [RFC 1332], and PPP
    [RFC 1661] is assumed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

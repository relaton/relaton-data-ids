  content: "   When implementing signaling protocols such as GIMPS, implementors\n
    \  need a way to test the functionality and measure the performance of\n   their
    own implementations.  In this document, we try to provide a\n   sketch for such
    a testing tool, a simple, stateless \"Ping\" NSLP,\n   which works similar to
    ICMP Ping.  This tool is able to traverse a\n   path from a source to a destination
    along signaling aware network\n   nodes and collect various data that could be
    useful for identifying\n   each node it is passing.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Historically, TCP as specified in RFC 793 was threatened by the blind\n
    \  data injection attack because of the loose acceptable ACK value\n   validation,
    where the ACK value of a data segment is considered valid\n   as long as it does
    not acknowledge data ahead of the next segment to\n   send.  RFC 5961 improved
    the defect by shrinking the range of\n   acceptable ACK values in a data segment.
    \ Later, RFC 9293 involved\n   the updates proposed by RFC 5961 as a TCP stack
    implementation\n   option.\n   However, an endpoint that follows the RFC 9293
    specifications can\n   still accept a data segment containing an ACK value acknowledging\n
    \  data that the endpoint has never sent.  This document specifies small\n   modifications
    to the way TCP verifies incoming data segments' ACK\n   value to prevent TCP from
    accepting invalid ACK values.\n\n\t "

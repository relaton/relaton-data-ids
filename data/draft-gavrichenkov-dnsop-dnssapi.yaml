  content: "   Managed DNS services are widely used to maintain DNS zones.\n   Virtually
    all of them have an API of some sort, in most cases an XML-\n   RPC or JSON-RPC
    API, while most of them lack the support of zone\n   transfers.  The latter is
    unlikely to change any time soon due to the\n   reasons outlined below.  This
    document describes a protocol, a common\n   denominator of existing API protocols,
    that both a service provider\n   and its customer can use to exchange information
    about DNS zones and\n   policies.\n\n\t "

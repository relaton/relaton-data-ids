  content: "   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] protocol\n
    \  provides network related information to client applications so that\n   clients
    may make informed decisions.  To that end, an ALTO Server\n   provides Network
    and Cost Maps.  Using those maps, an ALTO Client can\n   determine the costs between
    endpoints.\n\n   However, the ALTO protocol does not define a mechanism to allow
    a\n   client to obtain updates to those maps, other than by periodically\n   re-fetching
    them.  Because the maps may be large (potentially tens of\n   megabytes), and
    because only parts of the maps may change frequently\n   (especially Cost Maps),
    that can be extremely inefficient.\n\n   Therefore this document presents a mechanism
    to allow an ALTO Server\n   to provide updates to ALTO Clients.  Updates can be
    both immediate,\n   in that the server can send updates as soon as they are available,\n
    \  and incremental, in that if only a small section of a map changes,\n   the
    server can send just the changes.\n\n\n\t "

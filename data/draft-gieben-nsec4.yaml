  content: "   The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the\n
    \  NSEC resource record for authenticated denial of existence, and the\n   NSEC3
    resource record for hashed authenticated denial of existence.\n   This document
    introduces an alternative resource record, NSEC4, which\n   similarly provides
    authenticated denial of existence.  It permits\n   gradual expansion of delegation-centric
    zones, just like NSEC3 does.\n   With NSEC4 it is possible, but not required,
    to provide measures\n   against zone enumeration.\n\n   NSEC4 reduces the size
    of the denial of existence response and adds\n   Opt-Out to unhashed names.\n\n\t "

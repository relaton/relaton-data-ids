  content: "This document describes the use of the Common Open Policy Service\n(COPS)
    protocol for supporting Service Level Specification (SLS)\nnegotiation (COPS-SLS).
    The COPS protocol [COPS] has been defined by \nthe IETF Resource Allocation Protocol
    (RAP) WG [RAP] and will be used \nin this memo to communicate SLS information
    between customer and \nprovider. COPS-SLS can be used at different interfaces
    such as \nvertically between a service provider and a network provider or \nhorizontally
    between network providers in order to decide if the \nnetwork guarantees a service
    level for a traffic stream. This version \npresents COPS-SLS as a candidate protocol
    for the interface between \nthe Resource Control Domain (RCD) and the Service
    Control Domain \n(SCD), according to [SESSION-AUTH] vocabulary. It enables an
    SCD to\nvertically reserve RCD resource for its customers. Once resource has \nbeen
    reserved in the RCD, the media session establishment, together \nwith the horizontal
    resource reservation, follows the steps described \nin the [AUTHSESSION] framework.
    Moreover, the respective PDPs have to \nverify that all the media streams being
    accepted lie within the \nbounds of the resource reserved in the RCD by the SCD.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP
    allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state,
    allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby
    enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based
    on a Sigma-compliant Diffie- Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers
    from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol
    is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the- middle
    (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable security protocol, such
    as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and
    optional encryption for upper- layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.  This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

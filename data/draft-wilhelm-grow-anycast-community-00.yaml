  content: "   In theory routing decisions on the Internet and by extension within\n
    \  ISP networks should always use hot-potato routing to reach any given\n   destination.
    \ In reality operators sometimes choose to not use the\n   hot-potato paths to
    forward traffic due to a variety of reasons,\n   mostly motivated by traffic engineering
    considerations.  For prefixes\n   carrying anycast traffic in virtually all situations
    it is advisable\n   to stick to the hot-potato principle.  As operators mostly
    don't know\n   which prefixes are carrying unicast or anycast traffic, they can't\n
    \  differentiate between them in their routing policies.\n\n   To allow operators
    to take well informed decisions on which prefixes\n   are carrying anycast traffic
    this document proposes a well-known BGP\n   community to denote this property.\n\n\t "

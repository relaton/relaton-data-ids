  content: "   This draft describes an AI based TCP-IP model. By understanding how\n
    \  the Network is evolving from a Wireless and Software perspective\n   the limitations
    of current Internet Architecture are identified and\n   the corrections needed
    for the Big Data bottleneck present in\n   current Internet Architecture are described
    further. This draft\n   explains about the implicit life cycle between the Cloud,
    Network\n   and Internet.\n   An important conclusion is drawn that the Network
    cannot be\n   declassified from the Cloud.\n   Based on the evolution of the Virtualized
    Datacenter within the\n   Cloud architecture framework and the implicit fact that
    the Network\n   also needs to grow and scale towards the Cloud another important\n
    \  conclusion that the whole Topological address space which is the\n   current
    IP address space (IP as well as IPv6) needs to be\n   reclassified or divided
    into a physical (or logical) address space\n   and a new Virtual address space.
    The Virtual address space is a\n   Centralized Control plane which only processes
    routing information.\n   A future Internet architecture for resolving the Big
    Data bottleneck\n   which introduces a Virtual address space at specific Intersection\n
    \  points such as Inter-AS, CsC and IXP (Internet Exchange Points) is\n   described.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Much work has been put into adding authentication methods (DKIM,\n
    \  ARC), source verification (SPF) and policy support (DMARC) to email\n   flows,
    however all these specifications have focused on looking\n   backwards through
    email flow only, and only add new headers to\n   messages, causing them all to
    be susceptible to replay or re-use.\n\n   In particular, in early 2022, a type
    of attack called \"DKIM Replay\"\n   was widely seen, where correctly DKIM-signed
    messages were sent to a\n   different envelope sender.  The \"To\" address would
    not be aligned,\n   but such messages can also be the result of legitimate mailflow,
    so\n   these messages were delivered to end-recipient mailboxes, and caused\n
    \  reputation issues for the signers of the original message.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines the Call Processing Language (CPL), a language to
    describe and control Internet telephony services.  It is designed to be implementable
    on either network servers or user agents.  It is meant to be simple, extensible,
    easily edited by graphical clients, and independent of operating system or signalling
    protocol.  It is suitable for running on a server where users may not be allowed
    to execute arbitrary programs, as it has no variables, loops, or ability to run
    external programs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

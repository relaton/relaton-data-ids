  content: "This document provides an applicability analysis on the use of \n   Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and \n   mechanisms to satisfy
    the requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual Private \n   Network (L1VPN) Enhanced
    Mode. \n    \n   L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1
    over \n   layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic
    \n   Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Enhanced Mode of operation \n   features
    exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network \n   and the customer
    domain. \n   In addition, this document identifies areas where additional protocol
    \n   extensions or procedures are needed to satisfy the requirements of \n   the
    L1VPN Enhanced Mode, and provides guidelines for potential \n   extensions.\n\t "

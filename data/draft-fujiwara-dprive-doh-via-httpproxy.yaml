  content: "   DNS queries over HTTPS (DoH) hides DNS query information by (HTTPS)\n
    \  encryption.  However, DoH providers know both query source IP\n   addresses
    and DNS queries, and it is a privacy issue of DoH.  It is\n   possible to hide
    query source IP addresses from DoH providers by\n   existing protocol (HTTP) and
    implementations (HTTP proxy software).\n   This document proposes the use of DoH
    via HTTP proxy services.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Emergency calling is a localized event, requiring a caller to place
    \n   an specially identified local emergency call to a Public Safety \n   Answering
    Point (PSAP), while including the location of the caller \n   in that signaling.
    \ The function of routing the set-up messaging to \n   the appropriate PSAP is
    performed by a mapping function that binds a\n   given location with one or more
    PSAP SIP(S)-URIs.  This function is \n   done by the ECRIT mapping protocol.  This
    document analyzes when the\n   ECRIT mapping protocol function can occur, and
    what general \n   components are involved in that mapping.\n\n\t "

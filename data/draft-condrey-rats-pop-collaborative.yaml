  content: "   This document defines an extension to the Proof of Process (PoP)\n
    \  specification for documenting collaborative authorship.  The\n   extension
    enables multiple contributors to independently attest to\n   their individual
    contributions while maintaining a unified Evidence\n   chain for the combined
    document.  This supports use cases including\n   academic co-authorship, legal
    document drafting by teams, and\n   creative works with multiple writers.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to the Proof of Process (PoP) specification
    for documenting collaborative authorship. The extension enables multiple contributors
    to independently attest to their individual contributions while maintaining a
    unified Evidence chain for the combined document. This supports use cases including
    academic co-authorship, legal document drafting by teams, and creative works with
    multiple writers.</p>"

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This memo proposes an optional fast-track way to get from a working\n
    \  group document to IESG review that can be used for cases when working\n   group
    chairs believe that there is running code that implements a\n   working group
    Internet-Draft.  The basic idea is to do all of working\n   group last call, IETF
    last call and area director review during the\n   same two week period, to impose
    a higher barrier for comments that\n   might block progress, and to require prompt
    action by authors in\n   processing any changes arising from IETF last call.  The
    motivation\n   is to have the IETF process explicitly consider running code,\n
    \  consistent with the IETF's overall philosophy of running code and\n   rough
    consensus.  The intent is to run an RFC 3933 process experiment\n   to test out
    this approach.  [[This draft is proposed by the author\n   and not the IESG.]]\n\n\t "

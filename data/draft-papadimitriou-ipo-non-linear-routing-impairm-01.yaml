  script: Latn
  content: "Today, in transparent optical networks, the increasing bit-rate (10\nGbit/s
    and up to 40 Gbit/s in the future), combined with the\nincreasing number of wavelengths
    (16 and higher up to 320) and a\nnarrowing of the channels spacing, enhance the
    impact of non-linear\neffects on optical signal quality.\n\t "

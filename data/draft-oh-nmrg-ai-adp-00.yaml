  content: "   This document discusses the use of AI technology to automate the\n
    \  management of computer network resources distributed across different\n   locations.
    \ AI-based network management by automating distributed\n   processing involves
    utilizing deep learning algorithms to analyze\n   network traffic, identify potential
    issues, and take proactive\n   measures to prevent or mitigate those issues.  Network
    administrators\n   can efficiently manage and optimize their networks, thereby
    improving\n   network performance and reliability.  AI-based network management\n
    \  also aids in optimizing network performance by identifying\n   bottlenecks
    in the network and automatically adjusting network\n   settings to enhance throughput
    and reduce latency.  By implementing\n   AI-based network management through automated
    distributed processing,\n   organizations can improve network performance, and
    reduce the need\n   for manual network management tasks.\n\n\t "

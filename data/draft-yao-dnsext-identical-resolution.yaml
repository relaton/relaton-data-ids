  content: "This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises from\nthe
    desire to treat a set or group of names as \"aliases\" of each\nother, \"bundled,\"
    \"variants,\" or \"the same,\" which is problematic in\nterms of corresponding
    behavior for DNS labels.\n\nWith the emergence of internationalized domain names,
    among other\npotential use cases, two or more names that users will regard as\nhaving
    identical meaning will sometimes require corresponding\nbehavior in the DNS.  It's
    not clear how to accommodate these\nrequirements for behavior of such names in
    DNS resolution; in\nparticular, it's not clear when they are best accommodated
    in\nregistry practices for generating names for lookup in the DNS,\nexisting DNS
    protocol elements and behavior, or some set of protocol\nelements or behavior
    not yet defined.  This document attempts to\ndescribe some of these cases and
    the behavior of some of the possible\nsolutions discussed to date.\n\nNOTE: Even
    more than usual, version -02 of this document is a \"work\nin progress\".  Additional
    updates may be expected between the date of\nthis document and the DNSEXT meeting
    in Beijing, and can be found at\nhttp://users.isc.org/~woolf.\n\t "

  content: "   When DNS replies to be sent over UDP exceed the requestor's UDP\n   payload
    size, servers are expected to set the Truncated bit (TC) and\n   remove remove
    additional information from the response.  Clients\n   receiving the TC bit might
    choose to retry the request over TCP to\n   fetch the removed information.  Sometimes
    this extra information is\n   not important to the DNS resolution process and
    retrying over TCP may\n   not be needed.  This document defines the DP bit to
    indicate that the\n   dropped information that caused the TC bit was supplemental\n
    \  information.  This is useful, for example, in the case of Extended\n   DNS
    Error information which may be mostly debugging related\n   information.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes a method to achieve Fast Handoffs in Mobile\nIPv6.
    Fast Handoffs are required in Mobile IPv6 in order to limit\nthe period of service
    disruption experienced by a wireless Mobile\nNode when moving between access routers.
    This requirement becomes\neven more important when supporting real-time services.
    Fast\nHandoffs involve anticipating the movement of MNs by sending\nmultiple copies
    of the traffic to potential Mobile Node movement\nlocations. Both flat and Hierarchical
    Mobile IPv6 models are\nconsidered. The Hierarchical MIPv6 mobility Management
    model in [1]\nalready offers improvements to Mobile IP handoffs by providing a\nlocal
    Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) functionality. Some additions\nare made to the operation
    of this existing Hierarchical model to\nachieve Fast Handoffs.\n\t "

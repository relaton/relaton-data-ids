  content: "   In this specification OSPF shortest path first computation is done\n
    \  based on power ratios (consumed-power to available-bandwidth OR\n   available-bandwidth
    to available-bandwidth) assigned to links and\n   nodes such as Broadcast-Multi-Access
    networks that form part of the\n   topology in an area. When MPLS is deployed
    in the area (be it the\n   backbone or non-backbone area) LDP can be used to distribute
    a\n   disjoint set of labels for the power based topology. Flows some or\n   all
    of those that traverse the area can then be mapped either to the\n   regular shortest-path
    tree or the power based shortest-path tree.\n   This document specifies the proposal
    to construct and maintain such a\n   tree called the power based SPT.\n\n\n\t "

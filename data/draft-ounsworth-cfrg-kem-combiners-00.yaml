  content: "   The migration to post-quantum cryptography often calls for performing\n
    \  multiple key encapsulations in parallel and then combining their\n   outputs
    to derive a single shared secret.\n\n   This document defines the KEM combiner
    KDF( H(ss1) || H(ss2) ) which\n   is considered to be a dual PRF in practice,
    even though not provably\n   secure.  This mechanism simplifies to KDF( ss1 ||
    ss2 ) when used\n   with a KEM which internally uses a KDF to produce its shared
    secret.\n   RSA-KEM, ECDH, Edwards curve DH, and CRYSTALS-Kyber are shown to meet\n
    \  this criteria and therefore be safe to use with the simplified KEM\n   combiner.\n\n\t "

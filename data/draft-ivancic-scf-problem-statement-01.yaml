  content: "   This document provides a problem statement for non-realtime\n   communication
    between systems that are generally disconnected, which\n   require multiple network
    hops between source and destination, and\n   which may never be fully connected
    end-to-end at any given time.\n   This document describes a number of use cases
    that motivate having a\n   standard method to communicate between such systems,
    as multi-\n   organization and multi-vendor support and interoperability is highly\n
    \  desirable.  These use cases include dismounted soldiers, sensorwebs,\n   medical
    devices, animal tracking, low-Earth-orbiting satellites and\n   data mule scenarios.
    \ To avoid confusion in terminology when trying\n   to focus on the problem and
    requirements without bias towards\n   particular technical solutions, at this
    time, we refer to the\n   protocol instances that would support such communications
    as Store,\n   Carry, and Forwarding (SCF) agents, and refer to their activity
    as\n   SCF networking.  The concepts involved in SCF networking are not\n   entirely
    new and several facets of the problem have been solved in\n   multiple incompatible
    ways in existing or historic systems.  This\n   document describes the core SCF
    problem and gives an assessment of\n   the ability to use existing technologies
    as solutions.\n\n\t "

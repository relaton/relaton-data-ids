  content: "TCP-AO technology was proposed to obsolete the TCP-MD5 option which\nwas
    developed to protect the BGP sessions between routers.  Besides\nof allowing users
    to choose which cryptographic algorithm(s) they\nwant to use to meet their security
    needs, TCP-AO provides key\ncoordination mechanism giving the ability to move
    from one key to\nanother within the same connection with zero segment loss by
    using\ntwo ID fields i.e.  KeyID and RNextKeyID.  The sender uses the\nRNextKeyID
    to indicate the receiver using the preferred MKT which\nwill authenticate the
    next incoming segments.  However, if the sender\nfinds its MKT which is used to
    authenticate the outgoing segments has\nbeen attacked and should be changed into
    a new one, it can do nothing\nbut wait for receiver to send a segment which carries
    a different\nRNextKeyID.\n\nIn this case, the communication becomes dangerous
    probably because\nthe sender always authenticates outgoing segments by an attacked
    key\nbefore the receiver wants to change the incoming key.  This document\nprovides
    a method giving the sender ability to inform the other part\nchange the RNextKeyID
    when the sender finds the key used in outgoing\nsegment is not safe any longer.\n\t "

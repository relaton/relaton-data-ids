  content: "   This document describes the use cases of multiple provisioning domain\n
    \  (MPVD) in homenet.  Although most residential networks nowadays are\n   connected
    to a single ISP and normally subscribed to standard\n   internet service, it is
    expected that much wider range of devices and\n   services will become common
    in home networks.  Homenet defines such\n   home network topologies with increasing
    number of devices with the\n   assumption that it requires minimum configuration
    by residential\n   user.  As described in the homenet architecture ([RFC7368]),\n
    \  multihoming and multi-service residential network will be more common\n   in
    the near future.  Nodes in such network may commonly have multiple\n   interfaces
    or subscribe to multiple services.  Potential types of\n   PVD-aware nodes concerning
    interface and service specific\n   provisioning domains are introduced in this
    document.  Based on this,\n   different MPVD configuration examples are given.
    \ These examples\n   illustrate how PVD may be implemented in home network.  PVDs
    provide\n   independent provisioning domains for different interfaces and\n   services,
    which enables robust and flexible network configuration for\n   these networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "In multimedia communications, presence, and instant messaging systems,
    there is a need to define Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that represent services
    that are associated with a group of users.  One example is a resource list service.
    \ If a user sends a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) SUBSCRIBE message to the
    URI representing the resource list service, the server will obtain the state of
    the users in the associated group, and provide it to the sender.  To facilitate
    definition of these services, this specification defines two Extensible Markup
    Language (XML) documents.  One document contains service URIs, along with their
    service definition and a reference to the associated group of users.  The second
    document contains the user lists that are referenced from the first.  This list
    of users can be utilized by other applications and services.  Both documents can
    be created and managed with the XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

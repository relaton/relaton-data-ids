  content: "   This document specifies the Ephemeral Compute Attestation (ECA)\n   protocol,
    which enables ephemeral compute instances to prove their\n   identity without
    pre-shared operational credentials.  ECA uses a\n   three-phase ceremony that
    cryptographically combines a public Boot\n   Factor (a high-entropy provisioning
    value), a secret Instance Factor,\n   and a dynamically released Validator Factor
    to establish attestation\n   evidence.  The protocol is transport-agnostic and
    produces Entity\n   Attestation Tokens (EAT) for consumption by Relying Parties,
    such as\n   within automated certificate issuance protocols.\n\n\t "

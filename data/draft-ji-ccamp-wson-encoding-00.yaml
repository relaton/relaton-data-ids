  script: Latn
  content: "   Reconfigurable add/drop optical multiplexers(ROADM) featured highly
    \n   asymmetric switching capability, is an essential element in current \n   wavelength
    switched optical network(WSON).Because the multiple degree\n   Reconfigurable
    add/drop optical multiplexer(ROADM) can not only add/\n   drop wavelength but
    also switch wavelength, it is necessary to know\n   the switch connectivity offered
    by such a network element. With the \n   development of ROADM, the constraint
    of wavelength and direction is \n   abated, so the encoding of the ROADM needs
    improvement. This memo \n   provides a novel encoding for different ROADMs, Which
    is applicable \n   to the encoding of different kind of ROADMs.\n\t "

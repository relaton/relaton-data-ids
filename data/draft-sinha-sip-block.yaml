  content: "     This document defines a new response code, 4XX(Blocked), for the\n
    \    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This response code can be\n     used
    by User Agent Client (UAC) that intentionally does not want\n     to have session
    with an incoming request from another user with\n     particular SIP services.
    \ For example UAC does not want to\n     establish a session with an incoming
    request for video\n     conference from particular domain.  The existing mechanisms
    in\n     SIP do not provide any such facility to refuse a request based\n     request
    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), SIP application,\n     media type or other
    SIP services.\n\n\t "

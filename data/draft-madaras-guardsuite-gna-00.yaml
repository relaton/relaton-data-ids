  content: "   This document specifies the GuardNet Authorization Protocol (GNA),
    a\n   pre-execution authorization framework for high-risk digital and\n   physical
    actions.  GNA defines an enforcement model in which\n   sensitive operations (for
    example, payments, administrative changes,\n   OT/ICS commands, and AI-initiated
    actions) are intercepted before\n   execution, evaluated against policy and context,
    routed to one or\n   more authenticated approvers, and executed only after a valid\n
    \  authorization token is issued.\n\n   GNA provides non-repudiable authorization
    receipts and is designed to\n   integrate with existing identity providers and
    logging systems\n   without requiring architectural changes.  The protocol provides\n
    \  stronger authorization guarantees using digital signatures and\n   contextual
    decisioning and is intended as a complement to, not a\n   replacement for, existing
    authentication and monitoring systems.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the requirements for MIPv4/MIPv6 transition. \nResearches
    \ on  the  IPv4  to  IPv6,  or  IPv6  to  IPv4,  transition \nmechanisms are actively
    being conducted. These transition mechanisms \nassume that hosts are attached
    to the network statically. Currently, \ndevelopments of communication mechanisms
    are developed individually \nand differently. This means that the effects of considering
    mobile \nnode (MN) roaming in IPv4/IPv6 transition networks have not been \ninvestigated.
    Therefore, this document proposes the requirements and \nanalysis of different
    routing architecture of MIPv4/MIPv6 transition \nnetwork.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling can improve\n
    \  the user experience to adapt to network's constraints and share\n   expected
    application needs, and thus to provide differentiated\n   service to a flow and
    to packets within a flow.  The differentiated\n   service may be provided at the
    network (e.g., packet prioritization),\n   the server (e.g., adaptive transmission),
    or both.  Such an approach\n   is called CIDFI, for Collaborative and Interoperable
    Dissemination of\n   Flow Indicators.\n\n   A key component in a CIDFI system
    is to discover whether a network is\n   CIDFI-capable, and if so discover a set
    of CIDFI-aware Network\n   Elements (CNEs) that will be involved in the Host-to-network\n
    \  signaling and network-to-host signaling.  This document discusses a\n   set
    of discovery methods.\n\n\t "

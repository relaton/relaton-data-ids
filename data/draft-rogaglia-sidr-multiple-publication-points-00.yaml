- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) depends on Relying\n
    \  Parties (RP) ability to access its Trust Anchors' certificate\n   specified
    in the different \"Trust Anchor Locator (TAL)\" files and the\n   Repository Objects
    located at the Certificate Authorities (CA)\n   repositories hosted in its respective
    publication point.  This\n   document updates [RFC6490] by allowing multiple URI
    associated to a\n   single public key in a TAL file and introduces the concept
    of\n   multiple repository publication point operators for every CA in the\n   RPKI.
    \ This document provides also recommendation for the RP behavior\n   when analyzing
    signed objects that include multiple publications\n   points.\n\n\t "

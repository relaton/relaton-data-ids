- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   It has been broadly demonstrated that user experience improvements\n
    \  for time-critical applications have not increased at the same pace as\n   network
    throughput (i.e., the increased bandwidth does not result in\n   a corresponding
    increase in the user experience).  Optimizing network\n   latency rather than
    throughput can lead to a significantly improved\n   user experience for time-critical
    applications.  Low Latency, Low\n   Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) technology,
    introduced in RFC\n   9330, uses Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits by
    marking\n   packets suffering potential congestion in the network.  L4S operates\n
    \  as a congestion-control mechanism, using markers within the data\n   packets
    to detect and promptly respond to congestion conditions.\n   This feedback loop
    enables devices (e.g., endpoints such as client\n   devices and server devices)
    to adjust data flow in real-time,\n   preventing bottlenecks and ensuring smoother
    transmission.\n\n   RFC 5129 describes a mechanism for supporting ECN in the\n
    \  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) data plane.  That mechanism is\n   based
    on the codepoints that take part in the Traffic Class (TC)\n   field and, thus,
    prevent the use of TC field for traffic\n   differentiation.  This document defines
    how ECN can be supported in\n   the MPLS data plane using the MPLS Network Actions
    technology.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A proposal for use of DNS names to support universal account\n   identifiers
    'handles' is described.  Once registered, a handle may be\n   used for authentication
    to any network service, to initiate\n   communication with the holder or as the
    basis for IoT device\n   management.\n\n   This document is a whitepaper proposing
    the general approach.  A\n   strawman prototype supporting single account Web
    login across\n   multiple sites, onboarding of IoT devices and end to end secure\n
    \  messaging, file-drop, voice and video and has been built using\n   existing
    and proposed IETF work.\n\n\t "

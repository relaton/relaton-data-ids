abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes to allocate a block of globally unique IPv4   \naddresses
    for the exclusive use of Service Providers that provide   \n[L3VPN] based Services.
    The Service Provider may use these addresses   \nfor the provisioning of IP addresses
    to the links that connect   \nCustomer Edge (CE) routers with Provider Edge (PE)
    routers (PE-CE   \nlinks), and/or for the IP addressing of attached CE routers.
    \ \nThe main motivation for this proposal is to simplify the Service \nProviders'
    operations in the scenario where they monitor PE-CE links, \nand/or CE-routers,
    while at the same time conserving IPv4 address \nspace.  \nThis addressing scheme
    is not intended for use by VPNs that span    \nmore than one Service Provider,
    unless co-operation of addressing   \nstructure is maintained to ensure uniqueness
    of addresses between   \nproviders. Furthermore, although the main reference within
    this draft \nis related to services provided by [L3VPN], the recommendations \nformulated
    herein may also apply to other Layer-2 or Layer-3 VPN \narchitectures.\n\t "

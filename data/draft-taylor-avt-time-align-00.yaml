  content: "   This memo describes the use of RTCP-based feedback to reduce end-to-\n
    \  end delay through the use of time alignment between the source and\n   receiver.\n\n
    \  Time alignment is useful, for example, in certain gateway-to-gateway\n   scenarios
    and certain gateway-to-VoIP-terminal scenarios.  It is the\n   ability for a receiver
    to request that the sender shift the time\n   reference for packetization by a
    specified amount.  When a receiver\n   with strict packet timing limitations,
    e.g., due to a 3G UMTS Iu\n   interface, is connected to an sender at a peer endpoint
    capable of\n   responding to time alignment requests, e.g., with an AMR encoder\n
    \  associated with a PCM interface to the PSTN, this allows the\n   endpoints
    to reduce delay in the speech path by as much as the 20 ms\n   frame-block duration,
    depending on the degree of misalignment in the\n   time reference.\n\n\t "

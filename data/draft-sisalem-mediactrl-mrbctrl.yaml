  content: "   The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently working on an\n   architecture
    for controlling media services.  As part of the\n   MediaCtrl architecture the
    Media Resource Broker (MRB) was identified   as the component needed for intelligent,
    application level media\n   service selection based on non-static signaling properties.
    \ This\n   document defines the mechanisms needed by the media servers to\n   publish
    their capabilities and the mechanisms needed by the MRB to\n   monitor the status
    of the media servers.\n\t "

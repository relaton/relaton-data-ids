  content: "   Recently, a number of routing loop vulnerabilities were discovered
    in\n   the Teredo mechanism, which typically result in a Denial of Service\n   of
    the involved systems, possibly also affecting the intervening\n   networks.  This
    document describes a number of security checks that\n   can be performed by Teredo
    hosts and Teredo servers such that these\n   vulnerabilities are eliminated.\n\n\t "

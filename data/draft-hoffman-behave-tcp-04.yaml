  content: "This document defines a set of requirements for NATs that handle TCP\nthat
    would allow many applications, such as peer-to-peer applications\nand on-line
    games, to work consistently.  Developing NATs that meet\nthis set of requirements
    will greatly increase the likelihood that\nthese applications will function properly.\n\t "

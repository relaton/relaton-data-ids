  content: "The Dynamic DNS Update Protocol assumes that the devices/applications\nperforming
    dynamic registration of the DNS records will delete the\nrecords from the DNS
    database when the records become invalid. Initial\ndeployment of the devices supporting
    the Dynamic DNS Update protocol \nindicated that there are multiple legitimate
    scenarios when records \ndynamically registered in DNS are not removed from the
    database by the \ndevices that originally registered them. This can result in
    a \nsubstantial number of stale records. This document describes a \nmechanism
    to clean up these stale records.\n\t "

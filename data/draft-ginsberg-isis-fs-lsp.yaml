  content: "   Intermediate System To Intermediate System (IS-IS) provides efficient\n
    \  and reliable flooding of information to its peers.  However the\n   current
    flooding scopes are limited to either area wide scope or\n   domain wide scope.
    \ There are existing use cases where support of\n   other flooding scopes are
    desirable.  This document defines new\n   Protocol Data Units (PDUs) which provide
    support for new flooding\n   scopes as well as additional space for advertising
    information\n   targeted for the currently supported flooding scopes.\n\n   The
    protocol extensions defined in this document are not backwards\n   compatible
    with existing implementations and so must be deployed with\n   care.\n\n\n\t "

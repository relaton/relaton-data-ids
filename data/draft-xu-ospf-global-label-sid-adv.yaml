  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) is a new MPLS paradigm in which each SR-capable\n
    \  router is required to advertise global MPLS labels or Segment IDs\n   (SID)
    for its attached prefixes by using link-state IGPs, e.g., OSPF.\n   One major
    challenge associated with such global MPLS label or SID\n   advertisement mechanism
    is how to avoid a given global MPLS label or\n   SID from being allocated by different
    routers to different prefixes.\n   Although such global label or SID allocation
    collision problem can be\n   addressed through manual allocation , it is error-prone
    and\n   nonautomatic therefore may not be suitable in large-scale SR network\n
    \  environments.  This document proposes an alternative approach for\n   allocating
    and advertising global MPLS labels or SIDs via OSPF so as\n   to eliminate the
    potential risk of label allocation collision.\n\n\t "

  content: "This paper presents an overview of the mechanisms, operational practices,
    and transition plans that will be used for transitioning the Internet from IPv4
    to IPv6.  These techniques are collectively termed the Simple Internet Transition
    (SIT).                                                While specifically designed
    to transition the IPv4 Internet to IPv6, the methods described here could be adapted
    to transition other internet layer protocols such as IPX or CLNP to IPv6.\n\t "

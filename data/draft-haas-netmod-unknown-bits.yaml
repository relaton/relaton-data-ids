- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Protocols frequently have fields where the contents are a series of\n
    \  bits that have specific meaning.  When modeling operational state for\n   such
    protocols in YANG, the 'bits' YANG built-in type is a natural\n   method for modeling
    such fields.  The YANG 'bits' built-in type is\n   best suited when the meaning
    of a bit assignment is clear.\n\n   When bits that are currently RESERVED or otherwise
    unassigned by the\n   protocol are received, being able to model them is necessary
    in YANG\n   operational models.  This cannot be done using the YANG 'bits' built-\n
    \  in type without assigning them a name.  However, YANG versioning\n   rules
    do not permit renaming of named bits.\n\n   This draft proposes a methodology
    to represent unknown bits in YANG\n   operational models and creates a YANG typedef
    to assist in uniformly\n   naming such unknown bits.\n\n\t "

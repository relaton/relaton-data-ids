  content: "   There are currently significant efforts ongoing in IETF regarding\n
    \  more advanced multi-media functionalities, such as the work related\n   to
    RTCWEB and CLUE.  This work includes use cases for both multi-\n   party communication
    and multiple media streams from an individual\n   end-point.  The usage of scalable
    encoding or simulcast encoding as\n   well as different types of transport mechanisms
    have created\n   additional needs to correctly identify different types of resources\n
    \  and describe their relations to achieve intended functionalities.\n\n   The
    different usages have both commonalities and differences in needs\n   and behavior.
    \ This document attempts to review some usages and\n   identify commonalities
    and needs.  It then continues to highlight\n   important aspects that need to
    be considered in the definition of\n   these usages.\n\n\t "

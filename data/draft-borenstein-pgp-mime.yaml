    the representation of a wide variety of data types in Internet mail.  This document
    defines one particular type of MIME data, the application/pgp type, for 'pretty
    good' privacy, authentication, and encryption in Internet mail.  The application/pgp
    MIME type is intended to facilitate the wider interoperation of private mail across
    a wide variety of hardware and software platforms.\n\t "

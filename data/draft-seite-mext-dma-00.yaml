  content: "   Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP\n   principles
    where a given mobility anchor maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs)\n   binding up-to-date.
    \ Data traffic is then encapsulated between the\n   mobility anchor and the MN
    or its Access Router.  These approaches\n   are usually implemented on a centralised
    architectures where both MN\n   context and traffic encapsulation need to be processed
    at a central\n   network entity, i.e. the mobility anchor.  However, one of the
    trend\n   in mobile network evolution is to \"flatten\" mobility architecture
    by\n   confining mobility support in the access network, e.g. at the access\n
    \  routers level, keeping the rest of the network unaware of the\n   mobility
    events and their support.  This document discusses the\n   deployment of a Proxy
    Mobile IP approach in such a flat architecture.\n   The solution allows to dynamically
    distribute mobility functions\n   among access routers.  The goal is also to dynamically
    adapt the\n   mobility support of the MN's needs by applying traffic redirection\n
    \  only to MNs' flows when an IP handover occurs.\n\n\t "

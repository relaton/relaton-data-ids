  content: "This document describes and defines the managed objects for dynamic \nconfiguration
    of middleboxes. The scope of the middleboxes to which \nthese managed objects
    apply is limited to NATs and Firewalls.  \nHowever, the MIB module as defined
    by this document is intended to \nprovide a baseline for the dynamic configuration
    of other types of \nmiddleboxes. The applicability of existing Management Information
    \nBase (MIB) modules to the MIDCOM requirements, framework and \nsemantics is
    described. Additional managed objects are defined to \nsatisfy the entirety of
    the MIDCOM requirements, framework and \nsemantics, providing a complete MIDCOM
    MIB for NATs and Firewalls to \nfully realize the requirements of the MIDCOM protocol.\n\t "

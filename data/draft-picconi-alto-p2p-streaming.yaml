  content: "The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service aims at\nproviding
    applications with information about the network to optimize\ntheir traffic. Peer-to-peer
    (P2P) live streaming is one of such\n applications which can benefit from ALTO.
    We have recently designed a\nnew scheme to minimize inter-domain traffic in P2P
    live streaming\napplications without impacting video quality. In this draft we\nbriefly
    describe our solution, and we discuss the implications of the\ntype of information
    provided by the ALTO service on overlay\nconstruction.\n\t "

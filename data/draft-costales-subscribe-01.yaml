  content: "The number of ways to subscribe-to (and to unsubscribe-from) e-mail mailing
    lists is as varied as the number of programmers designing mailing list software.
    For some lists, for example, users (un)subscribe by sending a request to <listname>-request@host.domain.
    \ For others lists the address is majordomo@host.domain with the request to (un)subscribe
    embedded in the message body. Yet others set up special hosts to satisfy this
    need, such as <listname>@list-off.domain.  In this Internet Draft we offer two
    new e-mail headers intended to make mailing list subscription and unsubscription
    easier and more uniform: List-Subscribe and List-Unsubscribe.\n\t "

  content: "   The rapid increase in the amount and type of traffic makes it\n   significantly
    more challenging for operational and management\n   applications to maintain the
    network and deploy new services. This\n   is the root cause of one of the major
    challenges that network\n   operators (service providers, SME, etc) are facing
    today. The\n   operators are obliged to create a simplified view of their network\n
    \  infrastructure that can help network engineers to use such a\n   simplified
    model rather than manipulating individual devices. In this\n   context, providing
    network operators with a set of standard generic\n   YANG-based data models that
    enable management and automation of\n   services on their network is essential.\n
    \  This document describes what has to be addressed in order to equip\n   service
    providers with the means to quickly and dynamically\n   create/query/scale/update/delete
    the services they want to offer.\n   This may include a variety of different service
    enabling scenarios\n   and in particular VPN management from an individual to
    a data center,\n   within a data center or among a set of physical or virtualized
    data\n   centers that belong to an organization or different organizations.\n\n\n\t "

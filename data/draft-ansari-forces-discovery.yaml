- language: en

  content: "This document describes a protocol for dynamically determining CE/FE \n
    \  element  bindings  discovery  and  inter-FE  topology  discovery  and \n   maintenance.
    Such a mechanism is needed for all these elements in \n   the set to behave as
    a single network element, as required by the \n   ForCES architecture. The discovery
    protocol operates during both the \n   pre-association and post-association phases
    of ForCES protocol.\n\t "

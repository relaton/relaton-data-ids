  content: "GMPLS-TE Graceful shutdown is a method for explicitly notifying the \n
    \  nodes in a Traffic Engineering (TE) enabled network that the TE \n   capability
    on a link or on an entire Label Switching Router (LSR) is \n   going to be disabled.
    GMPLS-TE graceful shutdown mechanisms are \n   tailored towards addressing the
    planned outage in the network.  \n    \n   This document provides requirements
    and protocol mechanisms so as to \n   reduce/eliminate traffic disruption in the
    event of a planned \n   shutdown of a network resource. These operations are equally
    \n   applicable for both MPLS and its GMPLS extensions.\n\t "

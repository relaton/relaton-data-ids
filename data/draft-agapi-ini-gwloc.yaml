  content: "   The development of IP to PSTN gateways has made it possible for users\n
    \  of the two disparate networks to place 'telephone' calls between the\n   two
    networks with little effort.  Users placing calls from an IP\n   network to the
    PSTN network must choose a gateway to act as a bridge\n   between the two networks.
    \ Selection of a gateway can be based on any\n   number of criteria, such as price,
    codecs, version, billing, etc.  In\n   this draft we propose a gateway location
    service for this purpose.\n   The gateway location service protocol is an instantiation
    of the\n   Service Location Protocol that has been modified to run in a wide\n
    \  area network across many administrative domains.\n\n\t "

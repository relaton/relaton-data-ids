  content: "This document specifies the process by which the IETF appoints its 2\nrepresentatives
    to ICANN's Protocol Support Organization's Protocol\nCouncil (PSO-PC).  Additionally,
    mechanisms that the IETF will adopt\nfor identifying candidates for the PSO's
    appointments to the ICANN\nBoard of Directors are specified.  This process specification\nreflects
    2 years of IETF experience with ICANN, the PSO-PC and the\nPSO organization, since
    their inception in 1999.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines methods which enable simpler deployment of TLS-\n
    \  based EAP methods.  It defines new certificate fields, and uses\n   existing
    certificate fields in order describe new methods for\n   bootstrapping security.
    \ The methods defined here change TLS-based\n   EAP supplicant configuration from
    a complex and insecure process to\n   one that is automated, and is essentially
    trivial.  These methods are\n   still, however, compatible with existing standards
    and practices.\n\n\t "

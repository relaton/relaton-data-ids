  content: "   This document specifies the control plane procedures to support\n   Traffic
    Engineering (TE) across TRILL sites where such sites are\n   interconnected using
    [1] with the help of a Layer 3 core running\n   IP+GRE or IP+MPLS.  Traffic Engineering
    permits usage of a set of\n   links that possess a certain characteristic like
    specified bandwidth,\n   cost or even MTU. This draft aims at addressing how unicast
    frames\n   travelling from one TRILL site to another across a Layer 3 core that\n
    \  supports IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS can make use of the TE calculated\n   paths
    in the sending site as well as the receiving site where such TE\n   paths are
    pre-computed in both sites and need a mechanism to inter-\n   link them together.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

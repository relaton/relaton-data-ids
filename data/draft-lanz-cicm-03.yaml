  content: "   This memo presents a programming interface to standardize the way\n
    \  software programs manage cryptographic modules and use cryptographic\n   services
    offered by modules.  Although a number of interfaces for\n   commercial environments
    have been standardized and are in use, this\n   is the first generic cryptographic
    interface to be developed that\n   supports cryptographic modules separating two
    security domains and is\n   thus ideal for the high assurance environment.  The
    interface has\n   been designed to also allow less demanding environments to take\n
    \  advantage of its features.\n\n\t "

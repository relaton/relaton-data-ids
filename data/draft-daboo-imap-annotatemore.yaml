  content: "The METADATA extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol permits
    clients and servers to maintain \"annotations\" or \"metadata\" on IMAP servers.
    \ It is possible to have annotations on a per-mailbox basis or on the server as
    a whole.  For example, this would allow comments about the purpose of a particular
    mailbox to be \"attached\" to that mailbox, or a \"message of the day\" containing
    server status information to be made available to anyone logging in to the server.

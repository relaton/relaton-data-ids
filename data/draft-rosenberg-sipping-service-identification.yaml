  content: "This document considers the problem of service identification in the\nSession
    Initiation Protocol (SIP).  Service identification is the\nprocess of determining
    the user-level use case that is driving the\nsignaling being utilized by the user
    agent.  While seemingly simple,\nthis process is quite complex, and when not addressed
    properly, can\nlead to fraud, interoperability problems, and stifling of innovation.\nThis
    document discusses these problems and makes recommendations on\nhow to address
    them.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a simple DNS cache optimization which keeps\n
    \  the most popular Resource Records set (RRset) in the DNS cache:\n   Highly
    Automated Method for Maintaining Expiring Records (HAMMER).\n\n   The principle
    is that popular RRset in the cache are fetched, that is\n   to say resolved before
    their TTL expires and flushed.  By fetching\n   RRset before they are being queried
    by an end user, that is to say\n   prefetched, HAMMER is expected to improve the
    quality of experience\n   of the end users as well as to optimize the resources
    involved in\n   large DNSSEC resolving platforms.\n\t "

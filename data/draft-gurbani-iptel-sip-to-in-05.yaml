abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In Internet telephony, the call control functions of a traditional\ncircuit
    switch are replaced by a IP-based call controller that must\nprovide features
    normally provided by the traditional switch,\nincluding operating as a SSP for
    IN features.  A traditional switch\nis armed with an IN call model that provides
    it a means to reach out\nand make service decisions based on intelligence stored
    elsewhere.\nInternet call controllers, by contrast, do not have an IN call model.\n\t "

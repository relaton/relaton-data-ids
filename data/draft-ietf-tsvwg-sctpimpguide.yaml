  content: "This document is a compilation of issues found during six interoperability
    events and 5 years of experience with implementing, testing, and using SCTP along
    with the suggested fixes.  This document provides deltas to RFC 2960 and is organized
    in a time-based way.  The issues are listed in the order they were brought up.
    \ Because some text is changed several times, the last delta in the text is the
    one that should be applied.  In addition to the delta, a description of the problem
    and the details of the solution are also provided.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) RFC6480 [RFC6481] relies
    on Publication Points (PPs) to distribute cryptographically verifiable objects.
    Under the current design, Relying Parties (RPs) retrieve the complete set of RPKI
    objects from repositories, even when their operational requirements are limited
    to a specific subset, for example, ROAs only. This all-or-nothing retrieval model
    may result in increased bandwidth consumption, higher synchronization latency,
    and unnecessary computational overhead. This document examines these challenges
    and discusses directions for enabling more selective and efficient access to RPKI
    data.</p>"

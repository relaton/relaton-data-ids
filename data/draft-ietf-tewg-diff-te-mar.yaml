- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document complements the Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering
    (DS-TE) requirements document by giving a functional specification for the Maximum
    Allocation with Reservation (MAR) Bandwidth Constraints Model.  Assumptions, applicability,
    and examples of the operation of the MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model are presented.
    \ MAR performance is analyzed relative to the criteria for selecting a Bandwidth
    Constraints Model, in order to provide guidance to user implementation of the
    model in their networks.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

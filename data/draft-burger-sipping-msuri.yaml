  content: "Application Servers, SIP Proxies, and SoftSwitches (a.k.a. Media \nGateway
    Controllers) act as SIP [2] User Agents to control the media \nprocessing capabilities
    of media servers.  The SIP Request URI \nidentifies the desired service and provides
    a context for the media \nserver to interpret the SIP message.  This document
    describes a \nstandard SIP addressing mechanism to address specific services.
    \ \nBecause of SIP's flexibility, the existing protocol accommodates \nthese services.
    \ This document proposes a standard URI scheme for \nimportant media services
    such as announcements and conferencing.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a lawful basis extension for Virtualized\n   Conversations
    (vCon) that provides standardized mechanisms for\n   recording, verifying, and
    managing the lawful basis for processing\n   data within conversation containers.
    \ The lawful basis extension\n   addresses privacy compliance challenges through
    structured attachment\n   metadata, including the specific lawful basis being
    asserted,\n   temporal validity periods where applicable, and cryptographic proof\n
    \  mechanisms.\n\n   The extension is designed as a Compatible vCon extension
    that\n   introduces lawful basis management capabilities without altering\n   existing
    vCon semantics.  It defines a \"lawful_basis\" attachment type\n   with structured
    records for each of the six lawful bases defined in\n   regulations like GDPR,
    including consent, contract, legal obligation,\n   vital interests, public task,
    and legitimate interests.\n\n   Key features include automated lawful basis detection
    during\n   conversation processing, auditable records with cryptographic proofs,\n
    \  granular purpose-based permissions for all lawful bases, documented\n   justifications
    for other lawful bases, and integration with privacy\n   regulations including
    GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.\n\n\t "

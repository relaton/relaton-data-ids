abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a lawful basis extension for Virtualized Conversations
    (vCon) that provides standardized mechanisms for recording, verifying, and managing
    the lawful basis for processing data within conversation containers. The lawful
    basis extension addresses privacy compliance challenges through structured attachment
    metadata, including the specific lawful basis being asserted, temporal validity
    periods where applicable, and cryptographic proof mechanisms. The extension is
    designed as a Compatible vCon extension that introduces lawful basis management
    capabilities without altering existing vCon semantics. It defines a "lawful_basis"
    attachment type with structured records for each of the six lawful bases defined
    in regulations like GDPR, including consent, contract, legal obligation, vital
    interests, public task, and legitimate interests. Key features include automated
    lawful basis detection during conversation processing, auditable records with
    cryptographic proofs, granular purpose-based permissions for all lawful bases,
    documented justifications for other lawful bases, and integration with privacy
    regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.</p>

  content: "   The objective of this proposal is to introduce the notion of network\n
    \  identifier (NI) in the ICN architecture.  This is in addition to the\n   existing
    names (i.e., content identifiers, CIs, or application\n   identifiers, AIs, in
    general) that are currently used for both naming\n   and routing/forwarding purposes.
    \ Network identifiers are needed\n   considering the requirements on future networking
    architectures such\n   as: (i) to support persistent names (or persistently named
    objects)\n   and large-scale and high-speed mobility of any network entity (i.e,\n
    \  devices, services, and content), (ii) to accommodate different types\n   of
    Internet of Things (IoT) services, many of which require low-\n   latency performance,
    and enabling edge computing to support service\n   virtualization, which will
    require support for large scale migration\n   and replication of named resources,
    and (iii) to scale the ICN\n   architecture to future Internet scale considering
    the exponentially\n   increasing named entities.  If information on AI-to-NI mappings
    are\n   not directly accessible to the consumers, for instance, using\n   specific
    datasets like manifests, these considerations may require\n   enabling a name
    resolution service, which can be network based or\n   application driven, to support
    efficient and scalable routing.\n   Current document do not impose any restrictions
    on the name\n   resolution architecture, regarding its scope.\n\n   In the current
    draft, we begin by highlighting the issues associated\n   with ICN networking
    when utilizing only the AIs, which include\n   persistently named content, services,
    and devices.  Next we discuss\n   the function NI serves, and provide a discussion
    on the two current\n   NI-based proposals, along with their scope and functionalities.
    \ This\n   is with the objective of having a single NI construct for ICN that
    is\n   flexible enough to adapt to different networking contexts.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: <p>"Secure hybrid network monitoring - Problem statement" identifies challenges
    in securing and monitoring networks deployed across hybrid and mixed cloud environments.
    This document introduces the Path Characteristics Service (PCS), a framework that
    enables applications and operators to obtain and evaluate verifiable information
    about the characteristics of the network paths they use. It outlines a non- normative
    architecture and interfaces for PCS and explains how PCS can help address the
    identified challenges; it does not define protocol requirements.</p>

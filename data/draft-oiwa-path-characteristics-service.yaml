  content: "   \"Secure hybrid network monitoring - Problem statement\" identifies\n
    \  challenges in securing and monitoring networks deployed across hybrid\n   and
    mixed cloud environments.  This document introduces the Path\n   Characteristics
    Service (PCS), a framework that enables applications\n   and operators to obtain
    and evaluate verifiable information about the\n   characteristics of the network
    paths they use.  It outlines a non-\n   normative architecture and interfaces
    for PCS and explains how PCS\n   can help address the identified challenges; it
    does not define\n   protocol requirements.\n\n\t "

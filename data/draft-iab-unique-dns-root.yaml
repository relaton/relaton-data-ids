  content: "This document discusses the existence of a globally unique public name
    space in the Internet called the DNS (Domain Name System).  This name space is
    a hierarchical name space derived from a single, globally unique root.  It is
    a technical constraint inherent in the design of the DNS.  One root must be supported
    by a set of coordinated root servers administered by a unique naming authority.
    \ It is not technically feasible for there to be more than one root in the public
    DNS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS in short) is an MPLS data plane-based\n
    \  source routing paradigm in which the sender of a packet is allowed to\n   partially
    or completely specify the route the packet takes through\n   the network by imposing
    stacked MPLS labels on the packet.  SR-MPLS\n   could be leveraged to realize
    a source routing mechanism across MPLS,\n   IPv4, and IPv6 data planes by using
    an MPLS label stack as a source\n   routing instruction set while preserving backward
    compatibility with\n   SR-MPLS.\n\n   This document describes how SR-MPLS capable
    routers and IP-only\n   routers can seamlessly co-exist and interoperate through
    the use of\n   SR-MPLS label stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in-\n
    \  UDP as defined in RFC 7510.\n\n\t "

    \ draft-ali-ccamp-gmpls-lsp-ping-traceroute-01.txt Nov.07 \n \n\n[RFC4379] describes
    procedures for ping and tracerouting for LSPs \nwith PSC (packet switch capable)
    transit switching capability. An \nimportant implication of using transparent
    (non-PSC) nodes in GMPLS \nnetwork is that LSP Ping solution described in [RFC4379]
    are not \napplicable to LSP with non-PSC switching capability. Another \nimportant
    difference between PSC and non-PSC switching technologies \nis the data and control
    plan separation in the latter case. An \nimplication of the separation of data
    and control planes in GMPLS \nnetworks is that LSP traceroute procedures described
    in [RFC4379] are \nnot directly applicable to GMPLS networks with separation of
    data and \ncontrol planes.  \n\nThe scope of this draft is cases where data plane
    does not provide \nthe OAM functions addressed by this draft. This document is
    assumed \nthat OAM mechanisms provided by the underlying data plan technology
    \nMUST be used, whenever possible. E.g., G.709 addresses the problem of \ntrace
    routing in DWDM network. However, G.709 OAM mechanisms are only \napplicable to
    OEO (Optical-Electrical-Optical) capable node. This \ndocument fills in such gaps;
    in particular it addresses GMPLS OAM \nfunctionality in optical networks with
    wavelength routers, ROADMs \nnodes, etc. with no OEO conversion capability. For
    this purpose, the \ndraft relies on control plan mechanism to provide required
    OAM \nfunctions. Specifically the proposed solutions are based on Link \nManagement
    Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] and RSVP-TE [RFC3209], [RFC3473] \nand do not require
    any extension to the data plan.  \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nIn
    examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and \nserver respectively.
    \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",
    \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this
    \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.\n\t "

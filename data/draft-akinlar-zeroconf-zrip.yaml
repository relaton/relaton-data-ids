  content: "Zero-Configuration(Zeroconf) Networking is becoming highly popular\nwith
    the proliferation of cheap network attached devices and computers.\nZeroconf networks
    are a particular class of TCP/IP networks that may be\nestablished in the home,
    in small offices or for ad-hoc purposes.\nZeroconf networks do not have and should
    not be expected to have user\nconfigurable network infrastructure such as DHCP,
    DNS and other\nadministered services [4].\n\n\t "

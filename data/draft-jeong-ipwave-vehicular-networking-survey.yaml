  content: "   This document surveys the IP-based vehicular networks, which are\n
    \  considered a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems\n   (ITS).
    \ The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-\n   vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and infrastructure-\n   to-vehicle (I2V) networking.  This document deals
    with some critical\n   aspects in vehicular networking, such as IP address\n   autoconfiguration,
    vehicular network architecture, routing, mobility\n   management, and security.
    \ This document also surveys standard\n   activities for vehicular networks.  Finally,
    this document summarizes\n   and analyzes the previous research activities that
    use IPv4 or IPv6\n   for vehicular networking.\n\n\t "

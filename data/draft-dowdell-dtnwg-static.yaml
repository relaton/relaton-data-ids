  content: "   Static Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks cannot make full use of\n
    \  standard IPv4 or IPv6 static routing as defined in section 7.4 of\n   [RFC1812],
    due to the DTN feature of Late Binding where the IP\n   address or addresses associated
    with an Endpoint Identifier may not\n   be known when a packet is originated.
    \ This draft presents a\n   specification for static routing in the DTN environment.\n\n\t "

  content: "Applications routinely open multiple TCP connections.  For example,\nP2P
    applications maintain connections to a number of different peers\nand web browsers
    perform concurrent download from the same web\nserver.  Application designers
    pursue different goals when doing so:\nP2P apps need to maintain a well-connected
    mesh in the swarm while\nweb browsers mainly use multiple connections to parallelize
    requests\nthat involve application latency on the web server side.  However\nthis
    practice also has impacts to the host and the network as a\nwhole. For example,
    an application can obtain a larger fraction of\nthe bottleneck than if it had
    used fewer connections. Although\ncapacity is the most commonly considered bottleneck
    resource,\nmiddlebox state table entries are also an important resource for an\nend
    system communication.\n\nThis document clarifies the current practices of application
    design\ninvolving concurrent TCP connections and reasons behind them, and\ndiscusses
    the tradeoffs surrounding their use, whether to one\ndestination or to different
    destinations. Other resource types may\nexist, and the guidelines are expected
    to comprehensively discuss\nthem.\n\nConventions used in this document\n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are
    to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.\n\t "

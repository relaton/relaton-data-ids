  content: "This paper defines the requirements for a DNS-based architecture and\nprotocols
    for mapping a telephone number to a set of attributes\n(e.g., URLs) which can
    be used to contact a resource associated with\nthat number. There are many possible
    protocols that can be\nconsidered for a telephone number mapping service.  The
    purpose of\nthis document is to focus discussion on a DNS-based solution.  The\nintention
    is to enumerate the expectations of such a solution and to\nclarify the scope.\n\t "

  content: "   This specification designs an architecture that aims at load \n   balancing
    flows along multiple routes according to a measure of their \n   average traffic
    loads.   \n   This architecture supports such a service due to the operation in
    a \n   closed loop of an enhanced routing control plane with an enhanced \n   forwarding
    plane. \n   Basically, this routing paradigm allows a second dynamic metric \n
    \  called load to be taken into account when calculating new routes and \n   when
    forwarding the flows along the routes.  \n\t "

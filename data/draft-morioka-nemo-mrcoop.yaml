  content: "   This protocol intended to provide cooperation between mobile routers\n
    \  in a mobile network.  A mobile network is usually connected to the\n   Internet
    through mobile routers with wireless interfaces.  Link\n   quality of the wireless
    interface changes frequently and rapidly.  In\n   case of several mobile routers
    in a mobile network, MNN should use\n   the MR that has the best link quality.
    \ This protocol makes all MRs\n   in a mobile network share link quality of MRs
    each other. Propagation\n   of routing information in a mobile network is not
    out of sight of\n   this draft.\n\t "

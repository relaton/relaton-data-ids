  content: "   This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic\n   Control
    Plane.  To do this a Secure Key Infrastructure is\n   bootstrapped.  This is done
    using manufacturer-installed X.509\n   certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's
    authorizing\n   service, both online and offline.  We call this process the\n
    \  Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.\n   Bootstrapping
    a new device can occur using a routable address and a\n   cloud service, or using
    only link-local connectivity, or on limited/\n   disconnected networks.  Support
    for deployment models with less\n   stringent security requirements is included.
    \ Bootstrapping is\n   complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key\n
    \  infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The\n   established
    secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued\n   certificate to the
    device as well.\n\n\t "

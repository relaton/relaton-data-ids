  content: "   This memo describes a process for early allocation of code points by\n
    \  IANA from registries for which \"Specification Required\", \"RFC\n   Required\",
    \"IETF Review\", or \"Standards Action\" policies apply.  This\n   process can
    be used to alleviate the problem where code point\n   allocation is needed to
    facilitate desired or required implementation\n   and deployment experience prior
    to publication of an RFC that would\n   normally trigger code point allocation.\n\n
    \  This document obsoletes RFC 4020.\n\n\t "

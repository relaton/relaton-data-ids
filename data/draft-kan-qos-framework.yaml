  content: "This document proposes a 'two-plane three-tier' framework structure \nfor
    NSIS signaling. In this framework the Access Networks are \nconnected with wired
    backbone through default routers. It is \nassumed that one can do a competent
    job of network configuration & \nprovisioning in the backbone network, and just
    keeps backbone \nnetworks stupid simple.Resource policies which are implemented
    in \ninter-NSIS Domains and intra-NSIS Domain, NSIS Signaling and NSIS \nnegotiations
    are in the control plane. User data is transported in \nthe transport plane. COPS/Diameter
    is used for exchanging resource \npolicies.  \nThree-Tier NSIS signalings mean
    that NSIS signaling should be done \nin three levels. The first level is Inter-NSIS
    Domain NSIS \nsignaling across neighboring NSIS Domains, and the second level
    is \nIntra-NSIS Domain NSIS signaling inside each NSIS Domain while the \nthird
    level is end-to-edge NSIS signaling and end-to-end NSIS \nsignaling. The aggregate
    traffic crossing NSIS Domain borders is \nserved according to relatively stable,
    long-lived bilateral \nagreements. End-to-end QoS support is achieved through
    the \nconcatenation of such bilateral agreements.   \n\n\t "

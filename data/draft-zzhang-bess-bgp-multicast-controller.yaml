  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a way that one or more centralized\n   controllers
    can use BGP to set up a multicast distribution tree in a\n   network.  In the
    case of labeled tree, the labels are assigned by the\n   controllers either from
    the controllers' local label spaces, or from\n   a common Segment Routing Global
    Block (SRGB), or from each routers\n   Segment Routing Local Block (SRLB) that
    the controllers learn.  In\n   case of labeled unidirectional tree and label allocation
    from the\n   common SRGB or from the controllers' local spaces, a single common\n
    \  label can be used for all routers on the tree to send and receive\n   traffic
    with.  Since the controllers calculate the trees, they can\n   use sophisticated
    algorithms and constraints to achieve traffic\n   engineering.\n\n\n\t "

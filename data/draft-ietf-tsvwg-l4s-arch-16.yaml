  content: "   This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet\n
    \  applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable\n   throughput
    (L4S).  The insight on which L4S is based is that the root\n   cause of queuing
    delay is in the congestion controllers of senders,\n   not in the queue itself.
    \ With the L4S architecture all Internet\n   applications could (but do not have
    to) transition away from\n   congestion control algorithms that cause substantial
    queuing delay,\n   to a new class of congestion controls that induce very little\n
    \  queuing, aided by explicit congestion signalling from the network.\n   This
    new class of congestion controls can provide low latency for\n   capacity-seeking
    flows, so applications can achieve both high\n   bandwidth and low latency.\n\n
    \  The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment.  It\n   defines
    mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion\n   controls to coexist
    with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared\n   network.  These mechanisms
    aim to ensure that the latency and\n   throughput performance using an L4S-compliant
    congestion controller\n   is usually much better (and rarely worse) than performance
    would have\n   been using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing\n
    \  flows continuing to use 'Classic' controllers are typically not\n   impacted
    by the presence of L4S.  These characteristics are important\n   to encourage
    adoption of L4S congestion control algorithms and L4S\n   compliant network elements.\n\n
    \  The L4S architecture consists of three components: network support to\n   isolate
    L4S traffic from classic traffic; protocol features that\n   allow network elements
    to identify L4S traffic; and host support for\n   L4S congestion controls.\n\n\t "

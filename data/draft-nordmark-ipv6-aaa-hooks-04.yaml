  content: "This document specifies extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery that\nallow
    routers to ask hosts to periodically register.  Two types of\nregistrations are
    defined: to register with an AAA server using an\nAAA protocol, and to register
    with the routers using unsolicited\nNeighbor Advertisement messages to allow hosts
    to move between some\nlinks while keeping the same IPv6 address.  In the latter
    case the\nrouters would use the registrations to inject host routes in a 'local\narea'.\nThe
    purpose of this document is to stimulate discussion on how to\nmake IPv6 a good
    choice for wireless networks that have requirements\non 'local' mobility and/or
    AAA functionality.\n\n\t "

  content: "A protocol design flaw in the TLS renegotiation handshake leaves all\ncurrently
    implemented protocol version of TLS (SSLv3 to TLSv1.2)\nvulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks where the attacker can\nestablish a TLS session with a server,
    send crafted application data\nof his choice to the server and then proxy an unsuspecting
    client's\nTLS handshake into the TLS renegotiation handshake of the server. \nMany
    applications on top of TLS see the data injected by the attacker\nand the data
    sent by the client as a single data stream and assume\nthat an authentication
    during the TLS renegotiation handshake or\ncontained in the client's application
    data applies to the entire data\nstream received through the TLS-protected communication
    channel.\n\nThis document describes a protocol change for all protocol versions\nof
    TLS and SSLv3 that will fix this vulnerability for all\ncommunication between
    updated TLS clients and updated TLS servers.\n\t "

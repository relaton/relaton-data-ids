  content: "In this document we consider and analyse the specific scenario of\n   IPv6
    transition and deployment in a large department of a university\n   campus network.
    \ The department is large enough to operate its own\n   instances of all the conventional
    university services including (for\n   example) web, DNS, email, filestore, interactive
    logins, and remote\n   and wireless access.  The scenario is a dual-stack one,
    i.e.\n   transition to IPv6 means deploying IPv6 in the first instance\n   alongside
    IPv4.  This analysis identifies the available (and still\n   missing) components
    for IPv6 transition, while validating the\n   applicability of the IPv6 Enterprise
    Network Scenarios informational\n   text.\n\t "

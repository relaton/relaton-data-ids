  content: "   In this document I am providing the outlines for a modified version\n
    \  of the Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS); the modified version\n   will
    come as a new protocol that will build a secured tunnel between\n   the client
    and the server without the need to involve Certificate\n   Authorities or any
    other third party in this process; it is called\n   User Defined Key Pair protocol(UDKP),
    and is based on the assumption\n   that in most cases there is a registered profile
    for the user on the\n   server; a profile that includes among a lot of things
    the username\n   and the password that the user uses to authenticate to the server,\n
    \  the proposed protocol will make use of the username and the password\n   to
    create a key pair for the user on the fly at the client side, and\n   it will
    use this key pair as the starting point for creating the\n   secured tunnel instead
    of taking the server certificate as the\n   starting point. Additionally the proposed
    protocol has self-\n   protection against phishing attacks.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Chinese can be written in 2 different scripts, traditional Chinese and\nsimplified
    Chinese, that cannot be distinguished by many people of\ncertain background/cultures/groups
    who use them interchangeably.  As a\nresult, users of Chinese Domain Names (CDN)
    have special needs that can\nonly be satisfied by adding a label to CDNs that
    distinguish a CDN with\ntraditional characters from a CDN with simplified characters.
    \ This\nlabeling is an entire system that can be accomplished with SLDs or by\ncreating
    a new type of TLD called Language Script TLD (lsTLD).  This\ndraft describes the
    benefits that the system will provide and the\ntechniques involved in implementing
    it.\n\n\n\t "

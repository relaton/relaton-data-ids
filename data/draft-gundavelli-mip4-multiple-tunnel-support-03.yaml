abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol for allowing
    a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of address for each
    of its network interfaces and to simultaneously establish multiple Mobile IP tunnels
    with its home agent. This essentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the
    available network interfaces and build an higher aggregated data pipe with the
    home agent for its home address traffic. Furthermore, these extensions also allow
    the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate flow policies for binding individual
    traffic flows with the registered care-of addresses.</p>"

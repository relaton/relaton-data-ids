  content: "It has been observed that the current IETF standard designations, STD\nnnnn
    and BCP nnnn designation, have not worked well.  Problems have\nbeen found when
    one of them is used either as a stable reference for\nexternal specifications
    or as a combined reference for multiple\ndocuments linked together into a single
    document.  This document\nproposes two changes to these designations.  The first
    of these\nchanges would create a new document series and assign a new number\nand
    acronym to a specification when it enters the first level of the\nStandards Track
    (or is first designated as a BCP).  The second would\nmigrate the concept of STDs
    and BCPs numbering of RFCs into actual\ndocuments that detail what they identify,
    their publication\ninformation and their change history.  The document also specifies
    a\nset of minor standards process changes to accommodate and integrate\nthe new
    style of doing things that is represented by the new document\nseries.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCP\nXR
    (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media\ntransmission or reception
    quality, as proposed in RFC5968.  This memo\nsuggests that a new block should
    contain a single metric or a small\nnumber of metrics relevant to a single parameter
    of interest or\nconcern, rather than containing a number of metrics which attempt
    to\nprovide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a\nspecific application.
    \ Applications may then \"mix and match\" to\ncreate a set of blocks which covers
    their set of concerns.  Where\npossible, a specific block should be designed to
    be re-usable across\nmore than one application, for example, for all of voice,
    streaming\naudio and video.\n\t "

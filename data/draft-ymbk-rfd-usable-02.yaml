abstract:
- content: "<p>Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in
    routers. Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for being well-connected
    because topological richness amplifies the number of update messages exchanged.
    Many operators have turned RFD off. Based on experimental measurement, this document
    recommends adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits, to reduce the
    high risks with RFD, with the result being damping a non-trivial amount of long
    term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes' normal convergence process.</p>"

  content: "   This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic\n
    \  location.  This format is designed for use with PIDF Location Object\n   (PIDF-LO)
    documents.  The format is based on the civic address\n   definition in PIDF-LO,
    but adds several new elements based on the\n   civic types defined for DHCP.  The
    format also includes support for\n   the xml:lang language tag and restricts the
    types of elements where\n   appropriate.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The MPLS architecture introduced Special Purpose Labels (SPLs) to\n
    \  indicate special forwarding actions and offered a few simple\n   examples,
    such as Router Alert.  In the two decades since the\n   original architecture
    was crafted, the range, complexity and sheer\n   number of such actions has grown;
    in addition, there now is need for\n   \"associated data\" for some of the forwarding
    actions.  Likewise, the\n   capabilities and scale of forwarding engines has also
    improved vastly\n   over the same time period.  There is a pressing need to match
    the\n   needs with the capabilities to deliver the next generation of MPLS\n   architecture.\n\n
    \  In this memo, we propose an alternate mechanism whereby a single SPL\n   can
    encode multiple forwarding actions and carry data (if any)\n   associated with
    the actions, some in the label stack and some after\n   the label stack.  This
    proposal also solves the problem of scarcity\n   of base SPLs.\n\n   As proof
    of its utility and flexibility, this approach can\n   immediately address several
    use cases:\n\n   *  to carry an Entropy Label for better load balancing;\n\n   *
    \ to carry a Flow-Aggregate Selector for IETF network slicing;\n\n   *  to signal
    that further fast reroute may have harmful consequences;\n\n   *  to indicate
    that there is relevant data after the label stack;\n\n   *  among others.\n\n\t "

  content: "Seamless offering of Quality of Service (QoS) to a Mobile Node during\nhandovers
    is considered crucial for enabling a variety of application\nservices in the Mobile
    Internet.  In this document, we define the QoS\ncontexts and show how they could
    be transferred to enable seamless QoS\noperation during handovers.  We introduce
    the notion of QoS Profile\nTypes and the associated QoS Profiles, which together
    constitute QoS\ncontexts, that facilitate QoS inter-operability among the pariticipating\naccess
    routers.  We also illustrate how these contexts can be used with\nfast handover
    signaling.\n\n\t "

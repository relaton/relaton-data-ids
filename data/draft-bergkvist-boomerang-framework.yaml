  content: "This draft describes a framework for providing quantitative IP \nservices
    with guaranteed QoS. The proposed reservation approach is \nbased on a new, lightweight
    signaling protocol and it suits both \nDiff-Serv, Int-Serv QoS architectures.
    \nThe main designing principle of the Boomerang protocol is to make \nreservation
    almost as simple as forwarding an ordinary packet. Thus: \n* Signaling messages
    are generated only by the initiating node, \ntherefore complexity and intelligence
    is concentrated in one point \nenabling simple implementation \n* Flow state aggregation
    can be suggested to subsequent nodes by \nappending the Boomerang message\n\t "

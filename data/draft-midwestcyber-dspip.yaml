abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Digital Signing of Physical Items Protocol
    (DSPIP), a cryptographic protocol for authenticating physical items using digitally
    signed QR codes. This specification focuses on the SHIP type for shipping and
    logistics applications, providing cryptographic authentication of packages with
    chain of custody tracking. The protocol introduces privacy-preserving delivery
    mechanisms including encrypted recipient information, last mile provider selection,
    physical anti-cloning protections through split-key labels, and scalable revocation
    and delivery confirmation systems. DSPIP uses DNS-based public key distribution
    similar to DKIM and supports optional blockchain integration for immutable record
    keeping. While this specification focuses on shipping applications, the protocol
    includes a type field to enable future expansion to other use cases.</p>"

  content: "For some time now several equipment manufactures have been \nimplementing
    what is called L2TP tunnel switching or L2TP multihop.\nAlthough this technology
    has several applications and is quite \nwidespread, there has been no effort to
    standardize the nomenclature \nand methods associated with it. \nThe goal of this
    document is to achieve a common denominator in what\nis tunnel switching, its
    advantages and nomenclature associated with\nit .\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The session initiation protocol (SIP) [2] allows users' end systems\n
    \  to decline calls for many reasons. 6xx response codes communicate\n   global
    failures generated by callee's end system.  It defines 6xx\n   class response
    codes in the spirit of parallel forking scenarios\n   only.  There're scenarios
    where, authoritative server performs\n   parallel forking of the call to callee's
    own set of endpoints, and\n   then serially move on to fork call to alternate
    set of endpoints\n   (callee's voice mail and/or team call).  This draft clarifies\n
    \  behavior for existing 603 response code and proposes new 605 response\n   code
    to handle complete rejection of the call, which halts any\n   further processing
    of the call.\n\n\t "

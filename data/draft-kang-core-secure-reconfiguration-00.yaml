  content: "   This document presents a secure method to configure a key for a node\n
    \  when it initially joins to network that is currently in operation.\n   The
    method is suited for a scenario, where resource constrained\n   objects are interconnected
    with each other and thus form a network\n   called Internet of Things. It is assumed
    that communications for all\n   nodes are based on TCP/IP protocols and some of
    the nodes use the\n   constrained application protocol (CoAP). The method does
    not cover\n   all operations of secure bootstrapping, but it is intended to\n
    \  securely support self-reconfiguration of the pre-installed temporary\n   key
    of new node.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines service controls that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP]\noperations
    to provide a simple mechanism by which an LDAP client can\nselect master or replica
    directory information, control\nchaining and specify other service requirements
    when connected to an\nX.500 directory service. These service control mechanisms
    are not\nrequired when LDAP clients are connected to a single(non X.500) LDAP\nserver
    because, for example, chaining [X.518]is not supported by these\nservers.\n\nChaining
    protocols (DSP in X.500) also permit the extraction of\nmaster or replica data
    from within the X.500 directory system and\nprovide this to the client (via LDAP)
    without the need for client based\nLDAP referrals to different servers.\n \nIn
    addition, the controls proposed provide major step in the 'control'\nalignment
    of LDAP and DAP and their use of X.500. This will permit\nfunctional consistency
    to be achieved in directory enabled applications\nthat use LDAP for access.\n
    \ \nIn order to distinguish this functionality from LDAP V3 capable systems,\nan
    upgrade to LDAP V4 is also proposed.\n\nThe key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED',
    'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',\n'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED',  and 'MAY' in this
    document are\nto be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].\n\t "

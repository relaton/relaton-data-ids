- content: "<p>We present criteria for evaluating Congestion Control for behaviors
    that have the potential to cause harm to other Internet applications or users.
    Although our primary focus is the safety of transport layer congestion control,
    many of these criteria need to be applied to all protocol layers: entire stacks,
    libraries and applications themselves.</p>"

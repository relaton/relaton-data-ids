  content: "The plethora of networks comprising the Internet have been getting bigger
    and faster in the past at a tremendous rate. In the future, to address all of
    the current and future pervasive services, the Internet will also have to get
    better, i.e. it will need more intelligence created by clever software deployed
    throughout the network.                                  This Internet Draft advances
    the discussion on the issues involved in interconnecting the Internet and Public
    Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs), focusing on potential interfaces between
    Internet-based devices and Intelligent Network (I.N.) devices.                                    Services
    based on the interplay of PSTN / I.N. and the Internet are discussed and classified,
    and an outline of a protocol architecture for the interface between the Internet
    and the Intelligent Network is given.\n\t "

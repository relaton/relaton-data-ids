  content: "   With BGP/MPLS VPNs any-to-any connectivity among sites of a given\n
    \  Virtual Private Network would require each Provider Edge router that\n   has
    one or more of these sites connected to it to hold all the routes\n   of that
    Virtual Private Network. The approach described in this\n   document allows to
    reduce the number of Provider Edge routers that\n   have to maintain all these
    routes by requiring only a subset of these\n   routers to maintain all these routes.\n\n\nSpecification
    of Requirements\n\t "

  content: "   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defines an extensible
    \n   framework for performing network access authentication. Most EAP \n   authentication
    algorithms, also known as \"methods\", export keying \n   material that can be
    used with lower layer ciphersuites. It can be \n   useful to leverage this keying
    material to derive usage specific \n   keys that can be used to authenticate users
    or protect information \n   exchange by other applications or services.For this
    purpose [10] \n   proposes to derive root keys for each usage application and,
    then, \n   child keys to actual be used.  \n   This document defines how to generate
    a Usage Specific Root Key \n   (USRK) and a series of Application Master Session
    Keys (AMSKs) \n   specific to Mobile IPv6 service. These AMSKs can be used by
    Mobile \n   Node and Home Agent to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 protocol operation. \n\nThis
    document defines how to generate Application Master Session Keys \n(AMSKs) specific
    to Mobile IPv6. These AMSKs can be used by Mobile \nNode and Home Agent to bootstrap

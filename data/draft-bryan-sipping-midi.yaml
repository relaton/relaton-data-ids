  content: "This document describes conventions for using MIDI to generate tones\n
    \  on SIP UAs.  This does not define any changes to SIP but describes\n   how
    to use the existing Alert-Info header to play tones that can be\n   used to indicate
    specialized PSTN tones such as the ringback tones\n   from various countries.
    \ The tones are described using MIDI which\n   results in a compact representation
    that is simple for a UA to\n   generate and easy to render into audio.\n\n   This
    work is being discussed on the sipping@ietf.org mailing list.\n   This draft was
    revived at request of a few people so it could be\n   discussed.  Parts of it
    need to be updated since it was written in\n   2003.\n\t "

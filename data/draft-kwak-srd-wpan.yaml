  content: "   A low-rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) is a network\n
    \  designed for low-cost and very low-power short-range wireless \n   communications.
    It is hard to employ static routes. Route discovery \n   is the procedure whereby
    network devices cooperate to find and \n   establish routes through the network
    and is always performed with \n   regard to a particular source and destination
    device. However, Route\n   discovery in LR-WPAN has lack of authentication mechanism.
    Also, \n   dynamic network topology makes it arduous to detect malicious nodes.\n
    \  We proposed a secure route discovery authentication mechanism using \n   the
    ¥ìSRD. ¥ìSRD uses RREQ ID, destination address and the unique \n   value as input
    string to generate authentication code (AC). It is \n   used as the authentication
    between source node and destination node.\n\t "

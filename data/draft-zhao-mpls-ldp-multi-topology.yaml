  content: "   Multi-Topology (MT) routing is supported in IP through extension of\n
    \  IGP protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS.  Each route computed by OSPF\n   or
    IS-IS is associated with a specific topology.  Label Distribution\n   Protocol
    (LDP) is used to distribute labels for FECs advertised by\n   routing protocols.
    \ It is a natural requirement to extend LDP in\n   order to make LDP be aware
    of MT and thus take advantage of MT based\n   routing.\n\n   This document describes
    options to extend the existing MPLS\n   signalling protocol (LDP) for creating
    and maintaining Label\n   Switching Paths (LSPs) in a Multi-Topology enviroment.\n\n\t "

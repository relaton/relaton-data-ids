  content: "   Dyncast support in the network provides a client with a fresh optimal\n
    \  path to a service provider instance, where optimality includes both\n   path
    and service provider characteristics.  As a service invocation\n   usually takes
    more than one packet, dyncast needs to provide instance\n   affinity for each
    service invocation.  Naive implementations of\n   instance affinity require per-application,
    per service-invocation\n   state in the network.\n\n   The present short document
    defines a way to provide instance affinity\n   that does not require, but also
    does not rule out per-application\n   state.\n\n\t "

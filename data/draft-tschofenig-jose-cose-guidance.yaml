  content: "   JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and CBOR Object Signing and\n
    \  Encryption (COSE) are two widely used security wrappers, which have\n   been
    developed in the IETF and have intentionally been kept in sync.\n\n   This document
    provides guidance for protocol designers developing\n   extensions for JOSE/COSE
    and for implementers of JOSE/COSE libraries.\n   Developers of application using
    JSON and/or JOSE should also read\n   this document but are realistically more
    focused on the documentation\n   offered by the library they are using.\n\n\t "

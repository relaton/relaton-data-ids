  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a method called \"dry-run DNSSEC\" that allows\n
    \  for testing DNSSEC deployments without affecting the DNS service in\n   case
    of DNSSEC errors.  It accomplishes that by introducing a new DS\n   Type Digest
    Algorithm that signals to validating resolvers that dry-\n   run DNSSEC is used
    for the zone.  DNSSEC errors are then reported\n   with DNS Error Reporting, but
    the bogus response is withheld.\n   Instead resolvers fallback from dry-run DNSSEC
    and provide the\n   response that would have been answered without the presence
    of a dry-\n   run DS.  A further option is presented for clients to opt-in for
    dry-\n   run DNSSEC errors and allow for end-to-end DNSSEC testing.\n\n\t "

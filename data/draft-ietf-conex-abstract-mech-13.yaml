  content: "This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform
    the network about the congestion recently encountered by packets in the same flow.
    \ Today, network elements at any layer may signal congestion to the receiver by
    dropping packets or by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings, and the
    receiver passes this information back to the sender in transport-layer feedback.
    \ The mechanism described here enables the sender to also relay this congestion
    information back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total
    amount of congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP elements
    along the path, where it could, for example, be used to provide input to traffic
    management.  This mechanism is called Congestion Exposure, or ConEx.  The companion
    document, \"Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Use Cases\" (RFC 6789), provides
    the entry point to the set of ConEx documentation.\n\t "

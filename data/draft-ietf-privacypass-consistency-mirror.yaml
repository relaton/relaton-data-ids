  content: "   This document describes the mirror protocol, an HTTP-based protocol\n
    \  for fetching mirrored HTTP resources.  The primary use case for the\n   mirror
    protocol is to support HTTP resource consistency checks in\n   protocols that
    require clients have a consistent view of some\n   protocol-specific resource
    (typically, a public key) for security or\n   privacy reasons, including Privacy
    Pass and Oblivious HTTP.  To that\n   end, this document also describes how to
    use the mirror protocol to\n   implement these consistency checks.\n\n\t "

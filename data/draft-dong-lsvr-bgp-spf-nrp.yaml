  content: "   A VTN is a virtual underlay network which has customized network\n
    \  topology and a set of dedicated or shared network resources.  Network\n   Resource
    Partition (NRP) refers to a set of network resources that\n   are available to
    carry traffic and meet the SLOs and SLEs.  Multiple\n   NRPs can be created in
    a network to provide different Virtual\n   Transport Networks (VTN) to meet the
    requirements of different\n   services or different service groups.\n\n   As the
    number of NRP increases, there can be scalability concerns\n   about using Interial
    Gateway Protocols (IGP) to distribute the NRP\n   information in the network.
    \ In networks where BGP Shortest Path\n   First (SPF) can used as the underlay
    routing mechanism to distribute\n   the link-state information among network nodes,
    the information of\n   NRPs needs to be distributed along with the basic network\n
    \  information.  This document specifies the BGP SPF mechanisms with\n   necessary
    extensions to distribute the NRP information and perform\n   NRP-specific path
    computation.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Real-Time Internet Peering for Telephony (RIPT) Protocol defines\n
    \  a technique for establishing, terminating and otherwise managing\n   calls
    between entities in differing administrative domains.  The RIPT\n   Inbound extension
    brings this to end clients, such as a browser.\n   However, it defines a different
    technique for media that cannot\n   directly use the webRTC APIs, and require
    a change to them.  This\n   specification provides an extension to RIPT for webRTC
    compatibility,\n   enabling media to flow from browser to server as is done with
    RIPT,\n   or from browser to browser as is done with webRTC.  It also discusses\n
    \  techniques for sending e2e encrypted media.\n\n\t "

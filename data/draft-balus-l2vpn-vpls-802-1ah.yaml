  content: "IEEE 802.1ah draft standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider \n   Backbone
    Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols \n   for interconnection
    of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB \n   was defined in IEEE as a
    connectionless technology based on \n   multipoint VLAN tunnels. MSTP is used
    as the core control plane for \n   loop avoidance and load balancing. As a result,
    the coverage of the \n   solution is limited by STP scale in the core of large
    service \n   provider networks.   \n\n   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4762]
    provides a solution for \n   extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling
    capabilities, \n   through a routed MPLS backbone without running (M)STP across
    the \n   backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in \n
    \  service provider networks.  \n\n   This draft discusses extensions to the VPLS
    model required to \n   incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining
    the Service \n   Provider fit of the initial model.\n\t "

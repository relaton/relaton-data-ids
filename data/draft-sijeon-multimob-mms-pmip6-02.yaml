- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, [I-D.ietf-multimob-\n
    \  pmipv6-base-solution] has been submitted as a base solution that\n   locates
    MR on the LMA and uses the PMIPv6 tunnel between LMA and MAG\n   for MLD messages.
    In this draft, we present the direct routing\n   solution that uses the direct
    connection between MAG and MR, and\n   locates the MLD forwarding proxy function
    on MAGs. The proposed\n   direct routing solution is compared with the base deployment\n
    \  solution.\n\t "

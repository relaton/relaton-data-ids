  content: "   At the IETF, we currently use a set of methods to communicate a point\n
    \  of view, to solicit input, to resolve conflict and attempt to obtain\n   consensus
    within the group.  These methods include: writing an\n   Internet Draft, discussion
    on email lists, discussion at face-to-\n   face, interim or virtual meetings,
    and design teams.  At times, these\n   methods fall short.  People become entrenched
    in their positions.  A\n   Working Group may be split 80-20 or 70-30 for a prolonged
    period.\n   This wastes time and energy and may have a lasting impact.  This\n
    \  document discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each of the current\n   methods
    of communication focusing solely on their efficacy at\n   conflict resolution.
    \  A companion document will propose some\n   solutions including alternative
    methods of conflict resolution.\n\n\t "

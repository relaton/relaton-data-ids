  content: "Mobile IP Authentication is a requirement for the TR 45.6\nCDMA wireless
    packet data service architecture[8].\nDiameter AAA, as described in [1] and [2],
    is used to\nsupport Mobile IP authentication. This requires that both\nthe foreign
    and home network deploy Diameter servers.\nCurrently, RADIUS servers have been
    deployed and are\nwidely used in the Internet Service Provider(ISP)\narena.While
    DIAMETER is required to provide the advanced\nAAA support required by the TR 45.6
    architecture, a smooth\ntransition from RADIUS AAA to Diameter AAA is required.
    At\na minimum,the Diameter AAA server located in a foreign\nnetwork must inter-operate
    with RADIUS AAA located in Home\nNetwork.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a usecase of Service Function Chaining(SFC)
    to\n   realize Virtual Customer Premises Equipment (VCPE) in the transport\n   network.
    \ In this document, the concept of VCPE is introduced into\n   the transport network
    to provide value-added services for the\n   enterprise customers.  The SFC is
    used to realize the VCPE and chains\n   different services according to the requirement
    of the customers.\n   Such architecture can provide value-added and self-defined
    services\n   to the customers.  In the meantime, SDN controller is utilized in
    the\n   usecase to direct certain traffic flows to the VCPE.  This usecase\n   provides
    a practical mechanism to offer value-added and self-defined\n   services in the
    transport network without complicating the CPE\n   devices or increase OPEX and
    CAPEX cost.\n\n\t "

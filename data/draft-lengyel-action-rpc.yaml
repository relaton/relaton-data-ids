  content: "   The NETCONF protocol defines a number of operations to read and write\n
    \  configuration data.  However, it does not define actions on the\n   managed
    nodes.  Such actions are useful for 1) operations that do not\n   change the configuration
    data (e.g. ping) 2) reading or writing a set\n   of data that forms a logical
    group but might be scattered in\n   different parts of the management data model.\n\n
    \  This document defines a new Netconf capability supporting a generic\n   <action>
    operation.  A modeling view of how the content of the\n   generic <action> operation
    can be defined is also described.\n\n   Please send comments to netconf@ops.ietf.org.

  content: "Several types of explicit cross-layer communication schemes have\n    been
    proposed to enhance the transport protocol performance.\n    However, various
    challenges with such schemes have been identified,\n    for example concerning
    the interactions with the middleboxes and\n    tunnels in the network.  This document
    discusses different types of\n    explicit cross-layer notification mechanisms
    that have been proposed\n    to enhance end-to-end transport performance. We analyze
    the\n    different mechanisms using a taxonomy based on what kind of network\n
    \   interactions they require, and discuss the benefits and\n    disadvantages
    different approaches have.  The objective is to get a\n    common understanding
    of the possibilities and challenges with these\n    mechanisms, with pointers
    to past discussions on this topic, and to\n    describe the possible next steps
    towards removing barriers from\n    explicit cross-layer communication in future
    protocols.\n\t "

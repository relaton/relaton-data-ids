  content: "   Currently, more and more Internet streaming services are getting\n
    \  increasingly popular among users.  Recent large-scale deployed delay-\n   and
    loss-sensitive services, such as IPTV, impose stringent\n   requirements to the
    streaming media delivery.  Streaming media\n   service providers and operators
    have been struggling to make the QoE\n   of the subscribers at a satisfactory
    level.  However, most of the\n   existing P2MP streaming media delivery technologies,
    such as IP\n   multicast, are far from ideal in the aspects of scalability,\n
    \  reliability and stability.  This document presents the problem\n   statements
    in point to multipoint streaming media delivery, explains\n   why network awareness
    and policy-based routing control should be\n   urgently addressed for the point
    to multipoint streaming media\n   delivery mechanism and introduces what should
    be further considered\n   in the future.\n\n\n\t "

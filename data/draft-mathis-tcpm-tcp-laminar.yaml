abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The primary state variables used by all TCP congestion control\n   algorithms,
    cwnd and ssthresh, are heavily overloaded, carrying\n   different semantics in
    different states.  This leads to excess\n   implementation complexity and poorly
    defined behaviors under some\n   combinations of events, such as application stalls
    during loss\n   recovery.  We propose a new framework for TCP congestion control,
    and\n   to recast current standard algorithms to use new state variables.\n   This
    new framework will not generally change the behavior of any of\n   the primary
    congestion control algorithms when they are invoked in\n   isolation.  It will
    permit new algorithms with better behaviors in\n   many corner cases, such as
    when two distinct primary algorithms are\n   invoked concurrently.  It will also
    foster the creation of new\n   algorithms to address some events that are poorly
    treated by today's\n   standards.  For the vast majority of traditional algorithms
    the\n   transformation to the new state variables is completely\n   straightforward.
    \ However, the resulting implementation is likely to\n   technically be in violation
    of existing TCP standards, even if it is\n   fully compliant with their principles
    and intent.\n\n\t "

  content: "A set of attacks on SignedData objects have been identified relating to
    the fact that the certificate to be used when verifying the signature in a SignerInfo
    is not cryptographically bound into the signature. This leads to a set of attacks
    where the certificate used to verify the signature is altered leading to possible
    incorrect results. This document describes these attacks and provides ways to
    deal with some of the attacks.\n\n\t "

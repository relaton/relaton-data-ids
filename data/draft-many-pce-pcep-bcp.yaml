  content: "   A core standards track RFC defines the main underlying mechanisms,\n
    \  basic object format and message structure of the Path Computation\n   Element
    (PCE) Communications Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP has been later\n   extended in several
    RFCs, focusing on specific functionalities.  The\n   proliferation of such companion
    RFCs may cause ambiguity when\n   implementing a PCE based solution.  This document
    aims at documenting\n   best current practices and at providing a reference RBNF
    grammar for\n   PCEP messages, including object ordering and precedence rules.\n\n\t "

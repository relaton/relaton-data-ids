- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes the use of the Bidirectional Forwarding\n   Detection
    protocol with BGP and the static route over IPv4 or IPv6. \n   The main purpose
    of this draft is to solve the BFD bootstrap problem\n   with BGP and static routes.
    As to the encapsulation and \n   demultiplexing issues there have been descriptions
    in BFD single hop\n   draft [BFD-1HOP] and multi-hop draft [BFD-MULI]. With the
    BFD\n   interaction with BGP graceful restart, the rules described in BFD\n   single
    hop [BFD-1HOP] with IS-IS and OSPF graceful restart are also\n   applicable to
    the BFD with BGP graceful restart, and will not \n   iteratein in this draft.
    \n   Comments on this draft should be directed to rtg-bfd@ietf.org or \n   to
    author directly.\n\t "

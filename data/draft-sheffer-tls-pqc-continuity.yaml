  script: Latn
  content: "   As the Internet transitions toward post-quantum cryptography (PQC),\n
    \  many TLS servers will continue supporting traditional certificates to\n   maintain
    compatibility with legacy clients.  However, this\n   coexistence introduces a
    significant vulnerability: an undetected\n   rollback attack, where a malicious
    actor strips the PQC or Composite\n   certificate and forces the use of a traditional
    certificate once\n   quantum-capable adversaries exist.\n\n   To defend against
    this, this document defines a TLS extension that\n   allows a client to cache
    a server's declared commitment to present\n   PQC or composite certificates for
    a specified duration.  On\n   subsequent connections, clients enforce that cached
    commitment and\n   reject traditional-only certificates that conflict with it.
    \ This\n   mechanism, inspired by HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) but\n
    \  operating at the TLS layer provides PQC downgrade protection without\n   requiring
    changes to certificate authority (CA) infrastructure.\n\n\t "

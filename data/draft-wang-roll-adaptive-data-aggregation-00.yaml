  content: "   Data aggregation is a key energy saving functionality in wireless\n
    \  sensor networks (WSNs) for both data gathering applications and\n   event-based
    applications, since the communication cost is often the\n   higher order of the
    computation cost.  Through data aggregation, we\n   can reduce the scale of data
    while maintaining the correctness of\n   data for a set of symmetric functions
    called divisible perfectly\n   compressible (DPC) functions.  Also the achievable
    minimum data rate\n   among all sensor nodes is limited for random WSNs if we
    insist data\n   from ALL sensors should be collected.  Hence we use gathering\n
    \  efficiency to indicate the number of nodes whose data are gathered.\n   It
    is intuitive that there exists a tradeoff between the aggregation\n   throughput
    and gathering efficiency.  This document introduces\n   adaptive data aggregation
    schemes for WSN to consider the tradeoffs\n   between the aggregation throughput
    and gathering efficiency.\n   Specifically, the adaptive data aggregation schemes
    includes two\n   protocols, Single-Hop-Length (SHL) Scheme and Multiple-Hop-Length\n
    \  (MHL) Scheme, for different gathering efficiency requirements.\n\n\t "

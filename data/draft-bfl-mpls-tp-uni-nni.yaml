  content: "The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] provides\nreference
    models for an MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and\nan MPLS-TP Network-to-Network
    interface (NNI).  This document updates\nthose reference models to show detailed
    reference points for these\ninterfaces, along with further clarification of the
    functional\narchitecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.\n\nThis document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\n(PWE3)
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities\nof a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\nThis Informational Internet-Draft is aimed
    at achieving IETF\nConsensus before publication as an RFC and will be subjet to
    an IETF\nLast Call.\n\n[RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication
    as an RFC and\ninsert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published\nRFC
    has IETF onsensus.]\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies characteristics of a Non-Queue-Building Per-\n
    \  Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The NQB PHB provides a shallow-buffered,\n   best-effort
    service as a complement to a Default deep-buffered best-\n   effort service for
    Internet services.  The purpose of this NQB PHB is\n   to provide a separate queue
    that enables smooth (i.e. non-bursty),\n   low-data-rate, application-limited
    traffic microflows, which would\n   ordinarily share a queue with bursty and capacity-seeking
    traffic, to\n   avoid the delay, delay variation and loss caused by such traffic.\n
    \  This PHB is implemented without prioritization and can be implemented\n   without
    rate policing, making it suitable for environments where the\n   use of these
    features is restricted.  The NQB PHB has been developed\n   primarily for use
    by access network segments, where queuing delay and\n   queuing loss caused by
    Queue-Building protocols are manifested, but\n   its use is not limited to such
    segments.  In particular, the\n   application of NQB PHB to cable broadband links,
    Wi-Fi links, and\n   mobile network radio and core segments are discussed.  This
    document\n   recommends a specific Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to\n
    \  identify Non-Queue-Building microflows, and updates the RFC8325\n   guidance
    on mapping differentiated services (Diffserv) to IEEE 802.11\n   for this codepoint.\n\n
    \  [NOTE (to be removed by RFC-Editor): This document references an ISE\n   submission
    draft (I-D.briscoe-docsis-q-protection) that is approved\n   for publication as
    an RFC.  This draft should be held for publication\n   until the queue protection
    RFC can be referenced.]\n\n\t "

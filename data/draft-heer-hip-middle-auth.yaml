  content: "   The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a signaling protocol for\n
    \  secure communication, mobility, and multihoming that introduces a\n   cryptographic
    namespace.  This document specifies an extension for\n   HIP that enables middleboxes
    to unambiguously verify the identities\n   of hosts that communicate across them.
    \ This extension allows\n   middleboxes to verify the liveness and freshness of
    a HIP association\n   and, thus, to secure access control in middleboxes.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In the past few years, as well as currently, there have and are a\n
    \  number of proposals to insert IPv6 Extension Headers into existing\n   IPv6
    packets while in-flight.  This contradicts explicit prohibition\n   of this type
    of IPv6 packet proccessing in the IPv6 standard.  This\n   memo describes the
    possible failures that can occur with EH\n   insertion, the harm they can cause,
    and the existing model that is\n   and should continue to be used to add new information
    to an existing\n   IPv6 and other packets.\n\n\t "

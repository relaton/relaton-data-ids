abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC3261 constrained several SIP header fields whose grammar contains\n
    \  the \"name-addr / addr-spec\" alternative to use name-addr when certain\n   characters
    appear.  Unfortunately it expressed the constraints with\n   prose copied into
    each header field definition, and at least one\n   header field was missed.  Further,
    the constraint has not been copied\n   into documents defining extension headers
    whose grammar contains the\n   alternative.\n\n   This document updates RFC3261
    to state the constraint generically,\n   and clarifies that the constraint applies
    to all SIP header fields\n   where there is a choice between using name-addr or
    addr-spec.  It\n   also updates those extension SIP header fields that use the\n
    \  alternative to clarify that the constraint applies (RFCs 3325, 3515,\n   3892,
    4508, 5002, 5318, 5360, and 5502).\n\n\t "

  content: "   In this draft, we discuss the challenges and requirements related to\n
    \  the migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines\n   (VMs)and
    Virtual Network Elements (VNEs).  VM migration scheme across\n   IP subnets is
    needed to implement virtual computing resources sharing\n   across multiple network
    administrative domains.  Many technologies\n   are involved in the VM migration
    across DCs.  These technologies are\n   classified and discussed according to
    their different locations in\n   the inter-DC and intra-DC network.  For the seamless
    online migration\n   in various scenarios, many problems need to be resolved in
    the\n   control plane.  The VM migration process should be adapted to these\n
    \  aspects.  We also describe the limitations of various types of\n   virtual
    local area(VLAN) networking technologies and virtual private\n   networking (VPN)
    technologies that are traditionally expected to\n   support such migration, mobility,
    and interconnections.\n\n\t "

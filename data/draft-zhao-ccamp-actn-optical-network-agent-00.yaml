abstract:
- content: "<p>With the growth of optical network scale, the complexity of network
    operation and maintenance has increased dramatically. Enhancing the intelligence
    level of optical network operation and management and building high-level autonomous
    optical networks have become the common vision of global operators. The development
    of AI, especially large AI model technologies, provides a feasible technical path
    for realizing autonomous perception, decision-making, analysis, and execution.
    The existing ACTN architecture provides network abstraction and control functions
    for optical networks but lacks higher-level autonomous capabilities. This document
    explores the introduction of AI based Network Management Agent(NMA) functions
    into ACTN-based optical networks to achieve high-level autonomy of optical networks.
    It discusses the ACTN-enhanced architecture of optical networks after the introduction
    of NMAs, including key components, interaction relationships, new interface requirements
    in the enhanced architecture, as well as typical use cases of agent-based autonomous
    operation and maintenance for optical networks. The document aims to improve the
    autonomy level of optical networks and promote the realization of autonomous optical
    networks by extending the original ACTN architecture.</p>"

  content: "   Data-intensive analytics is entering the era of multi-domain,\n   geographically-distributed,
    collaborative computing, where different\n   organizations contribute various
    resources to collaboratively\n   collect, share and analyze extremely large amounts
    of data.  Examples\n   of this paradigm include the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
    and A\n   Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) experiments of the Large Hadron\n   Collider
    (LHC) program.  Massive datasets continue to be acquired,\n   simulated, processed
    and analyzed by globally distributed science\n   networks in these collaborations.
    \ Applications that manage and\n   analyze such massive data volumes can benefit
    substantially from the\n   information about networking, computing and storage
    resources from\n   each member's site, and more directly from network-resident
    services\n   that optimize and load balance resource usage among multiple data\n
    \  transfers and analytics requests, and achieve a better utilization of\n   multiple
    resources in clusters.\n\n   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    protocol can\n   provide via extensions the network information about different\n
    \  clusters/sites, to both users and proactive network management\n   services
    where applicable, with the goal of improving both\n   application performance
    and network resource utilization.  In this\n   document, we propose that it is
    feasible to use existing ALTO\n   services to provides not only network information,
    but also\n   information about computation and storage resources in data analytics\n
    \  networks.  We introduce a uniform resource orchestration framework\n   (Unicorn),
    which achieves an efficient multi-resource allocation to\n   support low-latency
    dataset transfer and data intensive analytics for\n   collaborative computing.
    \ It collects cluster information from\n   multiple ALTO services utilizing topology
    extensions and leverages\n   emerging SDN control capabilities to orchestrate
    the resource\n   allocation for dataset transfers and analytics tasks, leading
    to\n   improved transfer and analytics latency as well as more efficient\n   utilization
    of multi-resources in sites.\n\n\t "

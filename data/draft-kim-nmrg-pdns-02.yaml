  content: "With the advent of Software-Defined Networking(SDN), the network\nenvironment
    has changed greatly to focus on users, and network\nvirtualization technology
    has made great progress. However, networks\nthat are getting bigger and more advanced
    have become more and more\ncomplex and difficult to use SDN. In such an environment,
    a network\nsystem that users can easily access and use is required.\nIn this document
    we propose a more advanced policy-based network\nvirtualization system that allows
    users to select policies and\nprovide networks accordingly, rather than a system
    that simply\nvirtualizes a network and shares it with each user.\n\n\t "

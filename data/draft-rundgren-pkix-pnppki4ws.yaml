  content: "'Web Services' [2, 3] is the collective name of a set of emerging\ntechnologies
    targeted for ultimately supporting Plug-and-Play (PnP)\nintegration of business-
    and information-systems, within and between\norganizations.  This specification
    covers an X.509 certificate\nextension, designed to enable PnP-support for the
    Public Key\nInfrastructure (PKI) part of a Web Service.  In addition to\nsupporting
    Web Services, the extension is also intended to be\nuseable for general-purpose
    PKI-enabled applications.  A PowerPoint\npresentation highlighting the core of
    this specification is also\navailable [4]\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol used\n
    \  for real-time applications.  As standardized within RFC3830 it\n   defines
    four key distribution methods, including pre-shared keys,\n   public-key encryption,
    and Diffie-Hellman key exchange, with\n   allowances for ready protocol extension.
    \ A number of additional\n   methods have been developed and continue to be built
    from the base\n   protocol (see for example, RFC4442, RFC4563, RFC4650, RFC4738,\n
    \  RFC5410, RFC6043 and RFC6267.  However, in spite of its extensibility\n   and
    more general applicability, MIKEY and its related extensions have\n   primarily
    focused on the support of the Secure Real-time Transport\n   Protocol (SRTP).\n\n
    \  This document specifies a simple adaptation of the MIKEY\n   specification
    to allow the base protocol and its various key\n   management mode extensions
    to be readily applied in more general\n   environments beyond the multimedia SRTP
    domain.  In particular, the\n   document defines a repurposing of the MIKEY multimedia
    crypto\n   sessions structure and introduces a set of message extensions to the\n
    \  base specification to allow the MIKEY key management methods to be\n   applied
    within Low-power and Lossy networks (LLNs) and other general\n   constrained-device
    networks.\n\n\n\t "

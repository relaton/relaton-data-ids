  content: "This document provides an overview of a SIP-based Distributed Call \nSignaling
    (DCS) architecture to support carrier class packet-based \nvoice, video, and other
    real time multimedia services.  Companion \ndocuments address a specific set of
    SIP 2.0 protocol extensions and \nusage rules that are necessary to implement
    the DCS architecture in \nan interoperable fashion. \nThe DCS architecture takes
    advantage of endpoint intelligence in \nsupporting telephony services without
    sacrificing the network's \nability to provide value through mechanisms such as
    resource \nmanagement, lookup of directory information and translation \ndatabases,
    routing services, security, and privacy enforcement.  At \nthe same time, the
    architecture provides flexibility to allow \nevolution in the services that may
    be provided by endpoints and the \nnetwork. \nDCS also takes into account the
    need to manage access to network \nresources and account for resource usage.  The
    SIP usage rules \ndefined in the accompanying IDs specifically address the \ncoordination
    between Distributed Call Signaling and dynamic quality \nof service control mechanisms
    for managing resources over the access \nnetwork.  In addition, the DCS architecture
    defines the interaction \nneeded between network provided call controllers, known
    as a 'DCS-\nproxy' for supporting these services.\n\t "

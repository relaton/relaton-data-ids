  content: "The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution is a method
    based on RTP and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) that enables an RTP receiver
    to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP multicast data.  Upon a request
    from the RTP receiver, an auxiliary unicast RTP retransmission session is set
    up between a retransmission server and the RTP receiver, over which the reference
    information about the new multicast stream the RTP receiver is about to join is
    transmitted at an accelerated rate.  This often precedes, but may also accompany,
    the multicast stream itself.  When there is only one multicast stream to be acquired,
    the RAMS solution works in a straightforward manner.  However, when there are
    two or more multicast streams to be acquired from the same or different multicast
    RTP sessions, care should be taken to configure each RAMS session appropriately.
    \ This document provides example scenarios and discusses how the RAMS solution
    could be used in such scenarios.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

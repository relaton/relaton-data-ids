  content: "   It has been observed that specifications of new RTP payload formats\n
    \  often forget to register themselves in the IANA registry \"RTP Payload\n   Formats
    Media Types\".  In practice this has no real impact.  One\n   reason is that the
    Media Types registry is the crucial registry to\n   register any Media Type to
    establish the media type used to\n   identified the format in various signaling
    usage.\n\n   To resolve this situation this document performs the following.\n
    \  First it updates the registry to include known RTP payload formats at\n   the
    time of writing.  Then it closes the IANA Registry for RTP\n   Payload formats
    Media Types for future registration.  Beyond\n   instructing IANA to close this
    registry the instructions to authors\n   in RFC 8088 are updated that registration
    is no longer required in\n   the closed registry.\n\n\t "

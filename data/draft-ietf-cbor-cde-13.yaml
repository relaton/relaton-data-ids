  script: Latn
  content: "   CBOR (STD 94, RFC 8949) defines the concept of \"Deterministically\n
    \  Encoded CBOR\" in its Section 4.2, determining one specific way to\n   encode
    each particular CBOR value.  This definition is instantiated\n   by \"core requirements\",
    providing some flexibility for application\n   specific decisions; this makes
    it harder than necessary to offer\n   Deterministic Encoding as a selectable feature
    of generic CBOR\n   encoders.\n\n   The present specification documents the Best
    Current Practice for\n   CBOR _Common Deterministic Encoding_ (CDE), which can
    be shared by a\n   large set of applications with potentially diverging detailed\n
    \  application requirements.\n\n   The document also discusses the desire for
    partial implementations,\n   which can be another reason for constraining CBOR
    encoders, and\n   singles out the encoding constraint \"definite-length-only\"
    as a\n   likely constraint to be used in application protocol and media type\n
    \  definitions.\n\n   This specification updates RFC 8949 in that it provides\n
    \  clarifications and definitions of additional terms as well as more\n   examples
    and explanatory text; it does not make technical changes to\n   RFC 8949.\n\n\n
    \  // This revision -13 merges all active pull requests in preparation\n   //
    for the 2025-cbor-17 interim on 2025-10-15.\n\n\t "

  content: "Multihomed mobile nodes are capable of simultaneous attachment to\nmultiple
    access networks.  In this case, a PMIPv6-enabled local\nmobility anchor should
    distribute the application traffic to a proper\naccess network which the mobile
    nodes wish to receive from.  This\ndocument specifies how mobile nodes send their
    desire of flow\nmovement to an attached mobile access gateway, which then relays
    it\nto a local mobility anchor.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a standard Subject field identifier format for\n
    \  certificates issued to Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  This will\n   allow
    applications to easily and uniquely identify certificates\n   issued to devices
    as opposed to certificates issue to services or\n   users.  The certificates will
    adhere to standard Web PKI\n   specifications thus ensuring interoperability with
    existing\n   Certificate Authorities processes and workflows, and standard client\n
    \  and service libraries and applications.\n\n\t "

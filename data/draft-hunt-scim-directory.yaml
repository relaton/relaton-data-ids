  content: "   This document describes a directory server that implements the SCIM\n
    \  protocol and schema [, its capabilities and access control model],\n   and
    optional support for LDAPv3 protocol.  This specification extends\n   SCIM from
    provisioning to a general purpose access protocol in\n   support of data management
    applications (e.g. self-service systems)\n   and RESTful clients that need read/write
    access to a directory on the\n   Internet, between domains, or within a cloud.\n\n\t "

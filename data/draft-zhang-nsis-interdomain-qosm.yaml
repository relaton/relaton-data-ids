  content: "   This document has three goals. First of all, it presents our analysis\n
    \  of how to use the NSIS signaling (inter-domain QOSM and intra-domain \n   QOSM)
    to fulfill the QoS control in accord with the ITU-T RACF \n   functional architecture.
    For this goal, we discuss how the ITU-T RACF\n   entities in the ITU-T RACF functional
    architecture can be mapped to \n   the NSIS entities and how the RACF reference
    points can be \n   implemented by using the NSIS protocol suites and QOSMs. Secondly,
    we\n   aim at specifying an NSIS Inter-domain QOSM for E2E QoS control \n   across
    heterogeneous IP networks and applying this Inter-domain QOSM\n   to the e2e QoS
    control in the ITU-T RACF functional architecture \n   based on the above ITU-T
    RACF analysis. The detailed description of\n   the NSIS Inter-domain QOSM are
    given and the e2e QoS control \n   scenarios in the ITU-T RACF architecture (including
    RACF Push and \n   Pull resource control modes), which will be covered by the
    NSIS \n   Inter-domain QOSM are described and implemented. Thirdly, we specify\n
    \  and implement those QSPECs that will be used by the Inter-domain QOSM\n   for
    the e2e QoS control in the ITU-T RACF architecture.\n\n\t "

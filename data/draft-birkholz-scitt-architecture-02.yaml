  content: "   Traceability of physical and digital artifacts in supply chains is
    a\n   long-standing, but increasingly serious security concern.  The rise\n   in
    popularity of verifiable data structures as a mechanism to make\n   actors more
    accountable for breaching their compliance promises has\n   found some successful
    applications to specific use cases (such as the\n   supply chain for digital certificates),
    but lacks a generic and\n   scalable architecture that can address a wider range
    of use cases.\n\n   This memo defines a generic and scalable architecture to enable\n
    \  transparency across any supply chain with minimum adoption barriers\n   for
    producers (who can register their claims on any Transparency\n   Service (TS),
    with the guarantee that all consumers will be able to\n   verify them) and enough
    flexibility to allow different\n   implementations of Transparency Services with
    various auditing and\n   compliance requirements.\n\n\t "

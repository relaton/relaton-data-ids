  content: "   This document describes a 64-bit address mechanism that serves as an\n
    \  extension to IPv4, namely, IPv4_64.  As an add-on to IPv4, this\n   extension
    is designed to solve the IPv4 address exhaustion issue in\n   an innovative way,
    and slightly improve some IPv4 functions at the\n   same time.\n\n\t "

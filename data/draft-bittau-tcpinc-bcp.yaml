  content: "   TCP-ENO negotiates encryption of TCP connections, protecting legacy\n
    \  applications and protocols from passive eavesdropping.  TCP-ENO\n   generally
    falls back to unencrypted TCP when not supported by both\n   endpoints or the
    network.  Nonetheless, certain middlebox behavior\n   could cause TCP connections
    to fail entirely in conjunction with TCP-\n   ENO.  This document specifies conventions
    for servers against which\n   TCP-ENO machines can test network paths for TCP-ENO
    compatibility,\n   and describes the best current practice for enabling TCP-ENO
    only\n   when it is unlikely to cause connection failure.\n\n\t "

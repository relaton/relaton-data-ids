  content: "   This document specifies an attribute for a statement of possession
    of\n   a private key by a certificate subject.  As part of X.509 certificate\n
    \  enrollment, a Certification Authority (CA) typically demands proof\n   that
    the subject possesses of the private key that corresponds to the\n   to-be-certified
    public key.  In some cases, a CA might accept a\n   signed statement from the
    certificate subject.  For example, when a\n   certificate subject needs separate
    certificates for signature and key\n   establishment, a statement that can be
    validated with the previously\n   issued signature certificate for the same subject
    might be adequate\n   for subsequent issuance of the key establishment certificate.\n\n\t "

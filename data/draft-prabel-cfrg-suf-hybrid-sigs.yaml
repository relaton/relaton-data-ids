abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a generic hybrid signature construction that
    achieves strong unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (SUF- CMA), provided
    that the second component (typically the post-quantum one) is SUF-CMA secure.
    The proposed hybrid construction differs from the current composite hybrid approach
    by binding the second (post-quantum) signature to the concatenation of the message
    and the first (traditional) signature. This approach ensures that hybrid signatures
    maintain SUF-CMA security even when the first component only provides EUF-CMA
    security. In addition to this general hybrid construction, this document also
    proposes a non-black-box variant specifically tailored for schemes built from
    the Fiat-Shamir paradigm. This variant is SUF-CMA secure as long as only one component
    is SUF-CMA secure.</p>"

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a generic hybrid signature construction that\n
    \  achieves strong unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (SUF-\n   CMA),
    provided that the second component (typically the post-quantum\n   one) is SUF-CMA
    secure.  The proposed hybrid construction differs\n   from the current composite
    hybrid approach by binding the second\n   (post-quantum) signature to the concatenation
    of the message and the\n   first (traditional) signature.  This approach ensures
    that hybrid\n   signatures maintain SUF-CMA security even when the first component\n
    \  only provides EUF-CMA security.\n\n   In addition to this general hybrid construction,
    this document also\n   proposes a non-black-box variant specifically tailored
    for schemes\n   built from the Fiat-Shamir paradigm.  This variant is SUF-CMA
    secure\n   as long as only one component is SUF-CMA secure.\n\n\t "

  content: "Bulk data applications are posing serious challenges to the Internet\ninfrastructure
    and more mass adoption of such applications would only\nincrease that challenge.
    \ P2P bulk data applications and other large\nvolume HTTP traffic such as video
    currently dominate the Internet\ntraffic.  These applications do not generally
    benefit from the\ntraffic engineering techniques developed for the Internet.  In
    the\nHTTP traffic case, the traffic optimization issues are often\naddressed using
    the CDN infrastructure.  For P2P bulk data\napplications, the problem is about
    picking the right peers to\ncommunicate with and the criteria for doing this vary
    greatly based\non the application.  Hence, intelligent peer selection is the\nfundamental
    problem to address for these applications.  This document\nexplains the multiple
    dimensions of the peer selection problem with\nrespect to obtaining information
    from the network as well from other\npeers and argues for an integrated, common
    framework to share such\ninformation.\n\t "

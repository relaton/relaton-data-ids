  content: "There have been discussions on the v6ops mailing list and at IETF\nmeetings
    regarding the suitability of translators (i.e. NAT-PT) as\nmechanisms for IPv4
    to IPv6 transition. It has often been stated that\nNAT-PT is not a mechanism to
    be recommended in general to solve the\nIPv6-IPv4 transition problem. There have
    also been discussions\nregarding special scenarios where some form of translators
    could be\ndeployed if their use is documented appropriately. The aim of this\ndraft
    is to document the rationale for using translators in 3GPP\n(Third Generation
    Partnership Project) networks for IPv6-only SIP-\nbased IP Multimedia Subsystem
    (IMS) services and to describe a\nsolution to the problem.\n\t "

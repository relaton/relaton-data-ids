  content: "   Direct, real-time communications between web user agents (browsers)\n
    \  requires two points of standardization.  The first describes the on-\n   the-wire
    protocol that is used.  The second is the API that controls\n   and configures
    what gets put on the wire and how.  The capabilities\n   of the protocol determines
    the nature of the API.  This document\n   outlines how the constraints imposed
    upon the API by the protocol.\n\n\t "

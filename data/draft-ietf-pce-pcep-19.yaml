  content: "This document specifies the Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
    a PCE, or between two PCEs.  Such interactions include path computation requests
    and path computation replies as well as notifications of specific states related
    to the use of a PCE in the context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering.  PCEP is designed to be flexible
    and extensible so as to easily allow for the addition of further messages and
    objects, should further requirements be expressed in the future. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

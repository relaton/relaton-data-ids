  content: "The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\nfunctions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label\nSwitching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.\n\nExtensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling
    and routing protocols have\nbeen made in support of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    Traffic Engineered\n(TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The use of PCE in MPLS networks
    is\nalready established, and since P2MP TE LSP routes are sometimes\ncomplex to
    compute, it is likely that PCE will be used for P2MP LSPs.\n\nGeneric requirements
    for a communication protocol between Path\nComputation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs
    are presented in \"Path\nComputation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic\nRequirements\".
    This document complements the generic requirements and\npresents a detailed set
    of PCC-PCE communication protocol\nrequirements for point-to-multipoint MPLS/GMPLS
    traffic engineering.\n\t "

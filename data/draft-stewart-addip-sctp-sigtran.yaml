  content: "This document describes an extension to the Stream Control\nTransmission
    Protocol (SCTP) [RFCXXXX] to provide a method to add or\ndelete an IP address
    from a existing association.  Also this document\nwill provide a generic method
    for transmitting a reliable control\nchunk. The benefits of these extensions are
    a) uniform methods for the\naddition of control chunks that must be reliable and
    b) for machines\nwith hot pluggable interface cards the ability to add (and or
    delete)\nIP addresses dynamically without forcing an association restart.\n\t "

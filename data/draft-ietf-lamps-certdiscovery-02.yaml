  content: "   This document specifies a method to discover a secondary X.509\n   certificate
    associated with an X.509 certificate to enable efficient\n   multi-certificate
    handling in protocols.  The objective is threefold:\n   to enhance cryptographic
    agility, improve operational availability,\n   and accommodate multi-key/certificate
    usage.  The proposed method\n   aims to maximize compatibility with existing systems
    and is designed\n   to be legacy-friendly, making it suitable for environments
    with a mix\n   of legacy and new implementations.  It includes mechanisms to provide\n
    \  information about the target certificate's signature algorithm,\n   public
    key algorithm and the location of the secondary X.509\n   certificate, empowering
    relying parties to make informed decisions on\n   whether to fetch the Secondary
    Certificate.\n\n   The primary motivation for this method is to address the limitations\n
    \  of traditional certificate management approaches, which often lack\n   flexibility,
    scalability, and seamless update capabilities.  By\n   leveraging this mechanism,
    subscribers can achieve cryptographic\n   agility by facilitating the transition
    between different algorithms\n   or X.509 certificate types.  Operational redundancy
    is enhanced by\n   enabling the use of backup certificates and minimizing the
    impact of\n   Primary Certificate expiration or CA infrastructure failures.\n\n
    \  The approach ensures backward compatibility with existing systems and\n   leverages
    established mechanisms, such as the subjectInfoAccess\n   extension, to enable
    seamless integration.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Each prefix is advertised along with an 8-bit field of capabilities,by
    using the Prefix Options[RFC8362] and the flag flield in the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix
    TLV [RFC7684], but the definition of anycast flag to identify the prefix as anycast
    has not yet been defined. However, Almost all bits of the Flag field has been
    assigned already. Thus, it is also required to extend the flag field for future
    use. This document updates [RFC7684] and [RFC8362], by defining a new variable
    length Prefix attributes Sub-TLVs for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 and a new flag in the
    Prefix attributes Sub-TLV to advertise the anycast property.</p>"

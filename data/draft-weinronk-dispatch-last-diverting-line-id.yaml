  content: "   This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation\n   Protocol
    (SIP).\n\n   In cases where applications/services (for example verification /\n
    \  billing) are provided by a network that is not the originating\n   network
    the Network Asserted Identity is needed to provide these\n   services.\n\n   This
    extension provides the ability for a 'diversion service' to\n   provide a Network
    Asserted Identity of the last diverting user to\n   these applications/services.\n\n
    \  This extension defines a new general header, Last Diverting Line\n   Identity
    which conveys the Network Asserted Identity of the\n   diverting party to these
    applications/services.\n\n\t "

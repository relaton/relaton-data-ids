  content: "   Firewall performs resource intensive filtering of traffic based on\n
    \  set of rules. A single firewall becomes a traffic bottleneck\n   depending
    on network expansion, number of connections and the\n   throughput required. This
    document describes a method of\n   interconnecting the firewalls at multiple geographic
    locations\n   through standalone network. It will enable firewall to dedicate
    its\n   full processing capacity to perform task of packet filtering. The\n   tasks
    of encryption, dynamic routing and anti-spoofing of traffic are\n   taken care
    outside firewall function. The placement of firewall and\n   routing device along
    with protocols to be used will form the proposed\n   system to improve overall
    network security and scalability.\n\n\t "

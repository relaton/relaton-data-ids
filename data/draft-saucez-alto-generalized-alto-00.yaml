abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem is being
    discussed within the IETF and more globally by the research community and some
    enterprises. In this memo, we argue that it is important to conceive general-purpose
    mechanisms to solve this problem. By general-purpose we say not only application
    independent but also layer independent mechanism. The generality can be obtained
    because the underlying problem is the same regardless the application or the layer.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes an idea for a special DNS query whose use is\n
    \  to get the IPv6 address representing an IPv4 address in a 464xlat\n   environment.\n\n
    \  The query can also be used to force the IPv4 client to connect to the\n   server
    via IPv6 by returning the \"real\" IPv6 address of a dual-stack\n   server instead
    of the IPv6 address used to connect to the server's\n   IPv4 address using NAT64.\n\n
    \  The query is supposed to be compatible to the existing DNS system so\n   no
    changes to the DNS protocol or DNS servers need to be done.\n\n\t "

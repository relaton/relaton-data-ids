  content: "   This document describes a randomized hashing scheme consisting of a\n
    \  simple message randomization transform that when used as a front-end\n   to
    regular hash-then-sign signature schemes, such as RSA and DSS,\n   frees these
    signatures from their current vulnerability to off-line\n   collision attacks
    against the underlying hash function.  The proposed\n   mechanism can work with
    any hash function as-is and requires no\n   change to the underlying signature
    algorithm. Incorporating this\n   mechanism into existing applications requires
    changes that are\n   comparable in their complexity to accommodating a new (deterministic)\n
    \  hash function such as SHA-256.\n\n   Visit http://www.ee.technion.ac.il/~hugo/rhash/
    for more information \n   and updates on this work.\n\n\t "

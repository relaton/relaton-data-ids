  content: "Presence and Instant Messaging (IM) bridging involves the sharing of\npresence
    information and exchange of IM across multiple systems\nwithin a single domain.
    \ As such, it is a close cousin to presence\nand IM federation, which involves
    the sharing of presence and IM\nacross differing domains.  Presence and IM bridging
    can be the result\nof a multi-vendor network, or a consequence of a large organization\nthat
    requires partitioning.  This document examines different use\ncases and models
    for intra-domain presence and IM bridging.  It is\nmeant to provide a framework
    for defining requirements and\nspecifications for presence and IM bridging.  The
    document assumes\nSIP as the underlying protocl but many of the modles can fit
    other\nprotocols as well.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Protocol for Transposed Transactions over
    HTTP (PTTH), an HTTP extension that allows a backend server to establish an HTTP
    connection to a reverse proxy and transpose HTTP request flow. The reverse proxy
    then forwards incoming requests to the backend server over the transposed connection.
    This extension lets backend servers behind restrictive firewalls accept HTTP traffic
    through reverse proxies without changing firewall settings and with virtually
    zero overhead.</p>"

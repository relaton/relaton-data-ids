  content: "   This document specifies the Protocol for Transposed Transactions over\n
    \  HTTP (PTTH), an HTTP extension that allows a backend server to\n   establish
    an HTTP connection to a reverse proxy and transpose HTTP\n   request flow.  The
    reverse proxy then forwards incoming requests to\n   the backend server over the
    transposed connection.  This extension\n   lets backend servers behind restrictive
    firewalls accept HTTP traffic\n   through reverse proxies without changing firewall
    settings and with\n   virtually zero overhead.\n\n\t "

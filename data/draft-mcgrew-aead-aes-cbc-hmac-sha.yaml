  content: "   This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption with\n
    \  additional authenticated data (AEAD) that are based on the\n   composition
    of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Cipher\n   Block Chaining (CBC)
    mode of operation for encryption, and the HMAC-\n   SHA1 message authentication
    code (MAC).  It also separately defines a\n   generic composition method that
    can be used with other MACs and\n   randomized ciphers.\n\n   These algorithms
    are randomized, and thus are suitable for use with\n   applications that cannot
    provide distinct nonces to each invocation\n   of the AEAD encrypt operation.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies an optimization to the Routing Information\nProtocol
    (RIP) routing protocol for use in embedded RF IPv6 internets\nsuch as those used
    in 6lowpan [7] networks.  RIPless specifies the\nminimal changes to RIP, as specified
    in RIPng [2], RIP [3] and RIPv2\n[4] to allow the protocol to be used in a \"lossy\"
    RF networks where\nthe routing fabric of the network is built upon powered nodes
    and\nthat only the edge devices may be battery powered.\n\t "

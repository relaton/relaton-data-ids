  content: "Many music libraries, music centers, authors societies, music\npublishers,
    music shops, broadcasting companies and public need to\nshare bibliographic musical
    records. No standard format exists and\nexchanging musical records involves an
    important pre- and/or\npost-processing of these data.\nSearching, sorting and
    cataloging music bibliographical records does\nnot currently follow any standard.
    The researcher needs, in each\nlibrary and each music information center, to use
    different\nprocedure. In some cases, it is just impossible to obtain the\ntargeted
    result.\nThis document defines the requirements for a standard musical\nbibliographic
    format.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an information model that defines the\n   salient
    managed entities and their relationships in an Interface to\n   Network Security
    Function (I2NSF) architecture. The information\n   model is independent of platform,
    language, and protocol, and serves\n   as a common consensual lexicon for the
    I2NFS architecture as well as\n   clients using this architecture. This enables
    multiple application-\n   specific data models (which are dependent on platform,
    language,\n   and/or protocol) to be built from this information model. The\n
    \  advantage of doing so is to ensure that such data models will be\n   able to
    share and reuse consensually defined concepts, thereby\n   increasing interoperability.\n\n\n\t "

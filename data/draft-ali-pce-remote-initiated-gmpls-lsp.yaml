  content: "     Draft [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies\n     procedures
    that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE-\n     initiated LSPs in the
    active stateful PCE model. However, this\n     specification focuses on MPLS networks,
    and does not cover remote\n     instantiation of paths in GMPLS-controlled networks.
    This document\n     complements [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] by addressing\n
    \    the requirements for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.\n\n\n     \n\t "

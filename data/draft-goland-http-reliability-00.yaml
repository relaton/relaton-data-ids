  content: "   SOAR-ity is intended to allow for \"reliable\" (this term is almost\n
    \  always a misnomer) messaging over HTTP.  It achieves this goal by\n   introducing
    two new request headers, Message-ID which provides a\n   unique ID for a message
    and MsgCreate which contains the date and\n   time on which the first instance
    of the message with the associated\n   Message-ID was sent.  The purpose of the
    Message-ID/MsgCreate pair is\n   to allow any HTTP request (e.g. any HTTP method
    can be used) to be\n   repeated multiple times with a guarantee that the message
    will be\n   processed no more than one time.  In essence it makes any HTTP method\n
    \  call idempotent.\n\t "

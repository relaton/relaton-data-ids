  content: "The purpose of the draft is to provide mechanisms to discover all \nnodes
    and addresses on an IPv6 network.\n\nNetwork discovery is a key to network management
    and network \nsecurity. In IPv4 the most effective way to discover what devices
    \nwere attached to the network was to walk the entire network address \nspace.
    While this was easily done in IPv4, it is impossible in \nIPv6, due to the large
    range of addresses on a network. Currently \nthere is no effective way to discover
    the nodes on an IPv6 network. \n\nThis document describes the changes that need
    to be made to allow \nfor discovering nodes on an IPv6 network.\n\t "

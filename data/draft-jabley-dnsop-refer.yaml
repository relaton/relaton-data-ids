  content: "   The Domain Name System (DNS) incorporates a namespace that is\n   comprised,
    in practice, of multiple so-called zones.  Each zone is,\n   in principal, a finite
    tree structure which can be administered\n   autonomously, and is connected to
    exactly one parent zone and zero or\n   more child zones.  These connection points
    are known as zone cuts; a\n   parent zone contains information that allows the
    servers responsible\n   for the child zone to be found.\n\n   The current DNS
    specification encodes that information about child\n   zones using an \"NS\" resource
    record set in the parent zone, and a\n   corresponding \"NS\" resource record
    set in the child zone.  These two\n   resource record sets have identical owner
    names, class, and resource\n   record type but can differ in other respects such
    as the time-to-live\n   (TTL) attribute, the resource record data associated with
    each set\n   and the availability of cryptographic signatures.  This property
    of\n   being similar, related but potentially different has led to\n   operational
    complexity.\n\n   This document proposes a change to how zone cuts are encoded
    in the\n   parent zone, allowing the resource records in the parent and the\n
    \  child zone to be more clearly distinguished and protected separately\n   using
    cryptographic signatures.\n\n   It is not at all clear that this is a good idea.
    \ To restate in\n   stronger terms, the goal of the experiment described in this
    document\n   is to determine just how bad an idea this is.\n\n\t "

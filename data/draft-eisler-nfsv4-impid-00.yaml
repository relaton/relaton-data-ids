  script: Latn
  content: "NFSv4.0 has no method for allowing clients and servers to provide to\n
    \  each other their implementation identities. An implementation\n   identity
    might contain the name of the software that embodies the\n   NFSv4 client or server,
    and the version number of the software. This\n   proposal describes how a future
    minor version of NFSv4.0 could allow\n   clients and servers to exchange implementation
    identities.\n\t "

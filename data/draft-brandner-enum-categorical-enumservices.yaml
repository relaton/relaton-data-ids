  content: "This document defines the set of enumservices describing 'high level'\ncommunications
    categories. These are used as elements within the services field of NAPTR resource
    records within ENUM domain space. Each category identifies a kind of communications
    service in which an end user might want to engage using the associated resource.
    It includes the expected 'low level' service that comes under each category, together
    with a list of the URI schemes that are appropriate for use with each categorical
    enumservice.\n\n\t "

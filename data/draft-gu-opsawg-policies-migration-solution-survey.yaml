  content: "   This draft enumerates several kinds of potential solutions that may\n
    \  resolve the problem described in I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration.\n   The
    goal is to, on one hand, make deeper analysis to this problem\n   and, on the
    other hand, provide informaiton for gap analysis, and\n   authors of gap analysis
    can make research on the potential solutions\n   to find out whether there are
    existing protocols or mechanisms can be\n   reused to compose a specific potential
    solution.  The solutions\n   introduced here are just high level thought and,
    if one solution is\n   regarded as a preferred way, we need to analyze and define,
    if\n   needed, detail mechanism and protocols in future.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The \"Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)\" workshop
    was\n   convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from December 3-5,\n
    \  2024 as a three-day online meeting.  It builds on a previous 2002\n   workshop,
    the outcome of which was documented in RFC 3535 identifying\n   14 operator requirements
    for consideration in future network\n   management protocol design and related
    data models, along with some\n   recommendations for the IETF.  Much has changed
    in the Internet’s\n   operation and technological foundations since then.  The
    NEMOPS\n   workshop reviewed the past outcomes and discussed any operational\n
    \  barriers that prevented these technologies from being widely\n   implemented.
    \ With the industry, network operators and protocol\n   engineers working in collaboration,
    the workshop developed a\n   suggested plan of action and network management recommendations
    for\n   the IETF and IRTF.\n\n   Note that this document is a report on the proceedings
    of the\n   workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report were\n
    \  expressed during the workshop by participants and do not necessarily\n   reflect
    IAB's views and positions.\n\n\t "

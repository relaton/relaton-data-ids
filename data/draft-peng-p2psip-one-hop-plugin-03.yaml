  content: "       This document defines a specific Topology Plugin using a ramification\n
    \      of the basic One Hop Lookups based DHT algorithm which is called ONE-\n
    \      HOP-RELOAD. In the One Hop Lookups algorithm, each peer maintains a\n       full
    routing table containing information about every node on the\n       overlay in
    order to route RELOAD message in one hop. Compared with\n       CHORD-RELOAD algorithm,
    ONE-HOP-RELOAD improves the routing\n       efficiency, and can maintain complete
    membership information with\n       reasonable bandwidth requirements. This algorithm
    is able to handle\n       frequent membership changes by superimposing a well-defined
    hierarchy\n       on the system that guarantees topology disturbance events\n
    \      notification reach every peer in the overlay within a specified\n       amount
    of time. Currently some typical peer-to-peer storages systems\n       have stringent
    latency requirements, such as Amazon's Dynamo which is\n       built for latency
    sensitive applications uses One-Hop algorithm, so\n       that each node maintains
    enough routing information locally to route\n       a request to the appropriate
    node directly.\n\n\t "

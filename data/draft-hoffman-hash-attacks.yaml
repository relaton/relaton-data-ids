  content: "Recent announcements of better-than-expected collision attacks in popular
    hash algorithms have caused some people to question whether common Internet protocols
    need to be changed, and if so, how.  This document summarizes the use of hashes
    in many protocols, discusses how the collision attacks affect and do not affect
    the protocols, shows how to thwart known attacks on digital certificates, and
    discusses future directions for protocol designers.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

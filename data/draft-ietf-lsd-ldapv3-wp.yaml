  content: "Many different white pages schema proposals have been published for\n
    \  use in LDAPv3 as well as other directory service protocols.  While\n   these
    proposals define schema elements that are indeed useful in the\n   deployment
    of LDAPv3-based directory services, there are a few\n   problems common to the
    set of such proposals currently available to\n   implementors: inconsistent semantic
    and syntactic definitions of\n   similar attributes across schema, little or no
    semantic extensibility\n   of attribute definitions without changing source code
    for deployed\n   implementations, lack of standard object class definitions for\n
    \  containing white pages meta schema elements, and lack of an attribute\n   grouping
    method. This document defines an object class for holding\n   IWPS attributes
    as mapped into existing and relatively few newly\n   defined extensible attribute
    types.\n\t "

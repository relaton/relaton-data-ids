  content: "Anycast is applied in many protocols to provide automatically fault \nrecovery
    (high availability) and scalability, i.e Anycast RP in PIM, \nCooperative Home
    Agent and Cooperative Foreign Agent in Mobile IP. \n\nWhen the Operator's engineer
    completing configuring an anycast group,\nthey need a tool to check whether each
    group member can be reached\nby the anycast address (instead of by each member's
    \ unicast address)\n\nWhen the anycast group members are changed, e.g. there are
    some new\nmembers added on, there are some old members deleted from the group,\na
    tool is needed to check whether the changed group/member can be \nreached by the
    anycast address as it should be.\n\nWhen an anycast group have been canceled by
    configuration, there need \na tool to check whether the anycast group configuration
    have been wiped \noff from all group members.\n\nThe existing method is to use
    existent PING command to ping the \nanycast address. This existing method can
    only prove whether one \nmember in the anycast group instead of all members of
    the anycast \ngroup identified by the anycast address can be reached by that \nanycast
    address. Hence it cannot satisfy above problems.\n\nThis document provides a solution
    to prove that each member of a \ngiven anycast group can be arrived by that anycast
    address.\n\t "

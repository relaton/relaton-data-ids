abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document provides specification for aggregation of RSVP end-to-\n
    \  end reservations over MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels or MPLS \n   Diffserv-aware
    MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) Tunnels. This \n   approach is based on RFC 3175
    and simply modifies the corresponding \n   procedures for operations over MPLS
    TE tunnels instead of aggregated \n   RSVP reservations. This approach can be
    used to achieve admission \n   control of a very large number of flows in a scalable
    manner since \n   the devices in the core of the network are unaware of the end-to-end
    \n   RSVP reservations and are only aware of the MPLS TE tunnels.\n\t "

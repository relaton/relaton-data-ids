  content: "This document analyzes issues involved in the transition of \"unmanaged
    networks\" from IPv4 to IPv6.  Unmanaged networks typically correspond to home
    networks or small office networks.  A companion paper analyzes out the requirements
    for mechanisms needed in various transition scenarios of these networks to IPv6.
    \ Starting from this analysis, we evaluate the suitability of mechanisms that
    have already been specified, proposed, or deployed.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

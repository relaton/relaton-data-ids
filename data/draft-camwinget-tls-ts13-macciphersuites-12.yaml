  content: "This document defines the use of cipher suites for TLS 1.3 based on Hashed
    Message Authentication Code (HMAC).  Using these cipher suites provides server
    and, optionally, mutual authentication and data authenticity, but not data confidentiality.
    \ Cipher suites with these properties are not of general applicability, but there
    are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT) and constrained environments,
    that do not require confidentiality of exchanged messages while still requiring
    integrity protection, server authentication, and optional client authentication.
    \ This document gives examples of such use cases, with the caveat that prior to
    using these integrity-only cipher suites, a threat model for the situation at
    hand is needed, and a threat analysis must be performed within that model to determine
    whether the use of integrity-only cipher suites is appropriate.  The approach
    described in this document is not endorsed by the IETF and does not have IETF
    consensus, but it is presented here to enable interoperable implementation of
    a reduced-security mechanism that provides authentication and message integrity
    without supporting confidentiality.\n\t "

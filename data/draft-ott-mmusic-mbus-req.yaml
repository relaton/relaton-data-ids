  content: "In a variety of conferencing scenarios, a local communication channel\nis
    desirable for conference-related information exchange between co-\nlocated but
    otherwise independent application entities, for example\nthose taking part in
    application sessions that belong to the same\nconference.  In loosely coupled
    conferences such a mechanism allows\nfor coordination of applications entities
    to e.g. implement\nsynchronization between media streams or to configure entities\nwithout
    user interaction. It can also be used to implement tightly\ncoupled conferences
    enabling a conference controller to enforce\nconference wide control within a
    end system.\n\t "

  content: "   In many VoIP networks today, firewalls and session border controllers\n
    \  are used at the edge of an administrative domain to allow authorized\n   UDP
    media flows to enter or leave the network.  This document\n   introduces a new
    mechanism to authorize a UDP media flow.  This\n   mechanism works with encrypted
    hop-by-hop signaling, end-to-end\n   authenticated signaling, and multihomed networks.
    \ The media\n   authorization is performed using an Interactive Connectivity\n
    \  Establishment-capable endpoint and a calling signaling device that\n   authorizes
    a firewall to permit a flow.\n\t "

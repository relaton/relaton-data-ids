abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a standardized protocol for *discovery and invocation
    of AI agents* over HTTP. It defines a common metadata format for describing AI
    agents (including capabilities, I/O specifications, supported languages, tags,
    authentication methods, etc.), a semantic search mechanism to discover and match
    agents based on capabilities, and a unified RESTful invocation interface for calling
    those agents. The goal is to enable cross-platform interoperability among AI agents
    by providing a *“discover and match”* mechanism and a *unified invocation entry
    point* via standard HTTP. Security considerations, including authentication and
    trust measures, are also discussed. This specification aims to facilitate the
    formation of multi-agent systems by making it easy to find the right agent for
    a task and invoke it in a consistent manner across different vendors and platforms.</p>"

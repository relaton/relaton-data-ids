  content: "This document  identifies the basic information to be handled by\nService
    Level Specification (SLS, [RFC 2475], [DS-TERMS]) when\nconsidering the deployment
    of value-added IP service offerings over\nthe Internet. Such IP service offerings
    can be provided together with\na given quality of service (QoS), which is expected
    to be defined in\nsuch SLS, from a technical standpoint. Since these IP services
    are\nlikely to be provided over the whole Internet, their corresponding\nQoS will
    be based upon a set of technical parameters that both\ncustomers and services
    providers will have to agree upon. From this\nperspective, this draft aims at
    listing (and promoting a standard\nformalism for) a set of basic parameters which
    will actually compose\nthe elementary contents of a SLS.\n\t "

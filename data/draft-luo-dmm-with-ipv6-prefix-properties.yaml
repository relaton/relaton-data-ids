  content: "   This draft extends the existing PMIP-based mobility management\n   protocol
    to support a more distributed model by introducing two new\n   logical functions
    to enable distributed anchoring and location\n   management.  Given the consideration
    that, the MN may not always\n   require the mobility support that requires the
    use of the global\n   prefix and additional network resources, this draft supports
    the\n   option to leverage the extended properties of IPv6 prefixes source\n   address
    selection hint (i.e.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol and\n   its Prefix Information
    Option) to enable the UE's selection of IPv6\n   prefix according to its service/application's
    mobility support\n   requirement.  When the extended prefix properties feature
    is\n   supported by the MN, this draft enable the MN to select the\n   appropriate
    prefix according to the mechanism as described in\n   [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties].
    \ Once the IPv6 prefix is\n   determined, the rest of the DMM mechanism is similar
    to the luo draft\n   [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach].\n\n\n\t "

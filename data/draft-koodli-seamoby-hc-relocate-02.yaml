  content: "In networks with bandwidth constraints, such as wireless cellular\nnetworks,
    compression of IP and transport headers may be employed to\nobtain better utilization
    of the available spectrum capacity.  When\nheader compression is used along with
    handovers in such networks,\nthe header compression context needs to be relocated
    from one IP\naccess point (i.e., a router) to another in order to achieve seamless\noperation.
    \ In this document, we propose a mechanism to achieve this\ncompression context
    relocation using options for the handover ICMP\nmessages defined for IPv6 and
    suboptions for the destination options\nused by mobile nodes to request smooth
    handovers.\n\t "

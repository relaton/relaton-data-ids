  content: "   Pervasive monitoring on the Internet is enabled by the lack of\n   general,
    fundamental security.  In his presentation at the 88th IETF\n   Bruce Schneier
    called for ubiquitous use of security technologies to\n   make pervasive monitoring
    too expensive and thus impractical.\n   However, today security is too operationally
    expensive, and thus only\n   used where strictly required.\n\n   In this position
    paper we argue that all network transactions can be\n   secure by default, with
    minimal or no operator involvement.  This\n   requires an autonomic approach where
    all devices in a domain enrol\n   automatically in a trust domain.  Once they
    share a common trust\n   anchor they can secure communications between themselves,
    following a\n   domain policy which is by default secure.\n\n   The focus of this
    proposal is the network itself, with all protocols\n   between network elements,
    including control plane protocols (e.g.,\n   routing protocols) and management
    plane protocols (e.g., SSH,\n   netconf, etc).  The proposal is evolutionary and
    allows a smooth\n   migration from today's Internet technology, device by device.\n\n\t "

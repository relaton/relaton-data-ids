  content: "      This document describes the problems associated with the accumulation\n
    \  of TCP TIME_WAIT states at a network server, such as a web server,\n   and
    details two methods for avoiding that accumulation.  Servers that\n   have many
    TCP connections in TIME_WAIT state experience performance\n   degradation, and
    can collapse.  One solution is a TCP modification\n   that causes clients to enter
    TIME_WAIT state rather than servers.\n   The other is an HTTP modification that
    allows the client to close the\n   transport connection, maintaining the TIME_WAIT
    state at the client.\n   The goal of both approaches is ensure that TIME_WAIT
    states accumu-\n   late at the less loaded endpoint.\n\n   The document also presents
    initial performance data from reference\n   implementations of these solutions,
    which suggest that the modifica-\n   tions improve HTTP connection rates at the
    server by as much as 50%,\n   and allow servers to operate at small transaction
    throughputs that\n   they cannot sustain their default configuration.\n\t "

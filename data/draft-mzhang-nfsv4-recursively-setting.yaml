- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In the recent years, the concept of near-data computing has been\n
    \  widely recognized in storage architectures.  The core idea is to\n   process
    data nearby, reduce the overhead of network transmission, and\n   utilize the
    computing capability of smart devices (such as\n   intelligent NICs, smart SSDs,
    and DPUs).  This reduces CPU and memory\n   usage of clients (computing nodes)
    and improves data processing\n   efficiency.  This design idea is applied in NFSv4.2
    or future NFS\n   versions, such as Server-Side Copy, in which client sends the
    control\n   command and the storage server copies data without transmitting\n
    \  between client and server.  We are proposing a new mechanism for\n   setting
    the attributes for all the files and directories in the\n   parent directory,
    based on thes same thinking of the server side copy\n   mechanism.  Compared with
    traditional setting of attributes, data\n   transmission over the network is reduced
    and the bandwidth resources\n   are greatly released.\n\n\n\t "

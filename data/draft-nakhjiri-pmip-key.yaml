  content: "   The specification for a EAP based keying methodology for Proxy Mobile
    \n   IP security is a topic of interest within some standard bodies such \n   as
    WiMAX and is still under consideration. In this document, the \n   authors intend
    to provide an first pass illustration on how the EAP \n   keying framework may
    be used for bootstrapping keys between two \n   agents performing a network service
    such as Proxy Mobile IP function. \n   Care is taken so that the solution is aligned
    as closely as possible \n   to the guidelines provided by the EAP Keying framework
    [EAPKEY]. The \n   solution is, however, fitted to the constraints of the existing
    SDO \n   scenarios and may not fully fit a future generic application keying \n
    \  solutions defined by HOAKEY.   \n\t "

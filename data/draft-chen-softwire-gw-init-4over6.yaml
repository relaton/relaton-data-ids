  content: "   Gateway-Initiated 4over6 is a variant of Lightweight 4over6.  A\n   Lightweight
    B4 in Lightweight 4over6 mechanism is a router which acts\n   as a tunnel initiator
    for the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  This mechanism\n   mainly focuses on the scenario
    in which an IPv4 address and related\n   configuration information is configured
    to the device behind\n   Lightweight B4.  Gateway-Initiated 4over6 uses the full
    IPv4 address\n   rather than a shared address.  This enables an unmodified end
    server\n   or host that is behind a Lightweight B4 to get access to the IPv4\n
    \  Internet through an IPv6 network.\n\n\t "

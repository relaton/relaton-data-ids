  content: "   This paper extends the Nemo Basic Support [10] for a Mobile Router
    to\n   synchronize its Mobile Network Prefixes with its Home Agents and\n   obtain
    new ones dynamically.  The proposed prefix delegation\n   mechanism is agnostic
    to the way the prefixes are managed and\n   provisioned at the Home Agent; it
    might be used for bootstrapping,\n   resynchronization at binding creation or
    after a loss of states (eg\n   MR reboot), MNP Renumbering, and configuration
    checking for loop\n   avoidance.\n\t "

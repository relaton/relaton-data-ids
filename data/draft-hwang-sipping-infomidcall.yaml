  content: "This document describes the INFO usage examples for network based \nmid-call
    service. Mid-call based services are for example, Call \nTransfer, Call Waiting,
    and Three-Way Calling. Other possible mid-\ncall services are useful and important,
    even more in IP multimedia \nnetwork. The cases described in SIP service examples
    (draft-ietf-\nsipping-service-examples-05) are Terminal-basis. Since the service
    \nprocedures are fixed in the Terminal, the features are not extensible. \nThis
    document propose network-based mid-call control mechanism with \nINFO and show
    examples that simple mid-call request (INFO) from the \nTerminal, the network
    application server provide various mid-call \nservices by prompting user through
    the Media Server, according to the \nsubscription information of the user. \n

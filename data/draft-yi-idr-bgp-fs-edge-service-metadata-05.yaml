  script: Latn
  content: "   In edge computing and distributed cloud environments, a service may\n
    \  be deployed on multiple instances across one or more sites, referred\n   to
    as edge service.  The edge service is typically associated with an\n   ANYCAST
    IP address.  With the emergence of Computing-Aware Traffic\n   Steering (CATS)
    requirements, there is a growing need to consider\n   both network and computing
    metrics when making traffic steering\n   decisions.  Traditional routing protocols
    lack the capability to\n   convey compute-related information, necessitating extensions
    to\n   existing protocols.\n\n   This draft defines a mechanism to distribute
    service routes along\n   with computing-related metadata using BGP FlowSpec.  The
    service\n   metadata, including compute resource status and performance metrics,\n
    \  can be collected by a central controller, processed, and then\n   distributed
    to ingress routers using BGP FlowSpec extensions.  This\n   enables ingress routers
    to make path selections based not only on\n   routing cost but also on the running
    environment and resource\n   availability of edge services, thereby optimizing
    Quality of\n   Experience (QoE).\n\n\t "

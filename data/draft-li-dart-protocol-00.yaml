  content: "   This document proposes a new addressing and routing protocol named\n
    \  Domain-Aware Routing Technology (DART).  Built upon the existing IP\n   network
    architecture, DART introduces a fully qualified domain name\n   (FQDN)-centric
    addressing model to address the global exhaustion of\n   IPv4 addresses and significantly
    enhance the scalability and\n   evolvability of the Internet.\n\n   DART supports
    a name-based communication model and can be\n   encapsulated over either IPv4
    or IPv6 networks.  This enables high\n   compatibility with existing infrastructures
    and supports deployment\n   and interoperability across heterogeneous protocol
    environments.  Its\n   addressing logic and architectural design exhibit the following\n
    \  characteristics:\n\n   *  In terms of scalability\n      DART localizes the
    IPv4 address space to individual Domain Names\n      (DNS) domains, granting each
    domain an independent full address\n      pool.  This enables unlimited address
    reuse, greatly reduces\n      global routing table growth, and promotes a more
    structured and\n      aggregatable forwarding hierarchy.\n\n   *  In terms of
    evolvability\n      DART shifts the addressing paradigm from \"IP-based location\"
    to\n      \"name-based location\", laying the foundation for a unified, name-\n
    \     driven networking model.  It holds potential to redefine the\n      semantics
    of network addressing and routing architecture.\n\n   DART is designed for incremental
    deployment.  Network operators can\n   derive a subdomain within the DNS system
    to serve as a DART domain,\n   immediately gaining access to a dedicated 2^32-sized
    address space.\n   Each DART domain may further delegate subdomains, forming a\n
    \  theoretically infinite, hierarchical, and scalable global addressing\n   system.\n\n
    \  Deployment requires only the installation of DART-capable gateways at\n   the
    boundaries between DART domains and traditional networks, or\n   between different
    DART domains, to enable protocol interoperability\n   and cross-domain forwarding.
    \ Internal network devices and endpoints\n   within DART domains may continue
    operating under the existing IP\n   stack without immediate modification.  In
    particular, legacy\n   IPv4-only devices located behind an edge DART gateway can
    seamlessly\n   connect to the DART network via the *NAT-DART-4* mechanism.  New\n
    \  devices may progressively evolve toward native DART support, enabling\n   direct,
    end-to-end, name-based communication.\n\n   A working prototype of the DART protocol
    has been independently\n   developed and deployed by the author.  It is publicly
    accessible at\n   http://dart-proto.cn\n\n\t "

  content: "        RFC 3971 and 3972 (SEND) define a protocol for securing \n        resolution
    of a statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 address to a \n        link address as defined
    by IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. SEND does \n        this by requiring the autoconfigured
    addresses to be \n        cryptographically generated by the host from an RSA
    public \n        key. However, one drawback of SEND is that such addresses \n
    \       cannot be securely proxied. Proxy Neighbor Discovery is \n        important
    for Mobile IPv6 and in certain other cases. In this \n        document, we describe
    an extension of SEND to addresses that \n        are cryptographically generated
    using multiple public keys, \n        called multi-key CGAs. Neighbor Discovery
    messages for multi-\n        key CGAs are signed with an RSA ring signature, a
    type of \n        signature that can be generated using the private key of any
    \n        node from a group of nodes but which requires the public keys \n        of
    all group members to verify. Multi-key CGAs can be securely \n        proxied
    by all nodes that contribute keys to the address. The \n        advantage of multi-key
    CGAs over other techniques of secure \n        address proxying, such as trusting
    the router or using an \n        attribute certificate, is that it preserves location
    privacy. \n        A receiver cannot determine from the IPv6 address, ring \n
    \       signature, or cryptographic parameters whether the node or the \n        proxy
    is defending the address, and hence whether the node is \n        on or off the
    link.  \n\n\n\t "

  content: "   As a fundamental building block in security protocols, a key combiner\n
    \  is used to combine two or more input cryptographic keys, some\n   potentially
    compromised, into a single pseudorandom output key.  Most\n   of the existing
    key combiners are for two input keys.  This draft\n   specifies two proveably
    secure constructions of key combiners for\n   multiple keys [WWW25], which is
    particularly useful in post-quantum\n   migration where multiple input keys are
    produced by different\n   algorithms or even different approaches [RFC9370], [ETSI25].
    \ Namely,\n   here the input keys can be two or more, and the combined output
    key\n   remains pseudorandom if at least one of the input keys is secure,\n   i.e.,
    uniformly random and unknown to an attacker.  The two\n   constructions, called
    HKCv1 and HKCv2, are based on the extract-then-\n   expand paradigm of HMAC (Keyed-Hashing
    for Message Authentication)\n   [RFC2104].  HKCv1 is designed for simultaneously
    available input keys\n   using concatenation, while HKCv2 is tailored for scenarios
    where\n   input keys arrive incrementally, using an iterative HMAC structure.\n\n

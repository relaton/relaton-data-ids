abstract:
- content: "<p>As a fundamental building block in security protocols, a key combiner
    is used to combine two or more input cryptographic keys, some potentially compromised,
    into a single pseudorandom output key. Most of the existing key combiners are
    for two input keys. This draft specifies two proveably secure constructions of
    key combiners for multiple keys [WWW25], which is particularly useful in post-quantum
    migration where multiple input keys are produced by different algorithms or even
    different approaches [RFC9370], [ETSI25]. Namely, here the input keys can be two
    or more, and the combined output key remains pseudorandom if at least one of the
    input keys is secure, i.e., uniformly random and unknown to an attacker. The two
    constructions, called HKCv1 and HKCv2, are based on the extract-then- expand paradigm
    of HMAC (Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication) [RFC2104]. HKCv1 is designed
    for simultaneously available input keys using concatenation, while HKCv2 is tailored
    for scenarios where input keys arrive incrementally, using an iterative HMAC structure.

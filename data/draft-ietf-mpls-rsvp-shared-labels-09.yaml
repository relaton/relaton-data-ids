  content: "As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, the number of Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements has increased. Various implementation
    recommendations have been proposed to manage the resulting increase in the amount
    of control-plane state information.\n\n However, those changes have had no effect
    on the number of labels that a transit Label Switching Router (LSR) has to support
    in the forwarding plane. That number is governed by the number of LSPs transiting
    or terminated at the LSR and is directly related to the total LSP state in the
    control plane.\n\n This document defines a mechanism to prevent the maximum size
    of the label space limit on an LSR from being a constraint to control-plane scaling
    on that node. It introduces the notion of preinstalled 'per-TE link labels' that
    can be shared by MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs that traverse these TE links. This approach
    significantly reduces the forwarding-plane state required to support a large number
    of LSPs. This couples the feature benefits of the RSVP-TE control plane with the
    simplicity of the Segment Routing (SR) MPLS forwarding plane.\n\t "

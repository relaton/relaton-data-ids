  content: "[I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] defines a method for rapid \n
    \  acquisition of multicast sessions (RAMS).  Upon accepting the first \n   RAMS-R
    message, RS MUST echo an RAMS-I message as a response to RR.  \n   This document
    proposes to optionally convey a parameter called \n   unicast backspace in the
    RAMS-I message.  Unicast backspace is the \n   RTP timestamp difference between
    the first unicast burst packet to be \n   sent and the latest primary multicast
    packet in the buffer of RS.  \n   The RTP timestamps values for these packets
    are taken from the \n   primary multicast stream.  The parameter is a constant
    once RS \n   chooses a starting point for the unicast burst.  This parameter can
    \n   be used by RR to determine when to join the primary multicast session. \n
    \  RR would not rely on RAMS-I to revise the earliest multicast join \n   time
    after the burst rate is changed by RS and therefore is immune to \n   the lose
    of RAMS-I. Moreover, if this parameter is known, RR with \n   appropriate playback
    control can reduce the additional end-to-end \n   delay introduced by the RAMS
    process or can enable the RS to serve \n   the RR with shorter burst duration
    and therefore save the bandwidth \n   of RS export and the burst forwarding path.

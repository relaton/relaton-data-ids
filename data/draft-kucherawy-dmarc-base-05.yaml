- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document presents a proposal for a scalable mechanism by which
    a\n   mail sending organization can express, using the Domain Name System,\n   domain-level
    policies and preferences for message validation,\n   disposition, and reporting,
    and a mail receiving organization can use\n   those policies and preferences to
    improve mail handling.\n\n   The email ecosystem currently lacks a cohesive mechanism
    through\n   which email senders and receivers can make use of authentication\n
    \  protocols to establish reliable domain identifiers, communicate\n   policies
    about those identifiers, and report about mail using those\n   identifiers.  This
    lack of cohesion has several effects: receivers\n   have difficulty providing
    feedback to senders about authentication,\n   senders therefore have difficulty
    evaluating their authentication\n   deployments, and as a result neither is able
    to make effective use of\n   existing authentication technology.\n\n   The enclosed
    proposal is not intended to introduce mechanisms that\n   provide elevated delivery
    privilege of authenticated email.  The\n   proposal presents a mechanism for policy
    distribution that enables\n   increasingly strict handling of messages that fail
    authentication\n   checks, from no action, through altered delivery, up to message\n
    \  rejection.\n\t "

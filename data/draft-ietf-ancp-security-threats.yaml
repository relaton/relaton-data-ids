    Protocol (ANCP)

  content: "The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate Quality of
    Service (QoS)-related, service-related, and subscriber-related configurations
    and operations between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g.,
    a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)). The main goal of this protocol
    is to allow the NAS to configure, manage, and control access equipment, including
    the ability for the Access Nodes to report information to the NAS.\n\n This present
    document investigates security threats that all ANCP nodes could encounter. This
    document develops a threat model for ANCP security, with the aim of deciding which
    security functions are required. Based on this, security requirements regarding
    the Access Node Control Protocol are defined. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "Multi-Topology (MT) routing is supported in IP through extension of\nIGP
    protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS.  Each route computed by OSPF\nor IS-IS is associated
    with a specific topology.  Label Distribution\nProtocol (LDP) is used to distribute
    labels for FECs advertised by\nrouting protocols.  It is a natural requirement
    to extend LDP in\norder to make LDP be aware of MT and thus take advantage of
    MT based\nrouting.\n\nThis document describes options to extend the existing MPLS\nsignalling
    protocol (LDP) for creating and maintaining Label\nSwitching Paths (LSPs) in a
    Multi-Topology enviroment.\n\t "

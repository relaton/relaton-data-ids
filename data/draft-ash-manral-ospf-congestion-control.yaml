  content: "Based on overload and failure experience with link-state protocols, this
    \ndraft identifies means to enable link-state protocols to:\no avoid getting into
    congestion states wherever possible\no respond gracefully to network overloads
    and failures\no gracefully recover from massive loss of topology database \ninformation\nThe
    proposed mechanisms include the following:\no throttle setups of link adjacencies\no
    reduce the rate of flooding of link-state-advertisements(LSAs)\no prioritized
    treatment of Hello & LSA ack packets\no database backup & resynchronization for
    graceful recovery from loss \nof topology database information.\n\t "

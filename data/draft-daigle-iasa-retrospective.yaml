  content: "   The IETF Administrative Support Activity was formally established and\n
    \  undertaken as a project of the Internet Society in 2005.  In the\n   following
    10+ years, the IETF has grown and changed, as have the\n   responsibilities that
    fall to the IASA.\n\n   This document reflects on some of those changes and the
    implications\n   within the IASA structure, providing some areas for further\n
    \  discussion to consider evolving the IASA and the IETF/ISOC\n   relationship.\n\n\t "

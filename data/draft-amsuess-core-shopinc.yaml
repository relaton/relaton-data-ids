abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Applications built on CoAP face a conflict between the technical need\n
    \  for short message sizes and the interoperability requirement of\n   following
    BCP190 and thus registering (relatively verbose) well-known\n   URI paths.  This
    document introduces an option that allows expressing\n   well-known paths in as
    little as two bytes.\n\n\t "

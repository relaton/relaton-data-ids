  content: "This memo describes a generalized approach for achieving IP fast\nrestoration
    in response to link and router failures by using IP\nrouting to support high network
    availability.  The approach relies\non the utilization of flat, yet highly-localized
    routing technology\nto reduce far-reaching control message propagation, thereby
    limiting\nthe effects of a failure and enabling sub-second restoration.  It\nthen
    outlines how the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) (a\nMobile Ad hoc
    Network (MANET) routing protocol), when suitably\nmodified for use in fixed networks,
    can be used within this\nframework. The general approach to routing topology management\nwithin
    the fast restoration framework is immediate reaction on link\nfailure (to preserve
    existing flows) and gradually integration of\nnew network elements on activation
    into the domain (to further\nassure stability).\n\t "

  content: "   We introduce a new class of model based Internet metrics designed to\n
    \  determine if a long path can be expected to meet a predefined end-to-\n   end
    application performance target by applying a suite of single\n   property tests
    to successive sections of the long path.  In many\n   cases these single property
    tests are based on existing IPPM metrics,\n   with the addition of success and
    validity criteria.  The sub-path at\n   a time tests are designed to eliminate
    all known conditions that\n   might prevent the full path from meeting the target
    performance.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document presents an alternative addressing architecture for IPv6
    which controls global routing growth by very aggressive topological aggregation.
    It includes support for scalable multi-homing as a distinguished service.  It
    provides for future independent evolution of routing and forwarding models with
    essentially no impact on end systems.  Finally, it frees sites and service resellers
    from the tyranny of CIDR-based aggregation by providing transparent re-homing
    of both.\n\t "

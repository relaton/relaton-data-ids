  content: "This document describes an illustrative framework of a mechanism for use
    in conjunction with link-state routing protocols that prevents the transient loops
    that would otherwise occur during topology changes. It does this by correctly
    sequencing the forwarding information base (FIB) updates on the routers.\n\n This
    mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent (management action) link or node
    shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes. It can also be used in conjunction
    with a fast reroute mechanism that converts a sudden link or node failure into
    a non-urgent topology change. This is possible where a complete repair path is
    provided for all affected destinations.\n\n After a non-urgent topology change,
    each router computes a rank that defines the time at which it can safely update
    its FIB. A method for accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use
    of completion messages is also described.\n\n The technology described in this
    document has been subject to extensive simulation using pathological convergence
    behavior and real network topologies and costs. However, the mechanisms described
    in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and do not constitute
    a protocol specification. This document represents a snapshot of the work of the
    Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is published as a document
    of record. Further work is needed before implementation or deployment.\n\t "

    popular among users.  With the increasing growth of\n   streaming media traffic,
    network awareness and policy-based control\n   are required for providing higher
    QoE to the end users and better OAM\n   support to the service providers.  They
    are especially important for\n   point to multipoint streaming media delivery
    for the edge network.\n   However, most of the existing technologies or protocols,
    such as IP\n   multicast, do not provide the network aware and policy-based control\n
    \  mechanisms.  This document presents the problem statements in point\n   to
    multipoint streaming media delivery for edge network, explains why\n   network
    awareness and policy-based control should be urgently\n   addressed for the point
    to multipoint streaming media delivery in the\n   edge network and introduces
    what's should be further considered in\n   the future.\n\t "

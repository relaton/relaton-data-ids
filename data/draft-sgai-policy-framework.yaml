  content: "There is a need to represent, manage, and share policies and policy\n
    \       information in a vendor-independent, interoperable, scalable manner.\n
    \       The goal of this document is to provide a framework that meets these\n
    \       needs.\n \n        This framework has been developed specifically for
    QoS traffic\n        management. A secondary goal of this document is to show
    that this\n        general framework can be extended to other application domains,
    such\n        as security.\n\t "

  content: "This document presents a framework for interoperation between the\nContext
    Transfer Protocol (CTP) and the Next Steps in Signaling\n(NSIS) protocols. The
    main goals we are trying to achieve are: to\nprovide a seamless handover, to establish
    QoS and other states\nrequired by NSIS, to have this process appropriately secured,
    and to\ntradeoff between security, complexity and performance.\n\t "

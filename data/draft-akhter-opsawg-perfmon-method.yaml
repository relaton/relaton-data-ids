  content: "   There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of\n
    \  network applications and the network service in handling user data.\n   This
    performance data provides information essential in validating\n   service level
    agreements, fault isolation as well as early warnings\n   of network greater problems.
    \ This document describes a generic\n   methodology for calculating metrics related
    to network based\n   applications.  In addition, to the performance metrics, several\n
    \  additional information elements are included to help provide greater\n   context
    to the reports.  The measurements use audio/video\n   applications as base examples
    but are not restricted to these class\n   of applications.\n\n\t "

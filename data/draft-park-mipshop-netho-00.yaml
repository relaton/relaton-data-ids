  content: "   In this memo, a framework provides network-initiated handover to \n
    \  FMIPv6 MN (mobile node) in IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN is suggested.  \n    \n
    \  Basic concept and mechanism of layer-2/layer-3 handover and IAPP are \n   introduced.
    Suggested framework is integration of these three \n   protocols and additional
    primitives. \n\t "

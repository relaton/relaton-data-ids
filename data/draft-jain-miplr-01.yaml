  content: "This document is intended only to provide information to the Internet\ncommunity.
    \ The Mobile IP (MIP) protocol for IP version 4 provides\ncontinuous Internet
    connectivity to mobile hosts, without requiring any\nchanges to existing routers
    and higher-layer applications.  This\ndocument describes an alternative protocol,
    Mobile IP with Location\nRegisters (MIP-LR), where the sender first queries a
    database, called a\nLocation Register, to obtain the recipients current location.
    \ MIP-LR\nis designed for operation in tactical military environments, enterprise\nenvironments
    or within logical administrative domains, as it requires a\nsending host to be
    aware which hosts implement the MIP-LR protocol.\nMIP-LR gives up the transparency
    of MIP for several benefits in the\nareas of survivability, performance and interoperability.
    \nMIP-LR improves survivability for situations where the mobile's home\nnetwork
    is particularly vulnerable (e.g. in the forward area of a\nbattlefield), by allowing
    location registers to be placed and\nreplicated outside the home network.  This
    document describes how\nreplicated location registers can be managed by Translation
    Server or\nQuorum schemes.  In terms of performance, MIP-LR avoids triangle\nrouting
    and tunneling, and reduces the load on the home network as well\nas the home agents.
    \ MIP-LR provides improved interoperability with\nprotocols such as RSVP for providing
    QoS guarantees.  Finally, MIP-LR\nis interoperable with MIP, such that hosts which
    implement only MIP can\ncontinue to operate as expected (provided the provisions
    required by\nMIP, such as Home and Foreign Agents, are appropriately provided)\nwithout
    gaining any of the benefits of MIP-LR.  We have developed a\nworking version of
    the MIP-LR protocol running on Linux hosts.\n\t "

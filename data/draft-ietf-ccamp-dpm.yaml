  content: "When setting up a Label Switched Path (LSP) in Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    and MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) networks, the completion of the signaling
    process does not necessarily mean that the cross-connection along the LSP has
    been programmed accordingly and in a timely manner.  Meanwhile, the completion
    of the signaling process may be used by LSP users or applications that control
    their use as an indication that the data path has become usable.  The existence
    of the inconsistency between the signaling messages and cross-connection programming,
    and the possible failure of cross- connection programming, if not properly treated,
    will result in data loss or even application failure.  Characterization of this
    performance can thus help designers to improve the way in which LSPs are used
    and to make applications or tools that depend on and use LSPs more robust.  This
    document defines a series of performance metrics to evaluate the connectivity
    of the data path in the signaling process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

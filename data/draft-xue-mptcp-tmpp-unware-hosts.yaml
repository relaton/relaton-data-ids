  content: "   Transparent MPTCP Proxy(TMPP) is an introduced network-based\n   function,
    which is under MPTCP architecture.  It can help two MPTCP-\n   unaware hosts enjoy
    multipath support, and can be extensively used\n   both in the access networks
    and operators' networks.  Meanwhile, in\n   MPTCP architecture with TMPP, TMPP
    needs to modify the received\n   packets and transmit them again(just like gateway
    in NAT\n   environment).  In this document, we also discuss the guarantee for\n
    \  data transfer on TMPP's side.  The consideration of data transfer can\n   be
    expanded to the MPTCP architecture with proxy.\n\n\t "

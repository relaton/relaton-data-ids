abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers
    a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". A segment
    can represent topological or service based instructions. A segment can further
    be associated with a set of network resources used for executing the instruction.
    Such a segment is called resource-aware segment. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN)
    is a virtual underlay network which has a network topology and a set of network
    resources allocated from the physical underlay network. Resource-aware Segment
    Identifiers (SIDs) may be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved network
    resources. In addition, a group of resource-aware SIDs may be used to build SR
    based virtual underlay networks, which have customized network topology and resource
    attributes required by one or a group of customers and/or services. Such virtual
    networks are the SR instantiations of VTNs. This document describes a suggested
    way to use resource-aware SIDs to build SR based VTNs.</p>

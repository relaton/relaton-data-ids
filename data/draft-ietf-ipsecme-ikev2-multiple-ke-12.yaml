- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes how to extend the Internet Key Exchange\n   Protocol
    Version 2 (IKEv2) to allow multiple key exchanges to take\n   place while computing
    a shared secret during a Security Association\n   (SA) setup.\n\n   The primary
    application of this feature in IKEv2 is the ability to\n   perform one or more
    post-quantum key exchanges in conjunction with\n   the classical (Elliptic Curve)
    Diffie-Hellman (EC)DH key exchange, so\n   that the resulting shared key is resistant
    against quantum computer\n   attacks.  Since there is currently no post-quantum
    key exchange that\n   is as well-studied as (EC)DH, performing multiple key exchanges
    with\n   different post-quantum algorithms along with the well-established\n   classical
    key exchange algorithms addresses this concern, since the\n   overall security
    is at least as strong as each individual primitive.\n\n   Another possible application
    for this extension is the ability to\n   combine several key exchanges in situations
    when no single key\n   exchange algorithm is trusted by both initiator and responder.\n\n
    \  This document utilizes the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange, by means of\n   which
    multiple key exchanges are performed when an IKE SA is being\n   established.
    \ It also introduces a new IKEv2 exchange\n   IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE, which is used for
    the same purpose when the IKE SA\n   is up (during rekeys or creating additional
    Child SAs).\n\n   This document updates RFC7296 by renaming a transform type 4
    from\n   \"Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H)\" to \"Key Exchange Method (KE)\" and\n
    \  renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload from \"Diffie-Hellman\n   Group
    Num\" to \"Key Exchange Method\".  It also renames an IANA\n   registry for this
    transform type from \"Transform Type 4 - Diffie-\n   Hellman Group Transform IDs\"
    to \"Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange\n   Method Transform IDs\".  These changes
    generalize key exchange\n   algorithms that can be used in IKEv2.\n\n\t "

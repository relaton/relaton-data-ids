  content: "   The purpose of this document is to define a set of test scenarios\n
    \  which may be used to create a series of statistics that will help to\n   better
    understand the performance of network devices that operate at\n   nework layers
    above IP.  More specifically, these scenarios are\n   designed to most accurately
    predict performance of these devices when\n   subjected to dynamic traffic patterns.
    \ This document will operate\n   within the constraints of the Benchmarking Working
    Group charter,\n   namely black box characterization in a laboratory environment.\n\n\t "

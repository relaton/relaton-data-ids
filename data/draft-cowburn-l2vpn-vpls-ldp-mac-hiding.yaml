  content: "  This document describes a mechanism for hiding customer MAC \n  addresses
    on a PE-rs in an H-VPLS environment.  In the H-VPLS \n  hierarchy, a PE-rs is
    exposed to the MAC addresses for customers on \n  its directly attached MTU-s
    and the remote MAC addresses for all of \n  its configured VPLS instances.  This
    can result in the requirement \n  to store a large number of a MAC addresses.
    \ \n  This document introduces the concept of an MTU-id per MTU-s which is \n
    \ included with the customer frame sent by an MTU-s.  The PE-rs is \n  then able
    to switch based on the MTU-id rather than the customer MAC \n  addresses, thereby
    reducing the address storage requirements on the \n  PE-rs to be of the order
    of the number of MTU-s. \n\n\t "

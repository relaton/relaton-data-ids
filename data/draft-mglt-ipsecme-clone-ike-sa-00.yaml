  content: "   This document considers a VPN End User setting a VPN with a security\n
    \  gateway where at least one of the peer has multiple interfaces.\n\n   With
    the current IKEv2, the outer IP addresses of the VPN are\n   determined by those
    used by IKEv2 channel.  As a result using\n   multiple interfaces requires to
    set an IKEv2 channel on each\n   interface, or on each paths if both the VPN Client
    and the security\n   gateway have multiple interfaces.  Setting multiple IKEv2
    channel\n   involves multiple authentications which MAY each require multiple\n
    \  round trips and delay the VPN establishment.  In addition multiple\n   authentications
    unnecessarily load the VPN client and the\n   authentication infrastructure.\n\n
    \  This document presents the Clone IKE_SA extension, where an\n   additional
    IKEv2 channel is derived from an already authenticated\n   IKEv2 channel.  The
    newly created IKEv2 channel is set without the\n   IKEv2 authentication exchange.
    \ The newly created IKEv2 channel can\n   then be assigned to another interface
    using MOBIKE.\n\n\t "

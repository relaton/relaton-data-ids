  content: "   This document describes a mechanism to notify a BMP collector of the\n
    \  need to purge the state associated with a RIB view of a specific\n   peer.
    \ This is useful, for example, when the BMP sender decides to\n   stop exporting
    a specific RIB view after providing an initial export.\n   The BMP collector can
    use the per-peer Purge message to take\n   appropriate action to remove the stale
    state and avoid holding on to\n   irrelevant network data.\n\n\t "

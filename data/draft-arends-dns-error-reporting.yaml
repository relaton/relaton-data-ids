  content: "   DNS Error Reporting is a lightweight error reporting mechanism that\n
    \  provides the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS\n   resource
    records that fail to resolve or validate, that a Domain\n   Owner or DNS Hosting
    organization can use to improve domain hosting.\n   The reports are based on Extended
    DNS Errors [RFC8914].\n\n   When a domain name fails to resolve or validate due
    to a\n   misconfiguration or an attack, the operator of the authoritative\n   server
    may be unaware of this.  To mitigate this lack of feedback,\n   this document
    describes a method for a validating recursive resolver\n   to automatically signal
    an error to an agent specified by the\n   authoritative server.  DNS Error Reporting
    uses the DNS to report\n   errors.\n\n\t "

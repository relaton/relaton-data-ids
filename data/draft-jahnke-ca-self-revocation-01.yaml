  content: "   This document defines a cryptographically secure mechanism for\n   Certificate
    Authorities (CAs) and other self-signed trust anchors\n   to perform controlled
    self-revocation upon compromise detection.\n   This addresses a fundamental architectural
    paradox in current\n   internet infrastructure: self-signed trust anchors (PKI
    Root CAs,\n   DNSSEC KSKs, Code Signing Roots, Government PKIs, Industrial\n   Control
    System CAs, Mobile Platform Roots, and Critical\n   Infrastructure Trust Anchors)
    cannot be cryptographically revoked\n   because any revocation mechanism requires
    the anchor's private key,\n   but if attackers possess that key (the primary threat),
    they\n   control the revocation process.\n\n   This specification solves this
    25-year-old \"unsolvable\" problem by\n   making attackers inadvertently help
    terminate their own attacks.\n   The mechanism provides automated detection with
    mandatory manual\n   authorization, enabling trust anchor operators to terminate
    anchor\n   validity within hours instead of months while maintaining strict\n
    \  dual-person control. This addresses fundamental architectural\n   limitations
    exposed by historical incidents such as the DigiNotar\n   compromise in 2011 and
    Symantec certificate missuance incidents,\n   where extended cleanup periods affected
    millions of users globally,\n   as well as theoretical compromise scenarios affecting
    DNSSEC,\n   government PKI, industrial control systems, and other critical\n   infrastructure
    trust anchors.\n\n\t "

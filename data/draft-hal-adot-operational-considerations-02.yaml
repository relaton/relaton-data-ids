  content: "   DNS over TLS (DoT) has been gaining attention, primarily as a means\n
    \  of communication between stub resolvers and recursive resolvers.\n   There
    have also been discussions and experiments involving the use of\n   DoT to communicate
    with authoritative nameservers (Authoritative DNS\n   over TLS or \"ADoT\"), including
    communication between recursive and\n   authoritative resolvers.  However, we
    have identified a number of\n   operational concerns with ADoT that have arisen
    as DNS operators have\n   begun to experiment with and prepare for deploying DoT.
    \ These\n   operational concerns need to be addressed prior to ADoT's deployment\n
    \  at scale by DNS operators in order to maintain the stability and\n   resilience
    of the global DNS.  The document also provides some\n   suggested next steps to
    advance the operator community's\n   understanding of ADoT's operational impact.\n\n\t "

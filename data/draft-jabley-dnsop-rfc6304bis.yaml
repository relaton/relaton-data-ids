  content: "   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that\n
    \  are not globally-unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in\n   RFC
    1918 for private use within individual sites.\n\n   Devices in such environments
    may occasionally originate Domain Name\n   System (DNS) queries (so-called \"reverse
    lookups\") corresponding to\n   those private-use addresses.  Since the addresses
    concerned have only\n   local significance, it is good practice for site administrators
    to\n   ensure that such queries are answered locally.  However, it is not\n   uncommon
    for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the\n   public DNS instead
    of being answered within the site.\n\n   It is not possible for public DNS servers
    to give useful answers to\n   such queries.  In addition, due to the wide deployment
    of private-use\n   addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume
    of\n   such queries is large and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide\n
    \  a distributed sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on\n   the
    corresponding authoritative servers.  The AS112 project is named\n   after the
    Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was assigned to it.\n\n   RFC6304 described
    the steps required to install a new AS112 node, and\n   offered advice relating
    to such a node's operation.  This document\n   updates that advice to facilitate
    the addition and removal of zones\n   for which query traffic will be sunk at
    AS112 nodes, using DNAME,\n   whilst still supporting direct delegations to AS112
    name servers.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC6304.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) protocol is an \nefficient
    and extensible transport mechanism for IP over MPEG-2 \nnetworks. Such networks
    are often operated on broadcast wireless \n \n \n channels, and are thus specifically
    vulnerable to attacks. Passive \nattacks, such as eaves-dropping, are simple to
    perform and emphasize \nthe importance of security support within ULE. \n\nThis
    document defines a mandatory security extension for the ULE \nprotocol that is
    designed with the aim of being conservative in \nbandwidth consumption and lightweight
    in the sense that it allows for \nimplementation in low-cost, resource-scarce
    (mobile) receiver \ndevices. The extension may be easily adapted to the Generic
    Stream \nEncapsulation (GSE) protocol, which uses the same extension header \nmechanism.
    The document describes the format of the security \nextension header, specifies
    default security algorithms to be used \nwith this extension, and gives detailed
    processing descriptions for \ndevices implementing the security extension. \n\nConventions
    used in this document \n\nThe following DVB specific terms are taken from [RFC4326]
    and \nrecapitulated here for easy lookup: \n\nDVB: Digital Video Broadcast.  A
    framework and set of associated \nstandards published by the European Telecommunications
    Standards \nInstitute (ETSI) for the transmission of video, audio, and data using
    \nthe ISO MPEG-2 standard [MPEG2]. \n\nMPEG-2: A set of standards specified by
    the Motion Picture Experts \nGroup (MPEG) and standardized by the International
    Standards \nOrganization (ISO/IEC 13818-1) [MPEG2] and ITU-T [H222]. \n\nNPA:
    Network Point of Attachment.  In this document, refers to a 48-\nbit destination
    address (resembling an IEEE MAC address) within the \nMPEG-2 transmission network
    that is used to identify individual \nreceivers or groups of receivers. \n\nPDU:
    Protocol Data Unit.  Examples of a PDU include Ethernet frames, \nIPv4 or IPv6
    datagrams, and other network packets. \n\nPID: Packet Identifier [MPEG2].  A 13-bit
    field carried in the header \nof TS cells.  This is used to identify the TS Logical
    Channel to \nwhich a TS cell belongs [MPEG2]. \n\nSNDU: SubNetwork Data Unit.
    \ An encapsulated PDU sent as an MPEG-2 \npayload unit. \n\nTS: Transport Stream
    [MPEG2].  A method of transmission at the MPEG-2 \nlevel using TS cells; it represents
    layer 2 of the ISO/OSI reference \nmodel. \n \n TS Logical Channel: Transport
    Stream Logical Channel.  In this \ndocument, this term identifies a channel at
    the MPEG-2 level [MPEG2]. \nAll packets sent over a TS Logical Channel carry the
    same PID value. \n\nULE: Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation [RFC4326].  A
    protocol \nthat encapsulates PDUs into SNDUs that are sent in a series of TS \ncells
    using a single TS Logical Channel. \n\nTerms and abbreviations from cryptography
    are explained when they \nfirst appear within this document. \n\nAll numbers encoded
    in protocols are to be interpreted in network \nbyte order. \n\nThe key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\", when \nappearing within
    this document, are to be interpreted as described in \n[RFC2119].\n\t "

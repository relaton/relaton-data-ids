  content: "The VIEW extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]\npermits
    a subset of messages in the mailbox to be processed\nseparately from the entire
    set of messages in the mailbox.  This\nallows a client to restrict its view to
    only the messages appearing\nin this set.  The subset of messages also need not
    be returned in\norder of their sequence numbers, allowing clients to access messages\nin
    a particular sort order.\n\t "

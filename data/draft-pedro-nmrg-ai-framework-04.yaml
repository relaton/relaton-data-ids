  content: "   The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in network management\n
    \  (NM) solutions is the way to resolve many of the complex management\n   problems
    arising from the adoption of NFV and SDN technologies.  The\n   AINEMA framework,
    as discussed in this document, includes the\n   functions, capabilities, and components
    that MUST be provided by AI\n   modules and models to be successfully applied
    to NM.  This is\n   enhanced by the consideration of seamless integration of different\n
    \  services, including the ability of having multiple AI models working\n   in
    parallel, as well as the ability of complex reasoning and event\n   processing.
    \ In addition, disparate sources of information are put\n   together without increasing
    complexity, through the definition of a\n   control and management service bus.
    \ It allows, for instance, to\n   involve external events in NM operations.  Using
    all available\n   sources of information --- namely, intelligence sources ---
    allows NM\n   solutions to apply proper intelligence processes that provide\n
    \  explainable results instead of simple AI-based guesses.  Such\n   processes
    are highly based in reasoning and formal and target-based\n   intelligence analysis
    and decision --- providing evidence-based\n   conclusions and proofs for the decisions
    --- in the form of AI method\n   outputs with explanations.  This will allow computer
    and network\n   system infrastructures --- and user demands --- to grow in complexity\n
    \  while keeping dependability.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the REM License Token, referred to as the RLT,
    as the genesis artifact of the Reilly EternaMark Protocol for digital permanence
    and verifiable provenance. This specification formally defines the token structure,
    issuance procedures, cryptographic hash requirements, blockchain anchoring requirements,
    DOI archival requirements, verification methodology, and security model. The RLT
    represents an implementation of a dual-layer permanence artifact combining a blockchain
    timestamp with DOI-based archival to achieve durable, tamper-evident provenance
    guarantees. This document is published as an Informational Internet-Draft to serve
    as open, implementable guidance.</p>"

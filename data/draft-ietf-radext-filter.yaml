  content: "While RFC 2865 defines the Filter-Id attribute, it requires that the Network
    Access Server (NAS) be pre-populated with the desired filters.  However, in situations
    where the server operator does not know which filters have been pre-populated,
    it is useful to specify filter rules explicitly.  This document defines the NAS-Filter-Rule
    attribute within the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS).  This
    attribute is based on the Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP)
    described in RFC 4005, and the IPFilterRule syntax defined in RFC 3588. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

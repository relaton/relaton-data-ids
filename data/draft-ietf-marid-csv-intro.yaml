  content: "   Internet mail relies on exchanges between systems that have made no\n
    \  prior arrangement with each other.  Widespread abuse of the email\n   system
    has led operators to demand accountability for the email their\n   receiving SMTP
    servers are being asked to process.  Certified Server\n   Validation (CSV) provides
    an economical service that permits a\n   receiving SMTP server to decide whether
    a sending SMTP client is\n   likely to produce well-behaved traffic, or at least
    to decide whether\n   the client is sufficiently accountable for its actions.
    \ CSV provides\n   a small, simple and useful improvement to Internet mail service\n
    \  accountability.  It builds upon the existing practise of service\n   providers
    that accredit the networks from which sending systems are\n   connecting.\n\t "

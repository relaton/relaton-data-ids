  content: "   On-path telemetry techniques can provide high-precision inband flow\n
    \  insight and real-time network performance monitoring.  Although they\n   are
    benefical, network operators still face challenges applying such\n   techniques,
    especially flow identification when deploying flow-\n   oriented monitoring on
    a large scale.  This document introduces the\n   real network scenarios, and intends
    to address the problems by\n   proposing the requirements of inband flow learning
    mechenism that can\n   be used to implement inband flow information telemetry
    for\n   deployability and flexibility.\n\n\n\t "

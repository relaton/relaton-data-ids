  content: "   Proactive Routing Network (PRN), which runs on conventional\n   network,
    is user and service experience oriented; and provides a\n   set of E2E Pipes for
    the two End Systems of communication named\n   Requester and Source. The E2E Pipe
    have deterministic path learned\n   from the trace of the Request sent by Requester,
    and is QOS\n   guaranteed by resource reservation. Addressing issue is solved
    by\n   recording the labeled interfaces or Local Pipes taken along with\n   the
    Request to the Source. Each Pipe is protocol oblivious,\n   application aware,
    elastic and visible for users and operators.\n\n   PRN is not a new network, rather,
    it is a service attached to the\n   conventional network. Therefore it does not
    affect the operation\n   business of the conventional networks, so it is very
    conducive to\n   the deployment and smooth evolution.\n\n   PRN is valuable for
    users who want deterministic network service,\n   and is helpful for operators
    to simplify the service management\n   and easy for fault location and billing,
    and is helpful for\n   vendors to solve the addressing issue which is one of the
    biggest\n   challenges of increasing device throughput at a reasonable cost.\n\n\t "

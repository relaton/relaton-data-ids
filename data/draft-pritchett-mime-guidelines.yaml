- language: en

  content: "The introduction of MIME brings the standards required to construct robust
    mail user agents. These agents will quite often have presentation semantics. In
    many cases, the way to present a multipart message is clear based on the message,
    but there are times when this is not true. This document proposes a mechanism
    for dealing with those cases.\n\t "

  content: "   This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the\n
    \  description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc5661bis\n   effort.
    \ It describes the structure and function of Access Control\n   Lists within all
    minor versions of NFSv4.\n\n   It describes the structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their
    role in the NFSv4\n   security architecture.  While the focus of this document
    is on the\n   role of ACLs in providing a more flexible approach to file access\n
    \  authorization than is made available by the POSIX-derived\n   authorization-related
    attributes, the potential provision of other\n   security-related functionality
    is covered as well.\n\n   Because of the failure of previous specifications to
    provide a\n   satisfactory approach to either of the two ACL models for which\n
    \  support was intended, this document will include some small protocol\n   extensions
    to correct protocol defects, as provided for in RFC8178.\n\n   In this document,
    the relationship among the multiple ACL models\n   supported has changed.  A core
    set of functionality, derived from a\n   subset of that provided by the now-withdrawn
    draft POSIX ACLs is\n   presented as the conceptual base of the feature set.  Two
    additional\n   sets of features used to provide the functionality within the NFSv4\n
    \  ACL model and the full draft POSIX ACL model are presented as\n   OPTIONAL
    extensions to that core.\n\n   The current version of the document is intended,
    in large part, to\n   result in working group discussion regarding repairing problems
    with\n   previous specifications of ACL-related features and to enable work to\n
    \  provide a greater degree of interoperability than has been available\n   heretofore.
    \ The drafts provide a framework for addressing these\n   issues and obtaining
    working group consensus regarding necessary\n   changes.\n\n   When the resulting
    document is eventually published as an RFC, it\n   will supersede the descriptions
    of ACL structure and semantics\n   appearing in existing minor version specification
    documents for\n   NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby updating RFC7530 and RFC8881.\n\n\t "

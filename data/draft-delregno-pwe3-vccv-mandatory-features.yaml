  content: "Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085]\ndefines
    several Control Channel (CC) Types for MPLS PW's , none of\nwhich are preferred
    or mandatory.  As a result, independent\nimplementations of different subsets
    of the three options have\nresulted in interoperability challenges.  In RFC5085
    the CV type of\nLSP Ping is made the default for MPLS PW's and ICMP Ping is made\noptional.
    \ This however, is a recommendation and not a requirement\nfor implementations
    which can also lead to interoperability\nchallenges.\n\nTo enable interoperability
    between implementations, this document\ndefines a subset of control channels that
    is considered mandatory for\nVCCV implementation.  This will ensure that VCCV
    remains the valuable\ntool it was designed to be in multi-vendor, multi-implementation
    and\nmulti-carrier networks.  This document also states requirements for\nthe
    CV type too.\n\nThis draft is specific to MPLS PW's and not L2TPv3 PW.  For the\nL2TPv3
    PW only one CC and CV type are specified and the issues raised\nin this draft
    do not arise.\n\t "

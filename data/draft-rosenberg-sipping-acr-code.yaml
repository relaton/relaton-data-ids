  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows for users to make\n   anonymous
    calls.  However, users receiving such calls have the right\n   to reject them
    because they are anonymous.  SIP has no way to\n   indicate to the caller that
    the reason for call rejection was that\n   the call was anonymous.  Such an indication
    is useful to allow the\n   call to be retried without anonymity.  This specification
    defines a\n   new SIP response code for this purpose.\n\t "

  content: "   TRILL Active/Active Edge enables a Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation\n
    \  Group to connect to multiple RBridges which can ingress and egress\n   data
    traffic for the same VLAN at the same time. The purpose of\n   introducing the
    TRILL Active/Active Edge is to increase the access\n   bandwidth and resilience.
    This new access type puts forward new\n   requirements for TRILL control plane.
    Current TRILL control plane\n   need be extended in order to make the TRILL Active/Active
    Edge\n   operational. Requirements are developed in this document as the\n   guidelines
    for designing those specific control plane functions.\n\n\t "

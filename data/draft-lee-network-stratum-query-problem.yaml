  content: "This document describes the general problem of network stratum query\nfor
    application optimization. Network Stratum query is an ability to\nquery the network
    from an application controller such as those used\nin Data Centers so that application
    controller decisions such as\nserver assignment or virtual machine instantiation/migration
    could be\nperformed with better knowledge of the underlying network conditions.\n\nAs
    application servers are distributed geographically across Data\nCenters, many
    application-related decisions such as which server to\nassign a new client or
    where to instantiate/migrate virtual machines\nwill suffer from sub-optimality
    unless the underlying network\nconditions are factored in the decision process.
    The lack of network\nawareness may result in not meeting the end-user service
    objective\nfor some key applications like video gaming/conferencing that require\nstringent
    latency and bandwidth requirement.\n\t "

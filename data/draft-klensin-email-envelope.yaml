  content: "During the last few years, a number of proposals for\nextensions or improvements
    to email have run into trouble with a\nside-effect of mail relaying.  In the current
    Internet Mail model, every SMTP server is required to break strict layering by
    inserting one or more additional 'trace' headers into the message headers which
    are actually part of the SMTP payload.  Since the headers are\naltered in transit,
    header-signing is not an available option, various\nanti-spam and internationalization
    strategies are infeasible or much\nmore complex, and so on.  This document proposes
    to change the\nInternet mail model to place the in-transit trace information in
    the\nenvelope, removing the requirement that relaying systems modify the\nmessage
    payload.\n\n\t "

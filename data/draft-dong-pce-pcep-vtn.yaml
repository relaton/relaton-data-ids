  content: "   With the introduction and evolvement of 5G and other network\n   scenarios,
    some existing or new customers may require connectivity\n   services with advanced
    characteristics comparing to traditional\n   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
    \ Such kind of network service is\n   called enhanced VPNs (VPN+).  The typical
    application of VPN+ is to\n   provide network slice services.\n\n   A Virtual
    Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which\n   consists of a
    set of dedicated or shared network resources allocated\n   from the physical underlay
    network, and is associated with a\n   customized logical network topology.  VPN+
    services can be delivered\n   by mapping one or a group of overlay VPNs to the
    appropriate VTNs as\n   the virtual underlay.  Then traffic flows of the VPN+
    service can be\n   steered onto the TE paths within the VTN.\n\n   The Path Computation
    Element (PCE) provides path computation\n   functions in support of traffic engineering
    in Multi-protocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS), Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) and Segment
    Routing (SR)\n   networks.\n\n   This document specifies the extensions to PCE
    communication Protocol\n   (PCEP) to carry VTN information in the PCEP messages.
    \ The extensions\n   in this document can be used in the basic PCE computation,
    the\n   stateful PCE and the PCE-initiated LSP mechanisms to indicate path\n   computation,
    path status report and path initialization within a\n   specific VTN.\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to\n   bridge
    the gap between network and applications by provisioning\n   network related information.
    \ This allows applications to make\n   informed decisions, for example when selecting
    a target host from a\n   set of candidates.  The ALTO problem statement [RFC5693]
    considers\n   typical applications as file sharing, real-time communication and\n
    \  live streaming peer-to-peer networks.  Recently other use cases\n   focused
    on Content Distribution Networks and Data Centers have\n   emerged [draft-jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases-01].\n\n
    \  The present draft proposes to extend the cost information provided by\n   the
    ALTO protocol.  The purpose is to broaden the decision\n   possibilities of applications
    to not only decide 'where' to connect\n   to, but also 'when' to connect.  This
    is useful to applications that\n   have a degree of freedom on when to schedule
    data transfers, such as\n   non-instantaneous data replication between data centers.
    \ The draft\n   therefore specifies a new cost mode, called the \"schedule\" mode.
    \ In\n   this mode the ALTO server offers cost maps that contain link ratings\n
    \  that are valid for a given timeframe (e.g. hourly) for a period of\n   time
    (e.g. a day).  Besides the functional time-shift enhancement\n   providing multi-timeframe
    cost values the extansion also allows the\n   saving of a number of ALTO transactions
    and thus resources on the\n   ALTO server and clients.\n\n\n\t "

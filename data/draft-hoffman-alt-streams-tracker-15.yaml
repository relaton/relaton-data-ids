  content: "This document describes extending the IETF Datatracker to capture and
    display the progression of Internet-Drafts that are intended to be published as
    RFCs by the IAB, IRTF, or Independent Submissions Editor.  The states and annotations
    that are to be added to the Datatracker will be applied to Internet-Drafts as
    soon as any of these streams identify the Internet-Draft as a potential eventual
    RFC, and will continue through the lifetime of the Internet-Draft.  The goal of
    adding this information to the Datatracker is to give the whole Internet community
    more information about the status of these Internet-Drafts and the streams from
    which they originate.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

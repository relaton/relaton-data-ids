  content: "We compare the service received by TCP and UDP flows when they share\neither
    a link or an MPLS traffic trunk. Since traffic trunks allow non\nshortest path
    links also to be used, the total network throughput goes\nup with proper traffic
    engineering.  If UDP and TCP flows are mixed in a\ntrunk, TCP flows receive reduced
    service as the UDP flows increase their\nrates.  Also, we found that in order
    to benefit from traffic\nengineering, MPLS trunks should be implemented end-to-end
    (first router\nto last router). If some part of the network is MPLS-unaware, the\nbenefits
    are reduced or eliminated.\n\n\n\t "

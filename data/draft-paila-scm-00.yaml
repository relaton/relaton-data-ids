  content: "Traditionally, multicast trees in the Internet are built bottom-up.\nThe
    construction of multicast trees depends on the multicast\nreceivers's ability
    to inform their next hop multicast routers about\ntheir multicast group memberships.
    There are cases, in which the\ntraditional host-driven way of building the multicast
    trees is\ninsufficient. To point out one, consider an access network with\nunidirectional
    links. In a mobile environment, this requires that the\nreceiving interface of
    a mobile node must also have the capabilities\nto send out MLD or IGMP responses.
    This is not possible for broadcast\nnetworks (e.g DVB-T and DAB), that provide
    high downstream data\nrates, but no uplink connectivity.\nThis document presents
    Source Controlled Multicast as a proposal\nsolution to overcome the problems with
    unidirectional links. It\npresents a way to for source to control the multicast
    tree joining\nprocess on behalf of mobile nodes behind unidirectional links.\n\n\t "

  content: "Consider a service provider network that offers Optical Virtual \nPrivate
    Network (OVPN) service. An important goal in the OVPN \nservice is the ability
    to support what is known as _single end \nprovisioning_, where addition of a new
    port to a given OVPN would \ninvolve configuration/provisioning changes only on
    the devices \nconnected to that port. Another important goal in the OVPN service
    \nis the ability to establish/terminate an optical connection between \na pair
    of (existing) ports within an OVPN without involving \nconfiguration/provisioning
    changes in any of the provider devices. \nIn this document we describe a set of
    mechanisms that accomplishes \nthese goals.\n\t "

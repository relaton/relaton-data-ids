  content: "The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to manipulate
    configuration datastores.  However, client applications often need to be aware
    of common events, such as a change in NETCONF server capabilities, that may impact
    management applications.  Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring
    of the base system events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a
    YANG module that allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for some common
    system events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

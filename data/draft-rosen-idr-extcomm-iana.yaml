  content: "   This document reorganizes the IANA Registries for the type values and\n
    \  sub-type values of BGP Extended Communities attribute and the BGP\n   IPv6-Address-Specific
    Extended Communities attribute.  This is done\n   in order to remove inter-dependencies
    among the registries, thus\n   making it easier for IANA to determine which codepoints
    are available\n   for assignment in which registries.  This document also clarifies
    the\n   information that must be provided to IANA when requesting an\n   allocation
    from one or more of these registries.  These changes are\n   compatible with the
    existing allocations, and thus do not affect\n   protocol implementations.  The
    changes will however impact the \"IANA\n   Considerations\" sections of future
    protocol specifications.  This\n   document updates RFCs 4360 and 5701.\n\n\n\t "

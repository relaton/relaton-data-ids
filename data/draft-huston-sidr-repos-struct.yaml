  content: "This document defines a profile for the structure of repositories\nthat
    contain X.509 / PKIX Resource Certificates, Certificate\nRevocation Lists and
    signed objects.  This profile contains the\nproposed object naming scheme, the
    contents of repository publication\npoints, the contents of publication point
    manifests and a possible\ninternal structure of a Repository Cache that is intended
    to\nfacilitate synchronization across a distributed collection of\nrepositories
    and facilitate certificate path construction.\n\t "

  content: "   As the connected car and autonomous car technologies grows, many car\n
    \  manufacturers are interested in in-vehicle infotainment (IVI)\n   services.
    \ In addition, car-sharing services are expected to attract\n   attention in the
    future automotive industry.  The devices and\n   contents in the car are frequently
    used not only by the car owner but\n   also by others.  Automobile manufacturers
    are currently researching\n   on developing their own IVI service platforms.  Contrary
    to these\n   trends, however, IVI services present a risk that anyone can access\n
    \  the IVI services and lack scalability with other manufacturers.\n\n   In this
    document, we introduce the system which provide the basic\n   function that can
    be commonly used in IVI services growing very\n   rapidly.  This system is consisting
    of master, device and user.  This\n   system Users are categorized into different
    types, and services\n   provided by devices have different levels.  These are
    registered and\n   managed by master.  So, users are delivered different services\n
    \  according to user type.  In addition, devices can be dynamically\n   registered
    and deregistered to the master.\n\n\t "

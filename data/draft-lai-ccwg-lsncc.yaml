  content: "   This document provides a performance analysis on various congestion\n
    \  control algorithms(CCAs) in an operational low-earth orbit (LEO)\n   satellite
    network (LSN).  Internet CCAs are expected to perform well\n   in any Internet
    path, including those paths with LEO satellite links.\n   Our analysis results
    reveal that existing CCAs struggle to deal with\n   the drastic network variations
    caused by the mobility of LEO\n   satellites, resulting in poor link utilization
    or high latency.\n   Further, this document discusses the key challenges of achieving
    high\n   throughput and low latency for end-to-end connections over an LSN,\n
    \  and provides useful information when the LSN-specific congestion\n   control
    principles for the Internet is standardized in the future.\n\n\t "

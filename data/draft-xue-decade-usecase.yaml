  content: "   The objective of DECADE is to provide storage access to Content\n   Distribution
    Applications to improve their efficiency and reduce load\n   on the network infrastructure.\n\n
    \  In this document, we outline several potential use cases (not\n   technical
    solutions) for DECADE.  These use cases may provide\n   motivations for DECADE.
    \ Interactions within DECADE and between\n   DECADE Servers and DECADE Clients
    are described at an abstract level\n   so as to not constrain future protocol
    development.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines the hierarchical P2P-SIP architecture, which\nmakes
    the combination of P2P and SIP practical.  In this\narchitecture, heterogeneous
    overlays are inter-connected via a\ndecentralized manner provided by the hierarchical
    P2P-SIP\narchitecture.  The overhead of the session control process is reduced\nsince
    the P2P overlay is used by SIP as the underlying peer locating\napproach.  Some
    nodes in the overlay are proposed to be stateful to\nimprove the reliability of
    the overlay.  Finally, a session initial\nexample is presented to illustrate this
    architecture.This work is\nbeing discussed on the p2psip@cs.columbia.edu mailing
    list.\n\t "

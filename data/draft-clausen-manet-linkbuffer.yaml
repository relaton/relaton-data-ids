  content: "   A number of MANET routing protocols employ the ability to temporarily\n
    \  buffer undeliverable IP datagrams until a route to a destination\n   becomes
    available. This is indeed the case for reactive protocols,\n   which largely are
    based on the ability to store an undeliverable IP\n   datagram while a route discovery
    operation is carried out. Current\n   specifications of proactive routing-protocols
    do, however, also\n   indiate that they may benefit from such a mechanism: while
    a local\n   link breakage may imply that a selected route to a given destination\n
    \  breaks, buffering an undeliverable IP datagram may allow a local\n   topology
    discovery mechanism to select an alternative route.\n\n\n   This document describes
    a generic mechanism for buffering IP\n   datagrams in MANETs. The mechanism is
    based on the idea that while a\n   local link may make a route to a destination
    fail, it does not imply\n   that an alternative route to that destination is not
    available.\n   Hence, IP datagrams for transmission along that route are buffered
    to\n   allow the routing protocol time to construct an alternative route.\n   The
    IP datagram is discarded only if the routing protocol hasnâ\"À\"Ùt been\n   able
    to provide an alternative route within a determined small delay.\n\n   We note,
    that this specification does not mandate a required behavior\n   for MANET routing
    protocols. Rather, since the mechanisms currently\n   employed in the four existing
    MANET routing protocol specification\n   are similar in what they try to accomplish,
    it is the goal of this\n   specification to generalize and expand on these mechanisms,
    thereby\n   provide a framework for (i) discussing and refining the mechanism
    in\n   isolation and (ii) providing a common element, which may be usefull\n   for
    multiple MANET routing protocols.\n\t "

  content: "The early Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) documents defined the form
    of the MPLS label stack entry. This includes a three-bit field called the \"EXP
    field\". The exact use of this field was not defined by these documents, except
    to state that it was to be \"reserved for experimental use\".\n\n Although the
    intended use of the EXP field was as a \"Class of Service\" (CoS) field, it was
    not named a CoS field by these early documents because the use of such a CoS field
    was not considered to be sufficiently defined. Today a number of standards documents
    define its usage as a CoS field.\n\n To avoid misunderstanding about how this
    field may be used, it has become increasingly necessary to rename this field.
    This document changes the name of the field to the \"Traffic Class field\" (\"TC
    field\"). In doing so, it also updates documents that define the current use of
    the EXP field. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

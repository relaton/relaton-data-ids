  content: "   The current BGP-4 protocol specification [RFC4271] states that the\n
    \  selection process chooses the best path for a given route which is\n   added
    to the Loc-Rib and advertised to all peers.\n\n   Previous versions [RFC1771]
    of the specification defined a different\n   rule for Internal BGP Updates.  Given
    that Internal paths are not re-\n   advertised to Internal peers, it was specified
    that the best of the\n   external paths, as determined by the path selection tie
    breaking\n   algorithm, would be advertised to Internal peers.\n\n   This document
    extends that procedure to operate in environments where\n   Route Reflection [RFC4456]
    or Confederations [RFC5065] are used and\n   explains why advertising the additional
    routing information can\n   improve convergence time without causing routing loops.\n\n
    \  Additional benefits include reduction of inter-domain churn and\n   avoidance
    of permanent route oscillation.\n\n\t "

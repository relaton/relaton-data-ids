  content: "   As stated in the MEXT charter, the working group will \"work on\n   operational
    considerations on setting up Mobile IPv6 networks so that\n   traffic is distributed
    in an optimal way\".  This topic, referred to\n   as Distributed Mobility Management
    (DMM), has motivated the\n   submission of multiple problem statement and solution
    drafts.  This\n   document aims at summarizing the current status of the DMM effort,\n
    \  mainly focusing on Mobile IPv6-based solutions, in order to initiate\n   more
    discussions within the working group.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document investigates the benefits of cross-area work in the\n
    \  IETF.  It is examines existing cross-area work and identifies other\n   possibilities
    for work that spans more than one area.  The intention\n   is to help community
    members who focus their work within a specific\n   area to understand related
    work in other areas and to motivate\n   efficient cooperation across different
    areas in the IETF.\n\n\n\t "

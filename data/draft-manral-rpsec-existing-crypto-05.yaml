  content: "Routing protocols are designed to use cryptographic mechanisms to \n   authenticate
    data being received from a neighboring router to ensure \n   that it has not been
    modified in transit, and actually originated \n   from the neighboring router
    purporting to have originating the data.  \n   Most of the cryptographic mechanisms
    defined to date rely on hash \n   algorithms applied to the data in the routing
    protocol packet, which \n   means the data is transported, in the clear, along
    with a signature \n   based on the data itself.  These mechanisms rely on the
    manual \n   configuration of the keys used to seed, or build, these hash based
    \n   signatures.  This document outlines some of the problems with manual \n   keying
    of these cryptographic algorithms.\n\t "

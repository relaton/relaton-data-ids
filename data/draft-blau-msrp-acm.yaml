- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs.\nThe
    model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975\nand RFC4976,
    in that it uses SDP in a more conventional way when it\ncomes to conveying endpoint
    address information, and also uses\nmainstream mechanisms for NAT traversal instead
    of using MSRP relays.\n\t "

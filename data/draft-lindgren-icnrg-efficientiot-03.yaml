abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the tradeoffs involved in utilizing Information
    Centric Networking (ICN) for the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. It describes
    the contexts and applications where the IoT would benefit from ICN, and where
    a host-centric approach would be better. The requirements imposed by the heterogeneous
    nature of IoT networks are discussed (e.g., in terms of connectivity, power availability,
    computational and storage capacity). Design choices are then proposed for an IoT
    architecture to handle these requirements, while providing efficiency and scalability.
    An objective is to not require any IoT specific changes of the ICN architecture
    per se, but we do indicate some potential modifications of ICN that would improve
    efficiency and scalability for IoT and other applications. This document mainly
    serves as a problem statement and will not present a conclusive architecture design.
    It can be used as a basis for further discussion and to design architectures for
    the IoT.</p>"

  content: "   This Internet-Draft presents a new scheme that enables the\n   simultaneous
    re-authentication of a group of nodes in an efficient\n   manner. The Internet-Draft
    proposes to aggregate the re-\n   authentications of multiple network nodes members
    of the same group.\n   The scheme is based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP)\n   framework, defined in RFC 3748. As an example of operation, a method\n
    \  inspired from EAP-GPSK RFC 5433, is provided.\n\n\t "

  content: "Packet delay variation metrics appear in many different standards\ndocuments.
    \ The metric definition in RFC 3393 has considerable\nflexibility, and it allows
    multiple formulations of delay variation\nthrough the specification of different
    packet selection functions.\n\nAlthough flexibility provides wide coverage and
    room for new ideas,\nit can make comparisons of independent implementations more\ndifficult.
    \ Two different formulations of delay variation have come\ninto wide use in the
    context of active measurements.  This memo\nexamines a range of circumstances
    for active measurements of delay\nvariation and their uses, and recommends which
    of the two forms is\nbest matched to particular conditions and tasks.\n\t "

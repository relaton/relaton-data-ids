  script: Latn
  content: "The small (16-bit) size of the DNS transaction ID has made it a\n   frequent
    target for forgery, with the unhappy result of many cache\n   pollution vulnerabilities
    demonstrated throughout Internet history.\n   Even with perfectly and unpredictably
    random transaction ID's, random\n   and birthday attacks are still theoretically
    feasible.  This document\n   describes a method by which an initiator can improve
    transaction\n   identity using the 0x20 bit in DNS labels.\n\t "

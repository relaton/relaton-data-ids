  content: "   IGP Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algo) provides a mechanism for IGP nodes\n
    \  to compute the best paths according to a set of constraints in both\n   the
    topology and computation metrics.  Segment Routing over IPv6\n   (SRv6) can be
    used as one of the data plane of IGP Flex-Algo.\n\n   In SRv6 networks, services
    may be carried across multiple network\n   domains which are under the same administration.
    \ For some services,\n   it is expected that the an end-to-end inter-domain path
    can be\n   computed according to the same constraints (such as low latency)\n
    \  defined by Flex-Algo.\n\n   This document describes BGP extensions to advertise
    SRv6 locators as\n   IPv6 prefixes, together with the associated algorithm across
    the AS\n   boundary.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document presents a new TCP loss detection algorithm called RACK\n
    \  (\"Recent ACKnowledgment\").  RACK uses the notion of time, instead of\n   packet
    or sequence counts, to detect losses, for modern TCP\n   implementations that
    can support per-packet timestamps and the\n   selective acknowledgment (SACK)
    option.  It is intended to replace\n   the conventional DUPACK threshold approach
    and its variants, as well\n   as other nonstandard approaches.\n\n\t "

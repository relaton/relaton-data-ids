  content: "   Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting the\n   design
    of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, \"what\n   network will best
    fit these needs?\"  A part of fitting network design\n   to requirements is the
    problem of complexity, an idea often measured\n   by \"seat of pants\" methods.
    \ When would adding a particular protocol,\n   policy, or configuration be \"too
    complex?\"  This document suggests a\n   series of continuums along which network
    complexity might be\n   measured.  No suggestions are made in measuring complexity
    for each\n   of these continuums are provided; this is left for future documents.\n\n\t "

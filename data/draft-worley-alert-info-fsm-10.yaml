  script: Latn
  content: "The \"alert\" namespace of Uniform Resource Names (URNs) can be used in
    the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests and
    responses to inform a voice over IP (VoIP) telephone (user agent) of the characteristics
    of the call that the user agent has originated or terminated. The user agent must
    resolve the URNs into a signal; that is, it must select the best available signal
    to present to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call.\n\n RFC 7462
    describes a non-normative algorithm for signal selection. This document describes
    a more efficient alternative algorithm: a user agent's designer can, based on
    the user agent's signals and their meanings, construct a finite state machine
    (FSM) to process the URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions
    given in the definition of the \"alert\" URN namespace.\n\t "

  content: "   This draft describes a specific problem encountered when  using  RSVP\n
    \  (Resource  Reservation  Protocol)  over  optimised  routes  in  MIPv6\n   (Mobile
    IP Version 6). The address translation in the  MIP's  binding\n   cache creates
    a mismatch between the flow-id of the packets sent from\n   correspondent node
    to mobile node and the flow-id signalled by RSVP.\n\n   We discuss several solutions
    to this problem: (1) By  modifying  RSVP\n   at  mobile  and correspondent nodes
    to become aware of MIPv6 address-\n   ing, we provide a simple repair that allows
    RSVP flows  to  be  esta-\n   blished  between  the  fixed  network  and  mobiles;
    \ (2a)  By adding\n   optional objects to RSVP messages, a performance enhancement
    is  pro-\n   posed  to  make handovers smooth and seamless; (2b) A different tech-\n
    \  nique with the same goal is called flow  extension  and  it  provides\n   flows
    \ with fixed flow-ids from the correspondent node into the wire-\n   less access
    network at the expense of forwarding traffic  inside  the\n   access network,
    whenever the mobile node moves.\n \n   We conclude that the minimal solution (1)
    is a requirement  in  order\n   to  make  MIPv6 and RSVP interoperable; our favored
    approach requires\n   only minor changes to the correspondent and mobile  node's
    \ RSVP  and\n   MIP  specification.   However,  for well performing and uninterrupted\n
    \  operation we strongly recommend one of the solutions (2a or 2b)  that\n   support
    \ fast  re-establishment  or preservation of resource reserva-\n   tions when
    mobile nodes move.\n\n\t "

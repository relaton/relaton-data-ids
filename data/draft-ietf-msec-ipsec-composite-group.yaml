  content: "   The Multicast IP Security extension architecture [Weis] implicitly
    \n   assumes a basic group endpoint population that shares homogeneous \n   cryptographic
    capabilities and security policies. In practice, large-\n   scale cryptographic
    groups may contain a heterogeneous endpoint \n   population that can not be accommodated
    by that basic multicast IPsec \n   architecture. For example, some endpoints may
    not have been upgraded \n   to handle the successor algorithm for one that is
    being retired (e.g. \n   SHA1 transition to SHA-ng). Group deployments that span
    multiple \n   legal jurisdictions may have a different security policy in each
    \n   jurisdiction (e.g. key strength). This document defines the \n   \"composite
    cryptographic group\" IP security architecture capability. \n   A composite cryptographic
    group allows multicast IPsec applications \n   to transparently interact with
    the single logical group that is \n   formed by the union of one or more basic
    cryptographic groups. \n\n\t "

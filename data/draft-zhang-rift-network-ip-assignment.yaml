  content: "   IP assignment is always a big challenge in the construction of an\n
    \  enterprise-scale data center. For two interfaces connected by a\n   cable,
    if their assigned IP addresses do not belong to a same subnet,\n   data then cannot
    be transmitted via this cable. An error in a cable\n   connection could make the
    IP addresses of the cable's two ends not in\n   a same subnet, resulting in a
    reduction in network throughout.\n   Furthermore, it is difficult to find and
    repair this error connection\n   among numerous cables. A method to address this
    error in switch\n   connection would save a great amount of time and cost in modern
    data\n   center construction. Here, this draft introduces an approach to\n   assign
    the IP addresses automatically for two connected switches,\n   which allows data
    to be transmitted via a cable that is connecting\n   two arbitrary interfaces
    from two switches.\n\n\n\t "

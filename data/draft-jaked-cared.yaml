  content: "   Some encrypted DNS clients require anonymity from their encrypted DNS\n
    \  servers to prevent third parties from correlating client DNS queries\n   with
    other data for surveillance or data mining purposes.  However,\n   there are cases
    where the client and server have a pre-existing\n   relationship and each wants
    to prove its identity to the other.  For\n   example, an encrypted DNS server
    may only wish to accept queries from\n   encrypted DNS clients that are managed
    by the same enterprise, and an\n   encrypted DNS client may need to confirm the
    identity of the\n   encrypted DNS server it is communicating with.  This requires
    mutual\n   authentication.\n\n   This document discusses the circumstances under
    which client\n   authentication is appropriate to use with encrypted DNS, the
    benefits\n   and limitations of doing so, and recommends authentication mechanisms\n
    \  to be used when communicating with TLS-based encrypted DNS protocols.\n\n\t "

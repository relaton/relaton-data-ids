  content: "   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 in RFC 2616 uses the\n
    \  100-Continue status message with Expect: Continue header to send\n   request
    body at a later time to the origin server.  This memo\n   explains how to extend
    this status message to send multiple responses\n   from the origin server to the
    client for an extended period of time.\n   This achieves the essential function
    of broadcast from the origin\n   server to the client, without the client waiting
    for a response to a\n   request.\n\n\t "

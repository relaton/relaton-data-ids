  content: "   The presence of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)\n
    \  would render state-of-the-art, public-key cryptography deployed today\n   obsolete,
    since all the assumptions about the intractability of the\n   mathematical problems
    that offer confident levels of security today\n   no longer apply in the presence
    of a CRQC.  This means there is a\n   requirement to update protocols and infrastructure
    to use post-\n   quantum algorithms, which are public-key algorithms designed
    to be\n   secure against CRQCs as well as classical computers.  These new\n   public-key
    algorithms behave similarly to previous public key\n   algorithms, however the
    intractable mathematical problems have been\n   carefully chosen so they are hard
    for CRQCs as well as classical\n   computers.  This document explains why engineers
    need to be aware of\n   and understand post-quantum cryptography.  It emphasizes
    the\n   potential impact of CRQCs on current cryptographic systems and the\n   need
    to transition to post-quantum algorithms to ensure long-term\n   security.  The
    most important thing to understand is that this\n   transition is not like previous
    transitions from DES to AES or from\n   SHA-1 to SHA-2.  While drop-in replacement
    may be possible in some\n   cases, others will require protocol re-design to accommodate\n
    \  significant differences in behavior between the new post-quantum\n   algorithms
    and the classical algorithms that they are replacing.\n\n\t "

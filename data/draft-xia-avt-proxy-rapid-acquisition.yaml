  content: "This document describes a proxy rapid acquisition mechanism which\nreduces
    acquisition delay for an RTP receiver without supporting any\nrapid acquisition
    related functionality.  The network is responsible\nfor managing rapid acquisition
    on behalf of the RTP receiver,\nincluding detecting SFGMP message as proxy specified
    in [RFC4605]\nfrom the RTP receiver and launching the required rapid acquisition\nsignaling
    instead of the RTP receiver.  This proxy rapid acquisition\nof multicast RTP session
    in this document is referred to as Proxy\nRapid Acquisition of Multicast Sessions.\n\t "

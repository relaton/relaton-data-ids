  content: "   In the context of a Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE), hosts\n
    \  could frequently be energy-constrained and be turned off the vast\n   majority
    of time for energy-saving purposes.\n\n   In the case of a CoAP server, while
    it is offline, it is neither\n   available to serve requests.  Clients desiring
    to access its\n   resources have no way to understand when they will find it up
    again.\n\n   This specification provides a simple new message that gives to a
    CoAP\n   server the ability to signal its current availability in the network.\n\n\t "

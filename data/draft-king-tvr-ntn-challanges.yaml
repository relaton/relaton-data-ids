  content: "   Advanced networks, including the Internet, will utilise an increasing\n
    \  amount of Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) infrastructure. NTNs include\n   Low
    Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE)\n   aviation,
    and High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS). In addition,\n   NTN infrastructure
    will facilitate the deployment of advanced 5G use\n   cases and services.\n\n
    \  NTNs infrastructure is typically mobile, with various links and nodes\n   operating
    at different altitudes and latencies. Some NTN nodes and\n   links are temporal
    and need to be scheduled and established at\n   specific times based on line-of-sight
    availability, traffic demand\n   and power budgets.\n\n   This document summarises
    time variant NTN requirements and\n   challenges not met by existing routing and
    traffic engineering\n   techniques.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Sometimes an IP multicast distribution tree (MDT) traverses both\n
    \  MPLS-enabled and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network.  Typically\n   the
    MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an\n   MPLS region.
    \ In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the\n   MDT as a pure IP MDT,
    then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint LSP\n   (Label Switched Path) when it enters
    an MPLS-enabled region, and then\n   convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it
    enters a non-MPLS-enabled\n   region.  [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling]
    specifies the\n   procedures for building such a hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent\n
    \  Multicast (PIM) as the control protocol in the non-MPLS region of the\n   network,
    and using Multipoint Extensions to Label Distribution\n   Protocol (mLDP) in the
    MPLS region.  This document extends those\n   procedures so that they will work
    when the links between the MPLS and\n   non-MPLS regions are [RFC4364] interfaces.
    \ While these procedures do\n   not provide a good general multicast VPN solution,
    they are useful in\n   certain specific situations.\n\n\t "

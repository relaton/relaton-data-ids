- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "With the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space, large-scale\nISPs
    are now facing the option to deploy IPv6 in a timely manner.\nHowever, most existing
    IPv6 transition solutions have tradeoff\nbetween scalability and efficiency. This
    draft proposes a lightweight\naddress family transition mechanism named LAFT6.
    It only needs to\nmaintain per-subscriber state entries in core network and there
    is no\nspecific address format requirement for users' IPv6 address. It is a\nlightweight
    solution in terms of state-management, addressing and\nrouting. The experimental
    results have shown that LAFT6 is scalable\nand can be rapidly deployed in commercial
    ISP network.\n\t "

  content: "This document provides a definition for encapsulating the PPP\nprotocol
    directly on the various full duplex point-to-point Ethernet\nphysical layers.
    The later includes transmission bit rates of\n10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps, and 10Gbps.
    Note this is a distinct protocol\nfrom PPPoE, as the Ethernet frame is not existent
    here.  All PPP\npacket semantics and syntax are retained. The proposed methods
    in\nthis document may be especially useful for low cost, high bandwidth\nphysical
    channel implementations. In particular it specifies and\nredefines all necessary
    Ethernet Medium Independent Interface\nfunctional 'clauses.'\n\t "

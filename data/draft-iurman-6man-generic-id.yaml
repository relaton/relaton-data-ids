  script: Latn
  content: "   Some recent use cases have a need for carrying an identifier in IPv6\n
    \  packets.  While those drafts might perfectly make sense on their own,\n   each
    document requires IANA to allocate a new code point for a new\n   option, and
    so for very similar situations, which could quickly\n   exhaust the allocation
    space if similar designs are proposed in the\n   future.  As an example, one might
    need an 8-bit ID, while another one\n   might need a 32-bit, 64-bit or 128-bit
    ID.  Or, even worse, one might\n   need a 32-bit ID in a specific context, while
    someone else might also\n   need a 32-bit ID in another context.  Therefore, allocating
    a new\n   code point for each similar option is probably not the way to go.\n\n\t "

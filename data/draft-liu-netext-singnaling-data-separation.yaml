- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The mobility management signaling of PMIPv6 includes PBU/PBA message.\nBoth
    messages use the IPv6 mobility header, which is an expansion of\nIPv6 header,
    to carry signaling information. The transport protocol\nhas not been used, which
    can not guarantee the reliability of\ntransmission. This draft proposes to extend
    PMIP to make it has\ntransport protocol support and negotiation mechanism. The
    advantage\nof this extension is that transport protocol can provide more\nreliable
    transportation especially in the scenario that MAG and LMA\nare connected by a
    congested IP network.\n\t "

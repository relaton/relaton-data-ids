abstract:
- content: "<p>CoRE defines a mechanism for resource discovery based on Web linking
    with discovery, registration,modification, and other procedures. But energy efficiency
    is very important for resource constrained devices. This specification shows an
    efficient method for CoAP proxy finding the resource from end-points by reducing
    multicast messages. The current version -01 of this document is just an initial
    draft that is modified according to related comments.</p>"

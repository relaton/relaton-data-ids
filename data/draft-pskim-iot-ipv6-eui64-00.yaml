  content: "   An IoT-specific IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration is\n   suggested
    for diverse types of IoT devices. Both domain type and\n   device type are defined
    and combined with 16-bit hexadecimal number,\n   which is called the IoT type
    identifier. Then, this IoT type\n   identifier is reflected in generating EUI-64
    for each IoT device. An\n   IoT-specific IPv6 address is developed using the stateless
    address\n   autoconfiguration with the network prefix and the modified EUI-64.\n\n\t "

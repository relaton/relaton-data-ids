  content: "HTTP 1.1 [2] defines 20 status codes: 100-101, 200-206, 300-305, \n400-415,
    and 500-505.  The WebDAV RFC [3] adds six more: 102, 207, \n422, 423, 424 and
    507.  However, WebDAV implementers have found this \nto be insufficient.  The
    space of status codes available is limited, \nbut even if it were not, additional
    information would often be very \nhelpful.  WebDAV clients frequently need to
    be able to present \ndistinct options and helpful information to users, and sometimes
    \ncients might even be able to deal with errors automatically.\n\t "

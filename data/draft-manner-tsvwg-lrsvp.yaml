  content: "Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reserved\nresources
    in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if the\ncorrespondent node does not
    support QoS, it would be useful to be\nable to reserve at least local resources
    at the access network, e.g.,\nwireless link resources. Additionally, for mobile
    nodes the\ncontinuity of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signaling or slow\nre-reservations
    of resources after each handover. This draft proposes\na simple enhancement to
    RSVP, so that initial resource reservations\nand re-reservations, e.g., due to
    host mobility can be done locally\nin an access network.\n\n\t "

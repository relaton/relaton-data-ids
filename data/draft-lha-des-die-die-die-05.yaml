  content: "A long long time ago Data Encryption Standard (DES) was standardized.\nSome
    30 years later (2003) is was withdrawn as a standard by National\nInstitute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST), today 6 years later,\nits time for DES to finally
    die.  By 2008 it was possible to brute\nforce DES keys in 6.4 days using less
    than USD 10k worth of hardware.\nSo by 2008 DES had passed its sell-by date.  This
    document updates\nRFC1964, RFC4120, and RFC4121 to deprecate the use of DES in\nKerberos.
    \ Because the version of Kerberos specified in RFC1510 only\nsupports DES and
    has been replaced by RFC4120, RFC1510 is\nreclassified as historic.\n\t "

  content: "   The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working\n
    \  group is defining mechanisms to monitor network performance of large-\n   scale
    networks.  The use case will describe how very large enterprise\n   networks are
    not very different from the networks considered by other\n   LMAP use cases and
    that most measurements are useful to both use\n   cases.  In addition this use
    case will state the need for the ability\n   to have finer grained observation
    related to User Experience\n   potentially on a per application basis.\n\n\n\t "

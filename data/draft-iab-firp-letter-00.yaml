  content: "The Draft Report of the U.S. Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel
    (FIRP) has been posted and comments requested. Individual responses from ISOC/IETF
    members are encouraged. However, it is desirable to have a coordinated response
    from the Internet Society, IAB, and IESG.  Note that responses are due by February
    18.                                          This Internet Draft is a draft letter
    from Vint Cerf, Christian Huitema, and Phill Gross and is meant to be that coordinated
    response.\n\t "

  content: "   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n   communication
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.  For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular defined
    the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP, where each data channel
    might be used to\n   transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.  Data channel
    setup\n   can be done using either the in-band WebRTC Data Channel protocol or\n
    \  some external (in-band or out-of-band) negotiation.  This document\n   specifies
    how the SDP offer/answer exchange can be used to achieve\n   such an external
    negotiation.\n\n\t "

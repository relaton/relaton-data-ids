  content: "   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin\n
    \  authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital\n   signatures.
    \ These digital signatures can be verified by building a\n   chain-of-trust starting
    from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a\n   particular node in the DNS.  This
    document specifies two different\n   ways for validating resolvers to signal to
    a server which keys are\n   referenced in their chain-of-trust.  The data from
    such signaling\n   allow zone administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers
    in a\n   DNSSEC-signed zone.\n\n   This document describes two independent methods
    for validating\n   resolvers to publish their referenced keys: an EDNS option
    and a\n   different DNS query.  The reason there are two methods instead of one\n
    \  is some people see significant problems with each method.  Having two\n   methods
    is clearly worse than having just one, but it is probably\n   better for the Internet
    than having no way to gain the information\n   from the resolvers.\n\n\t "

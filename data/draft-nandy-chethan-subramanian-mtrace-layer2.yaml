  content: "    This document describes extensions to IP multicast traceroute\n    facility,
    named Mtrace2 version 2 (Mtrace2), to include\n    traced path for Layer 2 multicast.
    Mtrace2 allows tracing the path\n    from Last-Hop Router (LHR) to a source. Tracing
    the Layer 2 path\n    from LHR  till the actual receivers requires special implementations\n
    \   on the part of switches in the Layer 2 path. This specification\n    describes
    the required functionality in multicast routers and\n    switches. This feature
    functions along with the Layer 2 multicast\n    protocols like IGMP (Internet
    Group Management Protocol) Snooping\n    and MLD(Multicast Listener Discovery)
    Snooping.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a set of enhancements to the Network News\n   Transport
    Protocol [NNTP-977] that allows full-text searching of\n   news articles in multiple
    newsgroups.  The proposed SEARCH command\n   supports functionality similar to
    the [IMAP4] SEARCH command, minus\n   user specific search keys (i.e., ANSWERED,
    DRAFT, FLAGGED, KEYWORD,\n   NEW, OLD, RECENT, SEEN) and minus search keys based
    on headers that\n   do not exist in news (i.e., CC, BCC, TO).\n\n   The availability
    of the extensions described here will be advertised\n   by the server using the
    extension negotiation-mechanism described in\n   the new NNTP protocol specification
    currently being developed [NNTP-\n   NEW].\n\t "

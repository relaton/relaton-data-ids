  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or\n
    \  green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-\n   BGP)now
    plays an important role in the transition of their Provider\n   (P) core network
    as well as Provider Edge (PE) Inter-AS peering\n   network from IPv4 to IPv6.
    \ Operators must have flexiblity to\n   continue to support IPv4 customers when
    both the Core and Edge\n   networks migrate to IPv6.  As well as must be able
    to support IPv6\n   networks in cases where operators decide to remain on an IPv4
    network\n   or during transition.\n\n   This document details the External BGP
    (eBGP) PE-PE Inter-AS and PE-\n   CE Edge peering IPv4-Only PE design where both
    IPv4 and IPv6 all\n   supported SAFI NLRI can be advertised over a single IPv4
    peer and\n   IPv6-Only PE Design where all supported SAFI NLRI can be advertised\n
    \  over a single IPv6 peer.\n\n   This document also defines a new IPv4 BGP next
    hop encoding standard\n   that uses an IPv4 address as the next hop and not an
    IPv4 mapped IPv6\n   address.\n\n   This document also provides vendor specific
    test cases for the\n   IPv4-Only peering design and IPv6-Only PE design as well
    as test\n   results for the four major vendors stakeholders in the routing and\n
    \  switching indusrty, Cisco, Juniper, Nokia and Huawei.  With the test\n   results
    provided for the IPv6-Only Edge peering design, the goal is\n   that all other
    vendors around the world that have not been tested\n   will begin to adopt and
    implement the design.\n\n\t "

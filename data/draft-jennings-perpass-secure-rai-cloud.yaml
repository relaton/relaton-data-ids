  content: "   The Internet technical community is looking at ways to address\n   pervasive
    attacks as described in several other internet drafts.\n   [I-D.barnes-pervasive-problem]
    describes threat model to characterize\n   various pervasive attacks on the Internet
    communications.  There are\n   many systems that need to be secured against such
    attacks but this\n   paper considers one possible way to secure cloud based collaborations\n
    \  systems.  At a high level, this paper sugests that users or\n   enterprises
    could run a key server that manages the keys to access\n   their content.  The
    cloud service provider would not have access to\n   decrypt the data stored in
    the cloud but various users of the cloud\n   service could get the keys to encrypt
    and decrypt the contents of\n   collaboration sessions facilitated by the cloud
    service.  This does\n   not protect the meta data of who is talking to who but
    can help\n   protect the content of the conversations.\n\n\t "

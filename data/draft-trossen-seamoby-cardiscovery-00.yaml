  content: "A critical requirement in the protocols being designed for seamless \nIP-level
    handovers, such as fast handover and context transfer, is \nthat the target access
    router (TAR) for the mobile node's (MN) \nhandover is known to the current access
    router (AR). The TAR needs to \nhave the capability set necessary to meet the
    MN's requirements, and \nmeet any local policy requirements. While the TAR selection
    process \nhappens at the time of handover, the ARs which have the capabilities
    \nto meet the MN's requirements can be identified in advance. These \nARs are
    called candidate access routers (CARs).\n\t "

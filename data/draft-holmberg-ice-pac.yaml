  script: Latn
  content: "   During the process of creating a peer-to-peer connection, ICE\n   implementations
    can encounter situations where they have no candidate\n   pairs to check, and,
    as a result, conclude that ICE processing has\n   failed.  However, because additional
    candidate pairs can be\n   discovered during ICE processing, declaring failure
    at this point may\n   be premature.  This document discusses when these situations
    can\n   occur and proposes a way to avoid premature failure.\n\n\t "

  content: "Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving, and, as a consequence,
    new equipment providing lambda switching capability has been developed and is
    currently being deployed.\n\n Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is a family of protocols
    that can be used to operate networks built from a range of technologies including
    wavelength (or lambda) switching. For this purpose, GMPLS defined a wavelength
    label as only having significance between two neighbors. Global wavelength semantics
    are not considered.\n\n In order to facilitate interoperability in a network composed
    of next generation lambda-switch-capable equipment, this document defines a standard
    lambda label format that is compliant with the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
    (DWDM) and Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) grids defined by the
    International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector.
    The label format defined in this document can be used in GMPLS signaling and routing
    protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

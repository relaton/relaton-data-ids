  content: "This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload format
    to be used for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec. The
    payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing VMR-WB transport
    formats on non-IP networks. A media type registration is included for VMR-WB RTP
    payload format.\n\n VMR-WB is a variable-rate multimode wideband speech codec
    that has a number of operating modes, one of which is interoperable with AMR-WB
    (i.e., RFC 3267) audio codec at certain rates. Therefore, provisions have been
    made in this document to facilitate and simplify data packet exchange between
    VMR-WB and AMR-WB in the interoperable mode with no transcoding function involved.

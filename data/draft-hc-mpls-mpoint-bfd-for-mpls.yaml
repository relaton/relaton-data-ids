  content: "   Recent proposals have extended the use of Bidirectional Forwarding\n
    \  Detection to detect data plane failures in multipoint networks.  One\n   desirable
    application of Multipoint BFD [MP-BFD] is to detect data\n   path failures in
    point-to-multipoint Label Switched Paths (P2MP\n   LSPs).  The scope of this document
    is to discuss the applicability of\n   multipoint BFD for fault detection in the
    data plane of P2MP LSPs.\n   The document extends the techniques and mechanisms
    mentioned in\n   [RFC5884] and applies them to MPLS P2MP environment.\n\n\t "

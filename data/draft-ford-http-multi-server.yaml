  content: "This document describes an extension to HTTP by which servers can\n   automatically
    inform clients of mirrors of resources.  Clients can\n   then simultaneously request
    segments of the resource from different\n   servers, enhancing both network and
    server utilisation, download\n   speeds, and thus user experience.\n\n\t "

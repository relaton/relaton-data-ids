  content: "   This document discusses the evolution of the Internet routing system\n
    \  beyond mere reachability.  We observe, through examples of past\n   development,
    that such evolution has been taking place to improve on\n   capabilities of the
    Internet, deal with more complicated network\n   deployments and cater to changing
    requirements by end users as well\n   as novel and emerging applications.\n\n
    \  For achieving a routing system that serves more than a singular\n   reachability
    purpose, more information is taken into account when\n   performing the purpose-specific
    functions.  Such extra information\n   can be obtained by extending current routing
    protocols to exchange\n   more information or by carrying that information within
    packets.\n\n   This document is intended to seed discussions of how the observed\n
    \  evolution of the Internet's routing system can continue, what issues\n   may
    occur when simply continuing the current approach for achieving\n   routing beyond
    'mere' reachability and what may be needed to address\n   those issues.  Ultimately,
    however, this document recognizes the\n   positive impact that moving beyond reachability
    has brought to the\n   Internet and will continue to do so.\n\n\t "

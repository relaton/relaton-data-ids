  content: "This document concludes the For Your Information (FYI) sub-series of RFCs,
    established by RFC 1150 for use by the IETF User Services Area, which no longer
    exists.  The IESG does not intend to make any further additions to this RFC sub-series,
    and this document provides a record of this decision.  This document also obsoletes
    RFC 1150 and changes the status of RFC 1150 to Historic.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client may\n   subscribe
    to an organization's public keylist to keep its keystore\n   up-to-date with correct
    keys from the correct keyserver(s), even in\n   cases where the keys correspond
    to multiple (potentially\n   uncontrolled) domains.  Ensuring that all members
    or followers of an\n   organization have their colleagues' most recent PGP public
    keys is\n   critical to maintaining operational security.  Without the most\n
    \  recent keys' fingerprints and a source of trust for those keys (as\n   this
    document specifies), users must manually update and sign each\n   others' keys
    -- a system that is untenable in larger organizations.\n   This document proposes
    a experimental format for the keylist file as\n   well as requirements for clients
    who wish to implement this\n   experimental keylist subscription functionality.\n\n\t "

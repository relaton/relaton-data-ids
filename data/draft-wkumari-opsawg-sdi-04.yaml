  content: "   Deploying a new network device often requires that an employee\n   physically
    travel to a datacenter to perform the initial install and\n   configuration, even
    in shared datacenters with \"smart-hands\" type\n   support.  In many cases, this
    could be avoided if there were a\n   standard, secure way to initially provision
    the devices.\n\n   This document extends existing auto-install / Zero-Touch Provisioning\n
    \  mechanisms to make the process more secure.\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside square
    brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information, answers to frequently
    asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be removed before publication.
    \ This document is\n   being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-\n
    \  wkumari-opsawg-sdi.  The most recent version of the document, open\n   issues,
    etc should all be available here.  The authors (gratefully)\n   accept pull requests.
    ]\n\n   [ Ed note: This document introduces concepts and serves as the basic\n
    \  for discussion - because of this, it is conversational, and would\n   need
    to be firmed up before being published ]\n\n\t "

  content: "Many IMAP clients display information about total number of messages/\ntotal
    number of unseen messages in IMAP mailboxes.  In order to do\nthat they are forced
    to issue a LIST or LSUB command, to list all\navailable mailboxes, followed by
    a STATUS command for each mailbox\nfound.  This document provides an extension
    to LIST command that\nallows the client to request STATUS information for mailboxes\ntogether
    with other information typically returned by the LIST\ncommand.Note\n\nA revised
    version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC\neditor as a Proposed
    Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion\nand suggestions for improvement
    are requested, and should be sent to\nmorg@ietf.org.\n\t "

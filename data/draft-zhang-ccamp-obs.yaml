  content: "Reliabilty is one of the essential requirements in data transmission\nnetwork.
    In the traditional IP/TCP network, TCP provides end to end\nreliable transmission.
    Due to the high burst loss probability in\nOptical Burst Switching (OBS) Network,
    if we leave the retransmission \nwork to the uppper IP/TCP layer, the network
    may be overloaded. \nBesides the simple retransmission in the IP/TCP network,
    OBS network \nwhich builds on Wavelength Division Mutiplexing system has a new
    \nretransmission scheme -- alternate wavelength retransmission. With \nthe information
    of network status collected in the edge nodes, \nretransmission in the OBS network
    is more efficient and delay is \nshorter. Also TCP and OBS retransmission can
    work together which is \ncalled multi-layer retransmission.  \n\n\t "

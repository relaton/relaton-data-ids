  content: "As an optical signal progresses along its path, it may be altered by the
    various physical processes in the optical fibers and devices it encounters. When
    such alterations result in signal degradation, these processes are usually referred
    to as \"impairments\". These physical characteristics may be important constraints
    to consider when using a GMPLS control plane to support path setup and maintenance
    in wavelength switched optical networks.\n\n This document provides a framework
    for applying GMPLS protocols and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture
    to support Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in wavelength
    switched optical networks. Specifically, this document discusses key computing
    constraints, scenarios, and architectural processes: routing, wavelength assignment,
    and impairment validation. This document does not define optical data plane aspects;
    impairment parameters; or measurement of, or assessment and qualification of,
    a route; rather, it describes the architectural and information components for
    protocol solutions. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

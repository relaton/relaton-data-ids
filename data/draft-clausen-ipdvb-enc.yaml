  content: "This document contains the Simple Encapsulation, a simple and lean \nencapsulation
    mechanism for the transport of IP Datagrams over ISO \nMPEG-2 Transport Streams
    (TS). The MPEG-2 TS has been widely accepted \nnot only for providing digital
    TV services, but also as a subnetwork \ntechnology for building IP networks. One
    example is the Digital Video \nBroadcast (DVB), specified by standards published
    by the European \nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).\n\t "

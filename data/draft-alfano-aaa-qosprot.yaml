  content: "   This document describes a Diameter application that performs\n   Authentication,
    Authorization, and Accounting for Quality of Service\n   (QoS) reservations.  This
    protocol is used by elements along the path\n   of a given application flow to
    authenticate a reservation request,\n   ensure that the reservation is authorized,
    and to account for\n   resources consumed during the lifetime of the application
    flow.\n   Clients that implement the Diameter QoS application contact an\n   authorizing
    entity/application server that is located somewhere in\n   the network, allowing
    for a wide variety of flexible deployment\n   models.\n\t "

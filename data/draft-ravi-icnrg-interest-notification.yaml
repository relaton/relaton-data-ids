  content: "   This draft proposes a new packet primitive called Notification for\n
    \  CCN.  Notification is a PUSH primitive and can be unicast or\n   multicast
    to multiple listening points.  Notifications do not expect\n   a Content Object
    response hence only requires the use of FIB state in\n   the CCN forwarder.  Emulating
    Notification as a PULL has performance\n   and routing implications.  The draft
    proposes a new fixed header\n   primitive called Notification and a CCN message
    encoding using\n   Content Object primitive to transport Notifications.  These\n
    \  discussions are presented in the context of CCNx1.0 [1] proposal.\n   The draft
    also provides discussions on various aspects related to\n   notification such
    as flow and congestion control, routing and\n   reliability considerations, and
    use case scenarios.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a pilot implementation of a protocol change\n
    \  within the IETF.  The essence of the change is to have workgroup\n   chairs
    handle the feedback of AD (Area Director) Evaluation comments\n   on a draft to
    the authors (and workgroup if necessary) and make sure\n   that needed draft changes
    are made, and the AD notified when a new\n   draft which resolves the comments
    is available.\n\t "

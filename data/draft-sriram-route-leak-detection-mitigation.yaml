  content: "   In [I-D.ietf-sriram-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have\n
    \  provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated\n   several
    types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine\n   which of those route-leak
    types are detected and mitigated by the\n   existing BGPSEC protocol [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol-09].
    \ Where\n   the current BGPSEC protocol doesn't offer a solution, this document\n
    \  suggests an enhancement that would extend the route-leak detection\n   and
    mitigation capability of BGPSEC.  The solution can be implemented\n   in BGP without
    necessarily tying it to BGPSEC.  Incorporating the\n   solution in BGPSEC is one
    way of implementing it in a secure way.  We\n   do not claim to have provided
    a solution for all possible types of\n   route leaks, but the solution covers
    several, especially considering\n   some significant route-leak attacks or occurrences
    that have been\n   observed in recent years.  The document also includes a stopgap\n
    \  method for detection and mitigation of route leaks for the phase when\n   BGPSEC
    (path validation) is not yet deployed but only origin\n   validation is deployed.\n\n\t "

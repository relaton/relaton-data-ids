  content: "   As part of the SPARTACUS DNS gateway system, building a full DNS\n
    \  parser was necessary.  Parsing DNS packets is the only way to avoid\n   propogating
    packets which are not correctly formatted DNS packets.\n\n   In order to facilitate
    building a new parser from scratch, the author\n   chose to build a parser-builder
    which takes as input, a description\n   of the DNS wire format.\n\n   This document
    describes the language created to facilitate this\n   description, and includes
    the resulting DNS wire format description\n   in this language.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In certain models of inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label Switching\n
    \  (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) spoofing attack against\n   VPN
    sites is a key concern. For example, MPLS-based VPN inter-\n   provider model
    \"C\" for VPLS, or any L2 VPN purpose is not favoured,\n   owing to security concerns
    in the dataplane, even though it can scale\n   with respect to maintenance of
    routing state. Since the inner labels\n   associated with VPN sites are not encrypted
    during transmission, a\n   man-in-the-middle attacker can spoof packets to a specific
    L2 VPN\n   site. In this paper, we propose a label-hopping technique which uses\n
    \  a set of randomized labels and a method for hopping amongst these\n   labels
    using the time instant the packet leaves the port from a\n   sending Provider
    Edge Router. To prevent the attacker from\n   identifying the labels in polynomial
    time, we also use an additional\n   label. The proposed technique can be applied
    to other variants of\n   inter-provider MPLS based VPNs where Multi-Protocol exterior-BGP
    (MP-\n   eBGP) multi-hop is used. As we address a key security concern, we can\n
    \  make a case for the deployment of MPLS based L2 VPN inter-provider\n   model
    \"C\". Specifically we use the TicToc based Precision Time\n   Protocol LSP to
    provide the timing for determining the time instant\n   at which the packet is
    sent from the remote end Provider Edge Router\n   and hence calculating when it
    must have left that peer at the\n   Provider Edge Router in the near / receiving
    end.\n\n   This version of the document suggests a better method for gaining\n
    \  more finely granular time slices. This is done by running the PTP LSP\n   between
    the ASBRs in the ASes that are providing the inter-AS L2VPN\n   service.\n\n\t "

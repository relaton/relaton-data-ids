  content: "   Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an\n
    \  interface on a network device.  Routing protocols have been developed\n   based
    on the assumption that a destination address has this semantic.\n\n   Many proposals
    have been made to add semantics to IP addresses.\n   These proposals may set the
    meaning of an address within the scope of\n   a limited domain, or suggest an
    address semantic that is meaningful\n   at specific points in the network (such
    as the source and\n   destination), and ideally can continue to be used without
    special\n   interpretation at transit points.\n\n   This document presents a brief
    survey of technologies related to IP\n   address semantic proposals and describes
    the challenges to the\n   existing routing system that they present.  It then
    summarizes the\n   opportunities for research into new or modified routing protocols
    to\n   make use of new address semantics.  It does not pass comment on the\n   advisability
    or practicality of any of the solutions.\n\n   This document is presented as study
    to support further research into\n   clarifying and understanding the issues without
    directly proposing\n   technical solutions that are ready for productization,
    deployment, or\n   standardization.\n\n\t "

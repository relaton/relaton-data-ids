  content: "This memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path \nComputation
    Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of \nWavelength Switched
    Optical Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning \nin WSONs requires a routing
    and wavelength assignment (RWA) process.  \nFrom a path computation perspective,
    wavelength assignment is the \nprocess of determining which wavelength can be
    used on each hop of a \npath and forms an additional routing constraint to optical
    light path \ncomputation. Requirements related to optical impairments will be
    \naddressed in a separate document.  \n\n \n\nConventions used in this document
    \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",
    \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this
    \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\t "

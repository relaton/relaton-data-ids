  content: "There are many deployment scenarios which require Egress LSR to \n      receive
    binding of the RSVP-TE LSP to an application, and payload \n      identification,
    using some \"out-of-band\" (OOB) mechanism. This \n      document proposes protocol
    mechanisms to address this \n      requirement. The procedures described in this
    document are \n      equally applicable for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-\n
    \     multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.\n\t "

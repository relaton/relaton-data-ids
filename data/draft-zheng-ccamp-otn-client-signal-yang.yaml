  content: "   A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity\n
    \  services to its client.  The topology and tunnel information in the\n   transport
    layer has already been defined by Traffic-engineered models\n   and OTN models,
    however, the access to the network has not been\n   described.  These information
    is useful to both client and provider.\n\n   This draft describe how the client
    signals are carried over OTN and\n   defined corresponding YANG data model which
    is required during\n   configuration procedure.  More specifically, several client
    signal\n   (of OTN) models including ETH, STM-n, FC and so on, are defined in\n
    \  this draft.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Some recent Internet technology developments relate to improvements\n
    \  in communications latency.  For instance, improvements in radio\n   communications
    or the recent work in IETF transport, security, and\n   web protocols.  There
    are also potential applications where latency\n   is potentially in a more significant
    role than it has traditionally\n   been in Internet communications.  Modern networking
    systems offer\n   many tools for building low-latency networks, from highly optimised\n
    \  individual protocol components to software controlled, virtualised\n   and
    tailored network functions.  This memo views the developments\n   from a system
    viewpoint, and considers the potential future stresses\n   that the strive for
    low-latency support for applications may bring.\n\n\t "

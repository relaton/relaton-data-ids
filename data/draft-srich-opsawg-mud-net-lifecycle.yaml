  content: "   This memo describes the lifecycle of MUD as seen from the\n   perspective
    of a network operator.  It is informational and\n   intended to help provide perspective
    around the operation of a\n   network which connects MUD-supporting devices and
    uses MUD-\n   supporting network infrastructure.  All phases of network\n   operation
    that involves or affects MUD will be described.\n   Considerations specific to
    device manufacturers will be described\n   elsewhere.  Considerations relevant
    to network equipment\n   manufacturers and networking software authors will be
    described\n   where appropriate where MUD behavior is affected.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This experimental memo describes LEDBAT++, a set of enhancements to\n
    \  the LEDBAT (Low Extra Delay Background Transport) congestion control\n   algorithm
    for background traffic.  The LEDBAT congestion control\n   algorithm has several
    shortcomings that prevent it from working\n   effectively in practice.  LEDBAT++
    extends LEDBAT by adding a set of\n   improvements, including reduced congestion
    window gain, modified\n   slow-start, multiplicative decrease and periodic slowdowns.
    \ This set\n   of improvement mitigates the known issues with the LEDBAT algorithm,\n
    \  such as latency drift, latecomer advantage and inter-LEDBAT fairness.\n   LEDBAT++
    has been implemented as a TCP congestion control algorithm\n   in the Windows
    operating system.  LEDBAT++ has been deployed in\n   production at scale on a
    variety of networks and been experimentally\n   verified to achieve the original
    stated goals of LEDBAT.\n\n\t "

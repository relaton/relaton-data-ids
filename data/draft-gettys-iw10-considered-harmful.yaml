  content: "   The proposed change to the initial window to 10 indraft-ietf-tcpm-\n
    \  initcwnd must be considered deeply harmful; not because it is the\n   proposed
    change is evil taken in isolation, but that other changes in\n   web browsers
    and web sites that have occurred over the last decade,\n   it makes the problem
    of transient congestion at a user's broadband\n   connection two and a half times
    worse.  This result has been hidden\n   by the already widespread bufferbloat
    present in broadband\n   connections.  Packet loss in isolation is no longer a
    useful metric\n   of a path's quality.  The very drive to improve latency of web
    page\n   rendering is already destroying other low latency applications, such\n
    \  as VOIP and gaming, and will prevent reliable rich web real time web\n   applications
    such as those contemplated by the IETF rtcweb working\n   group.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Phishing, a broadly-launched social engineering attack in which an\n
    \  electronic identity is misrepresented in an attempt to trick\n   individuals
    into revealing credentials, is expanding on the Internet.\n   Corporations, Service
    Providers, consumer agencies, and financial\n   institutions have started to collect
    and correlate phishing attack\n   information to better plan out mitigation activities
    and to assist in\n   prosecution.  Early on it became obvious that a common format
    for the\n   data reported or exchanged between this parties was necessary.\n\t "

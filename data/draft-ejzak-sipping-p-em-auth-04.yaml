  content: "This document describes a private Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) header
    field (P-header) to be used by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
    (ETSI) Telecommunications and Internet-converged Services and Protocols for Advanced
    Networks (TISPAN) for the purpose of authorizing early media flows in Third Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS).  This header field
    is useful in any SIP network that is interconnected with other SIP networks and
    needs to control the flow of media in the early dialog state.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

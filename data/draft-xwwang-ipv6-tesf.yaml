  content: "The current Email infrastructure has the property that any host\n   sending
    mail to the mail system can identify itself as any user name\n   it wants.  Furthermore,
    the current Email framework neither\n   authenticates the sender nor traces the
    source of the mail, so even\n   find a spam, the method is just to reject the
    mail or insert the mail\n   source into \"blacklist\", and both of these methods
    can!_t deracinate\n   the generation of spam.  This document design a Email source
    address\n   authentication based on true IPv6 address access to identify and\n
    \  authenticate the mail source address, to trace the mail sender\n   effectively,
    and to deracinate the generation of spam.\n\n\t "

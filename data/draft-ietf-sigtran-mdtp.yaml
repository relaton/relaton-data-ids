  content: "This Internet Draft discusses a new protocol, namely the Multi-network\nDatagram
    Transmission Protocol (MDTP), that is intended to provide\nfault-tolerant reliable
    data transfer between communicating entities\nover IP networks [1].\n\nMDTP is
    proposed as an application-level protocol that is designed to\nsupport redundant
    networks and transparent fault management. MDTP also\nprovides timing control
    and configuration flexibilities to meet the\nstringent timing requirements often
    found in telephony signaling\nprotocols. The motivation of developing MDTP is
    to support\nInternet-based high reliability applications such as signaling and\ncall
    control for Internet telephony.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes procedures to damp multicast routing state\n
    \  changes and prevent the churn due to the multicast dynamicity at the\n   edge
    of a network.  The procedures described in this document help\n   avoid uncontrolled
    control plane load increase on the core routing\n   infrastructure.  New procedures
    are proposed inspired from BGP\n   unicast route damping principles, but adapted
    to multicast.  They\n   cover multicast and multicast in VPNs contexts.\n\n\n\t "

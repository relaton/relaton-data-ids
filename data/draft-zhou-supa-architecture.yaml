  content: "   Currently, there are network services that impose specific demands\n
    \  on a communication network. SUPA considers two types of network\n   services,
    the inter Data Center (DC) communication and Virtual\n   Private Networks (VPN).
    This document describes the SUPA basic\n   architecture, its elements and interfaces.
    \ The main SUPA\n   architecture entities are the Network Service Agent (NSA)
    and the\n   Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD). NSA is a functional entity\n
    \  that creates and runs network services/ ABPD is a functional\n   entity, which
    1) enables the generation, maintenance and release of\n   i) actual/detailed network
    topologies and ii) VPN and inter DC\n   service specific abstractions and 2) mapping
    between the VPN and\n   inter DC service service specific abstractions and the
    network\n   topology and configuration.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network\n   resources
    and the associated policies on each of a connected set of\n   links in the underlay
    network.  An NRP could be used as the underlay\n   to support one or a group of
    enhanced VPN services or RFC 9543\n   network slice services.  For the instantiation
    of an NRP, NRP-\n   specific information and policy need to be advertised to the
    network\n   nodes involved in the NRP, so that the NRP-specific state can be\n
    \  created and NRP-specific behavior can be enabled.  The mechanism for\n   instantiating
    NRPs on the involved network elements is called NRP\n   Policy.\n\n   This document
    specifies the BGP extensions for advertising NRP Policy\n   information to the
    set of network nodes involved in the NRP.  The NRP\n   Policy is advertised using
    a separate BGP Subsequent Address Family\n   Identifier (SAFI) of the BGP Link-State
    (BGP-LS) Address Family,\n   which allows to reuse the TLVs defined in BGP-LS
    without impacting\n   the base BGP and BGP-LS functionality.\n\n\t "

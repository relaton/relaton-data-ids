  content: "With the increased use of DNS anycast, load balancing, and other\n   mechanisms
    allowing more than one DNS name server to share a single\n   IP address, it is
    sometimes difficult to tell which of a pool of name\n   servers has answered a
    particular query.  While existing ad-hoc\n   mechanism allow an operator to send
    follow-up queries when it is\n   necessary to debug such a configuration, the
    only completely reliable\n   way to obtain the identity of the name server which
    actually\n   responded is to have the name server include this information in
    the\n   response itself.  This note proposes a protocol extension to support\n
    \  this functionality.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Sieve scripting language allows users to control handling and disposal
    of their incoming e-mail. By default, an e-mail message that is processed by a
    Sieve script is saved in the owner's \"inbox\". Actions such as \"fileinto\" and
    \"redirect\" cancel this default behavior.\n\n This document defines a new keyword
    parameter, \":copy\", to be used with the Sieve \"fileinto\" and \"redirect\"
    actions. Adding \":copy\" to an action suppresses cancellation of the default
    \"inbox\" save. It allows users to add commands to an existing script without
    changing the meaning of the rest of the script. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

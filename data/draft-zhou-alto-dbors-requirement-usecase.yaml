  content: "   This draft introduces the new challenges for the network brought by\n
    \  massive access services under the background of the convergence of\n   the
    cloud and the network which acquires the network to identify and\n   convey the
    information of fine-grain user and application\n   requirements, aiming to fulfill
    differentiated service provisioning\n   and improve the comprehensive utilization
    of network resources.  The\n   draft raises the scope of current solution gap
    analysis and further\n   proposes the definition of DB-ORS in which network capabilities
    are\n   abstracted as atomic services and can be orchestrated by\n   applications.
    \ Scenarios of cloud access and DCI are outlined to\n   clarify the concepts and
    principles of DB-ORS in overcoming\n   challenges.\n\n\t "

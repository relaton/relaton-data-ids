  content: "   WebRTC provides a solution for peer-to-peer streaming between web\n
    \  applications by leveraging a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream between\n   two
    clients.  This RTP stream is expected to be sent over an UDP\n   (Universal Datagram
    Protocol) connection, which by definition has no\n   built-in reliability.  Recently
    the FEC FRAME Working Group of the\n   IETF has come up with a framework and technical
    recommendations for\n   applying forward error correction (FEC) to unreliable
    streams.  This\n   framework can be applied to WebRTC with minimal changes to
    the\n   specification.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses mechanisms the IETF has historically used for\n
    \  updating RFCs subsequent to their publication, and outlines an\n   updated
    procedure for publishing newer versions (colloquially known\n   as \"bis versions\")
    that is appropriate in certain circumstances.\n   This procedure is expected to
    be easier for both authors and\n   consumers of RFCs.\n\n\t "

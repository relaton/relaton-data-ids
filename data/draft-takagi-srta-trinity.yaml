  content: "   This document proposes a conceptual architecture for ensuring the\n
    \  safety of autonomously coordinating AI systems, particularly future\n   Artificial
    General Intelligence (AGI).  Starting from the reliability\n   challenges facing
    current multi-agent AI, we outline the Structured\n   Responsibility and Traceability
    Architecture (SRTA) as a practical\n   framework for their resolution.  We then
    extend the philosophy of\n   SRTA to present the \"Trinity Configuration,\" an
    advanced role-based\n   model for AI agents that draws an analogy from the theological\n
    \  doctrine of the Trinity.  This paper comparatively examines the\n   evolutionary
    stages of this configuration and introduces a novel\n   concept, the \"Filioque
    Command,\" to define dynamic information flows\n   between agents.  While this
    series of considerations includes\n   concepts that are not fully verifiable at
    present, its purpose is to\n   provide a crucial theoretical foundation for the
    governance structure\n   of a safe superintelligence -- a \"North Star\" for AI
    research to aim\n   for.\n\n\t "

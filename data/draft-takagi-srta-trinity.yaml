abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a conceptual architecture for ensuring the safety
    of autonomously coordinating AI systems, particularly future Artificial General
    Intelligence (AGI). Starting from the reliability challenges facing current multi-agent
    AI, we outline the Structured Responsibility and Traceability Architecture (SRTA)
    as a practical framework for their resolution. We then extend the philosophy of
    SRTA to present the "Trinity Configuration," an advanced role-based model for
    AI agents that draws an analogy from the theological doctrine of the Trinity.
    This paper comparatively examines the evolutionary stages of this configuration
    and introduces a novel concept, the "Filioque Command," to define dynamic information
    flows between agents. While this series of considerations includes concepts that
    are not fully verifiable at present, its purpose is to provide a crucial theoretical
    foundation for the governance structure of a safe superintelligence -- a "North
    Star" for AI research to aim for.</p>

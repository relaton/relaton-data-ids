  content: "   The IETF 6LoWPAN working group was formed in 2004 to address the\n
    \  challenge of enabling wireless IPv6 communication over the newly\n   standardized
    IEEE 802.15.4 low-power radio for devices with limited\n   space, power and memory,
    such as sensor nodes [3].  IEEE 802.15.4\n   radio links, coupled with the interoperability
    and ubiquity of IP,\n   will lead to exciting new deployment scenarios for these
    low-power\n   networks.  Sensor wireless networks will be integrated into wired\n
    \  and/or wireless fixed infrastructure.  The integration of these\n   sensor
    networks with the Internet and wireless infrastructure\n   networks increases
    the network capacity, coverage area and\n   application domains.  In this draft
    we provide various integration\n   scenarios and discuss associated issues with
    such deployments.\n\n\n\t "

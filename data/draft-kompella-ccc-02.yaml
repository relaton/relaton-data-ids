  content: "Circuit Cross-Connect (CCC) was the ground-breaking design and\n   implementation
    of the transport of Layer 2 frames over Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS),
    which is now seen as an important application\n   of MPLS.  Thus, documenting
    CCC is important from a historical point\n   of view.  Furthermore, CCC is still
    in production in many networks,\n   providing yet another reason to document it.
    \ It is hoped that those\n   interested in this area will see where it started,
    how far we have\n   come, and the strengths and weaknesses of this particular
    approach,\n   and thereby gain some perspective of the area.  If in the process\n
    \  they get new insights for the future development in this area, that\n   is
    a bonus.\n\t "

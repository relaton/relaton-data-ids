  content: "   Energy consumption of network infrastructures is rising fast.  There\n
    \  are emerging needs for power-aware routing and traffic engineering,\n   which
    adjust routing paths to help reduce power consumption network-\n   wide.  This
    document gives a high-level analysis on the basic\n   requirements, approaches,
    and potential issues in power-aware routing\n   and traffic engineering.\n\n\t "

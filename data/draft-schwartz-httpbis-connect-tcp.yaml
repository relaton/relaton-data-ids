  content: "   TCP proxying using HTTP CONNECT has long been part of the core HTTP\n
    \  specification.  However, this proxying functionality has several\n   important
    deficiencies in modern HTTP environments.  This\n   specification defines an alternative
    HTTP proxy service configuration\n   for TCP connections.  This configuration
    is described by a URI\n   Template, similar to the CONNECT-UDP and CONNECT-IP
    protocols.\n\n\t "

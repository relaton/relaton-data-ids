  content: "Mobile IP ensures correct routing of packets to a mobile node as the mobile
    node changes its point of attachment to the Internet.  However, it is also required
    to provide proper Quality of Service (QoS) forwarding treatment to the mobile
    node's packet stream at the intermediate nodes in the network, so that QoS-sensitive
    IP services can be supported over Mobile IP.  This document describes requirements
    for an IP QoS mechanism for its satisfactory operation with Mobile IP.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

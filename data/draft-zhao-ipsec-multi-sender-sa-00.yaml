  content: "Astract: In this draft, we propose two efficient and practical \nmechanisms
    to enable the anti-replay service in the multiple sender SA. \nAs IPSec is still
    under its development, this draft is mainly based on \nthe existing RFCs. The
    two solutions require only minor change to the \ncurrent standards and are back
    compatible. The security of new \nproposals and the impacts of possible future
    standards will be analyzed \nand discussed. \n\t "

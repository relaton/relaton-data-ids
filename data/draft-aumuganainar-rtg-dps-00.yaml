- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The document describes a network design architecture for routing\n
    \  packets via different paths available in the network based on\n   application
    port number. Primarily, this is targeted for Enterprise\n   customers who have
    built up redundancy at their WAN edge but are\n   suffering from a congested primary
    link whilst the secondary is\n   idle.\n\n   The objective of this architecture
    is as follows\n\n   1) Offload bulky application on to the secondary link\n   2)
    Achieve the above with out introducing asymmetric routing in the\n   network\n\n\n\t "

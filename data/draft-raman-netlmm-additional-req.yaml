  content: "In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-req-01.txt, a set of requirements for a \nprotocol
    for localized mobility management has been described. In \nthis draft, we propose
    to include an additional requirement that \ncomponents of existing IETF protocols
    should be reused wherever \npossible to avoid extensive standardization activity
    and to enable \nreuse of existing IETF-compliant protocol implementations. \n\n\t "

  content: "Ethernet has been widely deployed in metro-networks, and there are \n
    \  more and more customers select Ethernet PW services. With the \n   deployment
    of IEEE 802.1ah network, there is a need to support \n   802.1ah attachment circuit.
    Based on the two modes defined in RFC \n   4448, this document introduces a new
    Ethernet encapsulation mode to \n   support the new AC type. This document also
    describes some scenarios \n   and procedures pertaining to the new mode. Some
    considerations \n   relating to multi-segment PW are also discussed.\n\t "

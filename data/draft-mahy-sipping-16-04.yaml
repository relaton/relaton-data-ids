  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become very popular, and\n
    \  with this popularity, the harmful misconceptions that there is a\n   specific
    limit to the number of features that can be implemented\n   using SIP primitives,
    and that informational documents produced by\n   the SIPPING Working Group that
    show example call flows place\n   restrictions on what can be implemented.  One
    especially catchy\n   buzzword--The \"SIPPING 16\"--supposedly refers to the sixteen
    basic\n   features of SIP.  This document describes why the mythical SIPPING 16\n
    \  does not exist, and where to find out more information about SIP\n   features.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The -phonebcp draft currently requires endpoints to disable sending
    a BYE on an emergency call. Insufficient justification and lack of attention to
    the entire problem has caused comment on that section of the document. This document
    attempts to define the problem and the requirements to controlling disconnect
    on emergency calls.</p>"

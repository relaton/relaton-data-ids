abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A novel mobility management approach is described in\n   [I-D.auge-dmm-hicn-mobility],
    that leverages routable location-\n   independent identifiers (IDs) and an Information-Centric
    Networking\n   (ICN) communication model integrated in IPv6, also referred to
    as\n   Hybrid ICN (hICN) [I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn].\n\n   Such approach belongs
    to the category of pure ID-based mobility\n   management schemes whose objective
    is (i) to overcome the limitations\n   of traditional locator-based solutions
    like Mobile IP, (ii) to remove\n   the need for a global mapping system as the
    one required by locator-\n   identifier separation solutions like LISP\n   [I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction]
    or ILA [I-D.herbert-intarea-ila].\n\n   ID-based networking as proposed by ICN
    architectures allows to\n   disentangle forwarding operations from changes of
    network location,\n   hence removing tunnels and user plane or control plane anchors.
    \ In\n   virtue of its anchorless property, we denote this approach as hICN-\n
    \  AMM (hICN Anchorless Mobility Management) hereinafter.\n\n   This document
    discusses hICN-AMM deployment options and related\n   tradeoffs in terms of cost/benefits.
    \ Particular attention is devoted\n   to the insertion in the recently proposed
    5G Service Based\n   Architecture under study at 3GPP where an hICN-AMM solution
    might\n   present a more efficient alternative to the traditional tunnel-based\n
    \  mobility architecture through GTP-U.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In many Opportunistic Security scenarios end-to-end encryption is\n
    \  automatized for Internet users.  In addition, it is often required to\n   provide
    the users with easy means to carry out authentication.\n\n   Depending on several
    factors, each communication channel to different\n   peers may have a different
    Privacy Status, e.g., unencrypted,\n   encrypted and encrypted as well as authenticated.
    \ Also each message\n   from/to a single peer may have a different Privacy Status.\n\n
    \  To display the actual Privacy Status to the user, this document\n   defines
    a Privacy Rating scheme and its mapping to a traffic-light\n   semantics.  A Privacy
    Status is defined on a per-message basis as\n   well as on a per-identity basis.
    \ The traffic-light semantics (as\n   color and symbol rating) allows for a clear
    and easily understandable\n   presentation to the user in order to optimize User
    Experience.\n\n   This rating system is most beneficial to Opportunistic Security\n
    \  scenarios and is already implemented in several applications of\n   pretty
    Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t "

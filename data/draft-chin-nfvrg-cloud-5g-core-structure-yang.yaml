  content: "   In 5G core network, all network functions are componentized,\nvirtualized
    and grouped into VNF. Network management system will manage\nthe functions based
    on VNF. This document presents YANG model proposal\non overall structure of cloud
    native 5G core network. The structure is\nitself represented as an example YANG
    model, with all of the related\ncomponent models logically organized in a way
    that is operationally\nintuitive, but this model is not expected to be implemented.
    \ The\nidentified component modules are expected to be defined and\nimplemented.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Billing information protocol is a simple protocol that can be used \nby
    servers to indicate the charging information incurred due to a \nspecific operation
    with a client. In many situations a client, like \na SIP user agent may need to
    know the charging information about a \nspecific interaction with the server.
    \ This document defines the \nBIP (Billing Information Protocol) that can be used
    as a standard \nway to share this charging information.  BIP supports simple \nindication
    of charging information.  The protocol defines a generic \nrepresentation on the
    number of units charged, the charge incurred \nper unit etc.  This will be useful
    for implementing services like \nadvice of charge.  The protocol is targeted for
    VoIP usages, \nhowever any generic client-server interaction can use this \nprotocol.

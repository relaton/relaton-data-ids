  content: "   The Web Push protocol provides a means of ensuring constant network\n
    \  availability of devices that would otherwise have limited\n   availability.
    \ This document describes extensions to that protocol\n   that enable the efficient
    delivery of messages to multiple devices.\n   This allows an application to request
    that a web push server deliver\n   the same message to a potentially large set
    of devices.\n\n\t "

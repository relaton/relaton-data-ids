  content: "   The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for\n
    \  software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from the\n   most
    basic ones up to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-\n   tenant deployments.\n\n
    \  This document defines the credentials that workloads use to represent\n   their
    identity.  They can be used in various protocols to\n   authenticate workloads
    to each other.  To use these credentials,\n   workloads must provide proof of
    possession of the associated private\n   key material, which is covered in other
    documents.  This document\n   focuses on the credentials alone, independent of
    the proof-of-\n   possession mechanism.\n\n\t "

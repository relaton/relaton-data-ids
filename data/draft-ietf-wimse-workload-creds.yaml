abstract:
- content: "<p>The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for
    software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from the most basic ones
    up to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi- tenant deployments. This document
    defines the credentials that workloads use to represent their identity. They can
    be used in various protocols to authenticate workloads to each other. To use these
    credentials, workloads must provide proof of possession of the associated private
    key material, which is covered in other documents. This document focuses on the
    credentials alone, independent of the proof-of- possession mechanism.</p>"

  content: "A key concept in IPv6 is that of the site.  Unfortunately, there is \nno
    rigorous definition of a site.  Rather, a site is only loosely \nand informally
    defined as 'a region of topology that belongs to a \nsingle organization and is
    located within a single geographic \nlocation' [1].\n\t "

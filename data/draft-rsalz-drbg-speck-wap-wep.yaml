  content: "   Cryptography is becoming more important to the IETF and its\n   protocols,
    and more IETF protocols are using, or looking at,\n   cryptography to increase
    privacy on the Internet [RFC7258].\n\n   This document specifies a proposed best
    practice for any mechanism\n   (or data format) that uses cryptography; namely,
    that RFCs cannot\n   specify an algorithm as mandatory-to-implement (MTI) unless
    that\n   algorithm has had reasonable public review.  This document also\n   \"sketches
    out\" a rough definition around what such a review would\n   look like.\n\n\t "

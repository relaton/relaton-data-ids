  content: "   Collective communication is the basic logical communication model for\n
    \  distributed applications.  When distributed systems scales, the\n   communication
    overhead becomes the bottleneck of the entire system,\n   impeding system performance
    to increase.  This draft describes the\n   performance challenges when the collective
    communication is employed\n   in a network with more nodes or processes participating
    in or a\n   larger number of such communication rounds required to complete a\n
    \  single job.  And the document presents several use cases where\n   different
    aspects of collective communication optimization are\n   needed.\n\n\n\t "

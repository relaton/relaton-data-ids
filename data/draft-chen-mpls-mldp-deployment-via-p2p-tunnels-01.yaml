abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The existing specification for Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol\n
    \  (mLDP) functionality assumes that a pair of LDP speakers which\n   support
    the P2MP/MP2MP capability are directly connected, or they can\n   reach each other
    through targeted LDP session and transparent\n   tunnel(s).  However, the real
    deployment may not satisfy these\n   assumptions, especially in the case where
    the targeted LDP session\n   and the transparent tunnel(s) have to be pre-established.
    \ This\n   document provides an automatic solution for finding the nearest\n   upstream
    node which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP along the path from\n   the current node
    to the root node, and triggering the targeted LDP\n   session and transparent
    tunnel(s) when needed.\n\n\t "

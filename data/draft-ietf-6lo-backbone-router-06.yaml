  content: "   This specification proposes proxy operations for IPv6 Neighbor\n   Discovery
    on behalf of devices located on broadcast-inefficient\n   wireless networks.  A
    broadcast-efficient backbone running classical\n   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery federates
    multiple wireless links to form a\n   large MultiLink Subnet, but the broadcast
    domain does not need to\n   extend to the wireless links for the purpose of ND
    operation.\n   Backbone Routers placed at the wireless edge of the backbone proxy\n
    \  the ND operation and route packets from/to registered nodes, and\n   wireless
    nodes register or are proxy-registered to the Backbone\n   Router to setup proxy
    services in a fashion that is essentially\n   similar to a classical Layer-2 association.\n\n\t "

  content: "   (Editorial note: to be updated as the text in the main body of the\n
    \  document is finalised) This document is intended to inform the\n   community
    about the impact of the deployment of the proposed\n   Encrypted Client Hello
    (ECH) standard that encrypts Server Name\n   Indication (SNI) and other data.
    \ Data encapsulated by ECH (ie data\n   included in the encrypted ClientHelloInner)
    is of legitimate interest\n   to on-path security actors including those providing
    inline malware\n   detection, parental controls, content filtering to prevent
    access to\n   malware and other risky traffic, mandatory security controls etc.\n\n
    \  The document includes observations on current use cases for SNI data\n   in
    a variety of contexts.  It highlights how the use of that data is\n   important
    to the operators of both public and private networks and\n   shows how the loss
    of access to SNI data will cause difficulties in\n   the provision of a range
    of services to end-users, including the\n   potential weakening of cybersecurity
    defences.  Some mitigations are\n   identified that may be useful for inclusion
    by those considering the\n   adoption of support for ECH in their software.\n\n\t "

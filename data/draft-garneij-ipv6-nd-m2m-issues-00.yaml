  content: "   The use of IPv6 in 3GPP cellular broadband for accessing the Internet\n
    \  and other data services like VoLTE via smartphones has increased as a\n   result
    of EPS network deployments worldwide and new IPv6 capable\n   smartphones tablets,
    and netbook computers.  The upcoming rise of\n   IoT/M2M is anticipated to bring
    billions of new devices into these\n   networks and the majority of these devices
    will be using only IPv6.\n   This document discusses the EPS network impact of
    IoT/M2M IPv6\n   connectivity specifically targeting the IPv6 Stateless Address
    Auto\n   Configuration (SLAAC), as specified in [RFC4861] and [RFC4862], which\n
    \  currently is the only supported IPv6 address configuration mechanism\n   in
    3GPP standards.\n\n\t "

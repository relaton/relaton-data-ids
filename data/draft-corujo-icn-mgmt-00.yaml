  content: "   This document aims to draw the attention of the ICNRG community to\n
    \  network management, an important but hitherto underdeveloped area of\n   research
    in information-centric networking.  We consider that the\n   availability of modern
    management mechanisms for information-centric\n   networks will foster their deployment
    in real-world environments.\n   For example, we argue that there is a need for
    creating basic network\n   management tools early on while ICN is still in the
    design and\n   experimentation phases that can evolve over time.  Perhaps ICN
    can\n   borrow successful mechanisms from the host-centric paradigm and adapt\n
    \  them to the new network primitives.  Alternatively, novel network\n   management
    schemes can be designed based on ICN primitives.  As a\n   discussion starter,
    this document summarizes recently published\n   approaches for ICN network management.
    \ In particular, this first\n   version presents a management framework for named
    data networking and\n   reviews previous work on NetInf management.\n\n\t "

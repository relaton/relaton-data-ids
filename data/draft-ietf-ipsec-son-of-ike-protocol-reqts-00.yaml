  content: "Various proposals have been made for updating the IKE protocol.\nOne thing
    which is missing from the dicussion is an evaluation of the\nscope of IKE, identifying
    which problems it should solve.  Once this\nscoping is done, it becomes easier
    to specify the requirements for\nthe protocol, as well as the protocol itself.
    \ Sections of this\ndocument discuss various scenarios that are considered important
    for\nIKE; this list needs to be refined by the WG.\n\n\t "

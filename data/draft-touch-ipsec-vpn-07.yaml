- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IPsec can secure the links of a multihop network to protect communication
    between trusted components, e.g., for a secure virtual network (VN), overlay,
    or virtual private network (VPN).  Virtual links established by IPsec tunnel mode
    can conflict with routing and forwarding inside VNs because IP routing depends
    on references to interfaces and next-hop IP addresses.  The IPsec tunnel mode
    specification is ambiguous on this issue, so even compliant implementations cannot
    be trusted to avoid conflicts.  An alternative to tunnel mode uses non-IPsec IPIP
    encapsulation together with IPsec transport mode, which we call IIPtran.  IPIP
    encapsulation occurs as a separate initial step, as the result of a forwarding
    lookup of the VN packet.  IPsec transport mode processes the resulting (tunneled)
    IP packet with an SA determined through a security association database (SAD)
    match on the tunnel header.  IIPtran supports dynamic routing inside the VN without
    changes to the current IPsec architecture.  IIPtran demonstrates how to configure
    any compliant IPsec implementation to avoid the aforementioned conflicts.  IIPtran
    is also compared to several alternative mechanisms for VN routing and their respective
    impact on IPsec, routing, policy enforcement, and interactions with the Internet
    Key Exchange (IKE).  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

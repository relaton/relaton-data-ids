  content: "   Loss Recovery by means of T3-Retransmission has significant\n   detrimental
    impact on the delays experienced through an SCTP\n   association.  The throughput
    achievable over an SCTP association also\n   is negatively impacted by the occurence
    of T3-Retransmissions.  Loss\n   Recovery by Fast Retransmission operation is
    in most situations\n   superior to T3-Retransmission from a latency and a throughput\n
    \  perspective.  The present SCTP Fast Recovery algorithms as specified\n   by
    [RFC4960] are not able to adequately or timely recover losses in\n   certain situations,
    thus resorting to loss recovery by lengthy\n   T3-Retransimissions or by non-timely
    activation of Fast Recovery.  In\n   this document we propose for a number of
    enhancements to the SCTP\n   Loss Recovery algorithms aimed to amend some of these
    deficiencies\n   with a particular focus on Loss Recovery for drops in Traffic
    Tails.\n   The enhancements supplements the existing algorithms of [RFC4960]\n
    \  with proactive probing and timer driven accelerated activation of the\n   Fast
    Retransmission algorithm as well as a number of enhancements of\n   the Fast Retransmission
    algorithm in itself are proposed.  The\n   enhancement are proposed as supplements
    to the Loss Recovery\n   algorithms of [RFC4960] and as such they do not deprecate
    or replace\n   any of the mechanisms defined by [RFC4960].\n\n   The solution
    proposed draws on prior art in the area of SCTP and TCP\n   Loss Recovery improvements.
    \ The mechanisms proposed include the\n   adjustment to SCTP Fast Retransmission
    of certain improvements\n   specified for TCP Fast Retransmission by [RFC6675]
    as well as the\n   proposal embeds SCTP Early Retransmit [RFC5827] in a delayed
    variant.\n   The proposal heavily draws on the ideas put forward for TCP by\n
    \  [DUKKIPATI01] for proactive probing and timer driven entering of Fast\n   Recovery
    procedures.  The proposal embeds certain aspects from\n   [HURTIG] when applicable.
    \ The procedures proposed are sender-side\n   only and do not impact the SCTP
    receiver.\n\n\t "

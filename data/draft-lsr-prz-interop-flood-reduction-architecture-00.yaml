  content: "   In case multiple distributed (including a possible centralized one)\n
    \  flood reduction algorithms are deployed at the same time in an IGP\n   domain
    the correctness of the overall solution preconditions certain\n   co-operative
    behavior of involved algorithms.  Under such conditions\n   the correctness of
    the overall solution can be derived from resulting\n   graph theoretical concepts
    easily.  This document presents the\n   necessary requirements on the deployed
    algorithms and the resulting\n   framework.  The situation of multiple algorithms
    in the network in\n   steady state is per se not necessarily operationally desirable
    but\n   must be, if minimal network disruption during such procedure is\n   required,
    solved for possible migration scenarios caused by e.g.\n   discovered defects
    or algorithm improvements.\n\n\t "

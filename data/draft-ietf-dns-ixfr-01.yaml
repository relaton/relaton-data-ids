- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This memo proposes extensions to the DNS protocols to provide for an incremental
    zone transfer (IXFR) procedure.  A companion mechanism, the NOTIFY procedure,
    is also proposed to allow secondaries to learn of changes to the primary database
    in a timely manner. A new DNS Opcode (NEWQUERY) is proposed that will provide
    the necessary upgrades to the DNS packet structure to provide for both these mechanisms.
    \ Further, it allows for easy upgradability, in the future. Two new RR types (CARRIER
    and ISOA) are proposed.                                                              This
    memo provides only a first cut at an attempt to document the ideas about these
    protocols and we invite extensive comments, maybe to revamp the entire stream
    of thought.\n\t "

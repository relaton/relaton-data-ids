  content: "   This document describes a mechanism permitting the DKIM signing\n   domain
    to indicate different levels of reliance be given to specific\n   messages by
    the recipient.  This reliance indication is a security\n   and safety enhancement
    when messages are selectively screened or\n   annotated based upon generally trusted
    DKIM signing domains.  Using\n   this reliance mechanism, the signing domain better
    protects\n   recipients by indicating low reliance levels when messages are from\n
    \  poorly-vetted sources.  A low reliance level warns the recipient to\n   increase
    the scrutiny given to such messages and also to\n   appropriately limit message
    annotations.  Without a means for a DKIM\n   signing domain to partition the handling
    of their messages, their\n   least vetted source may diminish the trust that might
    otherwise be\n   established for their signed messages.\n\n\n\t "

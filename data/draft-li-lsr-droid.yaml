  content: "   Over time, the routing protocols have been burdended with the\n   responsiblity
    of carrying a variety of information that is not\n   directly relevant to their
    mission.  This includes VPN parameters,\n   configuration information, and capability
    data.  All of the\n   additional data impacts the performance and stability of
    the routing\n   protocols negatively.\n\n   This has been convenient since the
    backbone of a routing protocol is\n   a small distributed database of routing
    information.  Any service\n   needing a distributed database has considered injecting
    its data into\n   a routing protocol so that it can leverage the protocols database\n
    \  service.  Architecturally, this is a mistake that puts the protocol\n   at
    risk from undue complexity and overhead.\n\n   To avoid this, DROID is a subsystem
    that is tangential to, but\n   independent of the routing protocols, and provides
    distributed\n   database services for other routing services.  It is based on
    the\n   publish-subscribe (pub/sub) architecture and is intentionally crafted\n
    \  to be an open mechanism for the transport of ancillary data.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The objective of this proposal is to introduce a mobility support\n
    \  framework for information centric networking (ICN) that is capable of\n   supporting
    dynamic mobility scenarios associated with both consumer\n   and producer applications,
    in a mobile device connected to a wireless\n   LAN or WAN point of attachment
    (PoA).  Due to rapidly evolving user\n   trends that shift towards increased mobility
    and increased access to\n   mobile content delivery (as both content producer
    and consumer), it\n   is essential for an ICN architecture to offer active mobility
    support\n   to end hosts, and present them with varying degrees of quality of\n
    \  experience.  We enable this through the use of a network-driven\n   mobility
    support architecture, which operates in a distributed and\n   anchorless manner,
    and relies on late-binding and in--band signaling\n   with the use of forwarding
    labels.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Power of Attorney (PoA) based authorization is a generic and\n   decentralized
    subgranting based authorization technique.  In this, a\n   principal can grant
    limited credibilities for an agent to act on its\n   behalf for some limited time
    and context.  This can be used for\n   example with semi autonomous devices to
    have them act on behalf.  PoA\n   is a self-contained document that a principal
    sign and directs to an\n   agent, thereby providing it the power to execute user
    actions on\n   behalf of the principal for a predefined time.  As an example in
    this\n   document we explain Power of Attorney based authorization technique\n
    \  as a decentralized solution for onboarding devices.  Industrial\n   network
    layer onboarding demands a technique that is efficient,\n   scalable, and secure.
    \ PoA based onboarding enables users such as\n   integrators and subcontractors
    to onboard devices permanently or\n   temporarily according to terms and requirements
    set in the PoAs.\n\n\t "

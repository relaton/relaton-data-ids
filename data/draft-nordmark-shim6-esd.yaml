  content: "The Shim6 protocol provides for locator agility while satisfying the\n'first,
    do no harm' security requirements.  This document outlines\nthree rather orthogonal
    sets of extensions to Shim6.  The first one\nis how to procide complete separation
    between identifiers and\nlocators.  The second one is how to allow routers to
    rewrite the\nlocators in the shim6 packets as a way to provide traffic engineering\ninformation
    to the hosts.  The third one is the outline of a simple\nextension to allow shim6,
    with a CGA upper-layer ID, to operate using\nIPv4 addresses as locators.\n\nThe
    purpose of this outline is to stimulate discussions.\n\t "

  content: "   The IETF has been having virtual meetings for a long time.  Until\n
    \  recently these have been interim meetings, and following the all-\n   virtual
    IETF-107 we expect to see more and more WG meetings take the\n   virtual route.
    \ A common practice at the IETF is to use room\n   \"humming\" to gauge working
    group consensus, though the final\n   consensus is determined by the working group
    chairs and typically\n   requires a mailing list poll as well.  We do not have
    a technique\n   equivalent to the hum for virtual meetings, and arguably this
    reduces\n   the effectiveness of these meetings.\n\n   This document defines the
    requirements from a web application whose\n   goal is to most faithfully replicate
    the \"feel\" of hums, through the\n   use of a traditional web user interface.\n\n\t "

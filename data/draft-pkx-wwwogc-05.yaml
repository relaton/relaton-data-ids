  content: "    The document describes a SingleSignON solution to WWW seen as one
    Giant\n    computer. As WWW use increases, on average an user has many service
    login\n    accounts they have to manage. It would be better for most users at
    the\n    expense of some security risk to have one password for all the services
    and\n    a WWW shell and a control panel. Also the WWW as an intelligent being
    could\n    show information to an user interpreting their needs from all their
    accounts.\n\n\t "

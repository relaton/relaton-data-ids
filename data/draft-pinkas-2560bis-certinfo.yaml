  content: "   OCSP [RFC2560] has been designed to allow an OCSP server to use\n   any
    kind of trustable information to answer to a client varying\n   from CRLs to an
    access to a database of issued certificates.\n\n   In its original version, OCSP
    does not allow taking full advantage\n   of an access to a database of issued
    certificates.\n\n   When a database of issued certificates is used by an OCSP
    server,\n   this document explains how the OCSP server shall respond and how\n
    \  OCSP clients shall react.\n\n   The proposal is intended to update 2560bis.
    It defines a new single\n   extension in a single response, called certInfo.  The
    extension is\n   non critical.  The meaning of \"good\", \"revoked\" and \"unknown\"
    are\n   unchanged.\n\n\n\n\t "

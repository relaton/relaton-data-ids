  content: "\tThere have been several attempts aimed at developing an Arabic Domain
    \n\tName System (ADNS) using Arabic characters in an Arabic-language \n\tcoherent
    fashion.  In the beginning of the second quarter of 2003, an \n\tArabic Domain
    Name Task Force (ADNTF) was formed under the auspices \n\tof United Nations Economic
    and Social Commission for Western Asia \n\t(ESCWA), and the guidance of Multilingual
    Internet Names Consortium \n\t(MINC); one of its main objectives was to help define
    standards for \n\tADNS through a Request For Comments (RFC) document.  This document
    \n\tresolves many technical and linguistic issues, including the adoption \n\tof
    the client-side DNS-based approach to name resolution; syntax of \n\tthe proposed
    Arabic Domain Names together with the character set and \n\tmany Arabic language-specific
    issues were clearly resolved.  This \n\tInternet-Draft proposes guidelines that
    are compatible with the \n\tInternet Consortium for Assigned Names and Numbers
    (ICANN) and the \n\tInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as far as Domain Names
    System \n\t(DNS) and Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) standards are \n\tconcerned.
    \ Technical, management, operational, and language-specific \n\tissues are discussed
    and recommendations are made.\n\t "

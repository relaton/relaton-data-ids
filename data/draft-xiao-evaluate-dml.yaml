  content: "\n   With rapid development of next generation networks, it is expected\n
    \  that a separate effort to study data modeling languages in the\n   interest
    of network management should be undertaken.  Based on a good\n   understanding
    of the requirements of data modeling in next generation\n   network management
    domain, evaluation on management data modeling\n   languages becomes an essential
    way for the purpose of standardization\n   to replace proprietary data models
    in the near future.  Our project\n   aims to establish a framework for evaluation
    to measure the\n   capabilities of management data modeling languages in meeting
    those\n   requirements by a set of criteria, which are modeling approaches,\n
    \  interoperability, conformance, extensibility, readability, data\n   representations
    and security considerations.\n\n\t "

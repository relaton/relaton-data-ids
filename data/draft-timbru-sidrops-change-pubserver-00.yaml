- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft outlines how Krill, an RPKI CA and Publication Server,\n
    \  implements the process that allows a CA to change the Publication\n   Server
    it uses, migrating its content from the old server, to the new\n   server's repository.\n\n
    \  The current implementation is modelled after the RPKI CA Key Rollover\n   process
    defined in RFC 6489, except that in this case a new location\n   is used for the
    new key.\n\n   It incudes some discussion about possible improvements to the\n
    \  process.\n\n   The goal of this draft is to serve as a starting point for a
    broader\n   discussion on how RPKI Repository Migration should be done.  If\n
    \  adopted as a working group item, the status could be changed to\n   standard
    or bcp, and the intent would of course be to update the\n   content to reflect
    working group consensus rather than what happens\n   to have been implemented
    in Krill at this time.\n\n\t "

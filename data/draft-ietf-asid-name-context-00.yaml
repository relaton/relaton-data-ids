  content: "The X.500 Standard has the concept of first level DSAs, whose administrators
    must collectively manage the root naming context through bilateral agreements
    or other private means which are outside the scope of the Standard.                                                              The
    Paradise-Nameflow X.500 service has an established procedure for managing the
    root naming context, which currently uses Quipu proprietary replication mechanisms
    and a root DSA. The project is moving towards 1993 standard replication protocols
    and wants to standardise a procedure for managing the root naming context which
    will use 1993 standard protocols.  Such a procedure will be useful to private
    X.500 domains as well as to the Internet X.500 public domain.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Source address validation (SAV) aims to avoid improper blocking of
    legitimate traffic while maintaining directionality. Existing SAV mechanisms commonly
    rely on ingress allowlist filters on interfaces facing customer or lateral peer
    Autonomous Systems (ASes), which can result in improper blocking when the allowlist
    is incomplete. This document analyzes this issue and describes an alternative
    ingress SAV approach based on a blocklist of prefixes exclusively associated with
    the provider cone. Network operators may select either approach based on their
    operational context.</p>"

  content: "   Source address validation (SAV) aims to avoid improper blocking of\n
    \  legitimate traffic while maintaining directionality.  Existing SAV\n   mechanisms
    commonly rely on ingress allowlist filters on interfaces\n   facing customer or
    lateral peer Autonomous Systems (ASes), which can\n   result in improper blocking
    when the allowlist is incomplete.  This\n   document analyzes this issue and describes
    an alternative ingress SAV\n   approach based on a blocklist of prefixes exclusively
    associated with\n   the provider cone.  Network operators may select either approach\n
    \  based on their operational context.\n\n\t "

  content: "Recently there are a number of efforts [sw1, sw2, in,tpc, etc.] of trying
    to\nconnect the packet-switching network with circuit-switching network, especially\nconnecting
    the Internet with public telephone networks.  The first problem\nof such interconnection
    is naming and addressing, later will come with\ndirectory services and routing
    problems.  This draft concentrates on\nnaming for DNS and URL.  Other problems
    are discussed in other documents\n[utrpt, framework].\n\t "

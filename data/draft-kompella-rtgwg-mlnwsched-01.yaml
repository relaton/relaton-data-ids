  content: "   Large Language Models (LLMs) are pushing the boundaries of\n   technology.
    \ The scale that they have reached currently vastly\n   exceeds the capacity of
    any single compute unit (XPU); this requires\n   a distributed approach where
    multiple XPUs are connected via a\n   \"backend\" network, sometimes in a single
    data center, but\n   increasingly in multiple data centers connected by a \"data
    center\n   interconnect\" (DCI).  We are approaching the point where the scale\n
    \  exceeds that of a single data center, thus requiring multiple such\n   data
    centers connected via a \"data center interconnect\" network.\n   Training and
    inferencing are expensive and critical operations, thus\n   they are typically
    scheduled, i.e., the (compute) resources they need\n   are carefully estimated,
    allocated and deployed so that these\n   resources are efficiently used.  However,
    while compute investment in\n   these LLM processing clusters dwarfs that of networks,
    it is becoming\n   increasingly clear that the latter can greatly impact the former.\n
    \  This has been the focus of recent conferences, including the fantel\n   Birds
    of a Feather meeting in IETF 123, @Scale: Networking 2025 and\n   Open Compute
    Project 2025.\n\n   This memo proposes that the same care that is taken regarding\n
    \  allocation of compute resources to jobs be taken with networking\n   resources:
    that they are estimated, allocated and deployed alongside\n   compute resources;
    that they have contingency plans in case of\n   network glitches; and that a holistic
    view be taken in order to\n   optimize job completion times of training and inferencing
    jobs.\n\n\t "

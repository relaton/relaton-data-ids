abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The CLUE framework document defines the concept of media captures\n
    \  which identify and describe the characteristics of media sent by a\n   provider.
    \ A capture scene is a grouping concept that provides ties a\n   number of captures
    together.  Within the capture scene the media\n   captures may further be grouped
    into capture scene entries.  The\n   current text in the CLUE framework document
    describing these concepts\n   could be improved and clarified so that both providers
    and consumers\n   use the same logic to encode/decode CLUE messages with capture\n
    \  scenes/ capture scene entries and media captures.  This draft\n   discusses
    these concepts and provides suggested updates.\n\n\t "

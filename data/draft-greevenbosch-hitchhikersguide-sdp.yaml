  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SDP) is the subject of numerous\n
    \  specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be\n   difficult
    to locate the right document, or even to determine the set\n   of Request for
    Comments (RFC) about SDP.  This specification serves\n   as a guide to the SDP
    RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot of the\n   specifications under the SDP
    umbrella, briefly summarises each, and\n   groups them into categories.\n\nNote\n\n
    \  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should\n   be
    sent to mmusic@ietf.org.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides an overview or 'roadmap' of the work done by \nthe
    IETF PKIX working group. It describes some of the terminology \nused in the working
    group's documents, and the theory behind an \nX.509-based Public Key Infrastructure,
    Privilege Management \nInfrastructure (PMI), and Time Stamping and Data Certification
    \nInfrastructures. It identifies each document developed by the PKIX \nworking
    group, and describes the relationships among the various \ndocuments. It also
    provides advice to would-be PKIX implementors \nabout some of the issues discussed
    at length during PKIX development, \nin hopes of making it easier to build implementations
    that will \nactually interoperate. \n    \n\n\t "

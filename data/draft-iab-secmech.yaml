  content: "Security must be built into Internet Protocols for those protocols to
    offer their services securely.  Many security problems can be traced to improper
    implementations.  However, even a proper implementation will have security problems
    if the fundamental protocol is itself exploitable.  Exactly how security should
    be implemented in a protocol will vary, because of the structure of the protocol
    itself.  However, there are many protocols for which standard Internet security
    mechanisms, already developed, may be applicable.  The precise one that is appropriate
    in any given situation can vary.  We review a number of different choices, explaining
    the properties of each.\n\t "

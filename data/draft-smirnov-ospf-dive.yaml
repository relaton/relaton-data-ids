  content: "   Many popular topologies for large-scale networks have highly regular\n
    \  structure with distinctive design pattern.  Examples of such\n   topologies
    include hub-and-spoke (also known as \"star\") common in\n   enterprise WAN networks,
    fat-tree and Clos topologies common in\n   datacenters.  For number of reasons
    in such large-scale networks\n   distance-vector protocols perform better than
    OSPF.  On the other\n   hand network backbones have no highly regular topology
    pattern and\n   there OSPF outperforms distance-vector protocols.  As a result
    large-\n   scale networks frequently employ different routing protocols in\n   different
    regions of the network, complicating network operations.\n\n   This document proposes
    OSPF extensions to improve scalability of\n   routing for large-scale networks.\n\n\t "

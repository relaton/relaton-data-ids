  content: "   The Conference Object Manipulation Protocol (COMP) allows to create,\n
    \  change and delete objects related to centralized conferences,\n   including
    participants, their media and their roles.  The protocol\n   relies on web services
    and SIP event notification as its\n   infrastructure, but can control conferences
    that use any signaling\n   protocol to invite users.\n\t "

  content: "For bidirectional lightpaths provisioning, in the case of optical nodes\nthat
    do not support wavelength conversion, it would be necessary to use\nthe same wavelength
    along the route on each direction. In certain \noptical network scenarios, the
    use of the same wavelength on both \ndirections would be advantageous.  For instance,
    some ROADMs may \nadd/drop the same wavelength simultaneously. In other cases,
    the users'\noptical end nodes are equipped with fixed-wavelength transponders.
    \n\nThis document describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling for \nbidirectional
    wavelength lightpaths that require the same wavelength on\nboth directions. By
    using an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC4420],\nthe extensions enable the
    new type lightpaths to support the low cost \nconfiguration at users' optical
    end nodes.\n\t "

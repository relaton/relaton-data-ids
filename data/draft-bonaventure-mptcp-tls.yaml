  content: "   Multipath TCP and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) include several\n
    \  techniques that improve the reliability and the security of data\n   transfers.
    \ In this document we propose Multipath TLS (MPTLS), a\n   tighter coupling between
    TLS and Multipath TCP that provides improved\n   security and reliability in the
    presence of adversaries.  MPTLS would\n   the resilience of existing TLS applications
    to attacks.  It could\n   also serve as a basis for the TCP extension that is
    being discussed\n   within the TCPINC working group to provide unauthenticated
    encryption\n   and integrity protection of TCP streams.\n\n\t "

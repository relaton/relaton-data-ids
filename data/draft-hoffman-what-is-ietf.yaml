  content: "This document gives a more concrete definition of \"the IETF\" as it understood
    today.  Many RFCs refer to \"the IETF\".  Many important IETF documents speak
    of the IETF as if it were an already-defined entity.  However, no IETF document
    correctly defines what the IETF is.  This document specifies an Internet Best
    Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.\n\t "

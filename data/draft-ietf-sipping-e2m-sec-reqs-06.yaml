  script: Latn
  content: "A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) does not always trust
    all intermediaries in its request path to inspect its message bodies and/or headers
    contained in its message.  The UA might want to protect the message bodies and/or
    headers from intermediaries, except those that provide services based on its content.
    \ This situation requires a mechanism called \"end-to-middle security\" to secure
    the information passed between the UA and intermediaries, which does not interfere
    with end-to-end security.  This document defines a set of requirements for a mechanism
    to achieve end-to-middle security.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

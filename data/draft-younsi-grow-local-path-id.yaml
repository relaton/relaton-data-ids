  content: "   Intelligence is required to track BGP paths throughout the various\n
    \  RIBs and VRFs of a routing platform, due to potential attribute\n   modifications
    and the use of BGP multipath.  This document introduces\n   the option to identify
    a path within a router in order to ease\n   correlation in monitoring.  A BMPv4
    TLV is defined in order to\n   communicate this locally significant identifier
    in monitoring\n   messages.\n\n\n\t "

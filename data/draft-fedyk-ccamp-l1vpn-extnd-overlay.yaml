  content: "   This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and defines\n
    \  extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route\n   diversity
    within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge\n   nodes. A particular
    example where route diversity within the core\n   network is desired, are dual-homed
    edge nodes. The document also\n   defines GMPLS UNI extensions to deal with latency
    requirements for\n   edge node initiated LSPs.\n\n   This document is also applicable
    to the L1VPN framework [RFC4847] to\n   extend the L1VPN from the basic mode to
    the enhanced mode by\n   including additional constraints, focusing upon the overlay
    extension\n   service model. Route Diversity for customer LSPs are common\n   requirement
    applicable to L1VPNs. This document describes L1VPN\n   compatible mechanisms
    to achieve diversity for sets of customer LSPs.\n   The extended overlay service
    model can support other extensions for\n   L1VPN signaling, for example, those
    related to latency requirements.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "PACE technology is designed to provide backwards-compatible modifications
    to Ethernet to support multimedia applications.  PACE Technology's Ethernet Interactive
    Access [1] uses a modified 802.3 MAC access algorithm to minimise access latency
    when communicating to standard 802.3 MAC devices.  This access algorithm is documented
    here via pseudo code in a manner similar to the 802.3 MAC standard.\n\t "

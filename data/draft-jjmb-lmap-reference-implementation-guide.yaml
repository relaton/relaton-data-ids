  content: "   This document describes a software architecture and reference\n   implementation
    guidelines for the framework for Large-Scale\n   Measurement of Broadband Performance
    (LMAP).  The IETF-LMAP working\n   group proposed a draft that details a logical
    architecture for\n   performance measurements in broadband networks on a large
    scale.  The\n   IETF-LMAP proposal contains the operational concepts for such
    a\n   platform.  However, since the standardization is in the initial\n   stages
    with no official existing implementation, the proposal leaves\n   many details
    of the specification up to the implementer to discover.\n\n\t "

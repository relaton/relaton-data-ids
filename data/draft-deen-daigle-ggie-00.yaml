  content: "   This document introduces the Glass to Glass Internet Ecosystem\n   (GGIE).
    \ The GGIE goal is to improve how the Internet is used for all\n   video, both
    amateur and professional, reflecting that the line\n   between amature and professional
    video technology is increasinly\n   blurred.  As the Glass to Glass (camera lens
    to viewing screen) name\n   implies GGIE's scope is from the original recording
    by a lens,\n   through the steps of editing, packaging, distributed and searching,\n
    \  and finally viewing.  GGIE is not a complete end to end architecture\n   or
    solution, it is use cases and technical specifications that can\n   serve as foundational
    building blocks for new Internet video\n   innovation.\n\n   This is a companion
    effort to the GGIE W3C Taskforce in the W3C Web\n   and TV Interest Group.\n\n
    \  This document is being discussed on the ggie@ietg.org mailing list.\n\n\t "

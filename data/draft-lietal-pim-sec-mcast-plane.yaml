  content: "This memo proposes a secure multicast plane between PIM-SM domains \nthrough
    a MSDP bridge. The MSDP bridge is the MSDP peering topology \nwith a GRE tunnel
    associated with each pair of MSDP routers. A \nmulticast protocol such as DVMRP,
    PIM-DM or BGMP runs over the MSDP \nbridge to forward secure multicast data in
    the global key space. As \na RP, each security broker in an interested domain
    translates the \ndata from the MSDP bridge to the local domain and forwards the
    data \nin the local key space. \nThis approach is perceived as a transitional
    solution to the \nmulticast security between PIM-SM domains. It will enable group
    \nsecurity association to differ from one shared tree to another, and \nwill essentially
    facilitate group key distribution.\n\n\t "

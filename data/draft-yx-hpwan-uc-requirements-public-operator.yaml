  content: "   Bulk data transfer is a long-lived service over the past twenty\n   years.
    \ High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WANs) are the\n   backbone of global
    network infrastructure, enabling the seamless\n   transfer of vast amounts of
    data and supporting advanced scientific\n   collaborations worldwide.  Many of
    the state-of-the-art dedicated\n   networks have been mentioned in [I-D.kcrh-hpwan-state-of-art].
    \ For\n   non-dedicated networks like public operator's network, the case is\n
    \  different in terms of QoS policies, security policies, etc.  This\n   document
    presents use cases and requirements of HPWAN from public\n   operator's view.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo provides a compilation of existing work performed by or\n
    \  proposed within the IETF, the IRTF, and the IAB that relates to\n   energy
    and sustainability: awareness, management, control, or\n   reduction of energy
    consumption.\n\n   The principal goal of this document is to help IETF, IRTF,
    and IAB\n   participants, especially newcomers and future contributors, become\n
    \  familiar with the body of work already published on energy-related\n   topics.
    \ It provides the first consolidated catalog of such efforts,\n   serving as an
    internal reference and orientation guide.\n\n   In addition, the document raises
    awareness of the Internet’s role in\n   energy efficiency and energy-related activities
    within the IETF,\n   IRTF, and IAB more broadly.  This helps continue identifying
    gaps and\n   investigating solutions where further work may be needed, and also\n
    \  offers background for readers outside the IETF community who may be\n   less
    familiar with how networking technologies contribute to energy\n   savings.\n\n
    \  The scope of this document includes selected work from the IETF,\n   IRTF,
    and IAB where relevant.  This document is descriptive in nature\n   and does not
    propose new work items.\n\n   This document captures work until December 2022,
    when the \"IAB\n   workshop on Environmental Impact of Internet Applications and\n
    \  Systems\" contextualized renewed community interest and discussion of\n   the
    topic.  This memo itself does not recommend or direct future\n   work.\n\n\t "

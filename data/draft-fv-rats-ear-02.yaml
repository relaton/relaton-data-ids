  content: "   This document defines the EAT Attestation Result (EAR) message\n   format.\n\n
    \  EAR is used by a verifier to encode the result of the appraisal over\n   an
    attester's evidence.  It embeds an AR4SI's \"trustworthiness\n   vector\" to present
    a normalized view of the evaluation results, thus\n   easing the task of defining
    and computing authorization policies by\n   relying parties.  Alongside the trustworthiness
    vector, EAR provides\n   contextual information bound to the appraisal process.
    \ This allows a\n   relying party (or an auditor) to reconstruct the frame of
    reference\n   in which the trustworthiness vector was originally computed.  EAR\n
    \  supports simple devices with one attester as well as composite\n   devices
    that are made of multiple attesters, allowing the state of\n   each attester to
    be separately examined.  EAR can also accommodate\n   registered and unregistered
    extensions.  It can be serialized and\n   protected using either CWT or JWT.\n\n\t "

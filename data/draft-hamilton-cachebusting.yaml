  content: "   Cachebusting is the sometimes deliberate, sometimes inadvertant,\n
    \  practice of defeating caching.  This document explains the nature of\n   the
    problem with relation to proxy cache servers using the World-Wide\n   Web's HTTP
    protocol, and outlines some simple measures which may be\n   taken to make an
    HTTP based service more 'cache friendly'.  Since Web\n   caching is still a novel
    concept, we also explain the basic\n   principles behind it.  This document should
    be read by developers of\n   HTTP based products and services - we assume that
    the reader is\n   already familiar with HTTP.\n\n\t "

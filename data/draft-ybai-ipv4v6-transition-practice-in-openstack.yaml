  content: "   OpenStack is a free and open-source software cloud computing\n   platform.
    \ It is primarily deployed as an infrastructure as a service\n   (IaaS) solution.
    \ However, OpenStack is designed mainly for IPv4, it\n   internally uses [RFC1918]
    addresses and heavily relies on NAT to map\n   RFC1918 addresses to public IPv4
    addresses known as floating IP\n   addresses for the external access.  Due to
    the different nature of\n   IPv6 and IPv4, the IPv6 support for the OpenStack
    is still in the\n   early stage.  In this document, two mechanisms are presented
    to\n   provide IPv4/IPv6 dual stack external access for the OpenStack, one\n   scenario
    is internal IPv4 and uses stateful IPv4/IPv6 translator for\n   the external IPv6
    access, and another scenario is internal IPv6 and\n   uses stateless IPv4/IPv6
    translation for the external IPv4 access.\n   Both mechanisms have been deployed
    in CERNET and providing services\n   to the global IPv4/IPv6 Internet.\n\n\t "

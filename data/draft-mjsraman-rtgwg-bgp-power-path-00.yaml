  script: Latn
  content: "   In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power\n
    \  consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between\n   Autonomous
    Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS\n   and then use suitable
    modifications to the BGP path selection\n   algorithm to route the packets along
    the paths. Such low-power paths\n   can be identified by using the available power-to-bandwidth
    (PWR)\n   ratio as an additional parameter in the BGP Path Selection Algorithm.\n
    \  For re-routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the\n   power
    based best path is selected and advertised as per the modified\n   algorithm proposed
    in this document. Extensions to the Border Gateway\n   Protocol (BGP) can be used
    to disseminate the PWR ratio metric among\n   the AS thereby creating a collaborative
    approach to reduce the power\n   consumption. The feasibility of our approaches
    is illustrated by\n   applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet. The
    techniques\n   proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power reduction require\n
    \  minimal modifications to the existing features of the Internet. The\n   proposed
    techniques can be extended to other levels of Internet\n   hierarchy, such as
    Intra-AS paths, through suitable modifications.\n\n\n\n\t "

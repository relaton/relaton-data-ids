abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies an HTTP authentication scheme for use when\ncredentials
    are validated by an out-of-band mechanism (not defined\nhere) and later communicated
    to the server through the use of a\ncookie.  Which out-of-band mechanism should
    be used, and how, is\ndescribed by the 401 (Unauthorized) response body.  It is
    common\npractice that this mechanism is an HTML form, sending the user's\ncredentials
    with the use of an HTTP POST request to a tier URL which\nwill set a cookie in
    response; though this document doesn't preclude\nthe use of other mechanisms.\n\t "

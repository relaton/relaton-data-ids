  content: "   The NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] defines ways to read configuration and\n
    \  state data from a NETCONF server.  In some cases, a client-configured\n   data
    item refers to a non-existent system generated data item\n   (e.g.,the auto-create
    interfaces (\"eth1\") is not yet present).  In\n   many situations, the system
    configured data item doesn't need to be\n   know to the client and client-configured
    data item will automatically\n   be removed from the operational state datastore
    and thus only appear\n   in the intended datastore if client-configured data item
    doesn't\n   exist.  In other situations system configured data item needs to be\n
    \  known and overriden by the client.  Not all server implementations\n   treat
    the system configuration data in the same way.  This document\n   defines a capability-based
    extension to the NETCONF protocol that\n   allows the NETCONF client to identify
    how system configuration are\n   processed by the server, and also defines a new
    mechanism for client\n   control of server processing of system configuration
    data.\n\n\t "

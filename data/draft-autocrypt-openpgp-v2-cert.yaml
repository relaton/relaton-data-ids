abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the "Autocrypt v2 Certificate", a standard structure
    for an OpenPGP certificate for Internet messaging (such as email) that offers
    a defense against both store-now-decrypt-later attacks from quantum computer and
    future key exfiltration attacks. It is also structured to support reasonable in-band
    transmission, using established mechanisms like the Autocrypt header field. This
    document also describes the structure, use, and maintenance of the OpenPGP Transferable
    Secret Key that corresponds with the Autocrypt v2 Certificate.</p>

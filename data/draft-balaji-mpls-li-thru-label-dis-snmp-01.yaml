  content: "   In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label\n   Switching
    (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful\n   Intercept is a key requirement.
    For example, MPLS-based Layer 3 VPN\n   models do not have any provider provisioned
    methods of lawful\n   intercept that are comprehensive, quick and easy to provision
    from\n   one single point. More particularly the auto-provisioning of lawful\n
    \  intercept for all sets of streams travelling between VPN sites and\n   consequent
    re-direction of these streams to the appropriate\n   government network has not
    been covered without multiple instances of\n   having to configure the intercept
    at various points in the network\n   both in the Single-AS case and the Inter-Provider
    VPN case.\n\n   In this paper, we propose a technique which uses a set of pre-defined\n
    \  labels called Lawful Intercept labels and a method for provisioning\n   lawful
    intercept amongst the various PE devices using these labels\n   both in the Single-AS
    and the inter-provider VPN cases. A single\n   point of action is the key to this
    idea. The intercepted traffic is\n   mirrored on a PE or a whole set of PEs or
    on all the PEs\n   participating in the VPN. A technique called the Domino-effect\n
    \  provisioning of these Label-based Provider Provisioned Lawful\n   Intercept
    mechanism is also outlined. This differs from [1] in that\n   there is explicit
    use of a secure SNMP mechanism to provision the\n   labels for Lawful Intercept
    at the various PEs instead of a MP-BGP\n   update.\n\n\t "

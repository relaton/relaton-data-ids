  content: "This document describes an extension to the IS-IS protocol to add\noperational
    capabilities that allow for ease of management and\ncontrol over IP prefix distribution
    within an IS-IS domain.  The IS-\nIS protocol is specified in [1], with extensions
    for supporting IPv4\nspecified in [2] and further enhancements for Traffic Engineering
    [4]\nin [3] and [6].\nThis document enhances the IS-IS protocol by extending the\ninformation
    that a Intermediate System (IS) [router] can place in\nLink State Protocol Data
    Units (LSPs) as specified in [2].  This\nextension will provide operators with
    a mechanism to control IP\nprefix distribution throughout multi-level IS-IS domains.\nAdditionally,
    the information can be placed in LSPs that have TLVs as\nyet undefined, if this
    information is used to convey the same meaning\nin such future TLVs as it is used
    in the currently defined TLVs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Port Control Protocol (PCP) Rapid Recovery allows PCP clients to\n
    \  repair failed mappings within seconds, rather than the minutes or\n   hours
    it might take if they relied solely on waiting for the next\n   routine renewal
    of the mapping.  Mapping failures may occur when a\n   NAT gateway is rebooted
    and loses its mapping state, or when a NAT\n   gateway has its external IP address
    changed so that its current\n   mapping state becomes invalid.\n\n\t "

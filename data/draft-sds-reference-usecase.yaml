  content: "  In IoT, IoE era, the cloud needs to accommodate enormous requests,\n
    \ and also the cloud has to provide unlimited scalability, real-time\n  analysis,
    and workload integration. Thus, inter-cloud storages\n  integration is required
    and a standard for complete integration\n  between cloud and legacy system is
    compulsory. Physical host and\n  storage integration from the perspective of bare
    metal provisioning\n  are also under the spotlight. The SDS is a proper technique
    to fulfil\n  this issue. According to the increasing demand for software defined\n
    \ storage, it is required to develop software defined storage reference\n  model.\n\n\t "

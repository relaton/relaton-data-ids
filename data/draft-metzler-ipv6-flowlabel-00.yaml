  content: "IP version 6 is specified in [1], but it specifies not completely the\nusage
    of the flow label field that is contained in the IPv6 Header.\nThis document specifies
    a potential use of the IPv6 flow label that\nprovide to applications access to
    the flow label so as to distinguish\nbetween several flows within the application.
    This results in basic\nrequirements on the handling of the flow label within the
    network.\n   \n\n\t "

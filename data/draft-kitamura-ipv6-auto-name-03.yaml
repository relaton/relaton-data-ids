  content: "   This document discusses notion and actual mechanisms of\n   \"Corresponding
    Auto Names\" for IPv6 Addresses. With this mechanism,\n   all IPv6 addresses (even
    if they are link-local scoped addresses)\n   can obtain their own Names, and it
    will be able to use Names\n   anywhere instead of IPv6 Addresses.\n\n   IPv6 address
    is too long and complicated to remember, and it is\n   very nuisance to type a
    literal IPv6 address manually as an\n   argument of applications. Also, it is
    very difficult for human\n   beings to tell which IPv6 address is set to which
    actual IPv6 node.\n   In this sense, literal IPv6 address information can be called\n
    \  meaningless information for human beings.\n\n   In order to solve above problems
    and to provide annotated\n   meaningful information to IPv6 addresses, mechanisms
    called\n   Corresponding Auto Names for IPv6 addresses is introduced. They\n   will
    become human friendly information. By applying a simple naming\n   rule to the
    Auto Names (e.g., use the same Auto Name Suffix for\n   IPv6 addresses that are
    set to the same interface (node)), this\n   will contribute to help people to
    understand which IPv6 address /\n   Name indicates which actual IPv6 node and
    provide meaningful\n   information.\n\n\t "

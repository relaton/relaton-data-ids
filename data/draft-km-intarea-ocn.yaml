  content: "   This text formulates a specialized network concept to support\n   communication
    constraints in automated systems.  These specialized\n   networks, formulated
    as Operations and Control networks (OCN), are\n   significant to many application
    scenarios involving the control and\n   monitoring of mechanical and digital devices.
    \ The document defines\n   the OCN reference model, describing the associated
    components,\n   interfaces, and reference points.  The reference model is independent\n
    \  of any specific technology.  Standardized mechanisms will facilitate\n   large-scale
    machine-to-machine communication and help with the\n   integration between OCN
    and the Internet.\n\n\t "

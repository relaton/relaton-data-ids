  content: "   Threshold cryptography schemes are described with application to the\n
    \  Ed25519, Ed448, X25519 and X448 Elliptic Curves.  Threshold key\n   generation
    allows generation of keypairs to be divided between two or\n   more parties with
    verifiable security guaranties.  Threshold\n   decryption allows elliptic curve
    key agreement to be divided between\n   two or more parties such that all the
    parties must co-operate to\n   complete a private key agreement operation.  The
    same primitives may\n   be applied to improve resistance to side channel attacks.\n\n
    \  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/cfrg/\n   (http://whatever)Discussion
    of this draft should take place on the\n   CFRG mailing list (cfrg@irtf.org),
    which is archived at .\n\n\t "

  content: "   RFC 822 [RFC0822] defines many headers which can be applied to email\n
    \  messages and RFC 2076 [RFC2076] provides a simple summary of the\n   commonly
    occurring headers in headings of e-mail messages.  Both of\n   these RFCs define
    the 'In-Reply-To' and 'References' fields - which\n   have since had their definitions
    improved in RFC 2822 [RFC2822] and\n   RFC 1036 [RFC1036] respectively.  These
    fields are used by 'thread\n   capable' email clients to display messages grouped
    together in\n   organised parent/child relationships that enable the reader to
    follow\n   a train of thought or a process of information dissemination.\n\n   However,
    if a reply to such a threaded message does not contain\n   relevant follow-up
    information or is used as a platform to deliver a\n   new message with new subject,
    then that reply is put within the\n   already existing thread.  This is known
    as 'Thread-Jacking'.  This\n   draft proposes a couple of techniques which can
    be undertaken to\n   resolve this issue within the scope of email.\n\t "

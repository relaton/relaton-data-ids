  content: "This  memo expands  on  RFC  1209 by describing how to do discovery and
    routing, both for private (intra-domain) and public  (inter-domain)  applications,
    over the SDMS service.  As such,this memo considers cases where a private network
    is spread  over multiple LISs.   In  particular,  this memo allows hosts or routers
    in different LISs  to  exchange  packets directly--without going through an intervening
    router.\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines BT's requirements for MPLS-TP features based\non
    our current thinking for how we may utilise functionality being\ndefined as part
    of the MPLS-TP standardisation effort within our\nexisting deployed MPLS networks.\n\nThis
    document is not intended to describe all future requirements for\nMPLS-TP features,
    only for those features that we have a currently\ndefined requirement for today
    and which we would like to see priority\nbe given to them when specifying and
    standardising MPLS-TP within\nIETF.  These features are required in order to enable
    us to enhance\nlive, revenue generating services.\n\t "

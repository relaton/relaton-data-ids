  content: "   This draft presents extensions to Constrained Application Protocol\n
    \  (CoAP) to enable RESTful Real-time Live Streaming for improving the\n   Quality
    of Experience (QoE) for delay-sensitive Internet of Things\n   (IoT) applications.
    The overall architecture is termed \"Adaptive\n   RESTful Real-time Live Streaming
    for Things (A-REaLiST)\". It is\n   particularly designed for applications which
    rely on real-time\n   augmented vision through live First Person View (FPV) feed
    from\n   constrained remote agents like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), etc.\n
    \  These extensions provide the necessary hooks to help solution\n   designers
    ensure low-latency transfer of streams and, for contents\n   like video, a quick
    recovery from freeze and corruption without\n   incurring undue lag. A-REaLiST
    is an attempt to provide an\n   integrated approach to maintain the balance amongst
    QoE, resource-\n   efficiency and loss resilience. It provides the necessary hooks
    to\n   optimize system performance by leveraging contextual intelligence\n   inferred
    from instantaneous information segments in flight. These\n   extensions equip
    CoAP with a standard for efficient RESTful\n   streaming for Internet of Things
    (IoT) contrary to HTTP-streaming in\n   conventional Internet.\n\n\t "

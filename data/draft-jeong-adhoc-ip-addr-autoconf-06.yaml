  content: "   This document specifies the steps which a mobile node in the ad hoc\n
    \  network takes in deciding how to autoconfigure its IPv4 or IPv6\n   address
    in its network interface.  Because the ad hoc IP address\n   autoconfiguration
    in this document considers the ad hoc network's\n   partition and mergence, the
    address duplication caused by the ad hoc\n   network's mergence can be resolved
    through an address resolution\n   protocol.  Also, this document specifies how
    to resolve the address\n   duplication in order to guarantee the maintenance of
    upper-layer\n   sessions, such as TCP session.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes previous efforts and their deployment legacy\n
    \  and the requirements for a successful email security infrastructure.\n   A
    gap analysis is performed and the tasks divided into problems that\n   are generally
    considered solved albeit possibly requiring improved\n   execution and problems
    that may be regarded as research.\n\n   This division of the problem space into
    'execution' and 'research'\n   portions allows different groups of developers
    to address each\n   independently and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.
    A testbed\n   for development and early adopter deployment that achieves this\n
    \  separation is described.\n\n\t "

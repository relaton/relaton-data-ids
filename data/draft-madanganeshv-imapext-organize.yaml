  content: "The ORGANIZE extension to Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4] \nspecifies
    the mechanism by which the client can inform the server to \nmaintain the entries
    for the messages to be organized. The \norganization of messages include appending,
    moving to a mailbox, \ndeleting messages, or changing the attributes of received
    messages. \n\nThis extension enables the lightweight IMAP clients to organize
    \ntheir messages on the server side, rather than performing it on the \nclient
    side. In addition to the information on the IMAP ORGANIZE \nextension, this document
    describes implementation of the ORGANIZE \nextension for Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol [SMTP].\n\t "

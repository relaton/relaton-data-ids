  content: "   QUIC is a new transport protocol that provides low-latency\n   communication
    and security.  QUIC's key features include faster\n   connection establishment,
    stream-based multiplexing, improved loss\n   recovery, and no head-of-line blocking.
    \ This document assesses the\n   potential human rights implications emerging
    from the deployment of\n   QUIC.  The assessment is done based on the methodology
    articulated in\n   [RFC8280].\n\n\t "

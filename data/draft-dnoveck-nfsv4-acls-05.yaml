  content: "   This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the\n
    \  description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc5661bis\n   respecification
    effort for NFv4.1.  It describes the structure and\n   function of Access Control
    Lists within all existing minor versions\n   of NFSv4.\n\n   It describes the
    structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their role in the NFSv4\n   security architecture.
    \ While the focus of this document is on the\n   role of ACLs in providing a more
    flexible approach to file access\n   authorization than is made available by the
    POSIX-derived\n   authorization-related attributes, the potential provision of
    other\n   security-related functionality is covered as well.\n\n   [Consensus
    Needed (Item #117a)]: Because of the failure of previous\n   specifications to
    provide a satisfactory approach to either of the\n   two ACL models for which
    support was originally intended, this\n   document clarifies the status of draft
    POSIX ACLs, with the\n   expectation that support for these might be provided
    via a later\n   extension.  In addition, this document will include some small\n
    \  protocol extensions to correct protocol defects, as provided for in\n   RFC8178.\n\n
    \  [Consensus Needed (Item #117a)]: In this document, the relationship\n   among
    the multiple ACL models supported has changed.  A core set of\n   functionality,
    shared in large part with that derived from a subset\n   of the functionality
    provided by the now-withdrawn draft POSIX ACLs\n   is presented as the conceptual
    base of the feature set.  Additional\n   sets of features used to provide the
    functionality within the NFSv4\n   ACL model and the full draft POSIX ACL model
    are considered as\n   OPTIONAL extensions to that core, with the latter not yet
    present in\n   NFsv4.1.\n\n   The current version of the document is intended,
    in large part, to\n   result in working group discussion regarding repairing problems
    with\n   previous specifications of ACL-related features and to enable work to\n
    \  provide a greater degree of interoperability than has been available\n   heretofore.
    \ The drafts provide a framework for addressing these\n   issues and obtaining
    working group consensus regarding necessary\n   changes.\n\n   When the resulting
    document is eventually published as an RFC, it\n   will supersede the descriptions
    of ACL structure and semantics\n   appearing in existing minor version specification
    documents for\n   NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby updating RFC7530 and RFC8881.\n\n\t "

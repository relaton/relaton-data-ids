  content: "   This is an informational document intended to outline what is known\n
    \  about routing stability of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), traffic\n   engineering
    techniques (TE) used in MPLS, and load balancing\n   techniques.  Known stable
    and unstable conditions provide bounds of\n   known behavior.  Network operators
    and equipment suppliers have\n   relied heavily on operational experience as existence
    proof of\n   instability or evidence of apparent stability.  Between the bounds
    of\n   known stable and unstable behavior there may be conditionally stable\n
    \  protocols and deployment scenarios.  There is some discussion of the\n   difficulty
    of mathematical stability proof for some techniques and a\n   challenge to the
    research community.\n\n\t "

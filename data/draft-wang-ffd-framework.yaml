- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The IP-based distributed system and software application layer often\n
    \  use heartbeat to maintain the network topology status.  However, the\n   heartbeat
    setting is long, which prolongs the system fault detection\n   time.  IP-based
    storage network is the typical usage of that\n   scenario.  When the IP-based
    storage network fault occurs, NVMe\n   connections need to be switched over.  Currently,
    no effective method\n   is available for quick detection, switchover is performed
    only based\n   on keepalive timeout, resulting in low performance.\n\n   This
    document defines the basic framework of how network assisted\n   host devices
    can quickly detect application connection failures\n   caused by network faults.\n\n\n\t "

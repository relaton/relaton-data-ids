  script: Latn
  content: "   Many HTTP servers host content from several origins.  HTTP/2\n   [RFC7540]
    permits clients to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a\n   server provided
    that certain conditions are satisfied.  One of these\n   conditions is the inclusion
    of the secondary origin in the\n   certificate provided during the TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]
    handshake.\n\n   In many cases, origins will wish to maintain separate certificates\n
    \  for different origins but still desire the benefits of a shared HTTP\n   connection.
    \ This draft describes how frames which were defined to\n   transfer client certificates
    might be used to provide additional\n   server certificates as well.\n\n\t "

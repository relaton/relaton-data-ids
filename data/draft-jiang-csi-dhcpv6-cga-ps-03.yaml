  content: "This document describes potential issues in the interaction between \nDHCPv6
    and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs). Firstly, the \nscenario of using
    CGAs in DHCPv6 environments is discussed.\nSome \noperations are clarified for
    the interaction of DHCPv6 servers and \nCGA-associated hosts. We then also discuss
    how CGAs and DHCPv6 may \nhave mutual benefits for each other, including using
    CGAs in DHCPv6 \noperations to enhance its security features and using DHCPv6
    to \nprovide the CGA generation function.\n\t "

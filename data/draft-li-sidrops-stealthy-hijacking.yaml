- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes how incomplete adoption of Route Origin\n   Validation
    (ROV) makes certain forms of BGP hijacking less visible on\n   the control plane
    while still capable of diverting traffic.  We\n   explain the underlying mechanism,
    define the form of the threat,\n   analyze an real-world incident that exemplifies
    the issue, and\n   discuss potential countermeasures to mitigate its impact.\n\n\t "

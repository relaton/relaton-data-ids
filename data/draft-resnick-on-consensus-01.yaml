  content: "   The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through\n
    \  a consensus process, taking into account the different views among\n   IETF
    participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on\n   technical matters.
    \ In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run\n   by a \"majority rules\"
    philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals\n   like \"humming\" instead of
    voting.  However, more and more of our\n   actions are now indistinguishable from
    voting, and quite often we are\n   letting the majority win the day.  This document
    is a collection of\n   thoughts on what rough consensus is, how we have gotten
    away from it,\n   and the things we can do in order to really achieve rough consensus.\n\n
    \     Note: This document contains the musings of an individual.  Right\n      now,
    it is just some rough notes and has lots of holes that need\n      to be filled
    in.  Even if those holes are filled, in its current\n      form, it is not intended
    to be published as an RFC, let alone\n      being a BCP for a change of IETF policy.
    \ If it evolves into such\n      a thing, great.  If it simply sparks discussion
    as an Internet\n      Draft, that's a perfectly fine outcome.\n\n\t "

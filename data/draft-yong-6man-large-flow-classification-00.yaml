abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bit\nrate flows
    (large flow) and huge amount of very low bit flows\n(small flow), which causes
    uneven load balance over ECMP paths.\nDifferentiating large flow and small flow
    packets in IP/MPLS\nnetworks enables enhanced ECMP transport. Enhanced ECMP applies\ndifferent
    distribution methods to large flow packets and small\nflow packets to improve
    the load balance. The classification also\nenables an effective congestion control.
    This draft proposes large\nflow classification in IPv6 protocol for this purpose.\n\t "

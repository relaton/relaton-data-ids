  content: "   Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's\n
    \  communications or activities.  Surveillance is one of several privacy\n   /security
    threats engineers try to take into account in their\n   designs.  The reports
    about pervasive monitoring of Internet traffic\n   have, however, surprised many
    since the scale was not envisaged\n   during the design of many Internet protocols.
    \ The approach to get\n   access to meta-data as well as to communication content
    has taken\n   forms that are largely indistinguishable from ordinary attacks.\n\n
    \  This document explains the attacks in context of the larger Internet\n   eco-system.\n\n\t "

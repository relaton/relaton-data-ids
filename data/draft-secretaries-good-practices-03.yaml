  content: "   The Working Group Secretary's role was succinctly defined in RFC\n
    \  2418. However, this role has greatly evolved and increased both in\n   value
    and scope since the writing of RFC 2418. This document updates\n   RFC 2418 by
    providing a new definition of the Working Group\n   Secretary's role. This document
    also provides a compilation of good\n   practices and some general guidelines
    regarding the fulfilment of the\n   role.\n\n   This document is intended for
    established Working Group Secretaries,\n   individuals desirous of taking up that
    role, or anyone else simply\n   interested in understanding better the Working
    Group Secretary's\n   role. This document may also be useful for Working Group
    Chairs to\n   better appreciate and help develop the value of Working Group\n
    \  Secretaries.\n\n\t "

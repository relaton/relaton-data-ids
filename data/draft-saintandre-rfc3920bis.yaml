  content: "This document defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging\nand
    Presence Protocol (XMPP), a technology for streaming Extensible\nMarkup Language
    (XML) elements for the purpose of exchanging\nstructured information in close
    to real time between any two or more\nnetwork-aware entities.  XMPP provides a
    generalized, extensible\nframework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon
    which a variety\nof applications can be built.  The framework includes methods
    for\nstream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a\nclient
    to a server and of one server to another server, and\nprimitives for push-style
    messages, publication of network\navailability information (\"presence\"), and
    request-response\ninteractions.  This document also specifies the format for XMPP\naddresses,
    which are fully internationalizable.\n\nThis document obsoletes RFC 3920.\n\t "

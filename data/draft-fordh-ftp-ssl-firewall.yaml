  content: "This document discusses some of the issues with running FTP, secured\n
    \  with TLS as defined in [FTP-TLS], through firewalls.  FTP is known to\n   be
    a bit of a problem for firewalls (see [RFC-1579] for a discussion\n   of normal
    FTP and firewalls).  Some of the problems have been fixed\n   by adding intelligence
    into the firewall.  With secured FTP, where\n   the control connection is encrypted,
    some of these techniques fail.\n\n   Whilst this document confines itself to issues
    of FTP over TLS, the\n   issues will probably be relevant for most secured FTP
    protocols that\n   conform to [RFC-2228].  Some of the discussions will also be
    relevant\n   to any protocol that firewalls do clever things with.\n\t "

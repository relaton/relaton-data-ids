  content: "This document reports a proposal for semantics of SIP spam scoring in\norder
    to achieve a flexible signalling standardization allowing an\nincremental adoption
    of the scoring mechanism.  This approach can\ngive early experimental implementers
    the possibility to start using\nspam scoring extensions in an explorative fashion
    without running\ninto interoperability problems.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a high-level technical description of the xvc\n
    \  video codec.  The xvc video codec is a novel video codec that was\n   released
    in its first version in September 2017.  This document\n   provides some technical
    information as well as a discussion section\n   around how the xvc codec meets
    the objectives of the NETVC Working\n   Group.  The document also includes results
    comparing the second\n   version of xvc with AV1 and HM for three different test
    cases; All-\n   Intra, single pass Random-Access, and multi-pass Random-Access.\n
    \  Results are also presented for the full xvc codec relative to the\n   royalty-free
    baseline profile of xvc.\n\n\t "

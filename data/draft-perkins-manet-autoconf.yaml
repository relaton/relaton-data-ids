  content: "If a node lacks an IP address, it cannot yet participate in ad hoc\nnetworks
    as currently designed, because the connectivity in an ad hoc\nnetwork is typically
    determined by mechanisms that depend upon using\nthe IP address as the identifier
    for the nodes in the ad hoc network.\nIn this document, a mechanism by which a
    node in an ad hoc network\nmay autoconfigure an IP address which is unique throughout
    the\nconnected portion of the ad hoc network is specified.  Specifically,\nmechanisms
    for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks, which are isolated from\nInternet connectivity,
    are described.\n\n\t "

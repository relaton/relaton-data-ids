  content: "This draft specifies Web Address Translation (WAT) mechanism. The\nscheme
    allows user to hide or rewrite the backend (and internal)\ndomain addresses. The
    scheme is based on a suite of URL translation\nschemes without requiring any of
    the backend application servers to be \nreconfigured This allows to host multiple
    applications on different \nvirtual servers via a single domain. The analogy is
    similar to NAT \nexcept that the proposed implementation scheme operates at the
    web \napplication layer and brings the value of web address translation \nmechanism
    up into the network than doing the functions only in the \nweb servers at the
    end point.\n\t "

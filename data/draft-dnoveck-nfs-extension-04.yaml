  content: "   This document surveys the processes by which the NFS protocols have\n
    \  been extended in the past, including all of the NFS major and minor\n   versions.
    \ It also looks forward to methods of protocol extension\n   that might be used
    by NFS in the future.\n\n   A particular focus is on how the minor versioning
    model of NFSv4 has\n   worked and what is being done to enhance version management
    within\n   NFSv4.  The work already done in the new NFSv4 version management\n
    \  document is summarized, and there is a discussion of further issues\n   the
    working group will need to address in moving that work forward.\n\n\t "

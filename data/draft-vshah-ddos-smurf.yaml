- language: en

  content: "Host Requirements RFC1122 states that an ICMP Echo Request destined\nto
    an IP broadcast or IP multicast address MAY be silently\ndiscarded. By discarding
    all broadcast ICMP Echo Requests, the end\nuser may lose valuable diagnostic capability.
    By forwarding some\nbroadcast ICMP Echo Requests, the host may be used as launching\nplatform
    for Smurf Attacks[1]. This draft describes a solution for\nselectively dropping
    broadcast ICMP Echo Requests based on whether\nthe source address is within the
    network or from outside the\nnetwork. Any host implementing this solution ensures
    that it does\nnot participate in a Smurf attack irrespective of whether responding\nto
    broadcast ICMP Echo Requests is enabled or disabled on it. \n\n\t "

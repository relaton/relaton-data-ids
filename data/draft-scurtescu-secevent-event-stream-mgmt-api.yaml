  content: "   Security Event Token (SET) delivery requires event receivers to\n   indicate
    to event transmitters the subjects about which they wish to\n   receive events,
    and how they wish to receive them.  This\n   specification defines an HTTP API
    for a basic control plane that\n   event transmitters can implement and event
    receivers may use to\n   manage the flow of events from one to the other.\n\n\t "

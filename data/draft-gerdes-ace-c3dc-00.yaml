  content: "   Resource-constrained nodes come in various sizes and shapes and often\n
    \  have constraints on code size, state memory, processing capabilities,\n   user
    interface, power and communication bandwidth (RFC 7228).\n\n   This document specifies
    a profile that describes how two autonomous\n   resource-constrained devices,
    a client and a server, obtain the\n   required keying material and authorization
    information to securely\n   communicate with each other.  Each of the devices
    is coupled with a\n   less-constrained device, the authorization manager, that
    helps with\n   difficult authentication and authorization tasks.  The constrained\n
    \  devices do not need to register with authorization managers from\n   other
    security domains.  The profile specifically targets constrained\n   clients and
    servers.  It is designed to consider the security\n   objectives of the owners
    on the server and the client side.\n\n\t "

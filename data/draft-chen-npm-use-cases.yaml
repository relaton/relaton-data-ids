  content: "   As networks continue to scale, we need a coordinated effort for\n   diagnosing
    control plane health issues in heterogeneous environments.\n   Traditionally,
    operators developed internal solutions to address the\n   identification and remediation
    of control plane health issues, but as\n   networks increase in size, speed and
    dynamicity, new methods and\n   techniques will be required.\n\n   This document
    highlights key network health issues, as well as\n   network planning requirements,
    identified by leading network\n   operators.  It also provides an overview of
    current art and\n   techniques that are used, but highlights key deficiencies
    and areas\n   for improvement.\n\n   This document proposes a unified management
    framework for\n   coordinating diagnostics of control plane problems and optimization\n
    \  of network design.  Furthermore, it outlines requirements for\n   collecting,
    storing and analyzing control plane data, to minimise or\n   negate control plane
    problems that may significantly affect overall\n   network performance and to
    optimize path/peering/policy planning for\n   meeting application-specific demands.\n\n\n\t "

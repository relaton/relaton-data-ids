abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Recently there has been renewed interest in an old idea: Issue\n   certificates
    with short validity periods and forego revocation\n   processing, reasoning that
    expiration is a sufficient replacement for\n   revocation as long as that expiration
    is not too far off.\n\n   This document covers considerations, both security and
    operational,\n   for using such Short Term Auto Renewed (STAR) certificates for\n
    \  various scenarios where Using a revocation protocol is considered\n   inappropriate.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes procedures that enhance OSPF Traffic\nEngineering
    (TE) extensions for advertising a router's local\naddresses.  This is needed to
    enable other routers in a network to\ncompute traffic engineered MPLS LSPs to
    a given router's local\naddresses.  Currently, the only addresses belonging to
    a router that\nare advertised in TE LSAs are the router's local addresses on links\nenabled
    for TE, and the Router ID.\n\t "

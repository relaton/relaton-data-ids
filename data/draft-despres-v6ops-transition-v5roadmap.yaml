  content: "   This document introduces a new approach intended to lead to a simple\n
    \  roadmap from the IPv4 Internet to a pure IPv6 one.\n\n   With it, applications,
    protocol stacks and customer edge devices need\n   only one standardized intermediate
    v5 version between v4 and v6.\n\n   Internet service providers upgrade their v4
    service to two\n   intermediate services: one with a v4 address and a v6 prefix,
    and one\n   with only a v6 prefix but with access to transition tools within the\n
    \  network.  Provision is also made for a standardized upgrade of 3GPP\n   networks.\n\t "

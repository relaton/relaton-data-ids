  content: "   This is an extension to the XDR specification to allow for bits to
    be\n   described and sent.\n\n   With protocols that have a large number of boolean
    values the\n   existing standard requires each to be individually packed into
    a\n   32-bit value.\n\n   This addition does not alter any existing XDR data streams
    or effect\n   existing implementations.\n\n   *  This specification describes
    how to pack a bit-boolean and short\n      bit-width data values into the 32-bit
    XDR block chunks.\n\n   *  And this specification describes how to describe them
    by extending\n      \"The XDR Language Specification\" to include bits.\n\n   *
    \ And a new namespace declaration type is specified to aid in the\n      reduction
    of name collisions in large projects.\n\n   While in draft status, a new Open
    Source XDR generation tool is being\n   developed [xdrgen].\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Currently, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed multicast routing\n   protocol
    in the Internet.  However in IPv6 this multicast protocol\n   lacks a simple connectivity
    debugging tool, making it difficult to\n   identify multicast routing problems.
    \ When a host wants to receive a\n   multicast group or channel, if the corresponding
    PIM-Join message\n   cannot be propagated in the network, nothing exists to inform
    the\n   receiver or the network about this failure.  We propose a simple\n   error
    notification message based on ICMP/ICMP6 which is able to\n   indicate where and
    why the error happened in the network without\n   using a multicast traceroute
    mechanism.\n\n\t "

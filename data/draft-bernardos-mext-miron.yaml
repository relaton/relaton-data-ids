  content: "The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam\nand
    attach to different access networks without disrupting the\nongoing sessions that
    nodes of the network may have.  By extending\nthe Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile
    Routers, nodes of the network are\nnot required to support any kind of mobility,
    since packets must go\nthrough the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional
    tunnel.\nCommunications from/to a mobile network have to traverse the Home\nAgent,
    and therefore better paths may be available.  Additionally,\nthis solution adds
    packet overhead, due to the encapsulation.\n\nThis document describes an approach
    to the Route Optimisation for\nNEMO, called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation for
    NEMO (MIRON).  MIRON\nenables mobility-agnostic nodes within the mobile network
    to directly\ncommunicate (i.e. without traversing the MRHA bi-directional tunnel)\nwith
    Correspondent Nodes.  The solution is based on the Mobile Router\nperforming the
    Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling on behalf of\nthe nodes of the mobile
    network.\n\nThis document (in an appendix) also analyses how MIRON fits each of\nthe
    currently identified NEMO Route Optimisation requirements for\nOperational Use
    in Aeronautics and Space Exploration.\n\t "

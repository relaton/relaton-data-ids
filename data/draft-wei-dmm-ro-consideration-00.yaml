  content: "   Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) is designed to be a distributed\n
    \  and scalable mobility management solution, and providing optimal\n   route
    for traffics is one of DMM's aims.  There have been several\n   proposals on DMM
    framework, and this document provides discussion on\n   how to optimize traffic
    routes, and aims to provide suggestioins on\n   how to avoid long route in DMM
    network.\n\n\t "

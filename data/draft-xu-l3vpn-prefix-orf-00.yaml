  content: "   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for\n
    \  BGP, refered to as \"VPN Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter\", that\n   can
    be used to perform VPN address-prefix-based route filtering.\n   This ORF-type
    supports prefix-length- or range-based matching, wild-\n   card-based address
    prefix matching, as well as the exact address\n   prefix matching for VPN address
    families.  The VPN Address Prefix ORF\n   is applicable in the context of Virtual
    Subnet and may also be\n   applicable in other BGP/MPLS IP VPN environments.\n\n\t "

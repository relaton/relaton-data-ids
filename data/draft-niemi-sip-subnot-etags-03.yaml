  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables\n   receiving
    asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP\n   user agents.  This
    framework defines the procedures for creating,\n   refreshing and terminating
    subscriptions, as well as fetching and\n   periodic polling of resource state.
    \ These procedures have a serious\n   deficiency in that they do not allow state
    to persist over a\n   subscription refresh, or between two consecutive polls.
    \ This\n   inability to suppress notifications of state already known to the\n
    \  subscriber results in superfluous traffic in the network.  This memo\n   defines
    an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to\n   condition the subscription
    request to whether the state has changed\n   since the previous notification was
    received.  When such a condition\n   is true, either the body of an event notification
    or the entire\n   notification message is suppressed.\n\t "

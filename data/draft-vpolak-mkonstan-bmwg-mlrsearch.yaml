- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes changes to [RFC2544], specifically to packet\n
    \  throughput search methodology, by defining a new search algorithm\n   referred
    to as Multiple Loss Ratio search (MLRsearch for short).\n   Instead of relying
    on binary search with pre-set starting offered\n   load, it proposes a novel approach
    discovering the starting point in\n   the initial phase, and then searching for
    packet throughput based on\n   defined packet loss ratio (PLR) input criteria
    and defined final\n   trial duration time.  One of the key design principles behind\n
    \  MLRsearch is minimizing the total test duration and searching for\n   multiple
    packet throughput rates (each with a corresponding PLR)\n   concurrently, instead
    of doing it sequentially.\n\n   The main motivation behind MLRsearch is the new
    set of challenges and\n   requirements posed by NFV (Network Function Virtualization),\n
    \  specifically software based implementations of NFV data planes.\n   Using [RFC2544]
    in the experience of the authors yields often not\n   repetitive and not replicable
    end results due to a large number of\n   factors that are out of scope for this
    draft.  MLRsearch aims to\n   address this challenge in a simple way of getting
    the same result\n   sooner, so more repetitions can be done to describe the\n
    \  replicability.\n\n\t "

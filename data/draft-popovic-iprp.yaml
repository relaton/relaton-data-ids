  content: "   Reliable packet delivery within stringent delay-constraints is of\n
    \  paramount importance to mission-critical computer applications with\n   hard
    real-time constraints. Because retransmission and coding\n   techniques counteract
    the delay requirements, reliability may be\n   achieved through replication over
    multiple fail-independent paths.\n   Existing solutions, such as the parallel
    redundancy protocol (PRP),\n   replicate all packets at the MAC layer over parallel
    paths. PRP works\n   best in local area networks. However, it is not viable for
    IP\n   networks that are a key element of emerging mission-critical systems.\n
    \  This limitation, coupled with diagnostic inability and lack of\n   security,
    renders PRP unsuitable for reliable data-delivery in these\n   IP networks. To
    address this issue, we present a transport-layer\n   solution: the IP parallel
    redundancy protocol (iPRP). Designing iPRP\n   poses non-trivial challenges in
    the form of selective packet-\n   replication, soft-state and multicast support.
    iPRP replicates only\n   time-critical unicast or multicast UDP traffic. iPRP
    requires no\n   modifications to the existing monitoring application, end-device\n
    \  operating system or to the intermediate network devices. It only\n   requires
    a simple software installation on the end-devices. iPRP has\n   a set of diagnostic
    tools for network debugging. With our\n   implementation of iPRP in Linux, we
    show that iPRP supports multiple\n   flows with minimal processing-and-delay overhead.
    It is being\n   installed in our campus smart-grid network and is publicly available.\n\n\n\t "

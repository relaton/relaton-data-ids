  content: "In order to deploy a residential telephone service at very large \nscale
    across different domains, it is necessary for trusted elements \nowned by different
    service providers to exchange trusted information \nthat conveys customer-specific
    information and expectations about the \nparties involved in the call.  This document
    describes private \nextensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (RFC3261)
    for \nsupporting the exchange of customer information and billing \ninformation
    between trusted entities in the PacketCable Distributed \nCall Signaling Architecture.
    \ These extensions provide mechanisms for \naccess network coordination to prevent
    theft of service, customer \noriginated trace of harassing calls, support for
    operator services \nand emergency services, and support for various other regulatory
    \nissues.  The use of the extensions is only applicable within closed \nadministrative
    domains, or among federations of administrative \ndomains with previously agreed-upon
    policies where coordination of \ncharging and other functions is required.  \n\n\t "

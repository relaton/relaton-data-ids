  script: Latn
  content: "   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different\n   applications
    while maximizing network resources usage, there's\n   growing business pressure
    to minimize operational tasks and the\n   deployment time of new services.\n\n
    \  New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals,\n   including
    the optimization of network functions through application\n   control. This control
    could be signaled directly by an application,\n   through a proxy or orchestrated
    in a centralized manner.\n\n   The current version of the Shared Unified Policy
    Automation (SUPA)\n   group charter identifies two fields where standardization
    would be\n   desirable for operators: the definition of a generic model for the\n
    \  description of network topologies at any layer and with any degree\n   of granularity,
    and the definition of a standardized model for\n   applications to push policies
    toward a central network controller.\n   The first of these topics, the topology
    modeling, is meant to\n   support the definition and application of the second.
    The present\n   memo analyses the current state of the art of the industries\n
    \  regarding these two topics and discusses whether an IETF\n   standardization
    is desirable and for which reasons.\n\n\t "

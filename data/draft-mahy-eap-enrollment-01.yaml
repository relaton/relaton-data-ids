  content: "This document introduces a new EAP Method intended to automatically\nenroll
    clients with minimal user interaction in a wireless LAN\nenvironment.  The enrollment
    process involves the client providing\nweak possibly temporary credentials and
    the server providing stronger\npersistent credentials, both stages over a TLS-protected
    channel.\n\n\t "

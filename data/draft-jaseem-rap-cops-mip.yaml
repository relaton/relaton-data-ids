  content: "Mobile IP is a protocol that is used to achieve transparent routing \nof
    IP packets to a mobile node. A mobile node obtains a care-of-\naddress in the
    foreign network and registers that address with the \nhome agent. The home agent
    as well as the foreign agent can apply \npolicies to the mobile node registration.
    This draft defines COPS \n[1] usage for Mobile IPv4 [2]. It describes how COPS
    is used to \ncontrol Mobile IP registration based on policies. It defines the
    \ninteractions between the PEP and the PDP to handle Mobile IP \nregistration
    messages. It also provides a guideline for mobility \nagents on how to use this
    COPS client with regards to the \nregistration messages.\n\t "

  content: "    PPP multiplexing is a technique to encapsulate and carry multiple\n
    \   subframes inside a single PPP superframe as defined in RFC3153. With\n    the
    existing Muxing mechanism, the carrier superframes waits for\n    certain time
    for the incoming frames to be multiplexed, but this\n    wait period may have
    impact on the delay constrains for the\n    subframes. On the other hand lesser
    wait period for superframes so\n    as to reduce the delay means lesser multiplexing
    efficiency.  This\n    document describe a method to achive maximum multiplexing
    efficiency\n    for PPP Multiplexing over a link especially during low and medium\n
    \   traffic scenarios with out effecting the delay constraints required\n    for
    different types of traffic over that link.\n\n    With priority multiplexing technique
    delay for real time traffic\n    during Multiplexing can be reduced, still assuring
    maximum\n    Multiplexing efficiency\n\n\t "

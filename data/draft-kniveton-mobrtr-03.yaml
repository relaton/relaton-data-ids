  content: "This document describes how to support mobile networks with Mobile\nIP
    or Mobile IPv6 using reverse tunneling.  It provides this support\ncapability
    with no modifications to Mobile IP or routing protocol\nsignaling, but also defines
    new extensions to ease in the implementation\nof network mobility.  There are
    two described scenarios of mobile router\nsupport, consumer mode, and fully enabled
    mode.  In the former, the\nmobile router is not allowed to use routing protocol
    signaling with the\nhome agent, but performs routing for subnet(s) assigned to
    it.  In the\nlatter mode, both the home agent and the mobile router use a routing\nprotocol
    in the same manner as fixed routers.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Report extensions to the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) are\n
    \  defined to support new modes of operation for the protocol.  This\n   includes
    a batched submission mode where an intermediary can collect\n   reports prior
    to settling on an exact task configuration.  It also\n   includes more flexibility
    for modes where a differential privacy\n   mechanism is applied as part of the
    aggregation process.  Report\n   extensions bind the content of reports to the
    chosen options to\n   ensure that the guarantees that both DAP and differential
    privacy\n   provide are maintained.\n\n\t "

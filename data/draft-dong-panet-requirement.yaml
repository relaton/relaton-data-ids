  content: "   Energy consumption of networks is rising fast, which results in the\n
    \  increase of network operational costs.  There are emerging demands\n   from
    operators for power-aware networking (PANET) which could\n   adaptively reduce
    the network energy consumption when possible.  This\n   document presents the
    requirements which should be considered in\n   building a power aware network.\n\n\n\t "

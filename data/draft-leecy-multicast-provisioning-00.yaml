  content: "This document proposes methods to provision resources for multicast\ngroups.
    \ It proposes mechanisms that allow multicast delivery paths\nto be constructed
    along paths that have been statically provisioned\nfor multicast traffic. In addition
    to static provisioning, it allows\nresources to be provisioned dynamically to
    overcome the difficulties\nin predicting and provisioning a priori, the amount
    of resources\nrequired for dynamic multicast groups.\n\nTo prevent the problem
    of data being multicasted on a path which has\nnot been provisioned for the service
    level that data is being\ntransmitted :  i) when resources are dynamically provisioned
    they are\nprovisioned at the same time as the distribution path is setup,\notherwise
    ii) multicast delivery paths are only constructed on paths\nalready provisioned
    statically.\n\t "

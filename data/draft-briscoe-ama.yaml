  content: "This paper presents an approach for solving the inherent problem with\nmulticast
    routing scalability - by co-operation between end-systems and\nthe network. We
    introduce an extremely efficient, elegant way to name\narbitrary sized inter-meshed
    aggregations of multicast addresses. This\nis done in such a way that it is easy
    to calculate how to change the\nname to encompass many more related names. We
    describe how these\naggregate names could be used anywhere in place of the set
    of addresses\nto which they refer, not by resolving them into multiple operations,
    but\nby a single bulk action throughout the routing tree, and in session\ndescriptions
    potentially including those for reservations. Initial\naggregation in end-systems
    might only reduce the problem by an order of\nmagnitude, but it is believed that
    this will provide sufficient\nstructure for routers to be able to recognise further
    aggregation\npotential.  To improve the chances of router aggregation, address
    set\nallocation schemes must fulfil certain criteria that are laid down in\nthis
    paper.\n\t "

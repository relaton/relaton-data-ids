  content: "SECSH defines an authentication mechanism that is based on public\nkeys,
    but does not define any mechanism for key distribution.\nNo common key management
    solution exists in current implementations.\nThis document describes a channel
    that can be used to configure\npublic keys in an implementation-independent fashion,
    allowing\nclient software to take on the burden of this configuration.\nThe public
    key channel provides a server-independent mechanism\nfor clients to add public
    keys, remove public keys, and list\nthe current public keys known by the server.
    Rights to manage\npublic keys are specific and limited to the authenticated user.\nA
    public key may also be associated with a mandatory command.\n\t "

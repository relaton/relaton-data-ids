  content: "   Mobile peers exchange signals with networks, for both wireline and\n
    \  wireless domains, to negotiate capabilities for mobile registration,\n   connection
    management, session establishment, service provisioning,\n   etc.  Generally,
    mobility capabilities include the supported and\n   provisioned resources along
    with associated protocols for certain\n   mobility management scenarios.  While
    devices in the mobile wireline\n   (IP) domain would mostly focus on the IP-related
    negotiation, devices\n   in the wireless domain, e.g., the 5G system (5GS), embrace
    both\n   mobile IP-related resources as well as wireless-specific\n   capabilities.
    \ Regarding both the mobile-IP and wireless domains, we\n   have generalized two
    protocol categories for mobility capability\n   negotiation & management, i.e.,
    the host-initiated category that\n   involves the direct & active engagement of
    mobile end devices vs. the\n   network-based category over which mobile endpoints
    play almost no\n   role in the process.  The classification and then the application
    of\n   the two categories help us analyze the mobility capability\n   negotiation
    for both the mobile IPv6 and the 3GPP 5G system.  The\n   comparison of the capability
    negotiation under both the Home-Routed\n   (HR) and the Local BreakOut (LBO) roaming
    cases in 5GS further\n   reflects the feasibility of the protocol dichotomy.\n\n\t "

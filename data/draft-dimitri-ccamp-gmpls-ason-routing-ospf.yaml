  content: "The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to \n
    \  control different switching technologies as well as different \n   applications.
    These include support for requesting TDM connections \n   including SONET/SDH
    and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). \n    \n   This document provides the extensions
    of the OSPFv2 Link State \n   Routing Protocol to meet the routing requirements
    for an \n   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by ITU-T.\n\t "

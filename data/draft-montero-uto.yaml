abstract:
- content: "<p>Unified Transition Overlay (UTO) is a gateway-based IPv4/IPv6 translation
    proxy that enables cross-version connectivity without requiring encapsulation,
    new protocol headers, or modifications to end-host stacks. UTO operates exclusively
    at transition gateways, which translate packet headers between IPv4 and IPv6 and
    update transport-layer checksums to preserve end-to-end correctness. By confining
    translation logic to gateways, UTO allows the underlying network to remain purely
    IPv4 or purely IPv6, facilitating incremental deployment within existing routing
    and forwarding infrastructures. UTO also supports incremental checksum update
    to reduce processing overhead for TCP and UDP traffic.</p>"

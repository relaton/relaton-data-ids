abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Unified Transition Overlay (UTO), a minimal
    encapsulation mechanism designed to enable bidirectional communication between
    IPv4-only and IPv6-only hosts without requiring NAT64, DNS64, heavy protocol translation,
    or global changes to Internet routing. UTO introduces a compact 12-byte header
    that carries a Remote Native Address (RNA) and allows a packet to traverse a network
    whose forwarding plane uses the opposite IP version. The underlying network remains
    purely IPv4 or purely IPv6, ensuring compatibility with existing hardware and
    reducing operational complexity.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Unified Transition Overlay (UTO), a gateway-
    based IPv4/IPv6 translation proxy that enables communication between IPv4-only
    and IPv6-only hosts without packet encapsulation, new protocol headers, or changes
    to end-host network stacks. UTO operates exclusively at transition gateways that
    translate packets between IPv4 and IPv6 and update transport-layer checksums to
    preserve TCP and UDP correctness. Incremental checksum update is supported to
    reduce processing overhead. The underlying network remains purely IPv4 or purely
    IPv6, allowing UTO to be incrementally deployed using existing routing and forwarding
    infrastructure.</p>"

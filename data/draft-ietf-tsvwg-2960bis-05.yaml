  content: "This document obsoletes RFC 2960 and RFC 3309. It describes the Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of
    broader applications.\n\n SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top
    of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services
    to its users:\n\n -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data,\n\n
    -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size,\n\n -- sequenced
    delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival
    delivery of individual user messages,\n\n -- optional bundling of multiple user
    messages into a single SCTP packet, and\n\n -- network-level fault tolerance through
    supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association.\n\n The design
    of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding
    and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

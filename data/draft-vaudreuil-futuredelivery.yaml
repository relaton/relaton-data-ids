  content: "This memo defines an extension to the SMTP submission protocol for a client
    to indicate a future time for the message to be released for delivery.  This extension
    permits a client to use server-based storage for a message that should be held
    in queue until an appointed time in the future.  This is useful for clients which
    do not have local storage or are otherwise unable to release a message for delivery
    at an appointed time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

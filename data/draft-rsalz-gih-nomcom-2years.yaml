  content: "   Each year the NomCom process is actually two processes -- finding out\n
    \  anew how to be a NomCom and conduct its business, and then\n   undertaking
    the work of the NomCom in selecting individuals to\n   undertake the various roles
    for which the NomCom has responsibility.\n   This applies to both the chair and
    to the voting volunteer members of\n   the NomCom.\n\n   The inclusion of the
    past chair into the NomCom as a non-voting\n   member mitigates this to some extent,
    but the past chair is\n   constrained as to the level of advice that can be offerred.
    \ This\n   acts an impediment to making concrete changes for future incarnations\n
    \  of the Nomcom that would improve the overall Nomcom process.\n\n   The NomCom
    process could benefit from greater levels of continuity\n   from year-to-year
    to reduce the amount of time taken to by the new\n   Nomcom to define its intended
    mode of operation and allow the\n   operation each incarnation of the Nomcom with
    a greater level of\n   consistency.\n\n   This document changes the term of office
    for NomCom voting volunteers\n   from one to two years.  It also changes the term
    of office for the\n   NomCom Chair from two to three.\n\n\t "

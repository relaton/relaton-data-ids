  content: "   This document proposes a novel network address encoding scheme,\n   called
    Network Geoidentifier (NGID), which aims to improve the\n   efficiency and accuracy
    of network device management by directly\n   embedding geolocation information
    (latitude and longitude) into IPv6\n   and IPv4 addresses.\n\n   This approach
    provides a native support for the geolocation of\n   network devices and is expected
    to have a significant impact on the\n   future of network management and service
    positioning.\n\n\t "

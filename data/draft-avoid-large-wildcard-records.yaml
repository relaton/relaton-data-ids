abstract:
- content: "<p>As DNS hosting becomes increasingly centralized, with multiple zones
    hosted on shared authoritative name servers, the risk of DNS amplification attacks
    has grown. By crafting large DNS records with wildcard owner names, attackers
    can exploit these shared servers to launch high-volume DDoS amplification attacks.
    This document provides operational guidance for DNS hosting providers to mitigate
    DDoS risks arising from amplification of responses derived from wildcard owner
    names.</p>"

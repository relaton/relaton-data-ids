  content: "In the current Internet, a site is often secured by firewall, which\nfilters
    harmful traffic from outside at the border of the site.  This\n'Border Defense
    Model', provides only a single line of defence and\nhinders the deployment of
    many next-generation Internet applications\nand services.\n\nThis memo surveys
    the security issues of the 'Border Defense Model',\nand proposes a network architecture
    'Quarantine Model', to provide a\nbetter security model and promote various end-to-end
    Internet usages.\n\nIn our 'Quarantine Model', nodes shareing an Enterprise network\nnetwork
    are connected to separate logical networks according to their\nsecurity privilege
    level and community of interest.  A different\nsecurity policy is implemented
    on each logical network segment using\nthe multiple security-related techniques,
    such as filtering,\nauthentication, and encryption.  This 'Compartmentalized'
    framework\nprovides a better depth of network defenes and additional flexibility\nto
    our 'Quarantine Model'.\n\nThis memo enumerates requirements and issues for this
    architecture.\nHowever, it is beyond the scope of this document to propose specific\nimplementations
    or protocols.\n\n\t "

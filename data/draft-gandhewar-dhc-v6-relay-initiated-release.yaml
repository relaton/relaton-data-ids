  content: "   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) is\n   initiated
    by a DHCPv6 client.  A DHCPv6 server can force DHCPv6\n   client to send RENEW
    or INFORMATION-REQUEST by sending a RECONFIGURE\n   message.  There may be multiple
    DHCPv6 network devices connected in\n   between a DHCPv6 client and a server,
    each one reserving resources\n   for the DHCPv6 client.  There are no DHCPv6 messages
    that a relay can\n   initiate in order to control the client binding.\n\n   A
    DHCPv6 client may not always send a RELEASE message when it no\n   longer needs
    the IPv6 address or prefix and network resources for the\n   associated services
    it is using.  This document specifies a way to\n   request release to be initiated
    by an intermediate DHCPv6 network\n   device, e.g.  DHCPv6 relay, on behalf of
    DHCPv6 client.  This helps\n   to relinquish network resources sooner than the
    lease expiration\n   time.\n\n\t "

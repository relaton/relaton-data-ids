  content: "Routes for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths \n(LSPs)
    may be computed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs). Where the \nLSP crosses multiple
    domains such as Autonomous Systems (ASs) the \npath may be computed by multiple
    PCEs that cooperate, with each \nresponsible for computing a segment of the path.
    \n \nHowever, in some cases such as when ASs are administered by separate \nService
    Providers, it would break confidentiality rules for a PCE to \nsupply a path segment
    to a PCE in another domain. This issue may be \ncircumvented by returning a loose
    hop and by invoking a new path \ncomputation from the domain boundary LSR during
    LSP setup as the LSP \nenters the second domain, but this technique has several
    issues \nincluding the problem of maintaining path diversity. \n \nThis document
    allows a PCE to provide a full path, but to hide the \ncontents of a segment of
    that path called the Confidential Path \nSegment (CPS). The CPS may be conveyed
    in the PCE Communication \nProtocol (PCEP) and signaled in a Resource Reservation
    Protocol \n(RSVP) explicit route either by replacing it with a path key or by
    \nencrypting it. \n\n\t "

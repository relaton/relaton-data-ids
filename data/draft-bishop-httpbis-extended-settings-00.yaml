abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   HTTP/2 defines the SETTINGS frame to contain a single 32-bit value\n
    \  per setting.  While this is sufficient to convey everything used in\n   the
    core HTTP/2 specification, some protocols will require more\n   complex values,
    such as arrays of code-points or strings.\n\n   For such protocols, this extension
    defines a parallel to the SETTINGS\n   frame, EXTENDED_SETTINGS, where the value
    of a setting is not a\n   32-bit value, but a variable-length opaque data blob
    whose\n   interpretation is subject entirely to the definition of the protocol\n
    \  using it.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The canonical format for the RFC Series has been plain-text, ASCII-\n
    \  encoded for several decades.  After extensive community discussion\n   and
    debate, the RFC Editor will be transitioning to XML as the\n   canonical format,
    with different publication formats rendered from\n   that base document.  These
    changes are intended to increase the\n   usability of the RFC Series by offering
    documents that match the\n   needs of a wider variety of stakeholders.  With these
    changes,\n   however, comes an increase in complexity for authors, consumers,
    and\n   the publisher of RFCs.  This document serves as the framework that\n   describes
    the problems being solved and summarizes the many documents\n   that capture the
    specific requirements for each aspect of the change\n   in format.\n\n\t "

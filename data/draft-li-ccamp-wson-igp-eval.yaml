  content: "Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a technology for optical \ncommunications,
    in which the user traffic is carried by data channels \nof different optical wavelengths.
    In traditional WDM Networks, each \nwavelength path is statically configured.
    With the deployment of the \nReconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM)
    and the \n \n Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS), WDM networks have become more
    \ndynamic, and operators can flexibly set up wavelength paths to carry \nuser
    traffic.  \n\nThis document discusses the set of Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
    \nrequirements that would enable distributed light path computation in \nWavelength
    Switched Optical Networks (WSON). An IGP impact analysis \nis also provided. According
    to the analysis, there is no significant \nimpact on the IGP performance.\n\t "

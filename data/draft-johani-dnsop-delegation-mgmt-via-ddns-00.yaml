  content: "   Delegation information (i.e. the NS RRset, possible glue, possible
    DS\n   records) should always be kept in sync between child zone and parent\n
    \  zone.  However, in practice that is not always the case.\n\n   When the delegation
    information is not in sync the child zone is\n   usually working fine, but without
    the amount of redundancy that the\n   zone owner likely expects to have.  Hence,
    should any further\n   problems ensue it could have catastropic consequences.\n\n
    \  The DNS name space has lived with this problem for decades and it\n   never
    goes away.  Or, rather, it will never go away until a fully\n   automated mechanism
    for how to keep the information in sync\n   automatically is deployed.\n\n   This
    document proposes such a mechanism.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-via-\n
    \  ddns (https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-\n   via-ddns).
    \ The most recent working version of the document, open\n   issues, etc, should
    all be available there.  The author (gratefully)\n   accept pull requests.\n\n\t "

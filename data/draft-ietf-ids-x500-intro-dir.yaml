  content: "This report provides a 'manual' for establishing an electronic White Pages
    Directory Service within an organisation and for connecting it to a wide-area
    Directory infrastructure. It is based on the experiences from the SURFnet Directory
    Services pilot project. The wide-area service is of importance to all users of
    e-mail services who want to find e-mail addresses of other e-mail users (worldwide!)
    or any other address information such as telephone and fax numbers.     Establishing
    a White Pages Directory Service within an organisation includes a technical, legal
    and data management component. As the amount of work involved in the technical
    component can be reduced by using standard equipment and by good support from
    the provider of the wide-area Directory infrastructure, the legal and data management
    issues require more attention. Legal aspects include formal registration of the
    service, informing all registered persons about the service and data protection.\n\t "

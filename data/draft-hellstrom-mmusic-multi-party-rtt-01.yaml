  content: "   This memo specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media handling\n
    \  in multi-party calls.  The main solution is to carry Real-Time text\n   by
    the RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103.\n   The main solution
    for centralized multi-party handling of real-time\n   text is achieved through
    a media control unit coordinating multiple\n   RTP text streams into one RTP session.\n\n
    \  Identification for the streams are provided through the CSRC lists in\n   the
    RTP packets and through the RTCP messages.  This mechanism\n   enables the receiving
    application to present the received real-time\n   text medium separated per source,
    in different ways according to user\n   preferences.  Some presentation related
    features are also described\n   explaining suitable variations of transmission
    and presentation of\n   text.\n\n   Call control features are described for the
    SIP environment.  A\n   number of alternative methods for providing the multi-party\n
    \  negotiation, transmission and presentation are discussed and a\n   recommendation
    for the main one is provided.  Two alternative methods\n   using a single RTP
    stream and source identification inline in the\n   text stream are also described,
    one of them being provided as a lower\n   functionality fallback method for endpoints
    with no multi-party\n   awareness for RTT.\n\n   Brief information is also provided
    for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC\n   environment.\n\n   EDITOR NOTE: A number
    of alternatives are specified for discussion.\n   A decision is needed which alternatives
    are preferred and then how\n   the preferred alternatives shall be emphasized.\n\n\t "

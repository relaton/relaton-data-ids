  content: "   During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, there are many kinds of\n
    \  transition methods and scenarios that have been or are currently\n   being
    defined in IETF, e.g., DS-Lite, Lw4over6, MAP-E, 4rd, 6rd and\n   etc.  Carriers
    have to select and determine their transition ways\n   among all of these techniques,
    which brings slow transition to IPv6.\n   Currently, we face two main challenges
    in IPv6 transition: the legacy\n   equipment does not support multiple IPv6 transition
    technologies at\n   the same time and there are not enough native IPv6 applications.\n
    \  This document describes an open IPv6 YANG [RFC6020] data model which\n   serves
    as a framework for configuring and managing an IPv6 service to\n   provide a low-cost
    and unified way to IPv6 transition.\n\n\t "

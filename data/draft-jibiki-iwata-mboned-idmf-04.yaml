- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes a new inter-domain multicast forwarding (IDMF)\nmechanism
    for PIM-SM multicast routing protocol. Although there have\nbeen various inter-domain
    multicast routing and forwarding protocols,\nthey still have a limitation for
    handling policy routing, QoS\nrouting, accounting and security, which network
    administrators are\nwilling to use in their network. In order to solve this limitation,\nwe
    propose a novel approach to create an inter-domain multicast\nforwarding tree
    (or routing table) among multiple PIM-SM domains with\nlogical unicast paths over
    which multicast packets are forwarded or\nflooded. The logical unicast paths are
    created by either IP-in-IP\ntunneling method , IP masquerade-like method, and
    MPLS label switched\npath (LSP) method, which can easily reuse policy routing
    and QoS\nrouting for unicast routing. These logical unicast paths are\nestablished
    among IDMF capable nodes or proxies, which are located\nwithin each PIM-SM domain,
    either manually or by a dynamic IDMP tree\nconstruction protocol. The IDMP capable
    nodes can also behave a proxy\nsender of multicast packets. It can prevent a multicast
    receiver from\nchanging a RP-tree into a global SP-tree, and also can help to
    reduce\nvirtually the number of multicast sources for a particular multicast\ngroup.
    This property can be effectively used for accounting, security\nand scalability
    enhancement required for interdomain communication.\nThe proposed mechanism is
    a general framework for inter-domain\nmulticast forwarding and can be also used
    as a MSDP based forwarding\nmechanism.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A delegation in the Domain Name System (DNS) is a mechanism that\n
    \  enables efficient and distributed management of the DNS namespace.\n   It involves
    delegating authority over subdomains to specific DNS\n   servers via NS records,
    allowing for a hierarchical structure and\n   distributing the responsibility
    for maintaining DNS records.\n\n   An NS record contains the hostname of the nameserver
    for the\n   delegated namespace.  Any facilities of that nameserver must be\n
    \  discovered through other mechanisms.  This document proposes a new\n   extensible
    DNS record type, DELEG, which contains additional\n   information about the delegated
    namespace and the capabilities of\n   authoritative nameservers for the delegated
    namespace.\n\n\t "

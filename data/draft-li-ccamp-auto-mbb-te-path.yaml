  content: "   As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul\n   network,
    automatic computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) path\n   becomes very important.
    \ But owing to requirements on the MPLS TE\n   path, explicit path or affinity
    property has to be introduced for the\n   path computation.  This causes the complexity
    of MPLS TE path design.\n   The document proposes an architecture and corresponding
    OSPF and ISIS\n   extensions to improve automation on computation of MPLS TE path.\n
    \  MPLS TE networks are divided into different traffic engineering\n   layers
    and areas according to the characteristics of the network\n   topology.  MPLS
    TE path can compute automatically based on traffic\n   engineering layers and
    areas to satisfy major requirements to bear\n   mobile network services.\n\n\n\t "

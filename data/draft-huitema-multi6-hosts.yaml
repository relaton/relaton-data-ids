  content: "A way to solve the issue of site multihoming is to have a separate\nsite
    prefix for each connection of the site, and to derive as many\naddresses for each
    hosts. This approach to multi-homing, which we\ncall Host-Centric IPv6 Multihoming,
    has the advantage of minimal\nimpact on the inter-domain routing fabric, since
    each site prefix can\nbe aggregated within the larger prefix of a specific provider;\nhowever,
    it opens a number of issues, which we will discuss in this\nmemo, including the
    problem created by the interaction between\ningress filtering and multihoming,
    which we analyze in detail. We\nthen propose a set of specific solutions that
    enable host centric\nmultihoming, and we review how these solutions meet the requirements\nof
    IPv6 site multihoming.\n\t "

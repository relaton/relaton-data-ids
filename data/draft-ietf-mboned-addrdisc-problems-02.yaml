  content: "Typically applications developers have requested static IANA\nassignments
    for their applications, even if the applications would\ntypically be only used
    within a site, between consenting sites, or\nwould not eventually even use multicast
    at all.  This memo describes\nthis problem space, and summarizes a number of proposed
    approaches to\nmitigating these problems.\n\n\t "

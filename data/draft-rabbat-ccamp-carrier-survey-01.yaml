  content: "   Optical transport networks operated using a GMPLS-based control plane
    \n   enable todays network operators to offer valuable new services. With \n   the
    completion of a number of GMPLS signaling and routing standards \n   and the availability
    of products implementing them, providers are now \n   looking at ways to enable
    additional features, such as shared-mesh \n   restoration. These can be key to
    efficient network operation while \n   providing strict performance guarantees.
    In that context, several \n   areas of work still need to be addressed within
    the CCAMP WG of the \n   IETF to develop interoperable, standards-based solutions
    that \n   carriers can embrace. \n    \n   Towards that end, this document presents
    the results of a serious \n   attempt to systematically gather and collate carrier
    inputs on \n   strategies for shared-mesh restoration and the associated issues.
    The \n   survey results are presented in aggregate form to provide an overview\n
    \  of carrier thinking, while retaining specific carrier response \n   confidentiality.
    The goal is to highlight areas of carrier concerns, \n   and identify specific
    work items to focus on and facilitate further \n   discussion on them. This is
    to enable the CCAMP WG to pursue ongoing \n   and further work in this area that
    is focused towards addressing the \n   identified carrier requirements.  \n\t "

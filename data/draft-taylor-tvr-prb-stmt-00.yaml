  content: "   Existing Routing Protocols expect to maintain contemporaneous, end-\n
    \  to-end connected paths across a network.  Changes to that\n   connectivity,
    such as the loss of an adjacent peer, are considered to\n   be exceptional circumstances
    that must be corrected prior to the\n   resumption of data transmission.  Corrections
    may include attempting\n   to re-establish lost adjacencies and recalculating
    or rediscovering a\n   functional topology.\n\n   However, there are a growing
    number of use-cases where changes to the\n   routing topology are an expected
    part of network operations.  In\n   these cases the pre-planned loss and restoration
    of an adjacency, or\n   formation of an alternate adjacency, should be seen as
    a non-\n   disruptive event.\n\n   This document attempts to describe the problems
    perceived with\n   existing routing protocols and act as a \"Problem Statement\"
    to be\n   addressed by the proposed Time-Variant Routing (TVR) working group.\n\n
    \  Readers are recommended to read this document alongside the TVR\n   (Time-Variant
    Routing) Use Cases (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/\n   draft-birrane-tvr-use-cases/).\n\n\t "

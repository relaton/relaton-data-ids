  content: "Some service providers who operate SIP proxy servers and registrars\n
    \  need to be able to express various types of policies to their\n   customers,
    such as media policies and security policies.  Discussion\n   needs to take place
    about the types of policies and how they will\n   have an impact on SIP User Agents
    (UA)s.  This document presents an\n   overview of the types of policies that might
    be available, and how\n   the operations of policies might be executed to aid
    in advancing the\n   current discussions on session policies.\n\t "

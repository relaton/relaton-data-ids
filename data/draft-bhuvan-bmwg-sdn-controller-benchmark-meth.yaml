  content: "   This document defines the methodologies for benchmarking performance\n
    \  of SDN controllers. Terminology related to benchmarking SDN\n   controllers
    is described in the companion terminology document.\n   SDN controllers have been
    implemented with many varying designs in\n   order to achieve their intended network
    functionality. Hence, the\n   authors have taken the approach of considering an
    SDN controller as\n   a black box, defining the methodology in a manner that is
    agnostic\n   to protocols and network services supported by controllers. The\n
    \  intent of this document is to provide a standard mechanism to\n   measure the
    performance of all controller implementations.\n\n\t "

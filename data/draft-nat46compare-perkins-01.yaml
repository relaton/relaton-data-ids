abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IVI, IVI + DHCPv6, 1:N IVI, Bidirectional NAT, and SIPNAT have been\nproposed
    to global Internet access to IPv6-only domains.  These\nmethods are not all mutually
    exclusive, and we propose that IVI\n(along with its variants) along with SIPNAT
    may be considered\ntogether as a more complete solution for enabling access from
    today's\nIPv4 global Internet into IPv6-only domains.  This would likely have\nthe
    effect of accelerating the adoption of IPv6, since with such\naccess enablements
    there would be much reduced incentive for new\ndeployments to require IPv4 addressability.
    \ As part of the\ndiscussion, we also include a comparison of the various techniques
    so\nthe relative trade-offs may be more easily understood.\n\t "

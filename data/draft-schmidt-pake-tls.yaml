abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes how to integrate Password-Authenticated Key\n
    \  Agreement (PAKE) schemes into TLS.  These schemes enable two parties\n   who
    share a potentially weak password to derive a common\n   cryptographic key, allowing
    them to establish a secure channel.  The\n   current document defines a generic
    way to integrate PAKE schemes into\n   TLS.  In addition, it demonstrates how
    to use the well-known Password\n   Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
    scheme in TLS as an\n   example for the generic construction.\n\n\t "

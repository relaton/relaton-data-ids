  content: "Mobile IP is now being deployed, providing connectivity to mobile\nusers.
    This is happening well ahead of the widespread use of IPv6,\nwhich may not have
    been expected at the time when the Mobile IP\nstandard was originally formulated.
    At the same time, networks with\nprivate address spaces are proliferating, using
    NAT devices to reach\nthe public internet. Today NATs are widely deployed in home\ngateways,
    as well as in other locations likely to be used by mobile\nusers, such as hotels.
    The result is that MIP-NAT incompatibility\nissues have become a major barrier
    to deployment of Mobile IP in one\nof its principal uses. This draft describes
    a known incompatibility\nbetween NAT and Mobile IP, and also describes a possible
    solution\nusing Mobile IP's vendor specific extensions. \n\n\t "

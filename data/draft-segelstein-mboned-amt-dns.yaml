    AMT Relay in a Multi-Network SSM Multicast Environment

  content: "   One of the obstacles to implementing AMT Multicast in a multi-network\n
    \  environment is the difficulty an AMT Gateway may have in finding an\n   AMT
    Relay that is optimal.  Optimal in this context means that the\n   AMT Relay has
    multicast connectivity to the Source, and its location\n   minimizes the unicast
    (tunneled) portion of the path to the Gateway.\n   Blind use of the global anycast
    address specified for AMT Relays in\n   \"Automatic IP Multicast Without Explicit
    Tunnels (AMT)\" could result\n   in reaching an AMT Relay that does not have multicast
    connectivity to\n   the source, which would yield a failure to obtain the multicast\n
    \  content; or it could result in reaching an AMT Relay that is\n   otherwise
    less than optimal.  This document proposes a method for\n   implementing standard
    DNS procedures so that an AMT Gateway using\n   normal DNS queries can virtually
    always find the optimal AMT Relay\n   for a given Source.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Call Park and Call Retrieve are useful telephony services that are\n
    \  normally found on traditional PBXs.  Implementing these services\n   using
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in the way described in\n   the SIP Service
    Examples draft [1] is straightforward, but suffers\n   from a useability problem
    when implemented using SIP User Agents\n   resembling traditional business telephones.
    \ This draft discusses a\n   simple extension to cater for this style of endpoint.\n\t "

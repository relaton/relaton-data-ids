  content: "   Future 5G networks will not make a clear distinction between\n   fronthaul
    and backhaul transport networks, because varying portions\n   of radio access
    network functionality might be moved toward the\n   network as required for cost
    reduction and performance increase.\n   This will pose additional challenges on
    the transport network,\n   driving for a new design of integrated fronthaul and
    backhaul,\n   usually referred to as crosshaul.\n\n   This document present the
    crosshaul architecture framework being\n   developed by the EU 5G-Crosshaul project,
    as well as identifies\n   several key requirements for the transport network,
    with the goal of\n   fostering discussion at the DETNET WG.\n\n\t "

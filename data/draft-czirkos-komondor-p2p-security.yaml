  content: "   This memo presents Komondor, an experimental peer-to-peer security\n
    \  system.  Komondor is a network intrusion detection system.  Hosts\n   running
    this software organize themselves automatically in an overlay\n   network, where
    they share information about intrusion attempts they\n   detect.  This way the
    security of all participants is increased, as\n   they are able to prepare for
    some of the attacks in advance.\n\n   The overlay created is a peer-to-peer network,
    which is completely\n   decentralized.  This communication model ensures stability,
    and by\n   using this the system remains operational over an unstable network.\n\n\t "

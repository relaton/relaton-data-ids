  content: "WIRE extends HTTP with a new type of redirect response that permits a\nresolver
    to explicitly delegate a resolution to other resolvers and\nprotocols. WIRE is
    an effort to make delegation more explicit, redirection\nmore flexible, and resolution
    processes more efficient through the use of\nhints. This document defines WIRE
    and describes the expected behaviors of\nresolvers and clients using WIRE. WIRE
    is an extension of the HyperText\nTransfer Protocol (HTTP), and is intended to
    be compatible with HTTP/1.0 and\nabove [4][5].\n \nWIRE encourages use of long-lived
    URIs and at the same time supports\nprotocol evolution without having to change
    currently deployed URIs or URI\nschemes. The extension is based on a simple URI
    resolution model that allows\nan application to dynamically request metadata describing
    where and how to\naccess a resource. The model can use any generic metadata description\nlanguage
    (e.g. RDF) and as the metadata itself is interpreted as a first\nclass resource,
    metadata resources are no different than any other resource\non the Web.\n\t "

  content: "   Software releases can't always wait for some document to become an\n
    \  RFC.  As the result some software products are released when they\n   implement
    a non-final version of an IMAP [IMAP4] extension. This may\n   cause substantial
    interoperability problems between clients and\n   servers that implement different
    revisions of the same document, as\n   syntax and semantics of operations may
    change substantially between\n   revisions of the same IMAP extension draft.\n\t "

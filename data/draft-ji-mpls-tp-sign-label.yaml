- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document extends the applicability of the Generic Associated\n
    \  channel Label (GAL), enabling the realization of the communication\n   between
    a Maintenance End Point (MEP) and a Maintenance Intermediate\n   Point (MIP) in
    the MPLS-TP OAM architecture. This mechanism can only\n   be used in the point-to-point
    co-routed bidirectional path of MPLS-\n   TP networks. By introducing the MPLS-TP
    Sign Label, it enables the\n   peer MEP to obtain the path information along the
    MPLS Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs) or MPLS pseudowires (PWs). After that, it\n
    \  could number the MIPs along the path, and each MIP could record the\n   pairing
    relationship of the forward and the backward directions of\n   that transport
    path.\n\t "

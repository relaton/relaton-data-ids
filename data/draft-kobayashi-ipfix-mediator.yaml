  content: "   An IPFIX Mediator is an intermediate node between IPFIX Devices and\n
    \  traffic Collectors.  This node acts as a IPFIX proxy or IPFIX\n   concentrator.
    \ Therefore, IPFIX Mediators enables cascade connection.\n   This document defines
    the Option Template required by cascade\n   connection and a reference internal
    component model and describes\n   several solution scenarios that use IPFIX Mediators.
    \ An IPFIX\n   Mediator is an intermediate node between IPFIX Devices and traffic\n
    \  Collectors.  This node acts as a IPFIX proxy or IPFIX concentrator.\n   IPFIX
    Mediator has several capabilities such as storage function of\n   original Flow
    Records, flexible aggregation function, and proper\n   distribution function for
    collector or analyzer.  The combination of\n   these capabilities can solve several
    problems related to traffic\n   monitoring.\n\t "

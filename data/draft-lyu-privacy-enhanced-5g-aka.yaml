  content: "   Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol aims to enable mutual\n
    \  authentication between networks and a phone equipped with a Universal\n   Subscriber
    Identity Module(USIM) card. 5G AKA introduces Subscription\n   Permanent Identifier
    (SUPI) and Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption\n   Scheme (ECIES) to preserve
    user identity privacy.  However, when the\n   authentication server becomes an
    unsecure entity due to malwares or\n   malicious attacks, these existing schemes
    cannot effectively protect\n   user identity privacy at the server-end.  For a
    small number of\n   important users with high demand for identity privacy and
    security,\n   comprehensive identity privacy protection is one of their important\n
    \  security requirements.  Based on a security assumption that the\n   server
    is trustworthy within a limited time, this document proposes a\n   privacy-enhanced
    access authentication scheme (PEAA) which is\n   compatible with 5G AKA.  This
    scheme not only achieves user anonymity\n   on wireless channels by dynamic temporary
    pseudonyms, but also\n   ensures that the server authenticates users without their
    permanent\n   identities.  In the context of hierarchical security requirements,\n
    \  PEAA scheme and the existing 5G AKA can respectively provide\n   different
    user identity privacy protection services for users with\n   different security
    requirements.\n\n\t "

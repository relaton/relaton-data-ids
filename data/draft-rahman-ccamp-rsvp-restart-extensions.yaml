  content: "This document describes the extensions needed by certain \n             features
    for the purpose of RSVP Graceful Restart (defined \n             in[RFC3473]).
    One of these extensions refers to the ability of \n             a node to recover
    the ERO in the case it has performed an ERO \n             expansion before control
    plane restart. Also a small \n             modification is proposed in the basic
    procedure to support \n             simultaneous multiple node restarts in a network.
    \n             Specifically, a node should use a non-zero Recovery Time while
    \n             in the recovery phase. This allows a node to determine at \n             restart
    time if any of its neighbors has previously restarted \n             and it is
    currently in the recovery phase.\n\t "

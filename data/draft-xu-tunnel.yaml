  content: "Virtual Aggregation (VA) is a mechanism for shrinking the size of the\nDFZ
    FIB in routers [I-D.francis-intra-va].  VA can result in longer\npaths and increased
    load on routers within the ISP that deploys VA.\nThis document describes a mechanism
    that allows an AS that originates\na route to associate a tunnel endpoint terminating
    at itself with the\nroute.  This allows routers in a remote AS to tunnel packets
    to the\noriginating AS.  If transit ASes between the remote AS and the\noriginating
    AS install the prefixes associated with tunnel endpoints\nin their FIBs, then
    tunneled packets that transit through them will\ntake the shortest path.  This
    results in reduced load for the transit\nAS, and better performance for the customers
    at the source and\ndestination.\n\t "

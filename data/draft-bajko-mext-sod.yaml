  script: Latn
  content: "   Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols require the\n   signaling
    messages between the mobile node and home agent to be\n   secured.  However security
    for the user plane/traffic is optional and\n   is a choice left to the mobile
    node.  This document proposes\n   extensions to Mobile IPv6 signaling which enables
    the user plane\n   traffic to be secured on a need or on-demand basis.  The mobile
    node\n   or the home agent can request at any time security for the user plane\n
    \  traffic.  Security for user plane traffic can be triggered as a\n   result
    of policy or, mobility or, at the user's choice.\n\n\t "

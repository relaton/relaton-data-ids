  content: "Some networks require communication between an interior and exterior portion
    of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or through a concatenation of such networks
    resulting in a nested VPN, but have sensitivities about what information is communicated
    across the boundary, especially while providing quality of service to communications
    with different precedence.  This note seeks to outline the issues and the nature
    of the proposed solutions based on the framework for Integrated Services operation
    over Diffserv networks as described in RFC 2998.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

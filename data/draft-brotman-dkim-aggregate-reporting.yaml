  content: "   This document introduces a mechanism enabling DKIM-signing domain\n
    \  owners to solicit aggregate reports from email receivers.  Presented\n   in
    an XML format, these reports possess adaptable elements conducive\n   for integration
    with current and future drafts and standards like\n   DMARCbis.  They capture
    the evaluation outcomes of DKIM signatures,\n   such as 'pass' or 'fail', alongside
    other potential data attributes.\n   Receivers can relay these aggregate reports
    to destinations\n   designated by the DKIM-signing domain holder, contingent upon
    their\n   support capabilities.\n\n\t "

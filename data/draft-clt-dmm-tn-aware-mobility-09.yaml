abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework and mapping from slices in 5G mobile
    systems to transport slices in IP, Layer 2 and Layer 1 transport networks. Slices
    in 5G systems are characterized by latency bounds, reservation guarantees, jitter,
    data rates, availability, mobility speed, usage density, criticality and priority.
    These characteristics should be mapped to the transport network slice characteristics
    that include bandwidth, latency and criteria such as isolation, directionality
    and disjoint routes. Mobile slice criteria need to be mapped to the appropriate
    transport slice and capabilities offered in backhaul, midhaul and fronthaul connectivity
    segments between radio side network functions and user plane function(gateway).
    This document describes how mobile network functions map its slice criteria to
    identifiers in IP and Layer 2 packets that transport network segments use to grant
    transport layer services during UE mobility scenarios. Applicability of this framework
    and underlying transport networks, which can enable different slice properties
    are also discussed. This is based on mapping between mobile and transport underlays
    (L2, Segment Routing, IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).</p>"

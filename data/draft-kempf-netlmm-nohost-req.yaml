  content: "In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-ps, the problems with using global IP mobility
    management protocols for local mobility and some problems with existing localized
    mobility management protocols are described. In this document, we explore requirements
    for localized mobility management in more detail. An extensive gap analysis against
    the protocols illustrates where existing protocols are able to fulfill the requirements
    and where they are lacking. \n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the use of references in RFCs and IANA\n   registries.
    \ It also discusses situations where RFCs are currently\n   required as references
    in IANA registries.\n\n   This document does not define any new policies, but
    instead describes\n   the many practices that have been used, particularly the
    practices\n   that are considered best current practices today.  This document
    is\n   informative, and thus does not require changes to, or prohibit\n   exceptions
    from, the current practices.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A routing registry(RR) is a repository of routing policy information.\n
    \  The IETF-RPSL-WG has developed a Routing Policy Specification\n   Language
    (RPSL) for describing routing policy constraints.\n \n   This document addresses
    the need for providing the means of managing\n   the routing registry as well
    as to provide access to the routing\n   registry from within the Internet standard
    network management\n   framework.  It defines a portion of the Management Information
    Base\n   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet\n   community
    to monitor and manage the RRs.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   FMIPv6 [4] requires signalling messages to be exchanged between a\n
    \  mobile node and its access router.  For secure interaction, these\n   messages
    must be authenticated using a security association between\n   the access router
    and the mobile node.  To enable the mobile node and\n   the access router unambiguously
    identify the correct security\n   association this document extends the mobility
    header authentication\n   option by defining a subtype to indicate a mobile node
    - access\n   router SPI.  Also, this option can be used in signaling messages
    used\n   to derive handover keys between the MN and AR, as described in HK_AAA\n
    \  [5].  The idea here is to re-use the existing mobility option for\n   authentication
    and only define an additional sub-type for MN-AR\n   authentication.\n\t "

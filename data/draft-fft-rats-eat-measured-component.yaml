  content: "   A measured component is a measurable object of an attester's target\n
    \  environment, that is, an object whose state can be sampled and\n   digested.
    \ Examples of measured components include the invariant part\n   of firmware that
    is loaded in memory at startup time, a run-time\n   integrity check, a file system
    object, or a CPU register.\n\n   This document defines a \"measured component\"
    format that can be used\n   with the EAT Measurements claim.\n\n\t "

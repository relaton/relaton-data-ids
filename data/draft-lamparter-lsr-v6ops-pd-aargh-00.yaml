  script: Latn
  content: "   Between large enterprise networks that can reasonably use their own\n
    \  IPv6 address space and small home and office networks that do not\n   utilize
    a complex routing topology, there is an intermediate space\n   where a network
    may need to utilize a nontrivial routed topology but\n   still connect to the
    internet in a plain \"customer\" role, with IPv6\n   address space being assigned
    over e.g.  DHCPv6-PD [DHCPv6].\n\n   This poses a yet-unsolved issue that the
    prefix(es) assigned by the\n   ISP may change, either frequently due to operational
    practice, or\n   infrequently on some external events like loss of prefix assignment\n
    \  state.  This change in prefix needs to propagate, at minimum, into\n   [ADDRCONF]
    mechanisms, but frequently also other components like\n   firewalls, naming systems,
    etc.\n\n\t "

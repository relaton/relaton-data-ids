  content: "   This document describes a practical mechanism to implement IP fast\n
    \  reroute using multiple viable loop-free next hops, which are not\n   necessarily
    shortest path to a destination. Upon a link failure,\n   all the destinations
    reachable via the primary nexthop will be \n   forwarded to pre-computed alternative
    loop free nexthops, if any,\n   without much delay. The mechanism does not impose
    any new protocol\n   message/capability exchange. The mechanism does not use any
    \n   tunneling techniques. It is shown that simple changes to existing\n   IGP
    shortest path computation and routing table structures are  \n   sufficient to
    achieve the desired functionality. More over, routers\n   which implement the
    proposed mechanism can co-exist and can be fully\n   backward compatible with
    existing unmodified routers.\n\t "

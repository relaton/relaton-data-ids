  content: "This memo describes a key-exchange method for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol
    based on Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public-key encryption.  It uses much less
    client CPU time than the Diffie-Hellman algorithm specified as part of the core
    protocol, and hence is particularly suitable for slow client systems. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends BGP SR Policy, the same protocol used to configure
    SR Policies, to report operational state information of SR Policies, Candidate
    Paths, and Segment Lists. Optional State sub-TLVs, carried within the BGP Tunnel
    Encapsulation attribute, are introduced in this document to report the operational
    states (e.g., Down, Inactive, or Invalid) along with their associated reasons
    of the SR Policies from network elements to controller. These extensions are restricted
    to operational state reporting and do not alter SR Policy computation, path selection
    procedures, or the operations of the base BGP protocol.</p>"

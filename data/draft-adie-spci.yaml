  content: "This document describes how personal contact information may be exchanged
    in a structured format suitable for machine processing.  The SGML-based Personal
    Contact Information (SPCI) format can be used to encode personal information of
    the type which might be found on a business card, in a form which is also suitable
    for human interpretation.  Possible uses of this format include:  exchange of
    personal information in email messages; encoding author information within a document;
    providing information about a mailing list; as an exchange format for 'address
    book' databases; and providing contact information for a company.  The SPCI information
    is encoded using SGML, and the specification is aligned with the SHAVE rules.
    \          A MIME body part type is defined for SPCI information.\n\t "

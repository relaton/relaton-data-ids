  content: "ISAKMP and PKIX both provide frameworks that must be profiled for use\nin
    a given application. This document provides a profile of ISAKMP\nand PKIX that
    defines the requirements for using PKI technology in\nthe context of IPsec. The
    document compliments protocol\nspecifications such as IKE, which assume the existence
    of public key\ncertificates and related keying materials, but which do not address\nPKI
    issues explicitly. This document addresses those issues.\n\t "

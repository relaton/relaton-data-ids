  content: "   Operational calamaties in the DNS happen from time to time, and in\n
    \  many cases problems persist due to DNS caching of bad data.  Lacking\n   any
    robust mechanism to signal that bad data has been flushed, the\n   operators of
    DNS authority servers often resort to unauthenticated\n   requests for help being
    sent to mailing lists, the results of which\n   are frequently unsatisfying to
    all concerned.\n\n   This document aims to present requirements for a more robust\n
    \  mechanism by which authoritative server operators can signal to\n   recursive
    server operators that bad data has been published, and that\n   targetted cache
    flushes may be beneficial.\n\n\t "

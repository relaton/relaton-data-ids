  content: "This document defines a new SDP attribute called general-purpose \nmedia
    descriptor (gpmd).  The gpmd attribute allows the use of new \ninformative parameters,
    gpmd parameters, to qualify existing media \nformats.  These gpmd parameters are
    not part of the standard (e.g., \nMIME) definition of the media format and support
    for them with a \ngiven media format can not be assumed.  Their use is therefore
    \nlimited to cases where they provide information that may be of use to \nthe
    other party in a session but is not critical to the use of the \nparticular media
    format.  This document also defines a specific gpmd \nparameter, voice-band data,
    which can be used to describe a media \nformat as carrying voice-band data.  This
    enables the receiver to \noptimize its handling of the media received.  \n    \n\t "

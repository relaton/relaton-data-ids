abstract:
- content: "<p>As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid
    and dynamic control increases. With scale, the need to automate even the simplest
    operations is important, but even more critical is the ability to quickly interact
    with more complex operations such as policy-based controls. In order to enable
    applications to have access to and control over information in the Internet's
    routing system, we need a publically documented interface specification. The interface
    needs to support real-time, transaction-based interactions using efficient data
    models and encodings. Furthermore, the interface must support a variety of use
    cases including those where verified control feed-back loops are needed. This
    document expands upon these statements of requirements to provide a problem statement
    for an interface to the Internet routing system.</p>"

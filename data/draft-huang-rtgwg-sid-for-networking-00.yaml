  content: "   More and more emerging applications have raised the demand for\n   establishing
    networking connections?anywhere and anytime, alongside\n   the availability of
    highly distributive?any-cloud services.  Such a\n   demand motivates the need
    to efficiently interconnect heterogeneous\n   entities, e.g., different domains
    of network and cloud owned by\n   different providers, with the goal of reducing
    cost, e.g., overheads\n   and end-to-end latency, while ensuring the overall performance\n
    \  satisfies the requirements of the applications.  Considering that\n   different
    network domains and cloud providers may adopt different\n   types of technologies,
    the key of interconnection and efficient\n   coordination is to employ a unified
    interface that can be understood\n   by heterogeneous parties which could derive
    the consistent\n   requirements of the same service and treat the service traffic\n
    \  appropriately by their proprietary policies and technologies.\n\n   Therefore,
    service ID is one promising candidate for the unified\n   interface since it could
    be designed to be lightweight, secure, and\n   enables fast and efficient packet
    treatment.  Leveraging service ID,\n   addressing and networking among heterogeneous
    network domains and\n   cloud providers can be accomplished by establishing the
    mapping\n   between the unified service ID and the specific technologies used
    by\n   a network domain or a cloud provider.\n\n   This document provides typical
    use cases of unified service ID for\n   addressing and routing (SIAN), validating
    that interconnecting\n   different network domains or cloud providers can be achieved
    at lower\n   cost without sacrificing the performance of application compared
    with\n   existing methods of which problems as well as gaps have also been\n   illustrated.
    \ The requirements for SIAN are also derived for each of\n   the scenarios.  Finally,
    a framework solution is demonstrated.\n\n\t "

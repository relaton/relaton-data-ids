  content: "As multicast networks start to get deployed in large number, it \nbecomes
    very important that, proper mechanisms are in place for \ntrouble shooting error
    conditions and informing other failure \nsituations. Since multicasting has little
    support from IP in this\nmatter (since ICMP does not support multicasting and
    broadcasting) it\nbehooves that, multicast routing protocols, embed these features
    in \nthemselves. This draft presents some ideas about how this can be done\nusing
    PIM protocol suite as example, since PIMSSM and PIMSM are \nprobably most widely
    used multicast routing protocols.\n\t "

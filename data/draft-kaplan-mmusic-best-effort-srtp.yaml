  content: "   This document defines the requirements and a proposed solution for
    \n   an SDP Offer/Answer exchange model for negotiating best-effort SRTP \n   keys,
    i.e., in a backward-compatible manner with non-SRTP devices.  \n   The proposed
    solution is a trivial interpretation of the usage of \n   the profile and the
    usage of SDP indication of [sdesc] and [kmgmt]. \n\n\t "

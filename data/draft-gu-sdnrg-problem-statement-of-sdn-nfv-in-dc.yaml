  content: "   With the development of cloud computing technology, cloud datacenters\n
    \  have been influenced.  Co-deployment of SDN and NFV technology shows\n   its
    distinct advantages of vitalizing network resources in providing\n   VPC services
    and SFC services.In order to deploy SDN and NFV in cloud\n   datacenters, a resolution
    test has been conducted.  According to the\n   resolution test, SDN and NFV technology
    has been nearly mature for\n   the commercial deployment in operators' network.
    \ However, there are\n   some key problems on network architecture, virtualized
    platform,\n   standard interfaces, performance of SDN devices and so on to be\n
    \  working out in practical practice.\n\n\t "

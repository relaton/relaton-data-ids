  content: "   There is a set of Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service\n   attributes
    which have been widely used in different types of fixed\n   networks though they
    don't appear as standard attributes.  Each of\n   these attributes has for long
    been part of many vendor dictionnaries,\n   thus presented in different approaches
    and different syntaxes.  This\n   document try to solve this in an effort to present
    them in a\n   standard, common way, based on approaches found in multiple\n   dictionnaries.\n\n\t "

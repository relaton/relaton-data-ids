  content: "   ''Packet marking'' is proposed as an architectural generalization of\n
    \  the type of service (TOS) and precedence facilities of IPv4 [RFC795,\n   RFC1349],
    as well as the traffic class facilities of IPv6 [IPv6].  It\n   is intended to
    encompass all mechanisms by which a host or a router\n   may mark a packet to
    invoke some differentiated packet handling\n   behavior by another node along
    the transit path of the packet.  This\n   memo examines several proposed applications
    of a packet marking\n   facility and attempts to categorize each application in
    terms of the\n   behavioral requirements it imposes on hosts and routers.  In\n
    \  addition, issues related to the deployment of packet marking,\n   including
    provisioning, authorization, and security, are examined.\n   This memo is proposed
    as a framework to focus discussion on\n   implementation issues and mechanisms
    as new differentiated services\n   enabled by a packet marking facility are introduced
    into the\n   Internet.\n\n\t "

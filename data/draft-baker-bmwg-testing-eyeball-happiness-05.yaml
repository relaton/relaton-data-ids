  script: Latn
  content: "The amount of time it takes to establish a session using common transport
    APIs in dual-stack networks and networks with filtering such as proposed in BCP
    38 is a barrier to IPv6 deployment.  This note describes a test that can be used
    to determine whether an application can reliably establish sessions quickly in
    a complex environment such as dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) deployment or IPv6 deployment
    with multiple prefixes and upstream ingress filtering.  This test is not a test
    of a specific algorithm, but of the external behavior of the system as a black
    box.  Any algorithm that has the intended external behavior will be accepted by
    it.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "This draft presents two extensions to the DTN bundle protocol.  The\nfirst
    extension is the use of relative time rather than absolute time\nto address situations
    where the DTN nodes cannot achieve loosely\nsynchronized clocks, as required by
    the current DTN bundle protocol.\nThe second extension is the addition of a \"hops-to-live\"
    field to the\nbundle header, which specifies how many node-to-node hops each\ninstance
    of a bundle is permitted to make before it expires.\n\nThese two extensions are
    separable; either may be used independently\nof the other.  Used together, however,
    they provide a powerful way to\nconstrain resources consumed by the handling of
    a DTN bundle despite\nthe absence of synchronized clocks or the presence of incomplete\nknowledge
    of the network topology (which may lead to the presence of\nhazards such as routing
    loops).\n\t "

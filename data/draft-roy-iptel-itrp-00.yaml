  content: "This contribution describes an IP Telephony Routing Protocol (ITRP)\nfor
    intra-ITAD communications. ITRP is a SINGLE protocol that is\nused between gateways
    and servers as well as among servers. It uses\ndiscovery, registration, update,
    keep-alive, confirmation, and\nerror-notification messages. The connectionless
    (e.g., UDP)\ntransport is used and, if needed, multicasting can be used instead\nof
    flooding. The connection-oriented (e.g., TCP) transport can also\nbe utilized.
    ITRP's operation is independent of any signaling\nprotocol and, can serve as a
    mechanism to provide the reachability\ninformation about alias addresses including
    telephone numbers. The\nproposed message formats in ITRP are similar to TRIP.\n\n\t "

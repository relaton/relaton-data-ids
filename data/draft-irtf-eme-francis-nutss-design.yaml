  content: "   This document presents a high-level design for an End-Middle-End\n
    \  (EME) signaling protocol called NUTSS (which stands for NAT, URI,\n   Tunnel,
    Signaling, STUN).  While high-level, this document tries to\n   be detailed enough
    that the EME RG can have a meaningful debate about\n   its pros and cons and possible
    alternatives.  The main attribute of\n   NUTSS is that it couples together both
    path-coupled and path-\n   decoupled signaling.\n\n\n\t "

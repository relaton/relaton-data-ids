  content: "Routing protocols are subject to attacks that can harm individual\nusers
    or the network operations as a whole.  The lack of a common set\nof security requirements
    has led to the use in existing routing\nprotocol of a variety of different security
    solutions, which provide\nvarious levels of security coverage.\nThe RPSEC working
    group intends to deliver in a separate document a\nset of security requirements
    for consideration of routing protocol\ndesigners.  The first step in developing
    the security requirements is\nto analyze the threats that face routing protocols.
    \ This document\ndescribes the threats, including threat sources and capabilities,\nthreat
    actions, and threat consequences as well as a breakdown of\nrouting functions
    that might be separately attacked.\n\t "

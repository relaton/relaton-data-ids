  content: "This document specifies a consistent profile or subset of the \nfeatures
    from the DeltaV specification [DeltaV].  The subset is \nsuitable for simple linear
    document versioning in a WebDAV [RFC2518] \nenvironment.  The subset is intended
    to limit functionality in order \nto improve predictability and thus interoperability.
    \ If a server \nadvertises support for this subset, then a client can interoperate
    \nwith that server very easily due to its predictability.  A server \nadvertising
    support for this subset MUST also support DeltaV. \n\n\t "

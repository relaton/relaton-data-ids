  content: "    This specification describes a protocol for a Shared Registry\n    System
    (SRS) that allows multiple registrars to register domain\n    names within a single
    Top Level Domain (TLD).  The protocol is\n    high-level, text-based, and can
    be used over many underlying\n    transport mechanisms, including email.  The
    semantic content of\n    the protocol is expressed as a set of keyword-value pairs;
    the\n    semantics and structure of this content is, in this document,\n    loosely
    described as the 'payload'.\n \n    The protocol described herein is essentially
    identical to the SRS\n    version 1.5 protocol, specified by the CORE SRS RFP
    and developed\n    by Curt Meyer of Emergent Corporation.\n\n\t "

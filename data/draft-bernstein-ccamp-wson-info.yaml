  content: "This document provides an information model of information needed by \n
    \  the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength \n   switched
    optical networks (WSONs).  The purpose of information \n   described in this model
    is to facilitate constrained lightpath \n   computation in WSONs. In particular
    in cases where there are no or a \n   limited number of wavelength converters
    available in the WSON. This \n   model currently does not include optical impairments.

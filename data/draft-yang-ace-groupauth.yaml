abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Constrained devices have a limitation in adapting various general\n
    \  cryptography mechanisms since they have limited processing power,\n   storage
    space and transmission capacities. Moreover, in an\n   environment that has a
    large number of constrained devices, the\n   device authentication and authorization
    procedure causes serious\n   burdens. Therefore, this draft proposes a group authentication\n
    \  mechanism to solve existing problems.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

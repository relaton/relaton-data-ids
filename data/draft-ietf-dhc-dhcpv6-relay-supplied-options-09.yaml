  content: "DHCPv6 relay agents cannot communicate with DHCPv6 clients directly. However,
    in some cases, the relay agent possesses some information that would be useful
    to the DHCPv6 client. This document describes a mechanism whereby the DHCPv6 relay
    agent can provide such information to the DHCPv6 server, which can, in turn, pass
    this information on to the DHCP client.\n\n This document updates RFC 3315 (DHCPv6)
    by making explicit the implicit requirement that relay agents not modify the content
    of encapsulation payloads as they are relayed back toward clients. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

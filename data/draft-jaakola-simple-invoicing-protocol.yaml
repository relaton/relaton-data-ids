  content: "This memo specifies a protocol for transferring invoices automatically\n
    \ between companies. The receiver can read invoice data automatically\n  into
    accounts payables and possibly into approval work flow. This\n  eliminates the
    costly and error-prone manual typing of invoice data.\n  Main design goal was
    simplicity in order to make implementation easy.\n  The parties involved identify
    themselves using e-mail addresses, which\n  makes addressing simple and flexible.\n\n\t "

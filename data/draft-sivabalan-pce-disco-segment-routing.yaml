  content: "   When a PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in\n   Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP), or a server participating in IGP,\n   its presence and
    path computation capabilities can be advertised\n   using IGP flooding.  Such
    IGP extensions exist for OSPF and ISIS to\n   advertise several such capabilities.
    \ Segment Routing (SR) leverages\n   the source routing and tunneling pardigms
    in which a node steers a\n   packet through the network using segments.  A segment
    can be an MPLS\n   label or IPv6 header with a new extension.  In SR networks,
    a PCE can\n   be used to compute paths using SR PCEP extension.  This document\n
    \  specifies additional capability to advertise a PCE that supports the\n   new
    SR PCEP extension.\n\t "

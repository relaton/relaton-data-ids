  content: "   This document discusses client implementation issues relating to RFC\n
    \  9537, “Redacted Fields in the Registration Data Access Protocol\n   (RDAP)
    Response”. The considerations in this document have arisen\n   from problems raised
    by two separate teams attempting to implement\n   RFC 9537 in both an RDAP web
    client and an RDAP command line client.\n   Some of these problems may be insurmountable,
    leaving portions of RFC\n   9537 non-interoperable between clients and servers,
    while other\n   problems place a high degree of complexity upon clients.\n\n\t "

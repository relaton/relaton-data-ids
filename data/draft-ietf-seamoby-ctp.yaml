  content: "This document presents the Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) that enables
    authorized context transfers.  Context transfers allow better support for node
    based mobility so that the applications running on mobile nodes can operate with
    minimal disruption.  Key objectives are to reduce latency and packet losses, and
    to avoid the re-initiation of signaling to and from the mobile node.  This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

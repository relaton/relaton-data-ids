  content: "This documents describes functions implemented in Session Initiation\n
    \  Protocol (SIP) intermediaries known as Session Border Controllers\n   (SBCs).
    \ Although the goal of this document is to describe all the\n   functions of SBCs,
    a special focus is given to those practices that\n   are viewed to be in conflict
    with SIP architectural principles.  It\n   also explores the underlying requirements
    of network operators that\n   have led to the use of these functions and practices
    in order to\n   identify protocol requirements and determine whether those\n   requirements
    are satisfied by existing specifications or additional\n   standards work is required.\n\t "

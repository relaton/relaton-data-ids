  content: "   This document is derived from artificial intelligence (AI) network\n
    \  and autonomous security, network management intend-based technology\n   to
    ensure constant security quality in B5G.  SOAR (Security\n   Orchestration Automation
    and Response) is needed by autonomous\n   security and network management to optimize
    an adaptive B5G network.\n   The purpose of this document is to confirm whether
    the requirements\n   are reflected future users and developed to identify users
    provided\n   by useful decisions on how to develop the system.  This document
    also\n   covers the user requirements for autonomous security and intend-based\n
    \  network management to ensure constant security quality on B5G.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that\n
    \  a certain domain name does not exist.  It is also used to signal that\n   a
    domain name exists, but does not have the specific RR type you were\n   asking
    for.  This document attempts to answer two simple questions.\n\n   When returning
    a negative DNSSEC response, a name server sometimes\n   includes up to two NSEC
    records.  With NSEC3 the maximum amount is\n   three.\n\n   o  Why do you need
    up to two NSEC records?\n\n   o  And why does NSEC3 sometimes require an extra
    record?\n\n   The answer to the questions hinges on the concept of wildcards and\n
    \  the \"closest encloser\".  With NSEC, the name that is the \"closest\n   encloser\"
    is implicitly given in the record that also denies the\n   existence of the domain
    name.  With NSEC3, due to its hashing, this\n   information has to be given explicitly
    to a resolver.  It needs one\n   record to tell the resolver the closest encloser
    and then another to\n   deny the existence of the domain name.  Both NSEC and
    NSEC3 may need\n   yet another record to deny or assert a wildcard presence.  This\n
    \  results in a maximum of two NSEC and three NSEC3 records,\n   respectively.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies Proof of Process (PoP), an evidence framework\n
    \  for digital authorship attestation.  The framework produces tamper-\n   evident,
    independently verifiable process evidence describing how\n   documents evolve
    over time, without capturing document content or\n   keystroke data.\n\n   Proof
    of Process implements a specialized profile of the Remote\n   ATtestation procedureS
    (RATS) architecture, extending it with\n   behavioral entropy bindings, Verifiable
    Delay Function (VDF) temporal\n   proofs, and a taxonomy of absence claims with
    explicit trust\n   requirements.  The specification defines two complementary
    CBOR-\n   encoded formats: Evidence Packets (.pop) produced by Attesters during\n
    \  document authorship, and Attestation Results (.war) produced by\n   Verifiers
    after appraising Evidence.\n\n   The framework is designed around four core principles:
    privacy by\n   construction (no content storage), zero trust (locally generated,\n
    \  independently verifiable), evidence over inference (observable facts,\n   not
    conclusions), and cost-asymmetric forgery (expensive to fake, not\n   impossible).
    \ This specification does not address AI detection,\n   stylometric analysis,
    or intent inference.\n\n\t "

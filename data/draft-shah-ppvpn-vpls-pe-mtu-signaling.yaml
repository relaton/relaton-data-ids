  content: "The [DTLS] draft identifies the need for an information exchange \nmechanism
    between a PE device and its adjunct L2PE devices in the \ndecoupled transparent
    LAN architecture. For example, the PE needs to \nprovide information to an L2PE
    about the existence of remote \nsite(s), and the MPLS label(s) that the L2PE needs
    to use to reach \nthose site(s). The [HVPLS] draft requires signaling between
    the PE-\nrs and the MTU-s device to setup the spoke VC connection for the \nVPLS
    service. \n    \n\n\t "

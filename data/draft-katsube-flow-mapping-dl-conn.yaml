  content: "This memo describes an information exchange protocol which enables IP
    nodes (hosts or routers) to associate various kinds of 'flow' with 'datalink connections'.
    \ By performing such an information exchange between adjacent nodes, some of functions
    performed in the routers (e.g., classification of datagrams with regard to output
    interface and/or requesting service class) would be able to be carried out without
    (or before) analyzing each datagram but by referring to a datalink connection
    ID which conveys the datagram. This facilitates the routers to provide high-throughput
    and QoS-supported services much more efficiently.\n\t "

  content: "   The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a tool to describe the\n
    \  limited access that a single function device such as an Internet of\n   Things
    device might need.  The enforcement of the access control\n   lists described
    protects the device from attacks from the Internet,\n   and protects the Internets
    from compromised devices.\n\n   This document details a process which occurs when
    a device is\n   detected to have violated the stated policy.  The goal of these
    steps\n   is to ensure that the device is correctly removed from operation,\n
    \  fixed, and if possible, restored to safe operation.  This document\n   does
    not define any new protocols, but provides context in which a\n   number of existing
    protocols are to be used together.\n\n\t "

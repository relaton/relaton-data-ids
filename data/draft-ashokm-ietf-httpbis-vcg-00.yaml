  content: "The  delivery  of inappropriate  video content for  OTT and Social Media\nwith
    \ HTTP  video streaming is a  serious worldwide problem. Most of the\ncountries
    \ have  established  age-related  and  parental  guidelines  to\nwarn   about
    \ inappropriate  or  unintended  content,  particularly  for\nchildren.  However,
    \ these  guidelines  do  not  offer  the  freedom  or\nconvenience   for   audiences
    \ to  avoid  consumption  of  inappropriate\ncontent  for  their  target  age
    \ group  instead  just  provide  warning\nmessages only.The Age-Relevant Video
    Content  Guidelines (VCG)  Standard\ndefines  a  standard meta  data format  which
    covers fully and partially\nscene by scene age relevancy  meta data for  video
    \  and  audio  content\nand  hence establishes  a  mechanism  for  delivering
    \ video and  audio\ncontent tailored to the viewers' age  groups.\n\nThe  Video
    \ Content  Guidelines(VCG)  is  a meta  data  file  which  can\nenable   existing
    \  HTTP based adaptive  streaming  standard  like  HLS,\nDASH,  CMAF, MSS  and
    \ HDS with updating  manifest file using  VCG  meta\ndata,   that   ensures  only
    \  the  target  age-appropriate  content  is\ndelivered  to the  audience and
    \ in-appropriate data  can be  skipped or\nmodified  so that  different age  group
    \ audience can  choose what  they\nwant  to watch.  This  ensures  the compatibility
    \ of  with the standard\nadaptive  streaming  protocols and players,  so that
    the existing social\nMedia  and OTT  streaming infrastructure  continue to  work
    without  any\nmajor changes.\n\n\t "

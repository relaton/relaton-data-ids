  content: "   This document describes a method to be used by VPN Service Providers\n
    \  to provide multi-homed CEs with fast protection of egress PEs. Egress\n   PEs
    in a redundant group always share the same label in distribution\n   of VPN routes
    of a VRF. A virtual Next Hop (vNH) in the IGP/MPLS\n   backbone is created as
    the common end of LSP tunnels which would\n   otherwise terminate at each egress
    PE. Primary and backup LSP tunnels\n   ended at the vNH are set up by MPLS on
    basis of existing IGP FRR\n   mechanisms. If the primary egress PE fails, the
    backup egress PE can\n   recognize the \"shared\" VPN route label carried by the
    data packets.\n   Therefore, the failure affected data packets can be smoothly
    rerouted\n   to the backup PE for delivery without changing their VPN route label.\n\n\t "

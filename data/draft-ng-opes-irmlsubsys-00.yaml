  content: "The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based \nlanguage
    that can be used to describe service-specific execution \nrules for network edge
    intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge \nServices (OPES) framework, as described
    in [3] and [4].  This memo \ndiscusses the need for OPES framework to have different
    sub-systems \nin different deployment scenario, and proposes additions to IRML
    for \na more flexible approach to supporting different sub-systems.  \n\n\t "

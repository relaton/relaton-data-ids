  content: "   This memo presents techniques for controlling the membership of\n   multicast
    groups which are constrained to be a subset of a pre-\n   existing multicast group,
    where such subset groups are only used for\n   short duration transactions which
    are multicast to a subset of the\n   larger multicast group.  Further the memberships
    of these\n   transactional groups is pushed by the sender rather than being pulled\n
    \  by the receiver.  These groups could be called Transactional Subset\n   Push
    Multicast Groups, but that label would be a bit long.\n\n\t "

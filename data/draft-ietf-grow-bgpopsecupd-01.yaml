  content: "   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol almost exclusively\n
    \  used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network\n   domains.
    \ Due to this central nature, it is important to understand\n   the security and
    reliability measures that can and should be deployed\n   to prevent accidental
    or intentional routing disturbances.\n\n   Previously, security considerations
    for BGP have been described in\n   RFC7454 / BCP194.  Since the publications of
    RFC7454 / BCP194,\n   several developments and changes in operational practice
    took place\n   that warrant an update of these best current practices.  This\n
    \  document replaces RFC7454 / BCP194, reiterating the best practices\n   for
    BGP security from that document and adding new practices and\n   recommendations
    that emerged since its publication.\n\n   This document provides a comprehensive
    list of Internet specific BGP\n   security and reliability related best practices
    as of the time of\n   publication.  It specifically does not cover other uses
    of BGP, e.g.,\n   in a datacenter context.\n\n   While the recommendations in
    this document are, in general, best\n   practices, operators still need to carefully
    weigh individual\n   measures vs. their local network requirements before implementing\n
    \  them.  Also, as with BCP194, best practices outlined in this document\n   may
    have changed since its publication.\n\n\t "

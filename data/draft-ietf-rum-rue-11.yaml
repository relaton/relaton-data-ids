  content: "Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which
    a hearing person can communicate with a sign language speaker who is deaf, deafblind,
    or hard of hearing (HoH) or has a speech disability using an interpreter (i.e.,
    a Communications Assistant (CA)) connected via a videophone to the sign language
    speaker and an audio telephone call to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using
    sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the
    interpreters may be employed by a company or agency, termed a \"provider\" in
    this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to
    connect video devices to their service and subsequently to CAs and other sign
    language speakers.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the sign language
    speaker conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider
    and that direct video calls between sign language speakers work.  This document
    describes the interface between a videophone and a provider.\n\t "

  content: "   Encryption and other security mechanisms are on the rise on all\n   layers
    of the stack, protecting user data and making network\n   operations more secured.
    \ Further, encryption is also a tool to\n   address ossification that has been
    observed over time.  Separation of\n   functions into layers and enforcement of
    layer boundaries based on\n   encryption supports selected exposure to those entities
    that are\n   addressed by a function on a certain layer.  A clear separation\n
    \  supports innovation and also enables new opportunities for\n   collaborative
    functions.  RFC 8558 describes path signals as messages\n   to or from on-path
    elements.  This document states principles for\n   designing mechanisms that use
    or provide path signals and calls for\n   actions on specific valuable cases.\n\n\t "

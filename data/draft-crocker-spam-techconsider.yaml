  content: "Internet mail has operated as an open and unfettered\nchannel between
    originator and recipient. This invites\nsome abuses, called spam, such as burdening
    recipients\nwith unwanted commercial email. Spam has become an\nextremely serious
    problem, is getting much worse and is\nproving difficult (or impossible) to eliminate.
    The\nmost practical goal is to bring spam under control; it\nwill require an on-going,
    adaptive effort, with\nstochastic rather than complete results. This note\ndiscusses
    available points of control in the Internet\nmail architecture, considerations
    in using any of those\npoints, and opportunities for creating Internet\nstandards
    to aid in spam control efforts.  It offers\nguidance about likely trade-offs,
    benefits and\nlimitations.\n\t "

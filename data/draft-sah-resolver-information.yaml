  content: "   This document describes methods for DNS resolvers to self-publish\n
    \  information about themselves, such as whether they perform DNSSEC\n   validation
    or are available over transports other than what is\n   defined in RFC 1035.  The
    information is returned as a JSON object.\n   The names in this object are defined
    in an IANA registry that allows\n   for light-weight registration.  Applications
    and operating systems\n   can use the methods defined here to get the information
    from\n   resolvers in order to make choices about how to send future queries\n
    \  to those resolvers.\n\n\t "

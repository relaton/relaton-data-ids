  content: "   This document specifies an HTTP extension to establish bi-directional\n
    \  byte streams in the direction from servers to their clients,\n   utilizing
    HTTP as a tunneling mechanism.  This approach not only\n   facilitates communication
    between servers located behind firewalls\n   and their known clients but also
    introduces the potential for these\n   known clients to serve as relays.  In such
    configurations, clients\n   can forward application protocol messages or relay
    TCP connections,\n   allowing servers to interact with any client on the Internet
    without\n   direct exposure.\n\n\t "

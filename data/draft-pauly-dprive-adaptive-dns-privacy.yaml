  content: "   This document defines an architecture that allows clients to\n   dynamically
    discover designated resolvers that offer encrypted DNS\n   services, and use them
    in an adaptive way that improves privacy while\n   co-existing with locally provisioned
    resolvers.  These resolvers can\n   be used directly when looking up names for
    which they are designated.\n   These resolvers also provide the ability to proxy
    encrypted queries,\n   thus hiding the identity of the client requesting resolution.\n\n\t "

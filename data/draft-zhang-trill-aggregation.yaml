  content: "   This document specifies TRILL active/active edge which allows\n   multiple
    RBridges concurrently forward data frames of the same VLAN\n   on links bundled
    by a Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group. With this\n   kind of connection, end
    nodes may increase the bandwidth and\n   reliability of the access at the edge
    of TRILL campuses. It's\n   required that no loop or duplication is caused by
    this new connection\n   type. Besides this basic requirement, this document outlines
    other\n   potential issues associated with TRILL active/active edge and\n   investigates
    how these issues may be addressed.\n\n\t "

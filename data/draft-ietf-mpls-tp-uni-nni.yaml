  content: "The framework for MPLS in transport networks (RFC 5921) provides reference
    models for the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Transport Service Interfaces,
    which are a User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and a Network-to-Network Interface
    (NNI). This document updates those reference models to show detailed reference
    points for these interfaces, along with further clarification of the functional
    architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.\n\n This document is a product of a
    joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

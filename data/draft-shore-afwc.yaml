    network entities to request firewall and NAT services and\nresources.  It is an
    instance of a protocol that provides\nauthorizations and other security servcies,
    and interworks with other\nsuch instances.  AFWC uses its authorization facilities
    to provide\nnetwork administrators more control over network border admissions\ndecisions
    than is provided by other firewall pinholing protocols.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies Metalink/HTTP: Mirrors and Cryptographic Hashes
    in HTTP header fields, a different way to get information that is usually contained
    in the Metalink XML-based download description format.  Metalink/HTTP describes
    multiple download locations (mirrors), Peer-to-Peer, cryptographic hashes, digital
    signatures, and other information using existing standards for HTTP header fields.
    \ Metalink clients can use this information to make file transfers more robust
    and reliable.  Normative requirements for Metalink/HTTP clients and servers are
    described here. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

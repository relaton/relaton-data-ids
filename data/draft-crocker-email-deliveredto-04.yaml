  content: "   The address to which email is delivered might be different than any\n
    \  of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were\n   created
    by the email author.  The address used by the email transport\n   service is provided
    separately, through an envelope SMTP \"RCPT TO\"\n   command.  Before final delivery,
    handling can entail a sequence of\n   submission/delivery events, using different
    destination addresses,\n   that lead to the recipient.  It can be helpful for
    a message to have\n   a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence,
    and to\n   include each address used for that recipient.  This document defines\n
    \  a header field for this information.\n\n   Email handling information is a
    matter of modifying the email\n   infrastructure and possibly creating privacy
    concerns.  A header\n   field such as this is not automatically assured of adoption
    or use.\n   Therefore it is being published as an Experiment, looking for\n   constituency
    and for operational utility.\n\n   This document is produced through the Independent
    RFC stream and was\n   not subject to the IETF's approval process.\n\n\t "

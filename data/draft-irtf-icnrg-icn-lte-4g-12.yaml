  content: "A 4G mobile network uses IP-based transport for the control plane to establish
    the data session at the user plane for the actual data delivery.  In the existing
    architecture, IP-based unicast is used for the delivery of multimedia content
    to a mobile terminal, where each user is receiving a separate stream from the
    server.  From a bandwidth and routing perspective, this approach is inefficient.
    \ Evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast service (eMBMS) provides capabilities
    for delivering contents to multiple users simultaneously, but its deployment is
    very limited or at an experimental stage due to numerous challenges.  The focus
    of this document is to list the options for using Information-Centric Networking
    (ICN) in 4G mobile networks and elaborate the experimental setups for its further
    evaluation.  The experimental setups discussed provide guidance for using ICN
    either natively or with an existing mobility protocol stack.  With further investigations
    based on the listed experiments, ICN with its inherent capabilities such as network-layer
    multicast, anchorless mobility, security, and optimized data delivery using local
    caching at the edge may provide a viable alternative to IP transport in 4G mobile
    networks.\n\t "

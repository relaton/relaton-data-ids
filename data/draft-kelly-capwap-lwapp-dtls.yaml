- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The LWAPP protocol defines interactions between wireless termination\n
    \  points and wireless access controllers.  Communications between these\n   components
    must be secured, and the current specification provides\n   for transport security
    using proprietary mechanisms which are\n   embedded in the protocol.  This document
    describes an alternative\n   approach which eliminates the embedded security,
    and instead uses\n   DTLS as a secure, tightly-integrated wrapper.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects\n
    \  to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n   different
    domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\" of protocols
    forming a horizontal unified, defragmented IoT\n   platform.  Such a platform
    will make objects accessible to\n   applications across organizations and domains.
    \ Towards this goal,\n   quite a few proposals have been made to build a unified
    host-centric\n   IoT platform as an overlay on top of today's host-centric Internet.\n
    \  However, there is a fundamental mismatch between the host-centric\n   nature
    of todays Internet and the information-centric nature of the\n   IoT system.  To
    address this mismatch, we propose to build a common\n   set of protocols and services,
    which form an IoT platform, based on\n   the Information Centric Network (ICN)
    architecture, which we call\n   ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages the salient features
    of ICN, and thus\n   provides seamless mobility support, scalability, and efficient\n
    \  content and service delivery.\n\n   This draft describes representative IoT
    requirements and ICN\n   challenges to realize a unified ICN-IoT framework.  Towards
    this, we\n   first identify a list of important requirements which a unified IoT\n
    \  architecture should have to support tens of billions of objects, then\n   we
    discuss how the current IP-IoT overlay fails to meet these\n   requirements, followed
    by discussion on suitability of ICN for IoT.\n\n   Though we see most of the IoT
    requirements can be met by ICN, we\n   discuss specific challenges ICN has to
    address to satisfy them.  Then\n   we provide discussion of popular IoT scenarios
    including the \"smart\"\n   home, campus, grid, transportation infrastructure,
    healthcare,\n   Education, and Entertainment for completeness, as specific scenarios\n
    \  requires appropriate design choices and architectural considerations\n   towards
    developing an ICN-IoT solution.\n\n\t "

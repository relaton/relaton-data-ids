  content: "   This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows a\n
    \  planned change to the data in the LoST server to occur.  Records that\n   previously
    were valid will become invalid at a date in the future,\n   and new locations
    will become valid after the date.  The extension\n   adds two elements to the
    <findservice> request: a URI to be used to\n   inform the LIS that previously
    valid locations will be invalid after\n   the planned change date, and add a date
    which requests the server to\n   perform validation as of the date specified.
    \ It also adds an\n   optional TTL element to the response, which informs all
    queriers the\n   current expected lifetime of the validation.\n\n\t "

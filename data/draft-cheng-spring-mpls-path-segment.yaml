  content: "   A Segment Routing (SR) path is identified by an SR segment list, one\n
    \  or partial segments of the list cannot uniquely identify the SR path.\n   Path
    identification is a pre-requisite for various use-cases such as\n   performance
    measurement (PM) of an SR path.\n\n   This document defines a new type of segment
    that is referred to as\n   Path Segment, which is used to identify an SR path.
    \ When used, it is\n   inserted at the ingress node of the SR path and immediately
    follows\n   the last segment of the SR path.  The Path Segment will not be popped\n
    \  off until it reaches the egress node of the SR path.\n\n   Path Segment can
    be used by the egress node to implement path\n   identification hence to support
    various use-cases including SR path\n   PM, end-to-end 1+1 SR path protection
    and bidirectional SR paths\n   correlation.\n\n\t "

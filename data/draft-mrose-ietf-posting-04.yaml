  content: "All self-governing bodies have ways of managing the scope of participant
    interaction.  The IETF uses a consensus-driven process for developing computer-communications
    standards in an open fashion.  An important part of this consensus-driven process
    is the pervasive use of mailing lists for discussion.  Notably, in a small number
    of cases, a participant has engaged in a \"denial-of-service\" attack to disrupt
    the consensus-driven process.  Regrettably, as these bad faith attacks become
    more common, the IETF needs to establish a practice that reduces or eliminates
    these attacks.  This memo recommends such a practice for use by the IETF.  This
    document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

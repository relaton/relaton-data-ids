  content: "The field of Accounting Management is concerned with the collection of\nresource
    consumption data for the purposes of capacity and trend\nanalysis, cost allocation,
    auditing, and billing. This document\ndescribes each of these problems, and discusses
    the issues involved in\ndesign of modern accounting systems.\nSince accounting
    applications do not have uniform security and\nreliability requirements, it is
    not possible to devise a single\naccounting protocol and set of security services
    that will meet all\nneeds. Thus the goal of accounting management is to provide
    a set of\ntools that can be used to meet the requirements of each application.\nThis
    document describes the currently available tools as well as the\nstate of the
    art in accounting protocol design. A companion document,\ndraft-brownlee-accounting-attributes-0x.txt,
    reviews the state of the\nart in accounting attributes and record formats.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

    UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers.\n   UTF8SMTP extension of
    ESMTP takes care that mails with UTF-8\n   characters in SMTP envelope and mail
    headers are not delivered to EAI\n   non-compliant SMTP servers.  This document
    describes mechanism how to\n   keep messages with UTF-8 characters on mail headers
    separated from\n   EAI non-compliant Mail User Agents.  This document also describes\n
    \  general requirements for UTF8SMTP Message Store.\n\n\t "

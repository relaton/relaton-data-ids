  content: "   There have been multiple issues with the allocation of TCP option\n
    \  kind numbers recently.  Two of these issues, which this document\n   attempts
    to address, are that there were only a small number of\n   options reserved by
    RFC 4727 for experiment and test use in the RFC\n   3692 style to begin with,
    and both of these have been used in\n   shipping products.  This impacts the ability
    of other research and\n   experimental efforts to develop and test running code
    since\n   registration of other option numbers requires either IESG Approval or\n
    \  Standards Action.  This document proposes designation of additional\n   experimental
    options in the IANA registry for TCP Option Kind\n   Numbers, intended to resolve
    the possible barriers to using the\n   existing RFC 3962 experimental-use options.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Domain contact information over DNS provides a vehicle for\n   exchanging
    contact information in a programmatic and reliable\n   manner. DNS has a ubiquitous
    presence within the internet\n   infrastructure and will act as a reliable publication
    method for\n   contact information exchange. This RFC provides an agreed upon\n
    \  structure, voluntarily, to publish points of contact for domains.\n\n   This
    document outlines the methodology for utilizing DNS TXT records\n   for voluntary
    publication of various forms of contact. The intended\n   purpose is to provide
    a faster means of reliable contact for\n   professionals, cyber-defense of domains.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a method to do Per VPN routing for L3 PPVPNs.
    \n   The solution uses BGP for auto-discovery of VPN membership, but uses \n   Per
    VPN RIP instances and dynamic MPLS tunnel interfaces to exchange \n   customer
    routes. The document proposes modifications to the RIP \n   protocol to the make
    the solution scalable. The framework presented \n   also supports deployment of
    multicast routing and forwarding for L3 \n   PPVPNs without enabling multicast
    in the core. \n\t "

  content: "   This short memo outlines the author's thoughts of current status and\n
    \  future development questions around IETF's financing mechanisms.\n\n   This
    memo is also input for discussion that the IETF community should\n   have.  The
    memo is the first part of the author's goal to document\n   the status and various
    challenges and opportunities associated with\n   the IETF Administrative Activity
    (IASA), in the context of the so\n   called \"IASA 2.0\" project.\n\n   The memo
    has no particular official standing, nor does it claim to\n   represent more than
    the authors' thinking at the time of writing.\n\n\t "

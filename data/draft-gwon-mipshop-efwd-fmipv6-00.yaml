  content: "We introduce Enhanced Forwarding from the Previous Care-of Address \n(eFWD)
    for fast handovers in Mobile IPv6. eFWD enables a mobile node \nto create and
    directly control a bi-directional tunnel between the \nmobile node’s previous
    and new subnet’s access routers subsequent to \na link layer handover. eFWD reduces
    handover latency by expediting \nthe mobile node’s movement detection and new
    subnet’s access router \ndiscovery via proposed Candidate Access Router Information
    Discovery \n(CARID) method and by eliminating time to acquire a new care-of \naddress.
    Main advantage of eFWD is complete removal of link layer \npre-triggers that are
    extremely complex mechanisms to implement in \nwireless technologies other than
    cellular systems. \n\t "

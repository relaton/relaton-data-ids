  content: "   Classical information models have proven highly effective for the\n
    \  design and operation of machine-based communication and computation\n   systems.
    \ These models intentionally abstract away meaning,\n   interpretation, and human
    decision-making in order to achieve formal\n   clarity and computability.\n\n
    \  This document describes a conceptual extension to classical\n   information
    models, referred to as complex information, which\n   represents information as
    consisting of two components: a real\n   component, suitable for machine processing,
    and an imaginary\n   component, representing human context, meaning, and non-computable\n
    \  decision factors.\n\n   The proposed concept does not replace existing information
    theory,\n   nor does it define new protocols or standards.  Instead, it provides\n
    \  a descriptive framework for reasoning about information systems that\n   interact
    with human decision processes, trust, and interpretation.\n\n\t "

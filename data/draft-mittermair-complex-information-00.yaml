abstract:
- content: "<p>Classical information models have proven highly effective for the design
    and operation of machine-based communication and computation systems. These models
    intentionally abstract away meaning, interpretation, and human decision-making
    in order to achieve formal clarity and computability. This document describes
    a conceptual extension to classical information models, referred to as complex
    information, which represents information as consisting of two components: a real
    component, suitable for machine processing, and an imaginary component, representing
    human context, meaning, and non-computable decision factors. The proposed concept
    does not replace existing information theory, nor does it define new protocols
    or standards. Instead, it provides a descriptive framework for reasoning about
    information systems that interact with human decision processes, trust, and interpretation.</p>"

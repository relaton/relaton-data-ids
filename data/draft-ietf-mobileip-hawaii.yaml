  content: "In this contribution, we present HAWAII: a domain-based approach for\nsupporting
    mobility.  HAWAII uses specialized path setup schemes\nwhich install host-based
    forwarding entries in specific routers to\nsupport intra-domain micro-mobility
    and defaults to using Mobile-IP\nfor inter-domain macro-mobility.  These path
    setup schemes deliver\nexcellent performance by reducing mobility related disruption
    to user\napplications, and by operating locally, reduce the number of mobility\nrelated
    updates.  Also, in HAWAII, mobile hosts retain their network\naddress while moving
    within the domain, simplifying Quality of\nService support.  Furthermore, reliability
    is achieved through\nmaintaining soft-state forwarding entries for the mobile
    hosts and\nleveraging fault detection mechanisms built in existing intra-domain\nrouting
    protocols.\n\t "

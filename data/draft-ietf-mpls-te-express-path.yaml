  content: "   In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance\n
    \  criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE\n   LSP.
    \ Such performance criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss\n   or other
    indications such as the conformance to link performance\n   objectives and non-RSVP
    TE traffic load.  This specification uses\n   network performance data, such as
    is advertised via the OSPF and ISIS\n   TE metric extensions (defined outside
    the scope of this document) to\n   perform such path selections.\n\n\t "

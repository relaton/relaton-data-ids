  content: "   Auto-Configuration in Virtual Aggregation as specified in\n   [I-D.ietf-grow-va-auto]
    requires configuration of a \"VP-range list\"\n   in ASBRs connected to transit
    and peer ISPs.  These ASBRs simply tag\n   some routes whose prefix falls within
    the VP-Range with a \"can-\n   suppress\" tag to indicate whether these routes
    should be FIB\n   installed.  This draft specified an extended auto-configuration\n
    \  mechanism in Virtual Aggregation to support the configuration of both\n   \"VP-List\"
    and \"popular prefixes\".  Specifically, based on this\n   mechanism, the ratio
    of lost packets when VP routes fail could be\n   minimized.\n\t "

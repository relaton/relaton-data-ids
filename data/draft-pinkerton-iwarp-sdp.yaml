abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "    SDP is a byte-stream transport protocol that closely mimics TCP's
    \n    stream semantics. SDP utilizes iWARP's advanced protocol offload, \n    kernel
    bypass, and zero copy capabilities. Because of this, SDP can \n    have lower
    CPU and memory bandwidth utilization when compared to \n    conventional implementations
    of sockets over TCP, while preserving \n    the familiar byte-stream oriented
    semantics upon which most current \n    network applications depend. \n\t "

  content: "This document describes P2PNS, a secure distributed name service for\nP2PSIP.
    \ P2PNS can be used to resolve SIP AoRs to Contact URIs\nwithout using DNS or
    central SIP servers.  P2PNS provides several\nsecurity mechanisms to efficiently
    prevent identity theft and to\nensure the uniqueness of SIP AoRs in a completely
    decentralized and\nuntrusted network without login servers.  The proposed proxy\narchitecture
    allows a seamless integration of legacy SIP UAs, avoids\nmodifications to the
    complex SIP protocol stack and facilitates the\ndeployment of P2PSIP networks.
    \ Because P2PNS provides a generic name\nservice it is not limited to P2PSIP but
    can also be used e.g. to\nbuild a distributed DNS system.\n\t "

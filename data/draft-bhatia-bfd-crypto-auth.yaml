  content: "This document proposes an extension for Bidirectional Forwarding \nDetection
    (BFD) to allow the use of any cryptographic authentication \nalgorithm in addition
    to the already documented authentication \nschemes, described in the base specification.
    \   \n\nAlthough this document has been written specifically to introduce two
    new Authentication types it describes how BFD can use National \nInstitute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) Secure Hash Standard \nfamily of algorithms (SHS)
    to authenticate the control packets, the \nmethod described in this document is
    generic and can be used to \nextend BFD to support any cryptographic hash function
    in the future. \n\n\t "

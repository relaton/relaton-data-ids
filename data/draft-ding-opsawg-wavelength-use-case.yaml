  content: "   This document describes use cases that demonstrate the applicability\n
    \  of network data to evaluate the performance of wavelength division\n   service.
    \ The objective of this draft is not to cover the wavelength\n   division service
    in detail.  Rather, the intention is to illustrate\n   the requirements of network
    data used to evaluate the performance of\n   wavelength division service.\n\n
    \  General characteristics of network data and two typical use cases are\n   presented
    in this document to demonstrate the different application\n   scenarios of network
    data in wavelength division service.\n\n\t "

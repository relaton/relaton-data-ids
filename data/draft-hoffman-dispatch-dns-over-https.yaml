  content: "   DNS queries sometimes experience problems with end to end\n   connectivity
    at times and places where HTTPS flows freely.\n\n   HTTPS provides the most practical
    mechanism for reliable end to end\n   communication.  Its use of TLS provides
    integrity and confidentiality\n   guarantees and its use of HTTP allows it to
    interoperate with\n   proxies, firewalls, and authentication systems where required
    for\n   transit.\n\n   This document describes how to run DNS service over HTTP
    using\n   https:// URIs.\n\n   [ This paragraph is to be removed when this document
    is published as\n   an RFC ] Comments on this draft can be sent to the DNS over
    HTTP\n   mailing list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dnsoverhttp .\n\n\t "

  content: "This document reproduces the Host/Host Protocol developed by the ARPA
    Network Working Group during 1969, 1970, and 1971.  It describes a protocol used
    to manage communication between processes residing on independent Hosts.  It addresses
    issues of multiplexing multiple streams of communication (including addressing,
    flow control, connection establishment/disestablishment, and other signaling)
    over a single hardware interface.  It was the official protocol of the ARPA Network
    from January 1972 until the switch to TCP/IP in January 1983.  It is offered as
    an RFC at this late date to help complete the historical record available through
    the RFC series.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for the historical record.\n\t "

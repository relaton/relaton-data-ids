  content: "There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systems\nwithin
    the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway\nProtocol [BGP],
    which is used to provide routing information between\nautonomous systems. This
    document proposes a system where the origin\nof any advertisement within BGP can
    be verified and authenticated,\npreventing the advertisement of prefix blocks
    by unauthorized\nnetworks, and verifying that the final destination in the path
    is\nactually within the autonomous system to which the packets are being\nrouted.\n\t "

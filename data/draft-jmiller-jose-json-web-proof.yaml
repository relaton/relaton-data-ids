  content: "   The JOSE set of standards established JSON-based container formats\n
    \  for Keys (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7517/), Signatures\n   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7515/),
    and Encryption\n   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7516/).  They also established\n
    \  IANA registries (https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml) to\n   enable
    the algorithms and representations used for them to be\n   extended.  Since those
    were created, newer cryptographic algorithms\n   that support selective disclosure
    and unlinkability have matured and\n   started seeing early market adoption.\n\n
    \  This document defines a new container format similar in purpose and\n   design
    to JSON Web Signature (JWS) called a _JSON Web Proof (JWP)_.\n   Unlike JWS, which
    integrity-protects only a single payload, JWP can\n   integrity-protect multiple
    payloads in one message.  It also\n   specifies a new presentation form that supports
    selective disclosure\n   of individual payloads, enables additional proof computation,
    and\n   adds a protected header to prevent replay and support binding\n   mechanisms.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This proposal allows host configuration to be split between two\ndifferent
    DHCP servers, potentially under different administration.\nThis may be useful
    to satisfy specific regulatory, operational\nor business model requirements.\nThis
    draft proposes two different approaches. In one approach, a\nDHCP server redirects
    clients to a second DHCP server. In the other,\na DHCP server acts as a proxy
    to a second server.\n\t "

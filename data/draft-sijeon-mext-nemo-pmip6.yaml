  content: "   Network mobility (NEMO) enables all the nodes within a mobile network\n
    \  to provide session continuity without requiring their involvement\n   when
    the mobile network moves. To provide NEMO support, the NEMO\n   basic support
    protocol (NEMO-BSP) is specified in [RFC 3963].\n\n   With the advances of the
    network-based mobility management protocol\n   referred to as Proxy Mobile IPv6
    (PMIPv6), interest in applicable\n   NEMO support in the PMIPv6 domain is increasing
    however, the standard\n   PMIPv6, defined in [RFC 5213], handles only a single
    mobile node.\n\n   This document presents a NEMO-enabled PMIPv6 using a Proxy
    Router\n   (PR) rather than the MR defined in [RFC 3963] and describes detailed\n
    \  operations for network/node mobility support in the PMIPv6 domain.\n\n\t "

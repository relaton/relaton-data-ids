  content: "   With IP protocols now generalizing to constrained networks, users\n
    \  expect to be able to Operate, Administer and Maintain them with the\n   familiar
    tools and protocols they already use on less constrained\n   networks.\n\n   OAM
    uses specific messages sent into the data plane to measure some\n   parameters
    of a network.  Most of the time, no explicit values are\n   sent is these messages.
    \ Network parameters are obtained from the\n   analysis of these specific messages.\n\n
    \  This can be used:\n\n   o  To detect if a host is up or down.\n\n   o  To measure
    the RTT and its variation over time.\n\n   o  To learn the path used by packets
    to reach a destination.\n\n   OAM in LPWAN is a little bit trickier since the
    bandwidth is limited\n   and extra traffic added by OAM can introduce perturbation
    on regular\n   transmission.\n\n   Two scenarios can be investigated:\n\n   o
    \ OAM coming from internet.  In that case, the NGW should act as a\n\t "

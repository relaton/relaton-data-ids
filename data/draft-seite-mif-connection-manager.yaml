  content: "It is a common practice for multiple interface terminals to use a\nconnection
    manager to perform provisioning domain selection and\ninterface configuration.
    \ The concept of connection managers for\npersonal computers is well known, and
    similar logic is now common in\nmobile phones that have multiple radio interfaces
    [3GPP TS 23.402].\nThe Problem Statement document highlights the lack of standardized\nbehavior
    for terminals in regard to managing multiple interfaces and\ntheir respective
    properties.  To address this issue, this document\nproposes a set of functional
    requirements for a generic MIF\nConnection Manager.\n\t "

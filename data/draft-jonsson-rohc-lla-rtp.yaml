  content: "This document defines a ROHC profile for compression of IP/UDP/RTP\npackets,
    utilizing functionality provided by the lower layer to\nincrease compression efficiency
    by completely eliminating the header\nfor most packets during normal operation.
    The profile is built as an\nextension to the  ROHC RTP profile [ROHC]. It defines
    additional\nmechanisms needed in ROHC, states requirements on the lower layer
    to\nguarantee transparency, and specifies general logic for compression\nand decompression
    making use of this header-free packet.\n\t "

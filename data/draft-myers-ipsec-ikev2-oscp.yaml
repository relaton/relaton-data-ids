abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "While IKEv2 supports public key based authentication (PKI), the \ncorresponding
    use of in-band CRLs is problematic due to unbounded CRL \nsize.  The size of an
    OCSP response is however well-bounded and small.  \nThis document defines two
    extensions to IKEv2 which enable the use of \nOCSP for in-band signaling of certificate
    revocation status.  Two new \ncontent encodings are defined for use in the CERTREQ
    and CERT payloads:  \nOCSP Responder Hash and OCSP Response.  An OCSP Responder
    Hash CERTREQ \npayload triggers transmission of an OCSP Response CERT payload.\n\t "

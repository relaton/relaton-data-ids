  content: "   Internet of Everything (IoE) deployments increasingly bind together\n
    \  devices, networks, cloud and edge compute, AI-assisted processing,\n   and
    human participation within the same time-bounded operational\n   interactions.
    \ When governance is externalized into multiple\n   fragmented control contexts,
    the system must continuously propagate\n   and reconcile identity, policy state,
    routing state, and compute\n   placement decisions across those contexts, in real
    time.\n\n   This document defines an architectural problem: as independently\n
    \  scaling dimensions multiply, coordination surfaces grow at\n   multiplicative
    rates, making deterministic governance impractical.\n   The draft enumerates requirements
    for interaction-scoped governance\n   primitives that collapse fragmented control
    contexts.\n\n\t "

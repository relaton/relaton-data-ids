  content: "   Monitoring of net neutrality is of interest to regulators as well as\n
    \  users throughout the world.  Standardized metrics are lacking.\n   Measurements
    need to be at the end user client, be able to accurately\n   separate wire and
    host time, detect quality of service provided to\n   individual applications and
    be lightweight.  The IPv6 Performance and\n   Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination
    Option meets all these criteria.\n   We propose that PDM be used for such measurements.
    \ A gap analysis\n   shows that PDM is available for IPv6 only and not for IPv4
    or low\n   powered devices.\n\n\t "

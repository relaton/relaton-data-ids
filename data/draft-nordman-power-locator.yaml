  content: "This specification addresses how to request that a device should\n   enter
    a \"power locator\" mode for a limited period of time.  The mode\n   involves
    a device cycling between a low and high power level in a\n   predictable manner
    so that a power metering device upstream in the\n   power distribution system
    can sense the signal and so determine where\n   the device draws its power from.
    \ This will be useful in many types\n   of buildings, particularly data centers
    and large commercial\n   buildings.  This draft addresses operation of the device
    carrying out\n   the request, but not detailed operation of the device that makes
    the\n   request and interprets the results.\n\n   This draft is an initial discussion
    document to generate feedback and\n   improvement.\n\n\t "

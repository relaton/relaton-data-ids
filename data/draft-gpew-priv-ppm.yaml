  content: "   There are many situations in which it is desirable to take\n   measurements
    of data which people consider sensitive.  In these\n   cases, the entity taking
    the measurement is usually not interested in\n   people's individual responses
    but rather in aggregated data.\n   Conventional methods require collecting individual
    responses and then\n   aggregating them, thus representing a threat to user privacy
    and\n   rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical.  This\n   document
    describes a multi-party privacy preserving measurement (PPM)\n   protocol which
    can be used to collect aggregate data without\n   revealing any individual user's
    data.\n\n\t "

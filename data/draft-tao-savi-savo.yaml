  content: "   This memo describes SAVO SAVI, a source address validation mechanism\n
    \  for IPv6 networks based on the OSPFv3 protocol within Intra-Domain\n   field.
    The proposed mechanism is intended to complement ingress\n   filtering techniques
    to provide a higher granularity on the control\n   of the forged source addresses
    and it can deal with the asymmetric\n   routing for which the common uRPF scheme
    ([RFC2827]) may fail.\n\n   The proposed SAVO mechanism does not need any additional\n
    \  communication between the routers in which the SAVO mechanism has\n   been
    implemented and deployed. It can be incrementally deployed by\n   the network
    manager and when it is only partially deployed it still\n   helps to restrict
    the effect of the source address forging. It\n   provides proactive incentives
    for the users who deploy it for they\n   will be able to filter the packets with
    forged source address to a\n   certain range, especially when the forged addresses
    are in the range\n   of OSPF route prefixes.\n\n\t "

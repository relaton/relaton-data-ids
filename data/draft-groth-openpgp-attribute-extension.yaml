  content: "A RFC was accepted extending TLS usage to include OpenPGP keys (RFC\n5081)
    as an alternative or in addition to X.509 certificates,\nhowever the author did
    not really standardise the way the\ninformation in OpenPGP keys was to be presented
    and this could be\ndetrimental or fragment efforts to utilise OpenPGP keys in
    this\nmanner.\n\nThe author didn't touch on the issue generating confidence scores\nbeyond
    potential use of Certificate Authorities.\n\t "

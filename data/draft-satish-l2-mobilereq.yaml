  content: "IP mobility protocols have traditionally been designed to be\nindependent
    of any L2 considerations.  A critical factor in achieving\ngood performance for
    IP mobility protocols is its closeness to an L2\nhandover. Handover occurs when
    a Mobile Node moves from one radio\naccess Point to another. If the new radio
    access point is associated\nwith a new subnet, the routing reachability change
    will have to reflect\nat the access routers. Better synchronization between L2
    handover and\nL3 handover are still more important when supporting fast handoff\nbetween
    two wireless domains. This draft discusses the L2 handover\nsteps and the possible
    coupling of L2 and L3 layers to support optimize\nlayer 3 handover. This draft
    also explores the location information as\na possible L2 trigger to support optimized
    L3 handover. Also an L2\ntrigger message format is defined which can be handled
    at L3\nindependent of other protocol considerations.\n\t "

  content: "This draft proposes a distributed local mobility anchors\narchitecture.
    \ It splits the functions of a local mobility anchor\ninto different logical functions:
    (1) allocation of home network\nprefixes or home addresses to mobile nodes, (2)
    location management\n(LM) which includes managing the IP addresses and locations
    of the\nmobile nodes, and (3) mobility routing (MR) which includes\nintercepting
    and forwarding packets.  The distributed local mobility\nanchors architecture
    consists of home local mobility anchors (H-LMA)\nat the registered networks and
    visited local mobility anchors (V-LMA)\nat the visited networks.  The V-LMA provides
    mobility routing\nfunction to avoid triangle routing problem in Proxy mobile IP,\nwhereas
    the H-LMA keeps the location management function.  The needed\nlocation information
    of a mobile node is acquired by a V-LMA from the\nH-LMA only when a packet is
    first sent to the mobile node via the\nV-LMA and are then cached at the V-LMA
    to enable optimized mobility\nrouting for packets subsequently sent to the mobile
    node.\n\nWhen either the source or the destination node is a fixed node,\nbypassing
    the tunneling role of all LMA's will expose the location\ninformation of the mobile
    node in some cases.  Yet unnecessarily long\nroutes are still avoid by having
    multiple V-LMA's in different\nnetworks and serving the packet transport with
    the nearest V-LMA.\n\t "

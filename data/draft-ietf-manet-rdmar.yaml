  content: "This document describes the Relative  Distance Micro-discovery Ad\nHoc
    Routing (RDMAR) protocol for use in mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs).  The protocol
    is highly adaptive, bandwidth-efficient\nand scaleable.  A key concept in its
    design is that protocol\nreaction to link failures is typically localised to a
    very small\nregion of the network near the change. This desirable behaviour is\nachieved
    through the use of a novel mechanism for route discovery,\ncalled Relative Distance
    Micro-discovery (RDM).  The concept behind\nRDM is that a query flood can be localised
    by knowing the relative\ndistance (RD) between two terminals.  To accomplish this,
    every\ntime a route search between the two terminals is triggered, an\niterative
    algorithm calculates an estimate of their RD, given an\naverage nodal mobility
    and information about the elapsed time since\nthey last communicated and their
    previous RD.  Based on the newly\ncalculated RD, the query flood is then localised
    to a limited\nregion of the network centred at the source node of the route\ndiscovery
    and with maximum propagation radius that equals to the\nestimated relative distance.
    This ability to localise query flooding\ninto a limited area of the network serves
    to increase scalability\nand minimise routing overhead and overall network congestion.\n\t "

  content: "   Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and ICANN's\n
    \  Security and Stability Advisory Committee have discussed the problems\n   that
    the DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains that have\n   address records
    in them (so-called \"dotless domains\").  However,\n   these statements spoke
    of the problem mostly as theoretical, when in\n   fact there are such TLDs today.
    \ This document lists the current\n   dotless TLDs, and gives a script for finding
    them.  This document\n   lists data about dotless TLDs, but does not address the
    policy and\n   technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.\n\n\t "

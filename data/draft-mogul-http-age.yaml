  content: "The 'Age' response-header field in HTTP/1.1 [RFC 2068] is\n        intended
    to provide a lower bound of an estimate of a\n        response message's age (time
    since generation), by\n        explicitly indicating the amount of time that is
    known to\n        have passed since the response message was retrieved or\n        revalidated.
    \ There has been considerable controversy over\n        when the Age header field
    should be added to a response.\n        This document explains the issues, rebuts
    a previous\n        proposal, and provides a set of proposed changes for the\n
    \       revision of RFC 2068.\n\t "

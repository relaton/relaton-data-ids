  script: Latn
  content: "Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across multiple
    domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLS networks presents a problem
    because no single point of path computation is aware of all of the links and resources
    in each domain. A solution may be achieved using the Path Computation Element
    (PCE) architecture.\n\n Where the sequence of domains is known a priori, various
    techniques can be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains are simply
    connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection are also known, the Per-Domain
    Path Computation technique can be used. Where there are multiple connections between
    domains and there is no preference for the choice of points of interconnection,
    the Backward-Recursive PCE-based Computation (BRPC) procedure can be used to derive
    an optimal path.\n\n This document examines techniques to establish the optimum
    path when the sequence of domains is not known in advance. The document shows
    how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow the optimum sequence of domains
    to be selected, and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived through the use
    of a hierarchical relationship between domains. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

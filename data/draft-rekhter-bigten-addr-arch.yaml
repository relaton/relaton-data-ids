  content: "This paper provides an architecture for allocating IPng addresses in the
    Internet. This paper does not go into the details of an addressing plan.  This
    paper focuses on addressing for a particular proposal known as BigTen, but the
    general principles apply to any hierarchically allocated address space.                                                             The
    IPng address space is a finite shared resource that must be managed for the good
    of the community. The managers of this resource are acting as its custodians.
    They have a responsibility to the community to manage it for the common good.\n\t "

  content: "Today, each application typically uses its own way to identify data.\nThe
    lack of a common naming scheme prevents applications from\nbenefiting from available
    copies of the same data distributed via\ndifferent P2P and CDN systems.  The main
    proposal presented in this\ndraft is idea that there should be a secure and application\nindependent
    way of naming information objects that are transported\nover the Internet.  The
    draft defines a set of requirements for such\na naming structure.  It also presents
    a proposal for such a naming\nstructure that could relevant for a number of work
    groups (existing\nand potential), e.g.  PPSP, DECADE and CDNI.  In addition, today's\nP2P
    naming schemes lack important security aspects that would allow\nthe user to check
    the data integrity and build trust in data and data\npublishers.  This is especially
    important in P2P applications as data\nis received from untrusted peers.  Providing
    a generic naming scheme\nfor P2P systems so that multiple P2P systems can use
    the same data\nregardless of data location and P2P system increases the efficiency\nand
    data availability of the overall data dissemination process.  The\nsecure naming
    scheme is providing self-certification such that the\nreceiver can verify the
    data integrity, i.e., that the correct data\nhas been received, without requiring
    a trusted third party.  It also\nenables owner authentication to build up trust
    in (potentially\nanonymous) data publishers.  The secure naming structure should
    be\nbeneficial as potential design principle in defining the two\nprotocols identified
    as objectives in the PPSP charter.  This\ndocument enumerates a number of design
    considerations to impact the\ndesign and implementation of the tracker-peer signaling
    and peer-peer\nstreaming signaling protocols.\n\t "

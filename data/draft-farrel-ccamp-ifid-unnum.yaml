  content: "   This document provides a means to identify component links that are\n
    \  bundled within an unnumbered interface. This feature is required\n   during
    Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)\n   establishment of Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) that utilize such\n   component links. Similarly, it is useful in
    error reporting for\n   such LSPs.\n\n\t "

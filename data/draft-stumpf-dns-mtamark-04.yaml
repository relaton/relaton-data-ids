  content: "   In contrast to other more extensive approaches to deal with\n   unsolicited
    email, commonly called \"spam\", this memo discusses a very\n   simple authentication
    scheme.  It uses marking of hosts in reverse\n   DNS (IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
    zones) to allow the receiving mail\n   transfer agents to decide whether the connecting
    (sending) host is a\n   designated mail transfer agent (MTA) or not.\n\n   Despite
    being a weaker scheme than most of the other proposals\n   currently discussed,
    it can reduce the amount of spam and viruses/\n   worms significantly and has
    the advantage that it can be implemented\n   based on existing and well-established
    Internet technology like DNS\n   without any changes to that technology.\n\n   This
    document is part of the LMAP work of the Anti-Spam Research\n   Group (ASRG) of
    the IRTF.\n\t "

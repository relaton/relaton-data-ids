  content: "This document describes a new application of the Telephony Routing\nover
    IP (TRIP) protocol. TRIP was engineered as a tool for inter-\ndomain exchange
    of telephone routing information. However, it can\nalso be used as a means for
    gateways and soft switches to export\ntheir routing information to a Location
    Server (LS), which may be\nco-resident with a proxy or gatekeeper. This LS can
    then manage those\ngateway resources. We discuss the motivations for this application,\nand
    then show how a subset of TRIP is needed for this application.\n\t "

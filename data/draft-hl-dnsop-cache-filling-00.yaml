  content: "   DNS recursive resolvers do not always have access to the\n   authoritative
    resolvers from which they need to get information.  For\n   example, when the
    DNS root servers are under DDoS attack, a recursive\n   resolver may not be able
    to get an answer from any of the root\n   servers.  This document describes how
    resolvers can populate their\n   caches with zone information, and keep their
    cache populated, using\n   out-of-band mechanisms that do not rely on the DNS
    protocol.  The\n   protocol is primarily designed for the root zone, but can apply
    to\n   any zone that wants to participate by publishing values to be cached.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the format of presence information. It makes\ndeliberately
    abstraction from issues associated with the transport of\nthis information. The
    proposed format follows the W3C XML\nrecommendation, such that presence information
    are valid XML \ndocuments according to a presence DTD.\nAs several types of devices
    are envisioned to handle presence\ninformation, including devices with low computing
    power and\nnetworking capabilities, the defined format has been kept as simple\nas
    possible, with only five tags defined, two of which with no\ndefined attributes.\n\n\t "

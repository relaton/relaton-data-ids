  content: "   This document describes an attack against SIP networks where a small\n
    \  number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP requests can stimulate\n   massive
    amounts of proxy-to-proxy traffic.  The document analysis\n   ways to limit the
    impact of this kind of attack, and proposes changes\n   to the SIP protocol to
    help mitigate the risk.  The document also\n   proposes ways to improve diagnosis
    of failures caused by the hop\n   limit being reached.\n\n   The purpose of this
    document is to stimulate discussion of the\n   identified problem and proposed
    solutions.  Much of the proposed\n   solution language appears normative, but
    implementors should not\n   treat the current document as such.\n\n   Comments
    are solicited, and should be directed to the SIPPING working\n   group list at
    'sipping@ietf.org'.\n\t "

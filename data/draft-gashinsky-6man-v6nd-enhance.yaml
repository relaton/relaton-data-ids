  content: "   In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover\n
    \  the actual number of machines on the subnet.  In contrast, the\n   default
    IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers\n   trillions of addresses,
    the overwhelming number of which will be\n   unassigned.  Consequently, simplistic
    implementations of Neighbor\n   Discovery can be vulnerable to denial of service
    attacks whereby they\n   attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers
    of unassigned\n   addresses.  Such denial of attacks can be launched intentionally
    (by\n   an attacker), or result from legitimate operational tools that scan\n
    \  networks for inventory and other purposes.  As a result of these\n   vulnerabilities,
    new devices may not be able to \"join\" a network, it\n   may be impossible to
    establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6\n   transported flows may be interrupted.\n\n
    \  This document describes a modification to the [RFC4861] neighbor\n   discovery
    protocol aimed at improving the resilience of the neighbor\n   discovery process.
    \ We call this process Gratuitous neighbor\n   discovery and it derives inspiration
    in part from analogous IPv4\n   gratuitous ARP implementation.\n\n\t "

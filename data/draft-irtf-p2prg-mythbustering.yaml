  content: "Peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic optimization techniques that aim at improving
    locality in the peer selection process have attracted great interest in the research
    community and have been the subject of much discussion. Some of this discussion
    has produced controversial myths, some rooted in reality while others remain unfounded.
    This document evaluates the most prominent myths attributed to P2P optimization
    techniques by referencing the most relevant study or studies that have addressed
    facts pertaining to the myth. Using these studies, the authors hope to either
    confirm or refute each specific myth.\n\n This document is a product of the IRTF
    P2PRG (Peer-to-Peer Research Group).\n\t "

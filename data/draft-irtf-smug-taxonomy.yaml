  content: "With the growth and commercialization of the Internet, the need for\nsecure
    IP multicast is growing. In this draft we present a taxonomy \nof multicast security
    issues. We first sketch some multicast group\nparameters that are relevant to
    security, and outline the basic\nsecurity issues concerning multicast in general,
    with emphasis on IP\nmulticast. Next we suggest two 'benchmark' scenarios for
    secure\nmulticast solutions. Lastly we review some previous works.\n\t "

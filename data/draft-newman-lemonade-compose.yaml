  content: "The submission profile of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)\nprovides
    a standard way for an email client to submit a complete\nmessage for delivery.
    \ The chunking extension provides a way for a\nclient to compose a message for
    submission from a series of client\nprovided pieces.  This specification further
    extends the chunking\nfacility so that a client can compose a message from additional\nsources.
    \ For example, a client could use this facility to forward a\nmessage from an
    IMAP server or forward a web page as an attachment to\na new message.\n\t "

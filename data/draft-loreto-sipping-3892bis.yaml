  script: Latn
  content: "SIP has a mechanism for conveying the identity of the referrer of a\nrequest
    by means of the Referred-By header field.  This header field\nmay be used when
    exploding a SIP MESSAGE request to a pre-defined\ngroup URI and when exploding
    a SIP INVITE request to an ad-hoc group\nor to a pre-defined group URI.  The Referred-By
    header is only\nincluded if the P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header
    field\nin the exploded SIP requests needs to carry another value, e.g. the\nURI
    of a pre-defined group, or a conference focus URI.  In those\ncases, the Referred-By
    header field in the resulting exploded\nrequests is set to the P-Asserted-Identity
    header field or to the\nFrom header field of the original SIP request received
    before\nexploding to convey to the receiver the identity of the original\ninviting
    sender.\n\nRFC 3892 restricts the value of the header to only one SIP URI.\nHowever
    the P-Asserted-Identity header field currently allows two URI\nvalues and may
    be expanded in the future to carry more than two\nvalues as described in draft-ietf-sipping-update-pai-09.
    \ This\ndocument extends the Referred-By definition to support more than one\nvalue
    as well.\n\t "

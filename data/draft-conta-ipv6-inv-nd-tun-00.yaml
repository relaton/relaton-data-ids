  content: "This memo describes an extension mechanism to the IPv6 Neighbor  Discovery
    and IPv6 Inverse Neighbor Discovery [IND] that applies to IPv6\nand IPv4 tunnels.
    \ The mechanism can be used to advertise the parameters of a tunnel to its exit
    point node, and to create a reverse tunnel path between the exit point and entry
    point nodes of a  unidirectional  tunnel.   If  such a bidirectional tunnel already
    exists, the\nmechanism can be used to learn the IPv6 address of the tunnel pseudointerface
    \ of the exit-point node, as well as the reverse tunnel path parameters.\n\t "

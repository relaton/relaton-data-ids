  content: "   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts\n
    \  to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models\n   in
    the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for\n   use in the
    development of the One Data Model liaison organization\n   (OneDM) definitions.
    \ Tools convert this format to database formats\n   and other serializations as
    needed.\n\n   An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects and their\n
    \  associated interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the\n   Data
    types for the information exchanged in those interactions.\n\n\n   // A JSON format
    representation of SDF 1.0 was defined in version\n   // (-00) of this document;
    version (-05) was designated as an\n   // _implementation draft_, labeled SDF
    1.1, at the IETF110 meeting of\n   // the ASDF WG (2021-03-11).  The present version
    (-11) collects a\n   // few smaller changes as input to the 2022-02-28 ASDF WG
    interim.\n   // It also removes deprecated elements from SDF 1.0.\n\n\t "

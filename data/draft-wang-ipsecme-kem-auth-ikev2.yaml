abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a new authentication mechanism, called KEM (Key
    Encapsulation Mechanism) -based authentication, for the Internet Key Exchange
    Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2). This is motivated by the fact that some post-quantum
    KEMs (like ML-KEM) are more efficient than post-quantum signature algorithms (like
    ML-DSA).</p>"

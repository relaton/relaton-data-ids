  content: "   This document describes the use-cases of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise\n
    \  Control, and Platooning, as defined by several Standards Development\n   Organizations
    such as ETSI, IEEE 1609, SAE and 3GPP.\n\n   C-ACC and Platooning involve concepts
    of direct vehicle-to-vehicle,\n   and device-to-device communications, which are
    developped by 3GPP and\n   precursory by the METIS EU project.  They are illustrated
    very\n   clearly in emergency settings such as FirstNet.\n\n   IP messages - instead
    of link-layer messages - are pertinent for\n   C-ACC and Platooning use-cases
    because applications for road safety\n   such as WAZE, iRezQ and Coyote (currently
    involving infrastructure)\n   are IP messages, and proved succesful in deployments.
    \ Applications\n   such as Sentinel are direct between vehicles but are not IP,\n
    \  currently.\n\n\t "

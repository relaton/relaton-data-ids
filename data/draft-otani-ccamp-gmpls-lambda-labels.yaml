  content: "Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a \n   consequence
    new equipment providing lambda switching capability has \n   been developed and
    is currently being deployed. However, RFC 3471 has \n   defined that a wavelength
    label (section 3.2.1.1) \"only has \n   significance between two neighbors\" and
    global wavelength continuity \n   is not considered. In order to achieve interoperability
    in a network \n   composed of next generation lambda switch-capable equipment,
    this \n   document defines a standard lambda label format, being compliant with
    \n   ITU-T G.694. Moreover some consideration on how to ensure lambda \n   continuity
    with RSVP-TE is provided. This document is a companion to \n   the Generalized
    Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling. It \n   defines the label format
    when Lambda Switching is requested in an all \n   optical network. \n\t "

  content: "This memo documents a long-standing technique, supported by a large number
    of mail servers, which allows users to be notified of new mail. In addition to
    server support, there are a number of clients that support this, ranging from
    full email clients to specialized clients whose only purpose is to receive new
    mail notifications and alert a mail client.\n\n In brief, the server sends the
    string \"nm_notifyuser\" CRLF to the finger port on the IP address (either configured
    or last used) of the user who has received new mail. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

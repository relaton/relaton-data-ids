- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an automatic and stateless IPv6 prefix\ndelegation
    solution for IPv6-only and dual-stack access networks.\nThe solution builds on
    automatic delegation mechanism defined by 6RD,\nbut is suitable for IPv6-only
    networks, including those that have not\ndeployed stateful DHCPv6.  The described
    stateless approach\nessentially exchanges the complexity of the stateful prefix\ndelegation
    to increased consumption of IPv6 address space and less\nflexible properties.\n\t "

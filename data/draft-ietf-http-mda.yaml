  content: "As the number of commercial services on the world wide web increases rapidly,
    the need arises for a means for these services to authenticate clients, and vice
    versa. A simple scheme can be based on keyed hash functions with a shared secret
    key for each client/server pair. Key management becomes impractical for both clients
    and servers when the number of participants is scaled up. This document describes
    a efficient scheme for using mutually trusted third parties to mediate authentication,
    as a direct extension of the digest access authentication scheme. The scheme is
    based upon public domain algorithms, and unlike encryption software, isn't subject
    to export restrictions. The main benefits to users include: avoiding having to
    enter separate user names and passwords for each service, and an ability to authenticate
    servers. It is proposed that the mediated digest authentication scheme be included
    in the proposed HTTP/1.1 specification.\n\t "

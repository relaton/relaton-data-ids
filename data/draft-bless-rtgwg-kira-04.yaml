  content: "   This document describes the Kademlia-directed ID-based Routing\n   Architecture
    KIRA.  KIRA is a scalable zero-touch distributed routing\n   solution that is
    tailored to control planes.  It prioritizes scalable\n   and resilient connectivity
    over route efficiency (stretched paths are\n   acceptable vs. routing protocol
    overhead).  KIRA's self-assigned\n   topological independent IDs can be embedded
    into IPv6 addresses.\n   Combined with further self-organization mechanisms from
    Kademlia,\n   KIRA achieves a zero-touch solution that provides scalable IPv6\n
    \  connectivity without requiring any manual configuration.  For\n   example,
    it can connect hundreds of thousands of routers and devices\n   in a single network
    without requiring any form of hierarchy (like\n   areas).  It works well in various
    topologies and is loop-free even\n   during convergence.  This self-contained
    solution, and especially the\n   independence from any manual configuration, make
    it suitable as\n   resilient base for all management and control tasks, allowing
    to\n   recover from the most complex failure scenarios.  The architecture\n   consists
    of the ID-based network layer routing protocol R²/Kad in its\n   Routing Tier
    (using source routing) and a PathID-based Forwarding\n   Tier (using PathIDs as
    labels for paths).  KIRA’s tightly integrated\n   add-on services (e.g., name
    resolution as well as fast and efficient\n   topology discovery) provide a perfect
    basis for autonomic network\n   management solutions.\n\n\t "

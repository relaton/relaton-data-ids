  content: "The number of organizations that have more than one Internet connection
    is increasing significantly with time.  In a substantial number of these cases,
    an organization's multiple connections are from the same ISP; this type of multi-homing
    is localized to the organization and its single provider, so a globally unique
    ASN should not be needed.  However, many ISPs can only support their customers'
    reliability and load-sharing requirements by using BGP, which DOES require an
    ASN.  Since the needs of the ISP and its multi-homed customer are contrary to
    the Internet's need to allocate the ASN space sensibly, this is a problem.  A
    solution to this problem has been proposed which makes use of private ASNs, but
    it has several disadvantages.  This paper documents the existing solution and
    describes its disadvantages, then presents another solution which doesn't share
    the same disadvantages.\n\t "

  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application layer\ncontrol
    (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating\nsessions with one
    or more participants. In the current PSTN, call\nsignaling messages travel through
    switches which act as trusted\nintermediaries. The signaling messages typically
    include calling\nparty identification information which may be delivered to the\ncalled
    party. The calling party is able to suppress the delivery of\nsuch information
    to the called party in order to maintain privacy.\n\t "

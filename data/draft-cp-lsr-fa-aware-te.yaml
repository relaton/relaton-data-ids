  content: "   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo]proposes a solution that allows IGPs\n   themselves
    to compute constraint based paths over the network, and it\n   also specifies
    a way of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and\n   SRv6 locators to steer
    packets along the constraint-based paths.\n\n   [RFC8570] describes IS-IS extensions
    to distribute network-\n   performance information (such as residual bandwidth,
    and available\n   bandwidth).\n\n   This draft describes the IGP extensions to
    advertise the\n   corresponding network-performance information of the Flex-Algorithm.\n\n\t "

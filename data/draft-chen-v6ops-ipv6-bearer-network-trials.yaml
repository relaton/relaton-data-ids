  content: "   This memo has introduced IPv6 practices on China Mobile IP bearer\n
    \  network, in which IP backbone network and broadband access routers\n   have
    been covered.  In the practice, IPv6 protocol conformance and\n   data packages
    forwarding capabiliteis have been tested in multi-\n   vendors environments.  Several
    IPv6 transition schemes have been\n   deployed to validate interoperabilities.
    \ Based on concrete testing\n   data, IPv6-enable deployment experiencies have
    been learned to share\n   with community.\n\n\t "

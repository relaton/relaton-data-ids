  content: "   Anycast RP (Rendezvous Point) protocol [N2] is designed to provide
    \n   load balancing and failover for RP.  However, there is no cooperation \n
    \  mechanism among anycast RP members when sending Register-Stop to DR \n   and
    transferringRegisters among anycast RP members.  The former \n   results in the
    subscribers under some Anycast RP members having \n   multicast service interruption
    and the latter leads to bandwidth \n   waste among Anycast RP members due to trashy
    Registers. This \n   specification solves these problems by giving the cooperation
    \n   mechanism among anycast RP members. \n\n\t "

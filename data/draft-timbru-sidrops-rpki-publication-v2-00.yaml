  content: "   The RPKI Publication Protocol first described in RFC 8181 has worked\n
    \  very well.  That said, as it turns out, there are a number of\n   requirements
    emerging from operational experience which cannot be\n   supported by the current
    protocol.  In particular, identity key roll\n   overs, support for publication
    quota and stricter verification of\n   content by the server.\n\n   This document
    is an early write-up with the following goals: (1)\n   support discussions about
    requirements for additional work and (2)\n   explore a possible version 2 with
    solutions to meet those\n   requirements.\n\n\t "

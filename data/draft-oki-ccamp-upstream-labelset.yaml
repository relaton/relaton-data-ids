  content: "This document describes extensions to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling required\nto
    support a upstream label set when a bidirectional path is set up.  In\nthe existing
    drafts on GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling, a upstream label for the\nupstream path has
    to be reserved at an intermediate node before Path\nmessage is transmitted to
    the next-hop node. On the other hand, a label\nset that includes one or more labels
    for the downstream path is carried\nby Path message and then Resv message reserves
    a label at each interme-\ndiate node on the route or a source node.  This document
    proposes the\nway to support the upstream label set as is the case of the Label
    Set\nfor downstream.\n\n\t "

  content: "As the Internet grows, it becomes inevitable even for the general \nusers
    to take measures against the security risks such as tapping, \nunauthorized access,
    and so on. For example, we can consider the use \ncase of networked home appliances
    which cannot have the rich \ncalculation resources and may use the dedicated transport
    protocol \nfor the media session. In such a case, it is effective to connect \nsuch
    devices securely using IPsec [1] because it does not require the \nrich resources,
    and is independent of the upper layer protocol. Also \nfrom the viewpoint of implementation,
    IPsec is not only widespread in \nIPv4, but also mandatory in IPv6 which is expected
    in the networked \nhome appliances region(this use case is just the one of examples,
    and \nthis document does not focus only on home appliances but also on the \ngeneral
    applications which use the dedicated media protocols, where \nIPsec is suitable
    as the security protocol). \n\n\t "

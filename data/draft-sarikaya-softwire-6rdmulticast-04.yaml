  content: "   This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6 hosts can\n
    \  receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  In 6rd encapsulation\n   solution,
    multicast communication is completely integrated into 6rd\n   tunnel. 6rd Customer
    Edge router is extended with Multicast Listener\n   Discovery (MLD) protocol Proxy
    entity.  MLD Proxy receives join\n   requests from 6rd IPv6 hosts and sends them
    upstream in 6rd's IPv4 in\n   IPv6 tunnel to 6rd Border Relay (BR).  This tunnel
    is used to\n   exchange MLD messages to establish multicast state at 6rd BR so
    that\n   6rd BR can use 6rd's IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel to send IPv6 multicast data\n
    \  to 6rd CEs.  At the CEs, multicast data is decapsulated and MLD Proxy\n   delivers
    it to IPv6 hosts based on MLD group membership state.  In\n   6rd Translation
    Multicast based solution, the protocol is based on\n   proxying MLD at the 6rd
    Customer Edge router and then translating MLD\n   messages to IGMP messages and
    sending them upstream to a network\n   which supports IPv4 multicast. 6rd Border
    Relay is multicast router\n   and IGMP-MLD translator.  It translates IGMP join
    back to MLD join\n   message and sends it to multicast source.  IPv6 Multicast
    data\n   received at 6rd Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast data\n
    \  and then sent to IPv4 multicast tree downstream to 6rd Customer Edge\n   which
    translates back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers to the\n   hosts.\n\n\t "

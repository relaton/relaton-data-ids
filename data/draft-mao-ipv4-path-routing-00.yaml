  content: "   This document describes a solution to the IPv4 address shortage \n
    \  problem. The solution is to be implemented within the IPv4\n   framework, rather
    than inside a \"next generation\" IP protocol.\n\n   By organizing local networks
    as an \"intranet hierarchy\" attached\n   to the Internet, nodes inside the hierarchy
    can be uniquely addressed\n   with path descriptions. Two IPv4 options, Source-Side
    Path-info and\n   Destination-Side Path-info, are added into the IPv4 protocol,
    so that\n   up to 2 path descriptions can be carried in the IPv4 header. Further,\n
    \  a currently unused flag bit in the IPv4 header is used to extend the\n   logical
    IPv4 header, so that options can also be carried \"out-band\".\n   \n   Core routers
    in the Internet will ignore the unrecognized new options\n   and the extension,
    and thus need not be replaced or updated.\n\t "

  content: "This document establishes an address allocation framework for \nGeographically
    Aggregatable Provider Independent (GAPI) IPv6 addresses\nfor the purpose of multihoming.
    A /16 is divided in a hierarchical \nmanner over geographical entities such as
    parts of continents, \ncountries, states, provinces and metropolitan areas, with
    each \nreceiving one or more /32 allocations from which end-user assignments \ncan
    be made. The number of /32 allocations for a geographical entity \ndepends on
    the current population. This address allocation framework\nin itself does not
    present a scalable multihoming solution, it merely\nprovides a necessary building
    block for such solutions.\n\n\t "

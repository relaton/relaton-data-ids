  content: "Certain L2VPN architectures [IPLS, VPLS] rely on there being a full\nmesh
    of pseudowires [PWE3-ARCH] among a set of entities.  This mesh\nis used to provide
    a 'LAN-like' service among the entities.  If one\nor more of these pseudowires
    is absent, so that there is not really a\nfull mesh, various higher layers (from
    routing to bridge control\nprotocols) that expect a LAN-like service may fail
    to work as\nexpected.  Therefore it is desirable to have procedures that enable\nthe
    pseudowire endpoints to determine automatically whether there is\nreally a full
    mesh or not.  It is also desirable to have procedures\nthat cause the L2VPNs to
    adapt to pseudowire failures.  This document\nproposes a set of procedures to
    meet these goals.  Detailed protocol\nencodings are not present, but will be added
    in future versions.\n\t "

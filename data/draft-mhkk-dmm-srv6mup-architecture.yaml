abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Segment Routing IPv6 Mobile User Plane (SRv6
    MUP) architecture for Distributed Mobility Management. The requirements for Distributed
    Mobility Management described in [RFC7333] can be satisfied by routing fashion.
    Mobile services are deployed over several parts of IP networks. A Segment Routing
    over IPv6 (SRv6) network can accommodate all, or part of those networks thanks
    to the large address space of IPv6 and the network programming capability described
    in [RFC8986]. Segment Routing IPv6 Mobile User Plane Architecture can incorporate
    existing session based mobile networks. By leveraging SRv6 network programmability,
    mobile user plane can be integrated into the SRv6 data plane. In that routing
    paradigm, session information between the entities of the mobile user plane is
    turned to routing information.</p>"

  content: "   This document defines the Mobile User Plane (MUP) architecture using\n
    \  Segment Routing (SR) for Distributed Mobility Management.  The\n   requirements
    for Distributed Mobility Management described in\n   [RFC7333] can be satisfied
    by routing fashion.\n\n   Mobile services are deployed over several parts of IP
    networks.  An\n   SR network can accommodate a part of those networks, or all
    those\n   networks.  IPv6 dataplane option (SRv6) is suitable for both cases\n
    \  especially for the latter case thanks to the large address space, so\n   this
    document illustrates the MUP deployment cases with IPv6\n   dataplane.\n\n   MUP
    Architecture can incorporate existing session based mobile\n   networks.  By leveraging
    Segment Routing, mobile user plane can be\n   integrated into the dataplane.  In
    that routing paradigm, session\n   information between the entities of the mobile
    user plane is turned\n   to routing information.\n\n\t "

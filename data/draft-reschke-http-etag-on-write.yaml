- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specifies a state identifier,\ncalled
    \"Entity Tag\", to be returned in the \"ETag\" response header.\nHowever, the
    description of this header for write operations such as\nPUT is incomplete, and
    has caused confusion among developers and\nprotocol designers, and potentially
    interoperability problems.\n\nThis document explains the problem in detail and
    suggests both a\nclarification for a revision to the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC2616)\nand
    a new header for use in responses, making HTTP entity tags more\nuseful for user
    agents that want to avoid round-trips to the server\nafter modifying a resource.\n\t "

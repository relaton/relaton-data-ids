  content: "The Mobile IP can provide IP mobility. The mobile node identified by \nits
    Home Address can have transparent home IP routing service \nregardless of attaching
    point.  However the need for the user \nmobility support has identified by wireless
    operators so as to \nprovide IP routing service, based on the user identifier
    not based on \nhome IP address.  This document specifies the user mobility support
    \nfor Mobile IPv6 through DNS, while providing semi-secure binding \nupdate mechanism
    for the route optimization between MN and CN.\n\t "

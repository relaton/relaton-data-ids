  content: "This document defines Address Settlement by Peer-to-Peer (ASP), a\npeer-to-peer
    (P2P) binary signaling protocol for usage on the\nInternet.  A P2P signaling protocol
    provides its clients with an\nabstract hash table service between a set of cooperating
    peers that\nform the P2P network.  ASP is designed to support a P2P Session\nInitiation
    Protocol (SIP) network, but it can be utilized by other\napplications with similar
    requirements.  ASP introduces the notion of\nusages, which are a collection of
    data types that are required for a\nparticular application.  For SIP, these types
    include location, STUN\nand TURN servers.  ASP defines a security model based
    on a\ncertificate enrollment service that provides peers with unique\nidentities.
    \ ASP also provides protocol extensibility and defines a\nmigration methodology,
    allowing for major upgrades of the P2P network\nwithout service disruption.\n\t "

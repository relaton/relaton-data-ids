  content: "This document was written during the process of clarification of RFC2598
    \"An Expedited Forwarding PHB\" that led to the publication of revised specification
    of EF \"An Expedited Forwarding PHB\".  Its primary motivation is providing additional
    explanation to the revised EF definition and its properties.  The document also
    provides additional implementation examples and gives some guidance for computation
    of the numerical parameters of the new definition for several well known schedulers
    and router architectures.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

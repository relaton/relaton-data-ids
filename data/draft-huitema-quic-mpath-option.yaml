  content: "   The initial version of QUIC provides support for path migration.  We\n
    \  propose a simple mechanism to support not just migration, but also\n   simultaneous
    usage of multiple paths.  In its simplest form, this\n   mechanisms simply requires
    that multipath senders keep track of which\n   packet is sent on what path, and
    use that information to manage\n   congestion control and loss recovery.  With
    that, clients can send\n   data on any validated path, and server on any validated
    path on which\n   the client recently sent non-probing packets.  A more sophisticated\n
    \  mechanism can be negotiated to explicitly manage paths and packet\n   scheduling.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the\n
    \  Internet when moving from an Access Router to another, a process\n   referred
    to as handover.  Several proposals [5] and [6] were made in\n   order to improve
    the handover delay to support real-time traffic,\n   such as Voice over IP.  These
    proposals keep a fundamental\n   characteristic of Mobile IP, namely the handover
    process is triggered\n   by the Mobile Terminal.  This document expands this concept
    to cover\n   situations where the handover has to be performed by network\n   management
    issues, such as spectrum allocation.  The document\n   describes a control architecture
    based on the policy management.\n\t "

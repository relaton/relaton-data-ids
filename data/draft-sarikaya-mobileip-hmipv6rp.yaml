  content: "This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Regional Paging \n(HMIPv6RP),
    a small and link-layer independent extension to the \nHierarchical Mobile IPv6
    with regional registrations, to support \npower-constrained operation in the mobile
    nodes and to reduce routing \nstate information in the visited domain.  The extension
    allows a \nmobile node to enter a power saving idle mode during which its \nlocation
    is known with the coarse accuracy defined by a paging area. \nIn the visited domain
    only the paging mobility anchor point (PMAP) is \nresponsible for keeping the
    binding cache entries for idle mobile \nnodes and, it re-establishes the downlink
    routes on demand by means \nof paging. This does not require snooping of data
    packets but is a \nnatural extension to network-level routing. Optionally, the
    mobile \nnode and the visited domain can agree on time slot based paging used
    \nfor Paging Agent Advertisements to restrict link interface power-on \ntime in
    the mobile node. \n\n\t "

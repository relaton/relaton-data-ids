  content: "This document addresses the general security requirements of both v4 and
    v6 versions of DHCP. This document lists security requirements and proposes as
    security model, which meets scaling requirements, security requirements and efficiency
    requirements.                                  The proposed security model uses
    public key cryptography and a proposed trusted key distribution mechanism to authenticate
    clients and servers. The authentication protocol can also exchange keying material
    for more efficiently protecting successive communication between client and server.
    \ The security model also addresses securing relay agents.\n\t "

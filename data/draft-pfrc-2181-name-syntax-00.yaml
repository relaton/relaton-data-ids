  content: "   RFC 2181 collected eight independent considerations and created a single\n
    \  docuement to address each of them in turn.  Over the following two decades\n
    \  it has become clear that each of these items should be considered and evovolve\n
    \  in its own right, as suggested in RFC 2181. This document extracts the exact\n
    \  text from RFC 2181 and places it into its own track.\n\n\t "

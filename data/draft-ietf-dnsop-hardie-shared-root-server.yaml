  content: "This memo describes a set of practices intended to enable an authoritative
    name server operator to provide access to a single named server in multiple locations.
    \ The primary motivation for the development and deployment of these practices
    is to increase the distribution of Domain Name System (DNS) servers to previously
    under- served areas of the network topology and to reduce the latency for DNS
    query responses in those areas.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

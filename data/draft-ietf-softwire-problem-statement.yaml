  content: "This document captures the problem statement for the Softwires Working
    Group, which is developing standards for the discovery, control, and encapsulation
    methods for connecting IPv4 networks across IPv6-only networks as well as IPv6
    networks across IPv4-only networks.  The standards will encourage multiple, inter-operable
    vendor implementations by identifying, and extending where necessary, existing
    standard protocols to resolve a selected set of \"IPv4/IPv6\" and \"IPv6/IPv4\"
    transition problems.  This document describes the specific problems (\"Hubs and
    Spokes\" and \"Mesh\") that will be solved by the standards developed by the Softwires
    Working Group.  Some requirements (and non-requirements) are also identified to
    better describe the specific problem scope.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "The purpose of this draft is to define a BGP-based auto-\n        discovery
    mechanism for layer-1 VPNs. The auto-discovery \n        mechanism for l1vpns
    allows the provider network devices to \n        dynamically discover the set
    of PEs having ports attached to \n        CEs member of the same VPN. That information
    is necessary for \n        completing the signaling phase. One main objective
    of l1vpn \n        auto-discovery mechanism is to support \"single-end \n        provisioning\"
    model, where addition of a new port to a given \n        l1vpn would involve configuration
    changes only on the PE that \n        has this port and on the CE that is connected
    to the PE via \n        this port.\n\t "

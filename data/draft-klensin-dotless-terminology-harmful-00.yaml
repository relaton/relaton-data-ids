  content: "   The history of the DNS has included a great deal of confusion about\n
    \  terminology that has, in turn, led to discussions in which different\n   parties
    have used the same words for different things.  For example,\n   \"host name\"
    has been used to describe both fully-qualified domain\n   names with particular
    properties and the first label component of\n   such names.  While established
    inconsistent uses may be impossible to\n   correct, it is in the interest of the
    community to avoid increasing\n   the confusion.  There have recently been a number
    of discussions\n   about \"dotless domains\" with at least four different definitions
    used\n   or implied in different contexts.  This document explains those uses\n
    \  and recommends avoiding the use of the term.\n\n\t "

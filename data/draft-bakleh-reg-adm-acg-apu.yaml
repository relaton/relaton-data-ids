  content: "This document provides guidelines for zone administrators(including \n
    \  but not limited to registry operators and registrars), and\n   information
    for all domain names holders, on the administration of\n   those domain names
    which contain characters drawn from Arabic\n   Characters Group of Languages.
    Other language groups are encouraged\n   to develop their own guidelines as needed,
    based on these guidelines\n   if that is helpful.\n\n   The document gives basic
    guidelines for IDN registrars (as it \n   is the case for IETF Document that talks
    about Japanese, Chinese \n   and Korean domain name registration \"RFC 3490\").
    The document \n   provides also information for owners of IDN that contains Arabic
    \n   characters on name reservation process. The document does not cover \n   Arabic
    gTLD or ccTLD problems.\n\n   Comments on this document can be sent to the authors
    at\n   arabic-idn-admin@aietf.org.\n\t "

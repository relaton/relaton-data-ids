  content: "   DNS cookies, as specified in RFC 7873, are a lightweight DNS\n   transaction
    security mechanism that provides limited protection to\n   DNS servers and clients
    against a variety of denial-of-service and\n   amplification, forgery, or cache
    poisoning attacks by off-path\n   attackers. This document specifies a means of
    producing interoperable\n   strong cookies so that an anycast server set including
    diverse\n   implementations will interoperate with standard clients. This\n   document
    updates RFC 7873.\n\n\n\t "

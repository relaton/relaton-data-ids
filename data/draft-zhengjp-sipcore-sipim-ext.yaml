  content: "   SIMPLE (SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions)\n
    \  is a protocol suite for instant messaging (IM) service, but it is\n   inefficient
    in processing session-mode instant message due to its\n   complex signaling processes
    and heavy header overheads, which makes\n   it difficult to meet the QoE (quality
    of experience) requirement,\n   especially in the usage scenario of mobile Internet
    and other traffic\n   sensitive networks.\n\n   This document describes an alternative
    Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP) extension for instant messaging service.
    The extension uses the\n   publish-subscribe mode to simplify signaling procedures
    and\n   introduces message user agent (MUA) to publish and receive message,\n
    \  and message broker (MB) as an intermediary to exchange messages\n   between
    MUAs. Message is tagged with a topic, and the lightweight\n   message format is
    more suitable for traffic sensitive networks.\n\n\n\n\t "

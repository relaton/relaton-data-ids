  content: "This document describes a profile for optimizing TCP to adapt so that
    it handles paths including second (2.5G) and third (3G) generation wireless networks.
    \ It describes the relevant characteristics of 2.5G and 3G networks, and specific
    features of example deployments of such networks.  It then recommends TCP algorithm
    choices for nodes known to be starting or ending on such paths, and it also discusses
    open issues.  The configuration options recommended in this document are commonly
    found in modern TCP stacks, and are widely available standards-track mechanisms
    that the community considers safe for use on the general Internet.  This document
    specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

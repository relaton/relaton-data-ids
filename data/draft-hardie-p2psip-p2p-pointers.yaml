  content: "Identifying overlay networks and the resources found within in them\npresents
    a number of bootstrapping problems.  While those hard\nproblems are under discussion,
    this draft proposes a small set of\nURI-based mechanisms which are intended to
    be generically useful for\nproviding pointers to peer-to-peer overlay networks
    in web pages,\nemail messages, and other textual media.\n\t "

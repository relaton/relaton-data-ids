  content: "   This document describes a TCP option intended to facilitate\n   transparent
    detection of middleboxes (or services playing that role)\n   along the path of
    a TCP connection as the connection is made. The\n   option has no effect if an
    appropriate middlebox is not on the path.\n\n\t "

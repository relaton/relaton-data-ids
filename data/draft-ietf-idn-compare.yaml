  content: "The IDN Working Group is working on proposals for internationalized\ndomain
    names that might become a standard in the IETF. Before a single\nfull proposal
    can be made, competing proposals must be compared on a\nwide range of requirements
    and desired features. This document compares\nthe many parts of a comprehensive
    protocol that have been proposed. It\nis the companion document to 'Requirements
    of Internationalized Domain\nNames' [IDN-REQ], which lays out the requirements
    for the\ninternationalized domain name protocol.\n\t "

  content: "When DNS validators have trusted keys, but have been offline for a\nlonger
    period, key rollover will fail and they are stuck with stale\ntrust anchors.  History
    service allows validators to query for older\nDNSKEY RRsets and pick up the rollover
    trail where they left off.\n\t "

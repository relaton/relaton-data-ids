  content: "One  can currently distinguish two kinds of globally unique, unicast IPv4
    addresses: provider independent (PI) and provider aggregatable (PA) addresses.
    These addresses are assigned to end-users by Internet Registries (IRs).                                                          There
    are also non globally unique e.g. private unicast addresses as described  in  RFC1597
    \ which  are suitable for many applications.\n\t "

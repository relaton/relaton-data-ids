  content: "               This document discusses the architecture and protocol implications
    of \n               making network initiation support easier with NetLMM. The
    framework \n               is restricted to inter-technology mobility within a
    single NETLMM \n               domain. It is proposed to add a new NetLMM message
    from the LMA to \n               the MAG, which function is to trigger, upon various
    events, the \n               location registration procedure. Further, it is indicated
    how to \n               complement NetLMM with 802.21 control mechanisms to achieve
    adequate \n               network initiation. \n\n\t "

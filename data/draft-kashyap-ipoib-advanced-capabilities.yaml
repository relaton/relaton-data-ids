  content: "InfiniBand Architecture(IBA) defines a high speed, channel\nbased interconnect
    between systems and devices. The InfiniBand\narchitecture provides multiple modes
    of transport services\nwith differing characteristics. IPoIB may be implemented
    over\nany or multiple such modes to take advantage of the underlying\nmode's features.
    IPoIB by default is implemented over the UD\nmode of IBA. This document describes
    IPoIB over IBA's non-UD\ntransport modes.\n\t "

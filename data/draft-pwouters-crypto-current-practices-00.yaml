  content: "   This document describes the current practices for handling new\n   cryptography
    within the IETF.  Some of these practices are informal\n   and depend on individuals
    in certain relevant roles, such as Working\n   Group Chairs, the Security Area
    Directors and the Independent Stream\n   Editor.  This document is intended to
    increase consistency and\n   transparency in how the IETF handles new cryptography,
    such as new\n   algorithms, ciphers and new primitives or combiners, by providing
    a\n   reference for the cryptographic practices within the IETF.  This\n   document
    does not describe any new policies and does not prohibit\n   exceptions in the
    described current practices.\n\n\t "

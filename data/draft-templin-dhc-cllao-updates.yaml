  content: "   RFC6939 specifies a method for DHCPv6 relay agents to insert a Client\n
    \  Link Layer Address Option (CLLAO) in a DHCPv6 Relay-Forward message\n   as
    informational material for the DHCPv6 server.  The server in turn\n   is not required
    to echo the CLLAO back in its replies.  In some\n   cases, however, the DHCPv6
    client may be interested to receive the\n   CLLAO, e.g., to determine if there
    are L2 devices (e.g., L2 proxies)\n   that rewrite the link-layer address.  This
    document discusses updates\n   to RFC6939 to allow the server to echo the CLLAO
    back to the client.\n\n\t "

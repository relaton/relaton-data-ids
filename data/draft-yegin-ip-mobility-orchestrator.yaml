  content: "   Host stacks can support mobility at multiple layers.  Mobility\n   protocols
    operating at different layers constitute alternate\n   solutions with various
    pros and cons, and they can also have adverse\n   affects on each other when used
    simultaneously.  Optimal results in\n   terms of seamless handover and data-path
    optimization can be achieved\n   when execution of these protocols are coordinated.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport networks that provide connectivity and bandwidth for customer
    services have typically been static, lacking flexibility, and requiring long planning
    times when deploying new services. Network Providers and Service Providers have
    embraced technologies that allow separation of data plane and control plane, distributed
    signaling for path setup and protection, and centralized path computation for
    service planning and traffic engineering. Although these technologies provide
    significant benefits, they do not meet the growing need for network programmability,
    automation, resource sharing, and service elasticity necessary to meet operators'
    requirements for virtual network operation. Virtual network operation refers to
    the creation of a virtualized environment allowing operators to view the abstraction
    of the underlying multi-administration, multi- vendor, multi-technology networks
    and to operate, control, and manage these multiple networks as if a single virtualized
    network. Another dimension of virtual network operation is the use of common core
    transport network resources by multi-tenant service networks as a way of providing
    a virtualized infrastructure to flexibly offer new services and applications.
    The work effort investigating this problem space is known as Abstraction and Control
    of Transport Networks (ACTN). This document provides an ACTN problem description,
    a scope of work, and outlines the core objectives and requirements to facilitate
    virtual network operation.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes enabling global service attributes in the\n
    \  Service Location Protocol (SLP). A global service attribute describes\n   a
    service property common to all service types. Its name begins with\n   the \"service-\"
    prefix. It is defined via an attribute template, and\n   can be imported into
    any service template. A single Service Request\n   (SrvRqst) message can use global
    service attributes to search\n   services across multiple service types. Global
    service attributes can\n   be associated with certain special characteristics
    so as to support\n   advanced discovery scenarios, such as URL changes, multi-access-point\n
    \  services, multi-function devices and replicated services.\n\t "

  content: "Under certain circumstances the desired effects of diversion can be \nachieved
    with no per-packet transport overhead. This draft describes \nthese circumstances
    as well as the per-packet bearer processing and \ngeneral signaling requirements
    of some proposals that strive to \nremove the need for this overhead. The first
    proposal is referred to \nas Zero-Overhead Diversion (ZOD). The second is referred
    to as More \nRobust Zero-Overhead Diversion (MR. ZOD). Mobile IP and load \ndistribution
    are examples of the useful application of diversion. \n\n\t "

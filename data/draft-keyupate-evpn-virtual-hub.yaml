  content: "   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming\n   pervasive
    for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data\n   center (DC) applications
    and as the next generation virtual private\n   LAN services in service provider
    (SP) applications.\n\n   The use of host IP default route and host unknown MAC
    route within a\n   DC is well understood in order to ensure that leaf nodes within
    a DC\n   only learn and store host MAC and IP addresses for that DC.  All\n   other
    host MAC and IP addresses from remote DCs are learned and\n   stored in DC GW
    nodes thus alleviating leaf nodes from learning host\n   MAC and IP addresses
    from the remote DCs.\n\n   This draft further optimizes the MAC and IP address
    learning at the\n   leaf nodes such that a leaf node within a DC only needs to
    learn and\n   store MAC and IP addresses associated with the sites directly\n
    \  connected to it.  A leaf node does not need to learn and store MAC\n   and
    IP addresses from any other leaf nodes thus reducing the number\n   of learned
    MACs and IP addresses per EVI substantially.\n\n   The modifications provided
    by this draft updates and extends RFC7024\n   for BGP EVPN Address Family.\n\n\t "

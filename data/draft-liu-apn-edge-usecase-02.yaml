  content: "   The ever-emerging new services are imposing more and more highly\n
    \  demanding requirements on the network.  However, the current\n   deployments
    could not fully accommodate those requirements due to\n   limited capabilities.
    \ For example, it is difficult to utilize the\n   traditional centralized deployment
    mode to meet the low-latency\n   demand of some latency-sensitive applications.
    \ Moreover, the total\n   amount of centralized service data is growing exponentially,
    which\n   brings great pressure on the network bandwidth.  There has been a\n
    \  clear trend that decentralized sites comprising of computing and\n   storage
    resources are deployed at various locations to provide\n   services.  In particular,
    when the sites are deployed at the network\n   edge, i.e. the Edge Computing,
    it can better handle the business\n   needs of the users nearby, which provides
    the possibilities to\n   provide differentiated network and computing services.
    \ In order to\n   achieve the full benefits of the edge computing, it actually
    implies\n   a precondition that the network should be aware of the applications'\n
    \  requirements in order to steer their traffic to the network paths\n   that
    can satisfy their requirements.  Application-aware networking\n   (APN) fits as
    the missing puzzle piece to bridge the applications and\n   the network to accommodate
    the edge services' needs, fully releasing\n   the benefits of the edge computing.\n\n
    \  This document describes the various application scenarios in edge\n   computing
    to which the APN can be beneficial, including augmented\n   reality, cloud gaming
    and remote control, which empowers the video\n   business, users interaction business
    and user-device interaction\n   business.  In those scenarios, APN can identify
    the specific\n   requirements of edge computing applications on the network, process\n
    \  close to the users, provide SLA guaranteed network services such as\n   low
    latency and high reliability.\n\n\n\t "

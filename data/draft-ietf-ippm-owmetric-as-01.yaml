  content: "Active traffic measurements are starting to become more widely used to\nascertain
    network performance characteristics.  All active measurement\nsystems have the
    capability to measure one-way delay and one-way loss\nmetrics, as defined in RFC2679
    [1] A One- way Delay Metric for IPPM and\nRFC 2680 [2] A One-way Packet Loss Metric
    for IPPM, respectively.  To\nensure that the resulting numbers have some meaning,
    we attempt to\ncharacterize how the measurements are taken and what would ensure
    that\nthe end numbers are indeed meaningful.  This document describes an\napplicability
    statement (formerly known as best current practices) for\nmeasuring the one-way
    delay and one-way loss metrics in operational\nnetworks.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Many traditional, centrally-managed blacklists and whitelists\n   describe
    Internet end-points by characteristics such as connectivity\n   type or network
    function, and these characteristics are often used to\n   infer behavior from
    which authorization is derived.  However, it is\n   often the case that connectivity
    type or network function are not\n   related to good or bad behavior.  This document
    describes a means of\n   creating blacklists and whitelists representative of
    Internet\n   end-points based on observed behavior by many participants in a\n
    \  distributed monitoring network.  The authors hope that distributed\n   lists
    will mitigate some of the problems associated with existing\n   centrally managed
    lists.  While the concept, architecture, and data\n   model are general enough
    to be applied to any type of network\n   service, the authors of this document
    are specifically addressing the\n   problem of spam in blogs.\n\t "

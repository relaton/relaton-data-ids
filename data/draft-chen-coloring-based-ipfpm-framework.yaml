  content: "   By setting one unused bit of the IP header of packets to \"color\"
    the\n   packets into different color blocks, it naturally gives a way to\n   measure
    the real packet loss and delay without inserting any extra\n   OAM packets.  This
    is called \"coloring\" based IP Flow Performance\n   Measurement (IPFPM).  This
    document specifies a framework and\n   protocol for this \"coloring\" based IPFPM.\n\n\n\t "

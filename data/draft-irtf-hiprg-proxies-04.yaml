  content: "   HIP proxies play an important role in the transition from the current\n
    \  Internet architecture to the HIP architecture.  A core objective of a\n   HIP
    proxy is to facilitate the communication between legacy (or Non-\n   HIP) hosts
    and HIP hosts while not modifying the host protocol\n   stacks.  In this document,
    the legacy hosts served by proxies are\n   referred to as Legacy Hosts (LHs).
    \ Currently, various design\n   solutions of HIP proxies have been proposed.  These
    solutions may be\n   applicable in different working circumstances.  In this document,\n
    \  these solutions are investigated in detail to compare their\n   effectiveness
    in different scenarios.\n\n\n\n\t "

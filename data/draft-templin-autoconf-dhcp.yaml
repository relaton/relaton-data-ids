  content: "Enterprise networks connect routers over various link types, and may also
    connect to provider networks and/or the global Internet.  Enterprise network nodes
    require a means to automatically provision IP addresses/prefixes and support internetworking
    operation in a wide variety of use cases including Small Office, Home Office (SOHO)
    networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), multi-organizational corporate networks
    and the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.  This document specifies
    a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for autoconfiguration and operation
    of nodes in enterprise networks.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies an extension to IP Flow Information \n\n  eXport
    (IPFIX) protocol specification in [RFC5101] and the IPFIX \n\n  information model
    specified in [RFC5102] to support hierarchical \n\n  structured data and lists
    (sequences) of Information Elements in \n\n  data records.  This extension allows
    definition of complex data \n\n  structures such as variable-length lists and
    specification of \n\n  hierarchical containment relationships between Templates.
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Conventions used in this document \n\n\n  The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL \n\n  NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD

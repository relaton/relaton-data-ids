  content: "   Server virtualization has been overwhelmingly accepted especially in\n
    \  cloud-based data centers. Accompanied with expansion of services and\n   technology
    advancements, the size of a data center has increased\n   significantly. There
    could be hundreds or thousands of physical servers\n   installed in a single large
    data center which implies that the number\n   of Virtual Machines (VMs) could
    be in the order of millions.\n   Effectively supporting millions of VMs with limited
    hardware resources,\n   becomes a real challenge to networking vendors. This document
    describes a\n   method to scale a switching system with limited hardware resources\n
    \  using IPv6 in large data center environments.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the Autokey security model for authenticating
    \nservers to clients using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and public \nkey cryptography.
    its design is based on the premiss that IPSEC \nschemes cannot be adopted intact,
    since that would preclude stateless \nservers and severely compromise timekeeping
    accuracy. In addition, \nPKI schemes presume authenticated time values are always
    available to \nenforce certificate lifetimes; however, cryptographically verified
    \ntimestamps require interaction between the timekeeping function and \nauthentication
    function in ways not yet considered by the IETF. \n                                   \n
    \  This Document includes the Autokey requirements analysis, design \n   principles
    and protocol specification. A detailed description of the\n protocol states, events
    and transition functions is included. A \n   prototype of the Autokey design based
    on this document has been \n   implemented, tested and documented in the NTP Version
    4 (NTPv4) \n   software distribution for Unix, Windows and VMS at \n   http://www.ntp.org.

  content: "Currently, there is an ongoing activity in the IETF to define a\nstandard,
    XML-based protocol to manage the configuration of networks\nand networking equipments.
    Defining initial requirements are underway\nand one important requirement among
    them is co-existence with the\nCLI. This document suggests a possible mechanism
    for this\nrequirement.  It identifies some characteristics of CLI commands, and\nprovides
    the syntax of XML template which models such characteristics\nof CLI commands.
    X-CLI is an API to manipulate XML templates in an\neasy and robust way.\n\n\t "

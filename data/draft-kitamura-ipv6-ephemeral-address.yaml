  content: "This document describes a new address type that is called\n   \"Ephemeral
    Addresses\". Ephemeral Addresses are designed to be used\n   as clients' source
    addresses of TCP / UDP sessions. An idea\n   Ephemeral Addresses is simple enough.
    They are achieved by deriving\n   existing \"ephemeral ports\" specifications.
    In other words, they are\n   achieved by naturally upgrading their concept from
    the port space\n   to the address space. Since Ephemeral Addresses functions are\n
    \  implemented only in the kernel side of the OS, we can use the\n   Ephemeral
    Addresses functions in current exiting enormous client\n   applications without
    modifying them. Ephemeral Addresses functions\n   can contribute to various types
    of security enhancements that\n   include privacy protections etc.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a TCP sender algorithm to trigger loss\n recovery
    based on the TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK)\n information gathered on a
    SACK scoreboard instead of simply counting\n the number of arriving duplicate
    acknowledgements (ACKs) in the\n traditional way.  The given algorithm is more
    robust to ACK losses,\n ACK reordering, missed duplicate acknowledgements due
    to delayed\n acknowledgements, and extra duplicate acknowledgements due to\n duplicated
    segments and out-of-window segments. The algorithm allows\n not only a timely
    initiation of TCP loss recovery but also reduces\n false fast retransmits.  It
    has a low implementation cost on top of\n the SACK scoreboard defined in RFC 3517.\n\t "

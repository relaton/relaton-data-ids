  content: "   Some critical applications may use a wireless infrastructure.\n   However,
    wireless networks exhibit a bandwidth of several orders of\n   magnitude lower
    than wired networks.  Besides, wireless transmissions\n   are lossy by nature;
    the probability that a packet cannot be decoded\n   correctly by the receiver
    may be quite high.  In these conditions,\n   guaranteeing the network infrastructure
    works properly is\n   particularly challenging, since we need to address some
    issues\n   specific to wireless networks.  This document lists the requirements\n
    \  of the Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) features\n   recommended
    to construct a predictable communication infrastructure\n   on top of a collection
    of wireless segments.  This document describes\n   the benefits, problems, and
    trade-offs for using OAM in wireless\n   networks to achieve Service Level Objectives
    (SLO).\n\n\t "

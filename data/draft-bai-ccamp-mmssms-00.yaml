abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for maintaining the survivability
    of streaming media services in the circumstances of the IP network (MSSMS). This
    service-oriented mechanism can calculate the health value(HV) of each service
    and judged their survivability in order to control the routing and the decision-
    making of each service.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives attackers
    the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by eavesdropping on network connections.
    This document specifies use of DNS Stateful Operations to enable a subscribe/publish
    mechanism for zone transfers reducing the over head introduced by NOTITY/SOA interactions
    prior to zone transfer request. This additionally prevents zone contents collection
    via passive monitoring of zone transfers by restricting XFR using DSO to require
    TLS.</p>"

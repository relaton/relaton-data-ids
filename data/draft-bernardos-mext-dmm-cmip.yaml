- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The use of centralized mobility management approaches -- such as\nMobile
    IPv6 -- poses some difficulties to operators of current and\nfuture networks,
    due to the expected large number of mobile users and\ntheir exigent demands.  All
    this has triggered the need for\ndistributed mobility management alternatives,
    that alleviate\noperators' concerns allowing for cheaper and more efficient network\ndeployments.\n\nThis
    draft describes a possible way of achieving a distributed\nmobility behavior with
    Client Mobile IP, based on Mobile IPv6 and the\nuse of Cryptographic Generated
    Addresses.\n\t "

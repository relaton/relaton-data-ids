  content: "This document presents a new alternative way of implementing discussion
    forums other than NNTP and mailing lists. It is largely based on standard e-mail
    except for retrieval. The purpose of this new protocol is to atenuate the bandwidth
    and net resources needed by either NNTP and mailing lists.                                                                     Based
    on implementation experience by me and Kovisoft, the remote moderator capabilities
    have been rewriten (in fact this was because I conceived a better way).\n\t "

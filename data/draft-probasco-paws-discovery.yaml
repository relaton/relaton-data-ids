  content: "   A white space master device needs to query a white space database and\n
    \  obtain information about available spectrum/channels prior to\n   operation.
    \ White space databases which contain information about\n   available spectrum/channels
    are associated with a regulatory domain\n   and hence specific to a country or
    region.  A white space master\n   device needs to discover the relevant white
    space database(s) given\n   its current location and the regulatory domain that
    it is operating\n   in.  The white space database discovery is the preliminary
    step that\n   a white space master device has to perform.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides a high level conceptual discussion on the\nsignificant
    modeling differences affecting the treatment of a POTS\n(Plain Old Telephone Service)
    call, a GETS (Government Emergency\nTelephone Service) call, and an MLPP (Multilevel
    Priority and\nPreemption) call in the traditional voice PSTN (Public Switched\nTelephone
    Network).\n\nThe genesis for this discussion on these services is primarily from\nexperience
    with the United States capabilities and it is appreciated\nthat these types of
    calls may be very different or non-existent in\nother regions of the world. Still,
    it may be useful to provide this\ndiscussion as a background, which may be useful
    in understanding the\nlegacy operations as the chartered ieprep work progresses.\n\nIt
    should be made clear from the onset that this document suggests no\nrequirements
    or solutions, but is merely informative about the\ntradition voice network treatments.\n\t "

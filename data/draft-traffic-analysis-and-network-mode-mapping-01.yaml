abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for network traffic classification
    and modality mapping based on large language models (LLMs), addressing the inefficiencies
    of traditional methods in dynamic network environments. The proposed approach
    automates multi- dimensional traffic feature extraction and intelligent decision-
    making to achieve precise alignment between traffic patterns and computing-storage-transmission
    requirements. The framework comprises two phases: pre-training (generating multi-modal
    traffic representations from pcap data) and mapping (dynamically formulating resource
    allocation strategies). It supports anomaly detection, QoS assurance, and multi-service
    collaboration, thereby significantly enhancing resource utilization efficiency
    and network service performance.</p>"

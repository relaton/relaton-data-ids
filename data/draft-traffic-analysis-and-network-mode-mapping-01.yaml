  content: "   This document presents a framework for network traffic classification\n
    \  and modality mapping based on large language models (LLMs),\n   addressing
    the inefficiencies of traditional methods in dynamic\n   network environments.
    \ The proposed approach automates multi-\n   dimensional traffic feature extraction
    and intelligent decision-\n   making to achieve precise alignment between traffic
    patterns and\n   computing-storage-transmission requirements.  The framework comprises\n
    \  two phases: pre-training (generating multi-modal traffic\n   representations
    from pcap data) and mapping (dynamically formulating\n   resource allocation strategies).
    \ It supports anomaly detection, QoS\n   assurance, and multi-service collaboration,
    thereby significantly\n   enhancing resource utilization efficiency and network
    service\n   performance.\n\n\t "

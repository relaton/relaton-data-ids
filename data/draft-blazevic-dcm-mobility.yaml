  content: "This document specifies a multicast routing protocol called\nDistributed
    Core Multicast (DCM). It is intended for use within a\nlarge single Internet domain
    network with a very large number of\nmulticast groups with a small number of receivers.
    Such a case\noccurs, for example, when multicast addresses are allocated to mobile\nhosts,
    as a mechanism to manage Internet host mobility. For such\nnetworks, existing
    dense or sparse mode multicast routing algorithms\ndo not scale well with the
    number of multicast groups. DCM is based\non an extension of the centre-based
    tree approach [1], [2]. It uses\nseveral core routers, called Distributed Core
    Routers (DCRs) and a\nspecial protocol between them. DCM aims: (1) to avoid multicast
    group\nstate information in backbone routers, (2) to avoid triangular\nrouting
    across expensive backbone links, (3) to scale well with the\nnumber of multicast
    groups. We analyse how DCM can be used to route\npackets to mobile hosts in cellular
    IP telephony, where each mobile\nhost is assigned a multicast address in every
    domain it visits. The\nbenefits of multicasting-based approach to route packets
    to mobile\nhosts are low latency and no disruption during handover.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo proposes to use COPS for the communication between a Label \nSwitching
    Router (LSR) and a Path Computation Server (PCS). Path \ncomputation is in much
    regard a complex function and might be out-\nsourced. For this reason a protocol
    between an LSR and a Path \nComputation Server is needed. This memo proposes to
    use COPS as a \nbase protocol for that task. \n\t "

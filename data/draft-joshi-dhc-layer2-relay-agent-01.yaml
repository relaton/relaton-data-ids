  content: "   In Layer 2 Access Networks, Access Concentrators are present between\n
    \  DHCP Clients and Relay Agent.  In this case, the Relay Agent can not\n   uniquely
    identify the end host and hence can not add unique 'Relay\n   Agent Information'
    option corresponding to the end hosts in DHCP\n   messages.  As the Access concentrators
    are closer to the end hosts,\n   they can uniquely identify the end hosts and
    add the Relay Agent\n   Information option in the DHCP message.  Access concentrators
    do not\n   set the 'giaddr' field.  Access Concentrators in this mode are\n   typically
    known as Layer 2 Relay agents.\n\n   This document provides insight to the behavior
    of the Access\n   Concentrators which act as DHCP Layer 2 Relay Agents in Access\n
    \  Networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the Naming Delegation Architecture that makes\n
    \  IPv6 Home Network globally reachable with Names or Fully Qualified\n   Domain
    Names (FQDN).  In this architecture, the Customer Premise\n   Equipment (CPE)
    acts as the DNS Authoritative Server of the Home\n   Network also called the Delegated
    DNS Server.  The Naming Delegation\n   is configured between the Delegated DNS
    Server and the Delegating DNS\n   Server managed by the ISP.\n\n   The use case
    considered in this document is an End User that\n   subscribes its ISP a specific
    Delegated Domain for its Home Network.\n   This document describes how the CPE
    automatically sets the Naming\n   Delegation between the Delegating and Delegated
    DNS Server.\n\n   The Naming Delegation is requested by the CPE.  The CPE DHCP
    Client\n   and the ISP DHCP Server exchange DHCP Options to properly set the\n
    \  Naming Delegation.  More specifically, the CPE DHCP Client (resp. the\n   ISP
    DHCP Server) configures the DNS(SEC) Zones of the Delegated DNS\n   Server (resp.
    Delegating DNS Server).  For the Delegating DNS Server,\n   the necessary pieces
    of information required to set the Naming\n   Delegation are the IP address of
    the Delegated DNS Server, and if\n   DNSSEC is used, the Delegation of Signing
    Information.  For the\n   Delegated DNS Server, the necessary information is the
    Delegated\n   Domain associated to the Home Network.\n\n\t "

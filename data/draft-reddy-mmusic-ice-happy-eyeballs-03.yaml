  content: "   This document describes an algorithm that makes Interactive\n   Connectivity
    Establishment (ICE) connectivity checks more responsive\n   by reducing delays
    in dual-stack host ICE connectivity checks when\n   there is a path failure for
    an address family preferred by the\n   application or by the operating system.
    \ As IPv6 is usually preferred\n   over IPv4, the procedures in this document
    helps avoid user-\n   noticeable delays when the IPv6 path is broken or excessively
    slow.\n\n\t "

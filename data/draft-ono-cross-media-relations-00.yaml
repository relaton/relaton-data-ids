  content: "   Some legitimate calls are from persons or organizations connecting\n
    \  the callee with weak social ties, such as a restaurant the callee   booked
    a table on-line.  These legitimate calls are often mistakenly\n   labeled as unsolicited
    calls at a filtering system which uses the\n   contact list of the callee.  To
    reduce these false positives during\n   SPIT filtering, we propose two approaches
    to label incoming calls\n   using cross-media relations from earlier communications.
    \ One\n   approach is that a potential caller offers the callee his contact\n
    \  address(es) which might be used in future calls.  Another is that a\n   callee
    provides a potential caller with weakly secret information.\n   In order to be
    identified as someone the callee contacted through\n   other means previously,
    the caller should convey the information in\n   future calls.\n\t "

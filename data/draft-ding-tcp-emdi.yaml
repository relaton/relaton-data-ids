  content: "   This document introduces an Enhanced Media Delivery Index (eMDI) that\n
    \  can be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for\n   monitoring
    a network intended to deliver streaming media over TCP\n   transport.  It aims
    to address the problems that RFC4445 has when\n   measuring in environments where
    TCP traffic is dominated as a\n   transport for streaming media.\n\n\t "

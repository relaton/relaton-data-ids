  content: "   The context distribution is important in a multi-agent system, which\n
    \  will impact the execution latency, token consumption, and task\n   completion
    success rate, especially in a complex and multi-round\n   workflow.\n\n   This
    document specifies the scenarios and procedures of agent context\n   distribution
    as well as the corresponding optimization during the\n   procedures in order to
    provide precise control of the context\n   distribution among the multiple agents.\n\n\t "

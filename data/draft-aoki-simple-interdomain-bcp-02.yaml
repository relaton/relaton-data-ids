  content: "This document describes best current practices that community\nadministrators
    should use when interconnecting two or more instant\nmessaging and presence communities
    using SIP/SIMPLE.  These best\npractices are intended to assist in the efficiency
    and scalability of\ninterconnections between large communities, and to ensure
    that\nsecurity and user privacy are maintained across the link between\ncommunities.
    \ The purpose of this document is to serve as the\nreference for the SIP/SIMPLE
    community towards inter-domain\ninteroperability and also to identify new requirements
    specific to\nthe inter-domain interface.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>In some IPv6 environments the need has arisen for hosts to be able
    to utilise a unique IPv6 prefix even though the link or media may be shared. Typically
    hosts (subscribers) on a shared network, like Wi- Fi or Ethernet, will acquire
    unique IPv6 addresses from a common IPv6 prefix that is allocated or assigned
    for use on a specific link. Benefits of a unique IPv6 prefix compared to a unique
    IPv6 address from the service provider are going from enhanced subscriber management
    to improved isolation between subscribers. In most deployments today IPv6 address
    assignment from a single IPv6 prefix on a shared network is done by either using
    IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) and/or stateful DHCPv6. While
    this is still viable and operates as designed there are some large scale environments
    where this concept introduces significant performance challenges and implications,
    specifically related to IPv6 router and neighbor discovery. This document outlines
    an approach utilising existing IPv6 protocols to allow hosts to be assigned a
    unique IPv6 prefix (instead of a unique IPv6 address from a shared IPv6 prefix).</p>"

  content: "   IGP normally computes the shortest paths in the network based on the\n
    \  IGP metric, without taking the link utilization into consideration.\n   In
    network scenarios where there is link degradation or failure which\n   causes
    link throughput reduction, or the volume of specific traffic\n   flows increase
    dramatically, congestion can happen if only the best\n   path is used for forwarding.
    \ This document describes IS-IS\n   extensions for the computation of alternate
    traffic engineering paths\n   which can be used for traffic load balancing when
    the shortest path\n   is becoming congested.\n\n\t "

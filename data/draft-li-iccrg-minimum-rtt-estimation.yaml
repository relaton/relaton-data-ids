  content: "   In traditional acknowledgment mechanisms, the sender frequently\n   \"pulls\"
    ACK packets, resulting in significant protocol control\n   overhead.  This leads
    to wasted CPU and I/O resources, contention for\n   packet spectrum on half-duplex
    links (e.g., WLAN), and reverse-path\n   congestion in asymmetric links (e.g.,
    satellite network).  Reducing\n   the number of ACKs is essential in scenarios
    where ACK overhead is\n   non-negligible.  However, a lower ACK frequency can
    introduce biases\n   in delay estimation, such as overestimating the minimum round-trip\n
    \  time (minRTT).  This document proposes how to calibrate the\n   estimation
    of the minRTT under low ACK frequency conditions.\n\n\t "

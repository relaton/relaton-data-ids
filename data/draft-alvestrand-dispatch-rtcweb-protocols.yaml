  content: "This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite\nintended
    for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in\nbrowsers - \"real
    time communication on the Web\".\n\nIt intends to serve as a starting and coordination
    point to make sure\nall the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable,
    and\nthat the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully\nspecified
    and on the right publication track.\n\nThis work is an attempt to synthesize the
    input of many people, but\nmakes no claims to fully represent the views of any
    of them.  All\nparts of the document should be regarded as open for discussion,
    with\nthe intended discussion forum being the \"RTCWEB\" WG (in formation).\n\nCurrently,
    discussion is on the rtc-web@alvestrand.no mailing list.\n\t "

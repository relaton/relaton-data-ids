  content: "   This document introduces a framework for capability modeling based
    on\n   the specification and refinement principles established in ITU-T\n   G.7711
    Annex G (also published as ONF TR-512.7 see latest release)\n   and the modeling
    boundaries work documented in draft-davis-netmod-\n   modelling-boundaries.  The
    framework defines how component–system\n   capabilities can be explicitly described
    and refined via a process of\n   pruning, refactoring, and occurrence formation.\n\n
    \  These capability definitions can target detailed operational\n   considerations,
    system interactions, licensing, abstract product\n   declarations, or sales and
    marketing.  The framework supports\n   modular, layered, and fractal declarations
    of networked behavior, and\n   provides a foundation for a suite of future IETF
    drafts aligned with\n   ongoing work on photonic plug manifests, entitlement/licensing,
    IVY\n   equipment modeling, energy/thermal considerations and related\n   domains.\n\n\t "

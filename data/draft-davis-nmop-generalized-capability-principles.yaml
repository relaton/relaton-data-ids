abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a framework for capability modeling based
    on the specification and refinement principles established in ITU-T G.7711 Annex
    G (also published as ONF TR-512.7 see latest release) and the modeling boundaries
    work documented in draft-davis-netmod- modelling-boundaries. The framework defines
    how componentâ€“system capabilities can be explicitly described and refined via
    a process of pruning, refactoring, and occurrence formation. These capability
    definitions can target detailed operational considerations, system interactions,
    licensing, abstract product declarations, or sales and marketing. The framework
    supports modular, layered, and fractal declarations of networked behavior, and
    provides a foundation for a suite of future IETF drafts aligned with ongoing work
    on photonic plug manifests, entitlement/licensing, IVY equipment modeling, energy/thermal
    considerations and related domains.</p>"

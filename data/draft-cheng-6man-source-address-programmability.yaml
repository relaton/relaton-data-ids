  content: "   IPv6-based tunneling technologies, such as SRv6, have been deployed\n
    \  by provider on transport networks to provide users with services\n   such as
    VPN and SD-WAN.\n\n   After the service traffic enters the provider's transport
    network,\n   it will be encapsulated by tunnel (SRv6 encapsulation). In order
    to\n   better meet the SLA requirements of users, some technologies need to\n
    \  carry relevant information along with the flow to guide the\n   processing
    of packets during forwarding.\n\n   This document discusses the programmability
    of IPv6 source addresses\n   to carry the necessary flow information\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a methodology for evaluating the ability of\n
    \  content-aware network devices to correctly detect and block malicious\n   or
    administratively disallowed traffic flows. This benchmark\n   addresses the issue
    of classification accuracy under well defined\n   conditions. It is not concerned
    with measuring forwarding performance\n   which is covered by other BMWG documents.\n\n\n\t "

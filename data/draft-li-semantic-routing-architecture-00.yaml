abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an Semantic Routing (SR) Architecture for
    enabling intelligent, semantic-driven communication among AI Agents. Unlike traditional
    IP-based routing or service mesh approaches, SRA leverages application-layer semantics
    — including service identity, intent vectors, and trust scores — to guide routing
    decisions dynamically. The architecture supports intent-driven task collaboration,
    trust-aware policy enforcement, and adaptive routing for multi-agent environments.
    SRA enables the network to evolve from a passive transport layer to an intelligent
    collaboration substrate supporting multi-agent coordination and cognitive networking.</p>"

  content: "   The Aggregate Route option provides a mechanism for a requestor to\n
    \  retrieve an aggregate route(s) from a DHCPv6 server using the\n   information-request
    message.  The aggregate route is a single route\n   representing multiple prefixes
    delegated by a DHCP server using\n   Prefix Delegation, and maybe advertised using
    routing protocols\n   instead of individual routes learnt from DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.\n
    \  This document specifies the data contained in aggregate route option\n   as
    well as the behavior of Requestor and DHCPv6 Server in requesting\n   and processing
    of this option.\n\n\t "

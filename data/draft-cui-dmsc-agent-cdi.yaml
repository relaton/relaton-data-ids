  content: "   This document defines a framework for enabling seamless cross-domain\n
    \  interoperability among AI agents operating across different networks,\n   administrative
    domains, and heterogeneous platforms.  The framework\n   addresses the challenges
    of identity federation, trust establishment,\n   policy harmonization, and secure
    communication that arise when AI\n   agents from distinct administrative realms
    need to collaborate on\n   shared tasks.  It specifies mechanisms for agent discovery,\n
    \  capability negotiation, trust delegation, and federated policy\n   enforcement,
    enabling scalable and secure multi-domain AI\n   collaboration without requiring
    centralized control.\n\n\t "

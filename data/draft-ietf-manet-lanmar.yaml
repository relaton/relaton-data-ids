  content: "The Landmark Routing Protocol (LANMAR) utilizes the concept of \nlandmark
    for scalable routing in large, mobile ad hoc networks.  \nIt relies on the notion
    of group mobility: i.e., a logical group \n(for example a team of coworkers at
    a convention) moves in a \ncoordinated fashion.  The existence of such logical
    group can be \nefficiently reflected in the addressing scheme.  It assumes that
    \nan IP like address is used consisting of a group ID (or subnet ID)\nand a host
    ID, i.e. <Group ID, Host ID>.  A landmark is dynamically\nelected in each group.
    \ The route to a landmark is propagated \nthroughout the network using a Distance
    Vector mechanism.  \nSeparately, each node in the network uses a scoped routing
    \nalgorithm (e.g., FSR) to learn about routes within a given (max \nnumber of
    hops) scope.  To route a packet to a destination outside\nits scope, a node will
    direct the packet to the landmark \ncorresponding to the group ID of such destination.
    \ Once the packet\napproaches the landmark, it will typically be routed directly
    to \nthe destination.  A solution to nodes outside of the scope of their \nlandmark
    (i.e., drifters) is also addressed in the draft.  Thus, \nby summarizing in the
    corresponding landmarks the routing \ninformation of remote groups of nodes  and
    by using the truncated \nlocal routing table, LANMAR dramatically reduces routing
    table size\nand routing update overhead in large networks.  The dynamic \nelection
    of landmarks enables LANMAR to cope with mobile \nenvironments.  LANMAR is well
    suited to provide an efficient and \nscalable routing solution in large, mobile,
    ad hoc environments in\nwhich group behavior applies and high mobility renders
    traditional \nrouting schemes inefficient.\n\t "

  content: "   Multicast was not originally supported with SR, as indicated in\n   [RFC8402]:
    Segment Routing is defined for unicast.\n\n   However, with the wide development
    and deployment of SR and SRv6\n   technology, there have been proposals to develop
    SR-based multicast\n   solutions, showing the interests to develop multicast solutions
    that\n   facilitate incremental deployment based on SR and SRv6.\n\n   This document
    examines two typical SRv6 multicast approaches and\n   considers a number of different
    aspects to provide a framework for\n   understanding.  The purpose is to help
    the working group and IETF\n   community to understand and thus evaluate these
    possible impacts.\n\n\n\t "

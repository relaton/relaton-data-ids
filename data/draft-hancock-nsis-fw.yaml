  content: "The NSIS working group is considering protocol developments in \nsignaling
    for resources for a traffic flow along its path in the \nnetwork. The requirements
    for such signaling are being developed in a \nseparate document [2]; This Internet
    Draft proposes a framework for \nsuch signaling. This initial version provides
    a model for describing \nthe entities that take part in the signaling and the
    ways in which \nthey can be used in different modes of operation. It also discusses
    \nthe overall structure of such a signaling protocol. Finally, it \nconsiders
    the possible interactions of NSIS signaling with other \nprotocols and functions,
    including security issues. \n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP [RFC3261]) provides a mechanism\n
    \  for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more\n   participants.
    \ This document describes a vulnerability of SIP\n   combined with HTTP Digest
    Access Authentication [RFC2617] through\n   which an attacker can leverage the
    victim's credentials to send\n   authenticated requests on his behalf.  This attack
    is different from\n   the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and does not require
    any\n   eavesdropping, DNS or IP spoofing.\n\t "

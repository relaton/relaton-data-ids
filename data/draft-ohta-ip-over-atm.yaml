  content: "The possibility to construct a conventional model to transfer IP over
    ATM is studied.                                                                The
    model contains concepts of subnet, bridges, routers, broadcast and so on, all
    of which are familiar with the model of IP over Ethernet.          Still, the
    model allows QoS assured seamless internetwork level (not link level) ATM connection
    which can be directly supported by existing ATM hardware. That is, new communication
    model with resource reservation such as RSVP or STII can be supported efficiently.\n\t "

  content: "   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) plays a crucial role
    in\n   securing inter-domain routing.  However, the current RPKI Repository\n
    \  system suffers from fundamental limitations in reliability,\n   scalability,
    and consistency.  In particular, single-point failures\n   at repository publication
    points (PPs), the growing number of\n   bidirectional connections between PPs
    and relying parties (RPs), and\n   the lack of a globally consistent historical
    RPKI data view pose\n   significant risks to the resilience, integrity, and authority
    of the\n   global RPKI ecosystem.\n\n   This document proposes the Decentralized
    RPKI Repository (dRR), a\n   novel repository architecture that decouples RPKI
    object signing\n   authority from RPKI object management authority (e.g., storage
    and\n   distribution). dRR introduces a distributed group of certificate\n   servers
    (CSs) and a layer of Monitors to achieve robust, scalable,\n   and auditable RPKI
    data management.  The architecture maintains full\n   compatibility with the existing
    RPKI trust model rooted in the five\n   RIR trust anchors, enabling incremental
    deployment without disrupting\n   current relying parties (RPs) validation semantics.
    \ By doing so, dRR\n   addresses longstanding repository challenges and enhances
    the overall\n   efficiency and trustworthiness of RPKI-based routing security.\n\n\t "

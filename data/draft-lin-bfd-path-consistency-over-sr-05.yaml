  content: "   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor\n   paths
    between nodes.\n\n   U-BFD defined in [I-D.ietf-bfd-unaffiliated-echo] can effectively\n
    \  reduce the device equipment.\n\n   Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified
    mechanism which is\n   suitable for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically
    and on a\n   large scale network.\n\n   In SR network, BFD can also be used to
    monitor SR paths. When a\n   headend use BFD to monitor the segment list/CPath
    of SR Policy, the\n   forward path of control packet is indicated by segment list,
    the\n   reverse path of response control packet is via the shortest path\n   from
    the reflector back to the initiator (headend) as determined by\n   routing. The
    forward path and reverse path of control packet are\n   likely inconsistent going
    through different intermediate nodes or\n   links.\n\n   This document describes
    a method to keep the forward path and\n   reverse path consistent when using S-BFD
    or U-BFD to detect SR\n   Policy\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Mobile IPv6 binding management has been designed for break-before-\n
    \  make handoffs, which can be performed by hosts equipped with a single \n   interface.
    However, a Mobile Node may be equipped with multiple \n   interfaces, allowing
    it to perform Make-Before-Break handoffs by \n   connecting simultaneously to
    two overlapping access networks during \n   the handoff. In theory these handoffs
    can be lossless, provided that \n   there is sufficient overlap between the two
    networks. However, unless \n   Mobile IPv6 bindings are managed carefully Mobile
    Node and \n   Correspondent Node will have inconsistent binding state during the
    \n   handoff, which will lead to packet loss. In this draft we propose \n   changes
    to binding management for lossless make-before-break \n   handoffs. The proposed
    changes do not affect the interoperability \n   with Mobile IPv6 nodes not implementing
    these changes. \n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an extension to the application scenarios of\n
    \  Route Target Constraints (RTC).  By using the Global Administrator\n   field
    of the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community to identify a\n   network node
    and exchanging BGP Route-Target routes, a BGP speaker\n   can generate an egress
    policy for filtering routing updates\n   associated with specific network nodes,which
    could implement precise\n   control and distribution of services such as BGP Flow
    Specification\n   and BGP Segment Routing Policies.\n\n\n\t "

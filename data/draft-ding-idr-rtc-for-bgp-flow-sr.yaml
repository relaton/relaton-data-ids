abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the application scenarios of
    Route Target Constraints (RTC). By using the Global Administrator field of the
    IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community to identify a network node and exchanging
    BGP Route-Target routes, a BGP speaker can generate an egress policy for filtering
    routing updates associated with specific network nodes,which could implement precise
    control and distribution of services such as BGP Flow Specification and BGP Segment
    Routing Policies.</p>"

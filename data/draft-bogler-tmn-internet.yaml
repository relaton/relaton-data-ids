  content: "The complexity of telecommunication networks, i.e. enterprise and carrier
    networks, has grown over the last two decades. Management of carrier networks
    and enterprise networks has followed different paradigms up to now:                                                                       -
    In carrier networks the Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) as created
    by ITU-T in the early 1980s is still being propagated.             - In enterprise
    networks the SNMP based approach is widely accepted.       The borders between
    public (carrier) and private (enterprise) networks are becoming increasingly transparent,
    a distinction between both types of networks may soon be irrelevant from a network
    management point of view.\n\t "

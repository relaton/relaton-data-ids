  content: "   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths to\n
    \  a regular TCP session and is being deployed extensively.  Source\n   Address
    Validation (SAV) technologies are proposed to prevent network\n   nodes from spoofing
    others' IP addresses and thus improve the\n   accountability of networks.  This
    document proposes a trusted MPTCP\n   extension based on SAV, which enables MPTCP
    to work with SAV and thus\n   improve the accountability of MPTCP connections.
    \ This extension\n   doesn't intend to replace the security solutions to resolving
    IP\n   forged attacks, like Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC),\n   but
    to improve the accountability of them and the whole connection.\n\n\t "

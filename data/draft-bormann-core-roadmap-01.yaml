  content: "   The CoRE set of protocols, in particular the CoAP protocol, is\n   defined
    in draft-ietf-core-coap in conjunction with a number of\n   specifications that
    are currently nearing completion.  There are also\n   several dozen more individual
    Internet-Drafts in various states of\n   development, with various levels of WG
    review and interest.\n\n   Today, this is simply a bewildering array of documents.
    \ Beyond the\n   main four documents, it is hard to find relevant information
    and\n   assess the status of proposals.  At the level of Internet-Drafts, the\n
    \  IETF has only adoption as a WG document to assign status - too crude\n   an
    instrument to assess the level of development and standing for\n   anyone who
    does not follow the daily proceedings of the WG.\n\n   With a more long-term perspective,
    as additional drafts mature and\n   existing specifications enter various levels
    of spec maintenance, the\n   entirety of these specifications may become harder
    to understand,\n   pose specific implementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.\n\n
    \  The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents as\n   well
    as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in\n   combination.
    \ In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even\n   corrections to the
    specifications referenced.\n\n   This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress,
    i.e. a long-\n   lived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information
    becomes\n   available and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed.\n   Similar
    to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815, it might be\n   published as an RFC
    at some future time later in the acceptance curve\n   of the specifications.\n\n
    \  This document does not describe a new protocol or attempt to set a\n   new
    standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice in using\n   the existing
    specifications, but it may also document emerging\n   consensus where a correction
    needs to be made.\n\n   The current version -00 of this document is an early draft
    that is\n   intended to spark the further collection of relevant information.\n\n\t "

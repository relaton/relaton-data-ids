  content: "For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly\n   deployed
    IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been\n   proposed.  One such
    mechanism is configured tunnels.  This document\n   provides a tunnel discovery
    mechanism by which the DHCPv6 servers can\n   provide information about the available
    configured tunnel end points\n   to reach the IPv6 nodes which are separated by
    IPv4 networks.\n\t "

  content: "When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP),
    the originating device, the access network provider to which the device is connected,
    and all service providers in the path of the call have information about the call,
    the caller, or the location, which is helpful for the PSAP to have in handling
    the emergency. This document describes data structures and mechanisms to convey
    such data to the PSAP. The intent is that every emergency call carry as much of
    the information described here as possible using the mechanisms described here.\n\n
    The mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an external resource)
    or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a location object). This follows
    the tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data can
    be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in the body of the SIP message)
    or by reference.\n\t "

  content: "   During discussions of a document to provide a standard representation\n
    \  and encoding of Domain-Sequence within the Path Computation Element\n   (PCE)
    communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path\n   Computation
    Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs.  It was\n   determined that there
    was a need for clarification with respect to\n   the ordered nature of the Include
    Route Object (IRO).\n\n   Since there was a proposal to have a new IRO type with
    ordering, as\n   well as handling of Loose bit, it felt necessary to conduct a
    survey\n   of the existing and planned implementations.\n\n   This document summarizes
    the survey questions and captures the\n   results.  Some conclusions are also
    presented.\n\n   This survey was informal and conducted via email.  Responses
    were\n   collected and anonymized by the PCE working group chairs.\n\n\t "

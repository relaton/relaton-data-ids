  content: "TIST is an application of the RSVP protocol to the problem of com-\nmunicating
    application requests, such as pinhole openings and NAT\ntable entries, to NATs
    and firewalls.  By using RSVP we avoid the\nproblem of having to locate these
    devices in the network and estab-\nlish trusted relationships with each one we
    would like to influ-\nence.\n\n\t "

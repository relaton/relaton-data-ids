  content: "This document specifies the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for the class
    of multicast routing protocols in the PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) family
    that use the concept of a Rendezvous Point as a means for receivers to discover
    the sources that send to a particular multicast group.  BSR is one way that a
    multicast router can learn the set of group-to-RP mappings required in order to
    function.  The mechanism is dynamic, largely self-configuring, and robust to router
    failure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes an RFC 3933 [RFC3933] experiment for the IETF\nRFC
    publication process.  The experiment is limited in scope and\nduration.  The specific
    experiment has been chosen because (a) it has\npotential to provide a significant
    process improvement, (b) it can be\nexecuted at a low cost, (c) it addresses a
    widely recognized problem\nin the IETF process, and (d) tool support can be (and
    has been) built\nfor it.  The experiment relates to the copyediting and other
    manual\ntasks in the publication process.  Specifically, the amount of work\nthese
    manual tasks require differs widely between drafts, and for a\ncertain subset
    of drafts there are either very minor editorial\nchanges or no changes needed
    at all, if we discount the different\nformatting requirements between RFCs and
    drafts.  The experiment\ninvolves identification of this subset of drafts and
    processing them\nseparately with a \"fast path\" process that uses almost entirely\nautomated
    processes.  For the drafts that belong to this subset, it\nis expected that the
    RFC Editor queuing time is reduced from months\nor years to weeks or less.\n\n\t "

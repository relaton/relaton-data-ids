abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Enabling interconnection of ATM Label Switching Routers (ATM-LSRs) over
    standard ATM switch networks is desirable in order to introduce MPLS technology
    into emerging ATM-LAN/WAN platform.  This draft describes how ATM-LSRs may interoperate
    with other ATM-LSRs over ATM UNI SVC services.  The two aspects of the problem
    that we address are ATM address (of target ATM-LSR) resolution and SVC to label
    binding.\n\t "

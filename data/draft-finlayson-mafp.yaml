  content: "The Internet has recently seen the emergence of applications that involve\nthe
    ongoing transmission, or ''pushing'', of structured data from a server to\none
    or more client nodes.  Most current applications send this data using\nunicast
    communications - usually over TCP connections.  However, similar\napplications
    can also be implemented using multicast-based protocols.\nMulticast not only improves
    the scalability of this particular class of\napplication, but also makes possible
    an additional class of application in\nwhich the participants can act as peers
    - sending data as well as receiving.\n \nThis Internet Draft describes the ''Multicast
    Attribute Framing Protocol''\n(MAFP) - a generic, attribute-based data representation,
    intended for a\nwide variety of multicast-based applications.  It is currently
    being used\nto implement the ''multikit'' generic multicast session browser\n(http://www.lvn.com/multikit).
    \ This draft describes an early version of\nMAFP that is likely to undergo changes
    in the future.  However, it is\nbeing described now, in the hope that it will
    promote open discussion of\nthis and similar protocols - ideally leading to the
    adoption of an open,\ninteroperable standard for this class of application.\n\n\t "

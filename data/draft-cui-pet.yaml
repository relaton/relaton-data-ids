  content: "IPv6 offers significant advantages over IPv4, however it will take \n
    long time to replace IPv4 with IPv6. Therefore, these two protocols are \n expected
    to coexist during the transition period. Currently, there are \n many transition
    devices deployed to solve transition problems. Most of \n them only use one technology
    (either translation or tunneling). However,\n any transition technology has limitation
    and application scope. In \n transition scenarios, besides IP version of source,
    middle and destination\n network, the network characteristic (a regular edge network
    or a backbone) \n has key impact on system performance of transition methods.
    Therefore, we \n need to decide which transition method should be used in some
    typical \n transition scenarios and how the transition and tunneling devices \n
    collaborate for solving transition problems. This draft introduces a smart\n toolbox
    named PET (shortfor Prefixing, encapsulation and translation) which\n includes
    all fundamental elements needed in all transition scenarios, such\n as the control
    and data plane operations of tunneling and translation.\n Based on PET, we propose
    a network side transition solution. In this framework, \n there deploys only one
    kind of transition device, i.e. PET. Through the\n collaboration of PETs, the
    transition problems can be solved. In this draft, \n we give the advantages and
    disadvantages of all transition methods PET may adopt\n according to IP version
    of source, middle and destination network, and the \n network characteristic.

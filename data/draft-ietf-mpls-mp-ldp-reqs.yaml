  content: "This document lists a set of functional requirements that served as input
    to the design of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions for setting up point-to-multipoint
    (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSP), in order to deliver point-to-multipoint applications
    over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructure.\n\n This work was
    overtaken by the protocol solution developed by the MPLS working group, but that
    solution did not closely follow the requirements documented here. This document
    is published as a historic record of the ideas and requirements that shaped the
    protocol work. This document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.\n\t "

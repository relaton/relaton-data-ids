  script: Latn
  content: "   Segment routing uses globally-known labels to accomplish forwarding\n
    \  along shortest paths, and label stacks to accomplish explicit routing\n   along
    arbitrary paths.  These labels are advertised using an IGP.\n   This draft describes
    how label bindings corresponding to RSVP, LDP,\n   BGP labeled-unicast, and static
    LSPs are advertised in segment\n   routing and how these labels can be combined
    with other segment\n   routing labels to create forwarding paths.  This draft
    also describes\n   how context labels for egress node protection are advertised
    in using\n   segment routing IGP extensions.\n\n\t "

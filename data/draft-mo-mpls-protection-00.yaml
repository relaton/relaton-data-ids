  content: "Protection issues for MPLS LSP have been discussed in recent IETF meetings.\nVarious
    drafts have different proposals on establishing the working\nand protection LSP
    ([1]-[5]). But how to reserve bandwidth for the\nprotection LSP has not be discussed.
    If the bandwidth for the\nprotection LSP is reserved in a similar fashion as that
    of the working\nLSP, the bandwidth utilization in the network would be very poor.\nIn
    this draft, an algorithm for reserve bandwidth for protection LSP\nis presented
    which enables very efficient bandwidth reservation for\nsingle fault protection.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema for\n
    \  Reverse DNS Management in a tightly controlled Representational State\n   Transfer
    (REST) environment.  This document describes a schema that\n   has been developed
    and deployed by ICANN in a \"RESTful\" based system\n   for the the last two years
    (at the time of writing) and is being used\n   by the registries responsible for
    reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations\n   underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA through
    an X.509 certificate\n   mediated HTTPS transaction.\n\n\t "

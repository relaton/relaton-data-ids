abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the work on MPLS Network Actions (MNA) a debate arose concerning
    how existing MPLS implementations handle Special Purpose Labels (SPLs) especially
    in the context of processing the MPLS Entropy Label. The question applies to the
    relative placement of the Entropy Label Indicator (ELI) and the MNA Base SPL in
    the MPLS label stack. This question is applicable to the use of the ELI and any
    new base SPL (bSPL), or to the relative placement of any two bSPLs including the
    Extension Label that precedes any extended SPL. In order to discover what deployed
    implementations currently do, it is proposed that the MPLS working group chairs
    poll participants to answer specific questions about their implementations. This
    document is a working draft of the questions to be asked. It is not intended that
    this document should progress to publication as an RFC.</p>"

  content: "It is possible in Web clients to interrupt the connection before the data
    transfer has finished.  As a result the client may have partial documents or images
    loaded into its memory.  It would be useful to be able to request the server to
    return the missing portion of the document only, instead of retransferring the
    entire file, if the page is re-entered later.\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success\n
    \  in information technology of the last half century.  As the Internet\n   becomes
    pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for\n   many domain-specific
    solutions.  However, domains with specific\n   requirements as well as communication
    behaviors and semantics still\n   exist and represent what [RFC8799] recognizes
    as \"limited domains\".\n\n   This document describes well-recognized scenarios
    that showcase\n   possibly different addressing requirements, which are challenging
    to\n   be accommodated in the IP addressing model.  These scenarios\n   highlight
    issues related to the Internet addressing model and call\n   for starting a discussion
    on a way to re-think/evolve the addressing\n   model so to better accommodate
    different domain-specific\n   requirements.\n\n   The limitations identified in
    this document are complemented and\n   deepened by a detailed analysis in a separate
    companion document\n   [I-D.iannone-internet-addressing-considerations].\n\n\t "

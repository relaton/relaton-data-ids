  content: "Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies must\n    share
    a common format and transport mechanism.  The Incident Object\n    Description
    Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for\n    document exchange.
    \ This draft outlines the SOAP wrapper for all\n    IODEF documents and extensions
    to facilitate an interoperable and\n    secure communication of documents.  The
    SOAP wrapper allows for\n    flexibility in the selection of a transport protocol.
    \ The\n    transport protocols will be provided through existing standards and\n
    \   SOAP binding, such as SOAP over HTTP(S) and SOAP over BEEP.\n\t "

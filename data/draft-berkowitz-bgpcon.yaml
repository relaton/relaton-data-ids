  content: "This is an update of an individual contribution that has been\naccepted
    as a work item by the Benchmarking Methodology Working\nGroup, and will split
    into two BMWG documents. It is being posted\nfor information.  T This document
    defines a specific set of tests that\nrouter implementers can use to measure and
    report the convergence\nperformance of BGP-4 processes.  It doe not consider the
    forwarding\nperformance of such routers once they have converged, or the convergence\ncharacteristics
    of the global routing system.\n\n\t "

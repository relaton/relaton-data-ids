  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,
    it defines objects for use by the MEGACO/H.248 Ringing Packages operating on Media
    Gateways. These objects can be used to manage the network containing Media Gateway(s).
    \nThis is the initial version of this draft. This draft defines a MIB that \ncontains
    the elements for defining ringing patterns [21].  Rules have been defined below
    which MUST be adhered to ensure a properly defined set of ringing patterns. \n\t "

  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data\n
    \  format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n   code
    size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need for version
    negotiation.\n\n   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR
    tags.\n   An existing CBOR tag, 103, allows for the representation of\n   geographic
    coordinates.  Proper exploitation of geographic\n   coordinates requires an associated
    reference frame.  The present\n   document defines a CBOR tag for referencing
    the coordinate reference\n   system (CRS) for a geographic coordinate.  It is
    intended as the\n   reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tag
    defined.\n\n\t "

    such as the addresses of DNS servers that does not\nrequire the maintenance of
    any dynamic state for individual clients.\nA host that uses stateless DHCP must
    have obtained its IPv6 addresses\nthrough some other mechanism, typically stateless
    address\nautoconfiguration.  This document is a guide to the protocol messages\nand
    options that must be implemented to provide stateless DHCPv6\nservice.\n\t "

  content: "   AI Agent can do some tasks as an assistant to human beings.  During\n
    \  the task process, the Agent may need to connect to other Agents with\n   different
    skills relative to the task.  The Agent to Agent\n   communication is a new kind
    of traffic for Internet, and some new\n   requirements for networking are proposed.
    \ This document talks about\n   the requirements and key issues of global AI agent
    communication\n   towards 6G.  Some 6G related use cases from 3GPP documents are\n
    \  introduced.  After that, the related requirements for the AI Agent\n   Communication
    Network (ACN) are proposed, and potential ACN\n   frameworks and standardization
    works for the AI Agent Communication\n   are also discussed.\n\n\n\t "

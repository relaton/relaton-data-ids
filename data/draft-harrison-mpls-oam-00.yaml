  content: "This Internet draft provides requirements and mechanisms for OAM \n(Operation
    and Maintenance) for the user-plane in MPLS networks. A \nconnectivity verification
    'CV' OAM packet is defined, which is \ntransmitted periodically from LSP source
    to LSP sink. The CV flow \ncould be used to detect defects related to misrouting
    of LSPs as \nwell as link and nodal failure, and if required to trigger \nprotection
    switching to the protection path.\n\t "

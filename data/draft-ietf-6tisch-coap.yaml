- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The [IEEE802154e] standardizes the TSCH mode of operation and defines\n
    \  the mechanisms for layer 2 communication between conforming devices.\n   6top
    defines a set of commands to monitor and manage the TSCH\n   schedule.  To realize
    the full functionality of sensor networks and\n   allow their adoption and use
    in real applications we need additional\n   mechanisms.  Specifically, the interaction
    with 6top, control and\n   modify schedules, monitor parameters etc must be defined.
    \ Higher\n   layers monitoring and management entities are then able to use these\n
    \  capabilities to create feedback loops.  Although, there have been\n   many
    custom implementations of such feedback loops between the\n   routing, transport
    and MAC layers in sensor network deployments,\n   there has been a lack of standards
    based approaches.  This draft\n   defines the messaging between monitoring and
    management entities and\n   the 6top layer and a mapping to the 6top commands.
    \ The document also\n   presents a particular implementation of the generic data
    model\n   specified in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-interface] based on CoAP and CBOR.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Firewall and Service Tickets is a generic and extensible protocol\n
    \  mechanism for hosts to send explicit signals to on-path elements to\n   request
    network services on a per packet basis.  This is a type of\n   \"host to networks
    signaling\", and the data of the signal is a\n   \"ticket\" that accompanies a
    packet.  A ticket indicates the requested\n   services or a grant of admission
    into a network; tickets are\n   processed by network nodes to instantiate the
    requested services.\n   Tickets are scoped to be relevant to their \"origin domain\"
    which is\n   the network or limited domain in which they are issued.  Outside
    of\n   their origin domain tickets are not processed and are forwarded as\n   opaque
    data.  To prevent forgery and to obscure the services being\n   requested, tickets
    are authenticated, encrypted, or otherwise\n   obfuscated such that they can only
    be read by network nodes in their\n   origin domain.  Tickets are sent in IPv6
    Hop-by-Hop options.\n\n\t "

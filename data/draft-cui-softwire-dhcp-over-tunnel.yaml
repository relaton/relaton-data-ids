  content: "   This document analyzes the scenario in which DHCPv4 interaction is\n
    \  performed over IP-IP tunnel, and proposes methods to keep DHCP\n   working
    under such situation.  The main issue is encapsulation of\n   DHCP packets on
    server side, and there are both in-protocol and out-\n   of-protocol solutions
    for this issue.  The in-protocol solution is to\n   have DHCP carrying the encapsulation
    address information, and the\n   out-of-protocol solution is to have the DHCP
    server keeping track of\n   the address mapping by inspecting DHCP packets.\n\n\t "

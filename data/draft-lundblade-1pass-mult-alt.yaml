  content: "Most MIME syntax and semantics can usually be processed in a single pass\nthrough
    the data.  For example, the MIME boundary parameter always\nappears before it
    is used.\n \nThis is not the case with multipart/alternative MIME entities.  The\nprocessor
    of the data cannot know the MIME types of the altnernatives\npresent until all
    alternatives have been processed.  Thus, it is not\npossible for a one pass processor
    to consider more than the first and\nmost limited representation, because a subsequent
    part may be something\nthat cannot be handled.\n\n\t "

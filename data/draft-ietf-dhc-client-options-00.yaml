  content: "During the summer of 1999, a grand debate raged over the correct\ninterpretation
    of several DHCP client options as described in [RFC\n2132], as well as the need
    for one option whose proposing\nInternet-Draft expired.\nAs a result of that debate,
    the authors gained some insights into\nthe intended (or unintended!) interpretation
    of certain options\ndefined in [RFC 2132,] particularly the Vendor Class Identifier\n(option
    60) and Vendor Encapsulated Options (option 43.)\nThese insights are presented
    in this informational Internet-Draft,\nwhose reason for being is to act as an
    aid to implementers of the\nDHC protocol, and to future editors of the underlying
    RFCs and\nselected, current Internet-Drafts.  This memo is not being\nproposed
    as a standards-track document, but rather as an aid to\nclarify existing and future
    RFCs.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an Extended Key Usage (EKU) value which\n   indicates
    that the certificate holder is authorized to sign security\n   tokens to assert
    claims, or attributes, about a subject.\n\n   When a certificate that asserts
    the claimSigning EKU signs a claim,\n   the owner of the service holding that
    certificate is asserting that a\n   statement about the subject is true. For example,
    a IdP secure token\n   service (STS) would use an X.509 certificate containing
    the\n   claimSigning EKU to sign SAML assertions containing an identifier and\n
    \  attributes about a user. This EKU value would allow for a separation\n   between
    the designation that a given Identity belongs within a given\n   Federation, and
    the empowerment of that entity within the federation\n   to sign claims..  This
    approach allows for greater flexibility for\n   the operators of Federated systems
    and for Certification Authorities\n   and avoids the overloading of other, already
    established methods\n   (such as Assurance Level designation via certificatePolicy
    OID).\n\n\n\t "

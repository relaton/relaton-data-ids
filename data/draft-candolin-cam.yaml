  content: "Most protocols and applications are designed for connections that are\nfairly
    static. When a node changes its point of attachment to the\nInternet frequently,
    it must be able to rapidly adapt to the new\nenvironment. Traditionally, each
    application and protocol tries to do\nthis independently of each other. In some
    cases, applications have\nbeen tailored to communicate with one other protocol
    layer to notice\nsuch changes. The main problem with this approach is that adding
    new\nprotocols and applications to the node cannot be made in a generic\nway.
    In order to obtain at least some level of context awareness,\nprotocols and applications
    must be specifically tailored to\nintercommunicate. This also adds complexity
    to application and protocol\ndesign, since protocols and applications perform
    a wide range of tasks\nfor which they have not originally been designed. To overcome
    these\nproblems, we add a new Context Aware Management (CAM) layer to the\nInternet
    Protocol stack. The purpose of CAM is to optimize the\nfunctionality of the node
    by monitoring the environment for changes\nand by adapting the behavior of the
    node accordingly. The protocols\nand applications thus perform the tasks for which
    they have been\ndesigned in the first place, and CAM makes the decisions regarding\nwhich
    protocols to use and with what parameters.\n\n\t "

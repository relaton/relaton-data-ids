  content: "This document describes a method for a DNS client resolver to\ndiscover
    the IP addresses of the upstream recursive DNS resolvers and\nhence bypass the
    local DNS proxy.  It also directs IANA to reserve\nthe \"LOCAL.ARPA\" domain name
    and to create a registry for well known\nsub-domains of that domain name, such
    sub-domains being reserved for\nuse within any network's administrative boundary.\n\t "

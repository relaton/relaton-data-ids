  content: "This document is an addendum to Version 1 of RSVP (Resource\n   ReSerVation
    Protocol) as defined in the proposed standard [RFC2205].\n   The flow label, one
    of the new header fields of the IPv6 protocol,\n   allows improvements to resource
    reservation protocols on IPv6 capable\n   networks.  Utilization of the flow label
    simplifies packet\n   classification and optimizes packet processing in routers
    along the\n   transport path.\n \n   The main objectives of this document are
    to specify the proper usage\n   of the IPv6 flow label and to promote its support
    within RSVP.  This\n   memo defines extensions required to the Version 1 specification
    and\n   additional processing rules needed to ensure correct operation.\n   Rather
    than simply presenting the specification with no\n   justification, we have tried
    to present the benefits of adopting the\n   flow label within RSVP for IPv6.  This
    addendum does not have any\n   effect on the implementation or usage of RSVP for
    IPv4.\n\t "

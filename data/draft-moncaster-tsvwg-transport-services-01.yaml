  content: "   The IETF has defined a wide range of transport protocols over the\n
    \  past three decades.  However, the majority of these have failed to\n   find
    traction within the Internet.  This has left developers with\n   little choice
    but to use TCP and UDP for most applications.  In many\n   cases the developer
    isn't interested in which transport protocol they\n   should use.  Rather they
    are interested in the set of services that\n   the protocol provides to their
    application.  TCP provides a very rich\n   set of transport services, but offers
    no flexibility over which\n   services can be used.  By contrast, UDP provides
    a minimal set of\n   services.\n\n   As a consequence many developers have begun
    to write application-\n   level transport protocols that operate on top of UDP
    and offer them\n   some of the flexibility they are looking for.  We believe that
    this\n   highlights a real problem: applications would like to be able to\n   specify
    the services they receive from the transport protocol, but\n   currently transport
    protocols are not defined in this fashion.  There\n   is an additional problem
    relating to how to ensure new protocols are\n   able to be adopted within the
    Internet, but that is beyond the scope\n   of this problem statement.\n\n\t "

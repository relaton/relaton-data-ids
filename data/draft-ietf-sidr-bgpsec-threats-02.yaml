  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a threat model for BGP path security\n   (BGPSEC).
    \ It assumes the context established by the SIDR WG charter,\n   as of April 19,
    2011.  The charter established two goals for the SIDR\n   work:\n\n   o  Enabling
    an AS to verify the authorization of an origin AS to\n      originate a specified
    set of prefixes\n\n   o  Enabling an AS to verify that the AS-PATH represented
    in a route\n      matches the path travelled by the NLRI for the route\n\n   The
    charter further mandates that SIDR build upon the Resource Public\n   Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI), the first product of the WG.  Consistent\n   with the charter, this threat
    model includes an analysis of the RPKI,\n   and focuses on the ability of an AS
    to verify the authenticity of the\n   AS path info received in a BGP update.\n\n
    \  The model assumes that BGP path security is achieved through the\n   application
    of digital signatures to AS_Path Info.  The document\n   characterizes classes
    of potential adversaries that are considered to\n   be threats, and examines classes
    of attacks that might be launched\n   against BGPSEC.  It concludes with brief
    discussion of residual\n   vulnerabilities.\n\n\t "

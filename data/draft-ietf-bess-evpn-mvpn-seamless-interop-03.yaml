  content: "   Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming\n   pervasive
    for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data\n   center (DC) networks
    and as the next generation VPN services in\n   service provider (SP) networks.\n\n
    \  As service providers transform their networks in their Central\n   Offices
    (COs) towards the next generation data center with Software\n   Defined Networking
    (SDN) based fabric and Network Function\n   Virtualization (NFV), they want to
    be able to maintain their offered\n   services including Multicast VPN (MVPN)
    service between their\n   existing network and their new Service Provider Data
    Center (SPDC)\n   network seamlessly without the use of gateway devices.  They
    want to\n   have such seamless interoperability between their new SPDCs and their\n
    \  existing networks for a) reducing cost, b) having optimum forwarding,\n   and
    c) reducing provisioning.  This document describes a unified\n   solution based
    on RFCs 6513 & 6514 for seamless interoperability of\n   Multicast VPN between
    EVPN and MVPN PEs.  Furthermore, it describes\n   how the proposed solution can
    be used as a routed multicast solution\n   in data centers with only EVPN PEs.\n\n\t "

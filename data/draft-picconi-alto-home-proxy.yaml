  content: "   This documents discusses the use of ALTO proxies running on home\n
    \  devices such as gateways or home NAS servers. An ALTO home proxy\n   caches
    ALTO information obtained from an origin ALTO server, and uses\n   that information
    to serve queries originating from the home network.\n   ALTO home proxies reduce
    ALTO traffic and query latency, improve\n   scalability, and enhance user privacy.\n\n\n\t "

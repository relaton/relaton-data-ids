  content: "This document is one of two reports on the Integrated ISIS protocol. The
    other report documents operational experience with the protocol. These two reports
    are required by the IAB/IESG in order for an Internet routing protocol to advance
    to Draft Standard Status. Integrated ISIS is an Interior Gateway Protocol and
    is designed to carry both IP and ISO CLNP routing information.                                                       Integrated
    ISIS is currently designated as a Proposed Standard. The protocol was first published
    in RFC 1195. Internet Draft [2] was published subsequently to RFC 1195 and documents
    the current version of the protocol.                                                              This
    report summarizes the key features of Integrated ISIS. It also attempts to analyze
    how the protocol will perform and scale in the Internet.                                                                  Please

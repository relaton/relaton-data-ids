abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping
    and Traceroute mechanisms are commonly used to detect and isolate data plane failures
    in all MPLS LSPs including Pseudowire (PW) LSPs. The PW LSP Ping and Traceroute
    elements, however, are not specified for IPv6 address usage. This document extends
    the PW LSP Ping and Traceroute mechanisms so they can be used with IPv6 PWs, and
    updates RFC 4379.</p>"

  content: "This document describes an ABNF extension for code generation. ABNF\nhas
    been widely used for decades. While its popurarity is ascribed to\nits simplicity
    and ease of use,  the demand for code generation\nhas been fulfilled only marginally,
    by some sort of non-standard\nextensions, or by conversion to yet another meta
    language. One\npossible solution is to add more detailed specifications to the\nexisting
    ABNF standard, but this hurts the very competitiveness of\nABNF itself.  Another
    solution is to standardize an extension and\nmake it a 'sister' standard in parallel
    to the existing ABNF\nstandaard.  In this document we propose such an extension
    as a\nstandard. The generated code using the proposed extension would be\n\"complete\",
    meaning no need to modify by hand, if there exist no\nconcepts of unordered groups
    in the specification.\n\t "

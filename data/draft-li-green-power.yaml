  content: "   Network sustainability is a key issue facing the industry.  Networks\n
    \  consume significant amounts of power at a time when the cost of power\n   is
    rising and sensitivity about sustainability is very high.  As an\n   industry,
    we need to find ways to optimize the power efficiency of\n   our networks both
    at a micro and macro level.  We have observed that\n   traffic levels fluctuate
    and when traffic ebbs there is much more\n   capacity than is needed.  Powering
    off portions of network elements\n   could save a significant amount of power,
    but to scale and be\n   practical, this must be automated.\n\n   The natural mechanism
    for enabling automation would be a Yet Another\n   Next Generation (YANG) interface,
    so this document proposes a YANG\n   model for power management.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Internet is increasingly being used for commercial and industrial
    purposes which, apart from causing an explosion in traffic, will require that
    the future network provides a highly efficient 'on-demand' service.  The provision
    of an efficient on-demand service will require Internet 'sessions' to use virtual-message-paths
    that must be opened and closed in a manner similar to the establishment of calls
    in a telephone network; enabling the network to refuse traffic which exceeds the
    available capacity and ensuring that established sessions will not be violated.
    \ It is felt that the RSVP mechanism will not fully meet these requirements for
    the commercial services described below, and this paper describes an alternative.\n\t "

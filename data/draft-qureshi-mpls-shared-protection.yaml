  content: "This document discusses the shared mesh protection concept. Its aim\nis
    to provide fast, guaranteed recovery of service at significantly\nless cost of
    protection capacity compared to other schemes. In\ncompanion documents [1,2],
    extensions to RSVP-TE and OSPF-TE\nprotocols are proposed that enable shared mesh
    protection. Those\nextensions, together with this document, first address global
    repair\nwith path-based protection switching, as opposed to local repair of\nLSP
    failures and reroute. However, the concept can be extended\nstraightforwardly
    to the local repair techniques being considered in\nthe MPLS working group.\n\t "

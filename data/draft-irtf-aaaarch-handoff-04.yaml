  content: "In order to decrease handoff latency, the concept of pre-emptive\nprovisioning
    is under investigation.  This document describes an\nexperimental extension that
    enables an accounting server to notify a NAS of a prospective handoff.  This enables
    the NAS to reserve resources and obtain the session parameters prior to arrival
    of the client, potentially reducing handoff times.  The extension described in
    this document may potentially be useful in enabling handoffs across access technologies
    and providers. However, whether the approach described in this document is effective,
    deployable or secure is the subject of current research.  It is offered for RADIUS
    primarily because source code for RADIUS client and server implementations is
    readily available for research purposes.  Given that this extension represents
    research work in progress, implementation of this specification for purposes other
    than research is not recommended.\n\t "

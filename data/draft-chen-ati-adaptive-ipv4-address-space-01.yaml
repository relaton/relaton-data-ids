  content: "   This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion\n
    \  issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of\n   the
    original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy IPv4),
    discusses the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system architecture
    enhancement aspects. It was originated\n   by a study called ExIP (Extended IPv4)
    analyzing the use of the first\n   available octet (eight bits) in the reserved
    private network pools\n   (10/8, 172.16/12 and 192.168/16) to achieve a moderate
    address space\n   expansion factor of 256 by each, while maintaining their familiar\n
    \  operation characteristics. Along the way, a parallel yet similar\n   effort,
    called EnIP (Enhanced IPv4), was discovered. EnIP fully\n   utilizes the same
    private network pools to increase the address space\n   by a factor of 17.1M with
    end-to-end connectivity. EzIP is a superset\n   that proposes one unified format
    for not only encompassing the\n   considerations of both, but also identifying
    additional capabilities\n   and flexibilities. For example, the EzIP may expand
    an IPv4 address\n   at least by a factor of 256 to as high as 256M without affecting
    the\n   existing IPv4 public address assignments, and even keeping the\n   current
    private networks intact for the 256M case. The EzIP is in\n   full conformance
    with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not only both\n   categories of connectivity,
    but also their interoperability. The\n   traditional Internet traffic and the
    IoT (Internet of Things)\n   operations may coexist simultaneously without perturbing
    their\n   existing setups, while offering end-users the freedom to choose one\n
    \  or the other. If the IPv4 public pool were reorganized, the\n   assignable
    pool could be multiplied by 512M or even up to 2B times\n   with end-to-end connectivity.
    The EzIP may be implemented as a\n   software / firmware enhancement to the Internet
    edge routers or\n   private network gateways wherever needed, or simply installed
    as an\n   inline adjunct hardware module between the two, enabling a seamless\n
    \  introduction. The 256M case establishes a spherical layer of routers\n   providing
    a complete interconnection between the Internet and end-\n   users. This configuration
    enables the entire current IPv4 based\n   Internet and private networks characteristics
    to remain intact. Under\n   the Dual-Stack environment, these proposed interim
    facilities would\n   relieve the IPv4 address shortage issue, while afford IPv6
    more time\n   to orderly reach the maturity and the availability levels required\n
    \  for delivering a long-term general service.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The specification for how a client discovers its network's NAT64\n
    \  prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this\n   purpose,
    but declares it to be a non-special name in that\n   specification's Domain Name
    Reservation Considerations section.\n\n   Consequently, despite the well articulated
    special purpose of the\n   name, (at the time of writing) 'ipv4only.arpa' still
    does not appear\n   as one of the names with special properties recorded in the
    Special-\n   Use Domain Names registry.\n\n   As a result of this omission, in
    cases where software needs to give\n   this name special treatment in order for
    it to work correctly, there\n   is no clear mandate authorizing software authors
    to implement that\n   special treatment.  Software implementers are left with
    the choice\n   between not implementing the special behavior necessary for the
    name\n   queries to work correctly, or implementing the special behavior and\n
    \  being accused of being noncompliant with some RFC.\n\n   This document formally
    declares the actual special properties of the\n   name, and adds similar declarations
    for the corresponding reverse\n   mapping names.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   There are discussions on how loss-based congestion controls consider\n
    \  lost packets that have been recovered by a coding mechanism.  This\n   document
    analyses to what extent transport protocols could ignore\n   such signals and
    proposes best current practices on the interaction\n   between congestion control
    and coding mechanism at the transport\n   layer.  Coding for tunnels is out-of-the
    scope of the document.\n   Examples of interest for the proposed solution is to
    better deal with\n   tail losses or with networks with non-congestion losses.\n\n\t "

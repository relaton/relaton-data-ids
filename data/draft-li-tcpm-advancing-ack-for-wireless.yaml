  content: "   Acknowledgement (ACK) is a basic function and implemented in most of\n
    \  the ordered and reliable transport protocols [RFC0793].  Legacy TCP\n   ACK
    is designed with high frequency to guarantee correct interaction\n   between sender
    and receiver.  However, the shared nature of the\n   wireless medium over wireless
    local area network (WLAN) induces\n   contention between data transport and backward
    signaling, such as\n   acknowledgement.  The current way of TCP acknowledgment
    induces\n   control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance\n
    \  especially for WLAN scenarios.\n\n   This document conducts the ACK frequency
    breakdown, analyzes several\n   ways of reducing ACK frequency, and discusses
    the compatibility\n   issues with existing systems in detail.\n\n\t "

  content: "Network service providers are increasingly moving from providing\njust
    Internet connectivity to offering intermediary-based services\nand performance
    optimizations to enhance end user experience at\nreduced costs.  These services
    and optimizations are being, or\nwill be, offered with the help of intermediate
    nodes placed in the\nservice provider network between communicating end-points.
    \ In\nthis document, we list several intermediary-based transport\nservices and
    performance optimization mechanisms that are being\n(or could be) provided by
    the intermediate nodes, and identify the\nrequirements of any solution that securely
    offers these services\nand mechanisms.\n\t "

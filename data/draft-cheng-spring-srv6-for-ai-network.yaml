  content: "   AI applications require fast processing and responses. Traffic using\n
    \  RoCEv2 has low entropy for ECMP. At the same time, AI elephant flows\n   are
    predictable. Traffic engineering technology for AI backend\n   networks becomes
    a possible solution. SRv6 TE can start from the\n   host side, making SRv6 source
    routing and traffic path control from\n   the host side an optional solution.\n\n
    \  This document presents a AI network Traffic Engineering (TE)\n   application
    scenario for handling link faults and traffic congestion\n   issues in data centers,
    based on Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6)\n   and Compressed Segment Identifier
    (CSID). The application scenario\n   uses SRv6 CSID Network Programming to directly
    install all\n   forwarding paths on the head-end device. When a data center\n
    \  experiences a link fault or traffic congestion, the head-end device\n   switches
    the forwarding path to another optimal path for avoiding\n   the location of link
    fault or traffic congestion, ensuring optimal\n   AI data flow forwarding.\n\n\t "

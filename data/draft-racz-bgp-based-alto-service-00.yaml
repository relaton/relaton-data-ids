  content: "Overlay applications, like Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing and video\nstreaming,
    attract a lot of users and generate a huge amount of data.\nMost overlay applications
    do not take into account the underlying\nnetwork topology in their routing decisions
    and connection\nestablishment in general. Due to this fact and the large amount
    of\nP2P traffic, overlay applications waste network resources, cause\nproblems
    in network management, and result in high costs for ISPs,\nespecially because
    of the expensive interconnection links between\nISPs. Therefore, the objective
    of the ALTO Working Group Charter\n[ALTO-charter] is to design and specify an
    Application-Layer Traffic\nOptimization (ALTO) service that will assist P2P applications
    in\ntheir peer selection process in order to achieve a more efficient\nusage of
    network resources, to reduce operational costs of ISPs, and\nto increase the overlay
    application performance at the same time.\n\nThis draft proposes a possible ALTO
    service that uses BGP routing\ninformation in order to calculate a rating value
    for peers providing\na certain resource (resource providers). The service is operated
    by\nthe ISP. Since BGP routing information is available in any ISP\nnetwork and
    the service accesses the routing information from the\nlocal ISP network, the
    deployment of the service does not require\nchanges in the network and the ALTO
    server can retrieve routing\ninformation automatically.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Typically an NAV (network-based anti-virus) system stores the \n   entire
    HTTP response from the server, scan the response for \n   malware and then transmits
    it to the client. This extension \n   attempts to better response time for Web
    traffic by letting the\n   NAV (network-based anti-virus) system save the time
    required for\n   the NAV system for transmission of data from the NAV system to
    \n   the client. In addition, this extension also helps in reporting \n   download
    progress and avoiding client connection timeout.\n\n\t "

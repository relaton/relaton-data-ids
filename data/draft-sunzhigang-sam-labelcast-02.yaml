  content: "   This document presents a lightweight transport protocol-Labelcast,\n
    \  especially for long-lived connection video streams.  This protocol\n   provides
    a procedure for application programs to send media data to\n   other programs.
    \ Like the UDP protocol, the Labelcast does not\n   provide delivery and duplicate
    protection.  However, it provides\n   efficient support for the monitoring of
    video transmission quality.\n   And, fast forwarding mechanism based on label
    is also supported by\n   the protocol.  Labelcast can coexist and integrate with
    existing\n   mechanisms, such as IP multicast and RTP/RTCP, while offering more\n
    \  flexible deployment options and scaling to support a greater number\n   of
    simultaneous multicast groups.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "In Internet telephony, end systems can take a large role in providing\nservices,
    especially in networks without pre-configured\ninfra-structure, such as peer-to-peer
    networks.  Since we believe\nthat end system services differ in their requirements
    from network\nservices, we define a new service creation scripting language called\nthe
    Language for End System Services (LESS).  LESS inherits man\ncharacteristics from
    the Call Processing Language (CPL).  It contains\ncommands and events for direct
    user interaction and the control of\nmedia applications.  This document defines
    the basic elements of LESS\nand several commonly used LESS extensions.\n\t "

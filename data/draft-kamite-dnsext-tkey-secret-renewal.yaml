  content: "TKEY [RFC2930] provides methods of setting up shared secret keys for\nTSIG
    [RFC2845] other than manual exchange. But TKEY itself cannot\ncontrol timing of
    key renewal very well though it can add or delete\nshared keys.  Since continuing
    to sign messages with old keys\npermanently is not safe, hosts which make use
    of TSIG should pay\nattention to the time limit of secret usage.\n\n\t "

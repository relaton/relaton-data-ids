  content: "   This document presents the problem statement and use cases for a sub-\n
    \  path transport layer. A sub-path is a portion of a network path that\n   has
    localized characteristics that are of interest to an operator to\n   manage. The
    \ structure for managing a sub-path is the \"sub-path\n   transport layer\". A
    sub-path transport layer can provide transport\n   layer mechanisms, such as reliability
    and congestion control, over\n   the aggregate of packets traversing the sub-path.
    Additionally, a\n   sub-path transport layer can provide performance measurements
    of\n   traffic over a sub-path which in turn can be input to operations and\n
    \  management. The sub-path transport layer implies the possibility that\n   traffic
    may be subject to two transport layer control loops, that of\n   the sub-path
    and that of a higher layer transport protocol, any such\n   solution must consider
    the ramifications of that.\n\n\t "

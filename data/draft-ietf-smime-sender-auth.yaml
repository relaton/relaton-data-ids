  content: Sender Authentication and the Surreptitious Forwarding Attack in CMS and

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "By default, a CMS signed-and-encrypted document or message authenticates\nonly
    the document's originator, and not the person who encrypted the\ndocument.  This
    subtle limitation exposes CMS and S/MIME signed-and-encrypted data to 'surreptitious
    forwarding.'  Secure-messaging standards have treated surreptitious forwarding
    as an insoluble problem of user carelessness, and have long accepted the risk
    of this attack.  This document discusses easy cryptographic remedies for this
    attack, suitable for incorporation into the CMS and S/MIME specifications.  This
    document is an abridgement of [U2001].\n\t "

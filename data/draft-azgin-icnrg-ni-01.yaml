- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The objective of this proposal is to introduce the notion of network\n
    \  identifier (NI) in the ICN architecture.  This is in addition to the\n   existing
    names (i.e., content identifiers, CIs, or application\n   identifiers, AIs, in
    general) that are currently used for both naming\n   and routing/forwarding purposes.
    \ Network identifiers are needed\n   considering the requirements on future networking
    architectures such\n   as: (i) to support persistent names (or persistently named
    objects)\n   and large-scale and high-speed mobility of any network entity (i.e,\n
    \  devices, services, and content), (ii) to accommodate different types\n   of
    Internet of Things (IoT) services, many of which require low-\n   latency performance,
    and enabling edge computing to support service\n   virtualization, which will
    require support for large scale migration\n   and replication of named resources,
    and (iii) to scale the ICN\n   architecture to future Internet scale considering
    the exponentially\n   increasing named entities.  These considerations also require\n
    \  enabling a network based name resolution service for efficient and\n   scalable
    routing.\n\n   In the current draft, we begin by highlighting the issues associated\n
    \  with ICN networking when utilizing only the AIs, which include\n   persistently
    named content, services, and devices.  Next we discuss\n   the function NI serves,
    and provide a discussion on the two current\n   NI-based proposals, along with
    their scope and functionalities.  This\n   is with the objective of having a single
    NI construct for ICN that is\n   flexible enough to adapt to different networking
    contexts.\n\n\n\t "

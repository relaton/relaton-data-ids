  content: "   The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in Internet traffic,\n   particularly
    during the introduction of the initial quarantine and\n   work-from-home arrangements.\n\n
    \  The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss\n   Network
    Impacts of the pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020.  The\n   workshop was held to
    convene interested researchers, network\n   operators, and network management
    experts, and Internet technologists\n   to share their experiences.  The meeting
    was held online given the\n   on-going travel and contact restrictions at that
    time.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In dense topologies (such as data center fabrics based on the Clos\n
    \  and butterfly though not limited to those; in fact any topology with\n   relatively
    high degree of connectivity qualifies here) IGP flooding\n   mechanisms designed
    originally for rather sparse topologies can\n   \"overflood\", or in other words
    generate too many identical copies of\n   same information arriving at a given
    node from other devices.  This\n   normally results in slower convergence times
    and higher resource\n   utilization to process and discard the superfluous copies.\n
    \  Distributed algorithms that restrict the amount of flooding performed\n   can
    be constructed, as long as they result in a flooding subgraph\n   connecting all
    nodes on the network in terms of flooding still.  Such\n   algorithms can reduce
    resource utilization significantly, while\n   improving convergence performance.
    \ We denote such algorithm as\n   \"distributed flooding prunners\" (or \"prunner\"
    for short) while\n   requiring them to follow some simple, additional rules.  The
    rules\n   presented in detail later allow to deploy mix of nodes any prunning\n
    \  algorithm and multiple prunners at the same time if necessary while\n   ensuring
    correct flood coverage for the whole network.  Additionally,\n   node by node
    migration, without flag day, from one algorithm to\n   another if necessary is
    possible.  And assuming the algorithms are\n   behaving correctly, the blast radius
    on algorithm change is normally\n   contained to a single node performing the
    switch and obviously the\n   convergence of an algorithm on introduction or removal
    of node\n   running such algorithm.\n\n   One such algorithm (modification of
    previous art), deployable even\n   without configuration, is described in this
    document.  Beside\n   reducing the extraneous copies, the proposed solution does
    \"load-\n   balance\" flooding across different possible paths in the network
    to\n   prevent build up of flooding hot-spots.\n\n\t "

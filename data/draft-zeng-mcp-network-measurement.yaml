abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a framework for intelligent network\n   measurement
    using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  By treating\n   network devices as MCP
    servers and network controllers as MCP\n   clients, this framework enables natural
    language-driven, AI-assisted\n   network measurement operations.  The framework
    leverages MCP's\n   standardized communication protocol to provide real-time network\n
    \  performance monitoring, intelligent fault diagnosis, topology\n   discovery,
    and automated measurement workflows.  This document\n   describes the architecture,
    use cases, and security considerations\n   for implementing MCP-based network
    measurement systems.\n\n\t "

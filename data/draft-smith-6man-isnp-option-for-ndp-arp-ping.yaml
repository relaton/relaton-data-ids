abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and IPv4 Address Resolution\n
    \  Protocol (ARP) can be used to perform \"ping\" tests that overcome\n   nodes'
    refusal to respond to IPv6 and IPv4 ICMP Echo Requests.  A\n   drawback is that
    NDP and ARP do not carry an Identification, Sequence\n   Number and Payload for
    these ping tests.  This memo proposes an IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery Option that
    adds these fields to the NDP and ARP\n   packets used to perform ping tests.\n\n\t "

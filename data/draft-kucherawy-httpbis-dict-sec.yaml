  content: "   Data compression algorithms benefit from blocks of tuning data called\n
    \  \"dictionaries\".  These can greatly improve data compression speed\n   and/or
    ratios, but their use and application has numerous potential\n   security issues
    of concern to the communities using them.  This\n   document enumerates security
    issues known about compression\n   dictionaries at the time of publication so
    that future proposals for\n   use of dictionaries can benefit from this collected
    material.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Long-term archiving storage fundamentally begins with archive data\n
    \  Accumulation, then Geo-duplication and then Management.  Using\n   A->G->M,
    LTASP has been created to solve mid-range and below, long-\n   term archiving
    requirements of the small-medium enterprise.  Where\n   tape has been deployed
    in the past, LTASP now offers an alternative\n   solution designed to be more
    robust and manageable in the long term\n   than network attached storage devices
    or simple disk storage alone.\n\n\t "

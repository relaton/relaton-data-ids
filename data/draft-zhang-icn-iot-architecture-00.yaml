  content: "   Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to\n
    \  Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different\n   domains,
    the current trend is to develop a unified de-fragmented IoT\n   platform so that
    objects can be made accessible to applications\n   across organizations and domains.
    \ Towards this goal, quite a few\n   proposals have been made to build a unified
    IoT platform as an\n   overlay on top of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions,
    however,\n   are inadequate to address the important challenges posed by a unified\n
    \  IoT system, especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and\n   communication
    reliability, due to the inherent inefficiencies of the\n   current Internet.  To
    address this problem, we propose to build a\n   unified IoT platform based on
    the Information Centric Network (ICN)\n   architecture, which we call ICN-IoT
    [20].  ICN-IoT leverages the\n   salient features of ICN, and thus provides seamless
    device-to-device\n   (D2D) communication, mobility support, scalability, and efficient\n
    \  content and service delivery leveraging in-network computing, caching\n   and
    storage.\n\n   This draft begins by motivating the need for an unified ICN-IoT\n
    \  platform to connect heterogenous IoT systems.  We then propose an\n   ICN-IoT
    system architecture and middleware components which includes\n   device/network-service
    discovery, naming service, IoT service\n   discovery, contextual processing, pub/sub
    management to support\n   efficient naming, data discovery, data processing and
    data\n   distribution.\n\n\t "

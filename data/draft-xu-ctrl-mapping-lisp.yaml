  content: "   EID-to-RLOC (Endpoint Identifier to Routing Locators) mapping system\n
    \  is one of the cornerstones for LISP (Location/Identifier Separation\n   Protocol)
    networks.  This document suggests that one control unit\n   could be included
    into mapping infrastructure to provide additional\n   functions such as traffic
    engineering.\n\n\t "

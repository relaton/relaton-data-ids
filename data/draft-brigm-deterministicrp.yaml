  content: "This document specifies the Deterministic Rendezvous Point (D-RP)\nmechanism
    for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Sparse Mode (SM)\nnetworks. It intends
    to provide a simple and robust RP service.\nThe mechanism is deterministic since
    it elects the highest priority\ncandidate to be the D-RP from those available
    for each IP address family.\nIf a D-RP fails, the election process begins again
    using the remaining C-RPs\nfor the IP address family. If no candidates are availabe,
    the network will\ntransition to PIM Dense Mode (DM) routing for that IP address
    family. \nIn the future if C-RPs emerge for the address family, the network will\nelect
    a new D-RP and return to operations with PIM SM routing.\n\t "

  content: "On February 27-28, 1997, the IPng Working Group held an interim\nmeeting
    in Palo Alto, California to consider adopting Mike O'Dell's\n'GSE - An Alternate
    Addressing Architecture for IPv6' proposal [GSE].\nIn GSE, 16-byte IPv6 addresses
    are split into distinct portions for\nglobal routing, local routing and end-point
    identification.  GSE\nincludes the feature of configuring a node internal to a
    site with\nonly the local routing and end-point identification portions of the\naddress,
    thus hiding the full address from the node.  When such a\nnode generates a packet,
    only the low-order bytes of the source\naddress are specified; the high-order
    bytes of the address are filled\nin by a border router when the packet leaves
    the site.\n\n\n\t "

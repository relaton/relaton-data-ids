  content: "   IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable\n   implementations.
    \ Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly\n   gaining popularity in several
    deployment scenarios, not the least in\n   what used to be solely areas of traditional
    telecommunication\n   protocols.  Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods
    that\n   enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and\n
    \  two-way network performance.  Unfortunately, however, standard IP\n   performance
    measurement security mechanisms cannot be readily used\n   with IPsec.  This document
    makes the case for employing IPsec to\n   protect the One-way and Two-Way Active
    Measurement Protocols (O/\n   TWAMP) and proposes a method which combines IKEv2
    and O/TWAMP as\n   defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively.  This specification\n
    \  aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be secured with the\n   best
    mechanisms we have at our disposal today while, on the other\n   hand, it facilitates
    the applicability of O/TWAMP to networks that\n   have already deployed IPsec.\n\n\t "

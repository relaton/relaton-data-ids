  content: "Dual Stack MIPv6 (DSMIP) is a MIPv6 extension to support IPv4\nmobility
    for mobile hosts.  While route optimization is well defined\nfor IPv6 traffic,
    this feature is not defined for IPv4.  However,\nRoute Optimization has many advantages
    as reduced delays and lower\nload for the Home Agent.  This document proposes
    solutions for the\ndifferent scenarios where IPv4 route optimization is performed.\n\t "

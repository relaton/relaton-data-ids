  content: "   This document is a living document, meaning that during the life\n
    \  timme of the MPLS Open Design Team we will put additonal questions/\n   issues
    into the document.  When we find an answer amd a way to\n   document the issu
    it will be removed from this document.\n\n   Ideally when the Design Team is closed
    this document will be empty,\n   or maybe we just add a pointer to where the answer
    to quesstion is\n   documented.  Thus this document will never go on to become
    an RFCc.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Transport Layer Security (TLS) is commonly used to protect HTTP and\n
    \  other protocols; it provides encrypted and authenticated\n   conversations
    between a client and a server.  In some scenarios, two\n   TLS sessions are used,
    so that a third device can participate in the\n   protected communication.  In
    these cases, separate TLS sessions are\n   run between the client and the middle
    device, on one side, and the\n   middle device and the server on the other side.
    \ This provides the\n   needed security, as long as the client, server, and middle
    device use\n   appropriate and consistent security policies.  However, this last\n
    \  part is problematic; how can the middle device know if a client\n   trusts
    a server?  At present, TLS provides no mechanism to coordinate\n   policies, and
    there is no convenient way to do so.\n\n   This note defines a TLS extension that
    allows a TLS server to provide\n   a TLS client with all of information about
    the other TLS server (or\n   servers) that are participating in the application
    layer traffic that\n   the client needs to make a well-informed access control
    decision.\n   This empowers the client to reject TLS sessions that include servers\n
    \  that it does not trust.\n\n\t "

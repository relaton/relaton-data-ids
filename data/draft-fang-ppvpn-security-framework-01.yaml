  content: "This draft addresses security aspects pertaining to Provider \nProvisioned
    Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs). We first describe the \nsecurity threats that
    are relevant in the context of PPVPNs, and the \ndefensive techniques that can
    be used to combat those threats. We \nconsider security issues deriving both from
    malicious behavior of \nanyone and from negligent or incorrect behavior of the
    providers. We \nalso describe how these security attacks should be detected and
    \nreported. We then discuss the possible user requirements in terms of \nsecurity
    in a PPVPN service. These user requirements translate into \ncorresponding requirements
    for the providers. In addition, the \nprovider may have additional requirements
    to make its network \ninfrastructure secure and meet the VPN customer’s expectations.
    \nFinally, we define how these user requirements apply to specific \nPPVPN technologies,
    namely RFC2547 PPVPNs, Virtual Router PPVPNs, \nIPSec VPNs, and Layer 2 PPVPNs.\n\t "

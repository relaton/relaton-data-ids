  content: "Recently there are a number of efforts trying to connect the packet-\nswitching
    network with circuit-switching network, especially the\nInternet with public telephone
    networks.  The first problem of such\ninterconnection is naming and addressing,
    which are described in some\nother drafts ([dnsurl], [telurl1], [faxemail]).  This
    draft gives a\nbrief framework on what the problems we may have in architecture
    and\ntechnology when connecting these two networks, and the possible\nsolutions
    for these problems.\n\t "

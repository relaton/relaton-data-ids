  content: "   This document introduces the KeyState EDNS(0) option code, to enable\n
    \  the exchange of SIG(0) key state information between DNS entities via\n   the
    DNS protocol.  The KeyState option allows DNS clients and servers\n   to include
    key state data in both queries and responses, facilitating\n   mutual awareness
    of SIG(0) key status between child and parent zones.\n   This mechanism addresses
    the challenges of maintaining\n   synchronization of SIG(0) keys used for securing
    DNS UPDATE messages,\n   thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of DNS
    operations\n   that require coordinated key management.\n\n   This document proposes
    such a mechanism.\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on
    in Github at:\n   https://github.com/johanix/draft-berra-dnsop-opt-transaction-state\n
    \  (https://github.com/johanix/draft-berra-dnsop-transaction-state-00).\n   The
    most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc,\n   should all
    be available there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull\n   requests.\n\n\t "

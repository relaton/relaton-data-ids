  content: "This document describes the expected business telephony requirements \nfor
    delivering called party name towards SIP entities. A couple of \nmechanisms exist
    to deliver calling name and number to the called \nparty. None exist for exposing
    the called party name or preferred \nidentity to the calling party. This draft
    proposes a mechanism to \nprovide this capability. \n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the pEp KeySync protocol, which is designed\n
    \  to perform secure peer-to-peer synchronization of private keys across\n   devices
    belonging to the same user.\n\n   Modern users of messaging systems typically
    have multiple devices for\n   communicating, and attempting to use encryption
    on all of these\n   devices often leads to situations where messages cannot be
    decrypted\n   on a given device due to missing private key data.  Current\n   approaches
    to resolve key synchronicity issues are cumbersome and\n   potentially insecure.
    \ The pEp KeySync protocol is designed to\n   facilitate this personal key synchronization
    in a user-friendly\n   manner.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a set of shapes for the representation of\n   uncertainty
    for PIDF-LO geodetic location information.  This includes\n   a GML profile and
    a schema that defines additional geometries.\n   Further recommendations are made
    to restrict the use of geographic\n   Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and units
    of measure restrictions\n   that improve interoperability.\n\n\t "

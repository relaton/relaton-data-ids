abstract:
- content: <p>Christian's Congestion Control Code is a new congestion control algorithm
    designed to support Real-Time applications such as Media over QUIC. It is designed
    to drive towards low delays, with good support for the "application limited" behavior
    frequently found when using variable rate encoding, and with fast reaction to
    congestion to avoid the "priority inversion" happening when congestion control
    overestimates the available capacity. The design was validated by series of simulations,
    and also by initial deployments in control networks. We describe here these simulations
    and tests.</p>

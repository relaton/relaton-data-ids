  content: "   Christian's Congestion Control Code is a new congestion control\n   algorithm
    designed to support Real-Time applications such as Media\n   over QUIC.  It is
    designed to drive towards low delays, with good\n   support for the \"application
    limited\" behavior frequently found when\n   using variable rate encoding, and
    with fast reaction to congestion to\n   avoid the \"priority inversion\" happening
    when congestion control\n   overestimates the available capacity.  The design
    was validated by\n   series of simulations, and also by initial deployments in
    control\n   networks.  We describe here these simulations and tests.\n\n\t "

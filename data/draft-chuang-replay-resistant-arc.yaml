abstract:
- content: "<p>DKIM [RFC6376] is an IETF standard for the cryptographic protocol to
    authenticate email at the domain level and protect the integrity of messages during
    transit. Section 8.6 (https://www.rfc- editor.org/rfc/rfc6376.html#section-8.6)
    defines a vulnerability called DKIM Replay as a spam message sent through a SMTP
    MTA DKIM signer, that then is sent to many more recipients, leveraging the reputation
    of the signer. We propose two Replay Resistant cryptographic domain based protocols
    that leverage ARC [RFC8617]. The first technique discloses all SMTP recipients
    as signed RFC822 headers by the sender which allows a receiver to verify this.
    The second technique defines a SMTP extension that allows both the sender and
    receiver to participate in signing the message signature. It includes a path building
    technique that accurately defines the SMTP forwarding path of the message. Both
    techniques permit a receiver to detect DKIM and ARC replay.</p>"

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In dense topologies (such as data center fabrics based on the Clos\n
    \  and butterfly topologies, though not limited to these), IGP flooding\n   mechanisms
    designed for sparse topologies can \"overflood,\" or carry\n   too many copies
    of topology and reachability information to fabric\n   devices.  This results
    in slower convergence times and higher\n   resource utilization.  The modifications
    to the flooding mechanism in\n   the Intermediate System to Intermediate System
    (IS-IS) link state\n   protocol described in this document reduce resource utilization\n
    \  significantly, while increasing convergence performance in dense\n   topologies.\n\n
    \  Note that a Clos fabric is used as the primary example of a dense\n   flooding
    topology throughout this document.  However, the flooding\n   optimizations described
    in this document apply to any topology.\n\n\t "

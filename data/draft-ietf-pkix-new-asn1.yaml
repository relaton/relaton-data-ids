  content: "The Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) certificate format, and
    many associated formats, are expressed using ASN.1.  The current ASN.1 modules
    conform to the 1988 version of ASN.1.  This document updates those ASN.1 modules
    to conform to the 2002 version of ASN.1.  There are no bits-on-the-wire changes
    to any of the formats; this is simply a change to the syntax.  This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

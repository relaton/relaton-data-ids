  script: Latn
  content: "   [RFC5213] prompts the Inner-domain handover of the MN in Proxy Mobile\n
    \  IPv6(PMIPv6).This document describes network-based Inter-domain\n   handover
    functionality and corresponding mobility options for\n   PMIPv6.This document
    strictly abides by the three principle describes\n   in PMIPv6:\n\n   (a)The movement
    of MN is transparent to CN.\n\n   (b)MN doesn't participate in any mobility-related
    signaling.LMA and\n   MAG are responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of
    the host.\n\n   (c)This document is compatible with RFC5213.\n\n   The points
    of this document are as follows:\n\n   (1) Concepts: The MN's Home Agent(HA) ,Home
    Address (HoA) and Care-of\n   address(CoA) is not only for user but also for the
    specific\n   session.MN initiating a session uses the address assigned by the
    LMA\n   which the MN is registered at the moment as the HoA for the\n   session.The
    user initiating a session uses the address assigned by\n   the LMA which the MN
    moves to as the CoA for the session.\n\n   (2) Binding Cache:Every local mobility
    anchor must maintain two\n   Binding Cache entries for each currently registered
    mobile node.  One\n   is Inner-domain BCE,the other is Inter-domain BCE.  Inner-domain
    BCE\n   maintains the binding between MN's Proxy-CoA and MN's HoA.  Inter-\n   domain
    BCE maintains the bingding between CN's HoA and CN's CoA.\n\n   (3)Communication:For
    the user initiating a session or accepting a\n   session,no matter how it moves,the
    HoA for the session is\n   unchanged,the source address of the data packets is
    the user's own\n   HoA,and the destination address of the the data packets is
    the HoA of\n   CN.The local mobility anchor will check all the packets received
    from\n   the mobile access gateway.If both the source address of the data\n   packets
    is the MN's HoA recorded in Inner-domain BCE,and the CN's HoA\n   and CoA recorded
    in Inter-domain BCE are the same,the LMA will route\n   the packets directly to
    CN as described in RFC5213.Otherwise,\n   according to looking up the Inter-domain
    BCE,LMA gets the CoA of CN.\n   Then ,LMA encapsulates the packets to route to
    CN.On receiving a\n   packet from a correspondent node with the destination address\n
    \  matching a mobile node's home network prefix(es), the CN's LMA MUST\n   first
    check the source address and the destination address of the\n   data packets,if
    the source address of the data packets is MN's HoA\n   recorded in Inter-domain
    BCE and the destination address is CN's HoA\n   recorded in Inner-domain BCE ,the
    CN'LMA will forward the packets to\n   the right MAG directly as described in
    RFC5213.Otherwise, CN'LMA will\n   remove the outer header before forwarding the
    packet.  Then,LMA looks\n   up the Inner-domain BCE to forward the packets to
    the right MAG.\n\n   (4)Updates:When MN moves to visited LMA(MN-vLMA),MN-vLMA
    will do\n   three things.\n\n   Firstly MN-vLMA will assign a MN-CoA for MN and
    build up the Inner-\n   domain BCE for MN.  Secondly,MN-vLMA will sends message
    to MN-hLMA to\n   get the HoA of CN .Then,MN-vLMA builds up the binding between
    CN-HoA\n   and CN-HoA in the Inter-domain BCE.Thirdly, MN-vLMA sends message to\n
    \  CN-LMA wiht the MN-CoA and MN-HoA included in the message to help CN-\n   LMA
    updating the Inter-domain BCE for MN.\n\n   Compared with \"draft-ma-netext-pmip-handover-00.txt\",
    this document\n   is compatible with RFC5213 and the LMA described in this document\n
    \  should decide if it is necessary to encapsulate the packets.In other\n   word,if
    MN and CN are both in their home domain,they will communicate\n   just as the
    way described in RFC5213 and otherwise they will\n   communicate in the way described
    in this document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Compute First Networking (CFN) Dynamic Anycast refers to in-network\n
    \  edge computing, where a single service offered by a provider has\n   multiple
    instances attached to multiple edge sites.  In this\n   scenario, flows are assigned
    and consistently forwarded to a specific\n   instance through an anycast approach
    based on the network status as\n   well as the status of the different instance.\n\n
    \  This document describes an architecture for the Dynamic Anycast\n   (Dyncast)
    in Compute First Networking (CFN).  It provides an\n   overview, a description
    of the various components, and a workflow\n   example showing how to provide a
    balanced multi-edge based service in\n   terms of both computing and networking
    resources through dynamic\n   anycast in real time.\n\n\t "

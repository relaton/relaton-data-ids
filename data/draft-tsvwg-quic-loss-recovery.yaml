  content: "   QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and secure\n
    \  transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for\n   HTTP/2
    semantics.  While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application\n   protocol, QUIC
    builds on decades of transport and security\n   experience, and implements mechanisms
    that make it attractive as a\n   modern general-purpose transport.  QUIC implements
    the spirit of\n   known TCP loss recovery mechanisms, described in RFCs, various\n
    \  Internet-drafts, and also those prevalent in the Linux TCP\n   implementation.
    \ This document describes QUIC loss recovery, and\n   where applicable, attributes
    the TCP equivalent in RFCs, Internet-\n   drafts, academic papers, and/or TCP
    implementations.\n\n\t "

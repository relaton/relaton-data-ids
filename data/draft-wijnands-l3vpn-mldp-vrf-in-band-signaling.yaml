  content: "   Sometimes an IP multicast distribution tree (MDT) traverses both\n
    \  MPLS-enabled and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network.  Typically\n   the
    MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an\n   MPLS region.
    \ In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the\n   MDT as a pure IP MDT,
    then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint LSP\n   (Label Switched Path) when it enters
    an MPLS-enabled region, and then\n   convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it
    enters a non-MPLS-enabled\n   region.  Other documents specify the procedures
    for building such a\n   hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
    in the non-\n   MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Extensions to
    Label\n   Distribution Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document\n   extends
    those procedures to handle the case where the link connecting\n   the two regions
    is a \"Virtual Routing and Forwarding Table\" (VRF)\n   link, as defined in the
    \"BGP IP/MPLS VPN\" specifications.  However,\n   this document is primarily aimed
    at particular use cases where VRFs\n   are used to support multicast applications
    other than Multicast VPN.\n\n\t "

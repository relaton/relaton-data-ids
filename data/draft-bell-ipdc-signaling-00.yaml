  content: "   The protocol described in this document is a member of the IP  Device\n
    \  Control  (IPDC) family of protocols.  The IPDC protocols are proposed\n   as
    a protocol suite, components of which can be used individually  or\n   together
    \ to perform connection control, media control, and signaling\n   transport  for
    \ environments  where  the  service  control  logic  is\n   separated  from  the
    network access server. Please see the references\n   section for other IPDC documents.\n
    \n   The protocol specification presented here is intended for use between\n   a
    \ media  gateway  controller and a media gateway.  The media gateway\n   may be
    capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice  over  ATM\n   gateway,  dialup
    \ modem  media  gateway,  circuit  switch,  or cross-\n   connect.   Using the
    IP Device Signaling Transport protocol presented\n   here, the media  gateway
    can  receive  a  signaling  from  a  circuit\n   switched  network  and  deliver
    \ the  signaling  to  a  media gateway\n   controller  on  an  intervening  IP
    \ network.   The   media   gateway\n   controller can also send signaling to a
    media gateway for delivery on\n   a circuit switched network.\n\n\t "

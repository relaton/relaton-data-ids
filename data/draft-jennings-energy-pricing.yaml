  content: "   This specification defines media types for representing the future\n
    \  price of energy in JSON.  It also defines a way for a client device,\n   such
    as a car, refrigerator, air conditioner, water heater, or\n   display to discover
    a web server that can provide the future price\n   for local electrical energy.
    \ This will allow the client device to\n   make intelligent decisions about when
    to use energy, and enable price\n   distribution when the building is off-grid.
    \ It enables obtaining\n   price from a local or non-local price server.\n\n   This
    draft is an early skeleton of a draft to start discussion around\n   this idea.\n\n\t "

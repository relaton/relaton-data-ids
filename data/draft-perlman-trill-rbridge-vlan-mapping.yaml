  content: "Some bridge products perform a feature known as \"VLAN mapping\", in\n
    \  which a bridge translates a data frame's VLAN ID from one VLAN to\n   another
    when it forwards a frame from one port to another. This\n   feature facilitates
    scenarios such as combining two bridged LANs with\n   overlapping VLAN IDs into
    one bridged LAN without merging two\n   communities just because they have been
    given the same VLAN ID in the\n   original two clouds. This document describes
    how RBridges can achieve\n   the same functionality.\n\t "

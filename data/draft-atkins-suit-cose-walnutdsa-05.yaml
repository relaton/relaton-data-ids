  content: "   This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital\n
    \  Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR\n   Object
    Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax.  WalnutDSA is a\n   lightweight, quantum-resistant
    signature scheme based on Group\n   Theoretic Cryptography with implementation
    and computational\n   efficiency of signature verification in constrained16807\n
    \  environments, even on 8- and 16-bit platforms.\n\n   The goal of this publication
    is to document a way to use the\n   lightweight, quantum-resistant WalnutDSA signature
    algorithm in COSE\n   in a way that would allow multiple developers to build compatible\n
    \  implementations.  As of this publication, WalnutDSA has not been\n   endorsed
    by the IETF.\n\n   WalnutDSA(TM) and Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm(TM) are\n

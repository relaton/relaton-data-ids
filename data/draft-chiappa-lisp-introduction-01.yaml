  content: "   LISP is an upgrade to the architecture of the IPvN internetworking\n
    \  system, one which separates location and identity (currently\n   intermingled
    in IPvN addresses). This is a change which has been\n   identified by the IRTF
    as a critically necessary evolutionary\n   architectural step for the Internet.
    In LISP, nodes have both a\n   'locator' (a name which says _where_ in the network's
    connectivity\n   structure the node is) and an 'identifier' (a name which serves
    only\n   to provide a persistent handle for the node). A node may have more\n
    \  than one locator, or its locator may change over time (e.g. if the\n   node
    is mobile), but it keeps the same identifier.\n\n   One of the chief novelties
    of LISP, compared to other proposals for\n   the separation of location and identity,
    is its approach to deploying\n   this upgrade. (In general, it is comparatively
    easy to conceive of\n   new network designs, but much harder to devise approaches
    which will\n   actually get deployed throughout the global network.)  LISP aims
    to\n   achieve the near-ubiquitous deployment necessary for maximum\n   exploitation
    of an architectural upgrade by i) minimizing the amount\n   of change needed (existing
    hosts and routers can operate unmodified);\n   and ii) by providing significant
    benefits to early adopters.\n\n   This document is an introduction to the entire
    LISP system, for those\n   who are unfamiliar with it. It is intended to be both
    easy to\n   follow, and also give a fairly detailed understanding of the entire\n
    \  system.\n\n\t "

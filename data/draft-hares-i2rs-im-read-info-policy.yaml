  content: "   The Interface to the routing system (I2RS) specifies a new interface\n
    \  that a client (I2RS client) can utilize to interface to the routing\n   system.
    \ Some applications that utilize the services of I2RS client\n   may require a
    specific set of data in response to network events or\n   conditions based on
    pre-established rules.  In order to reduce the\n   data flow through the network,
    the I2RS client needs to signal the\n   I2RS agent to filter some of the collected
    data or events prior to\n   transmission to the i2rs client.  This functionality
    is necessary to\n   meet the requirements I2RS enabled services which include
    service-\n   layer routing improvements, and control of traffic flows and exit\n
    \  points.\n\n   This document introduces a read-only I2RS RIB policy Informational\n
    \  Model that provides filters for the reads and notifications from the\n   I2RS
    RIB Info Model (IM).  This model utilizes a generic information\n   model (IM)
    for policy templates that is extensible and hierarchical.\n   These templates
    support the features described by the I2RS\n   architectural model.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document updates RFC3961 to support encryption mechanisms that\n
    \  can authenticate associated data, such as Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM)\n   and
    Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).  These mechanisms are often more\n   performant and
    need not expand the message as much as conventional\n   modes.\n\n\t "

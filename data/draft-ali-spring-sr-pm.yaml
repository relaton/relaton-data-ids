  content: "   RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
    accurate\n   measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as
    related metrics\n   such as delay variation and channel throughput in MPLS networks.
    \ This document\n   describes how these mechanisms can be used for performance
    measurements in Segment\n   Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) networks.  The
    document also specifies how\n   similar mechanisms can be used for performance
    measurement in Segment Routing with\n   IPv6 data plane (SRv6) networks.\n\n\t "

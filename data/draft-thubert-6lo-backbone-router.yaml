  content: "   This specification proposes an update to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, to\n
    \  enhance the operation of IPv6 over wireless links that exhibit lossy\n   multicast
    support, and enable a large degree of scalability by\n   splitting the broadcast
    domains.  A higher speed backbone federates\n   multiple wireless links to form
    a large MultiLink Subnet.  Backbone\n   Routers acting as Layer-3 Access Point
    route packets to registered\n   nodes, where an classical Layer-2 Access Point
    would bridge.\n   Conversely, wireless nodes register to the Backbone Router to
    setup\n   routing services in a fashion that is essentially similar to a\n   classical
    Layer-2 association.\n\n\t "

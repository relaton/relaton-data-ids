  content: "  S/MIME delivers confidentiality, integrity, and data origination\n  authentication
    for email. However, there are many situations where\n  organizations also want
    robust access control applied to information\n  in messages. The Enhanced Security
    Services (ESS) RFC5035 for S/MIME\n  defines an access control mechanism for email,
    but the  access check\n  happens after the data is decrypted by the recipient
    which devalues\n  the protection afforded by the cryptography and provides very
    weak\n  guarantees of policy compliance. Another major issues for S/MIME is\n
    \ its dependency on a single type of identity credential, an X.509\n  certificate.
    Many users on the Internet today do not have X.509\n  certificates and therefore
    cannot use S/MIME.  Furthermore, the\n  requirement to discover the X.509 certificate
    for every recipient of\n  an encrypted message by the sender has proven to be
    an unreliable\n  process for a number of reasons.\n\n  This document presents
    requirements for an alternative model to ESS to\n  address the identified issues
    with access control in order to deliver\n  more robust compliance for S/MIME protected
    messages. This document\n  describes an access control model which uses cryptographic
    keys to\n  enforce access control policy decisions where the policy check is\n
    \ performed prior to the decryption of the message contents. This\n  authorization
    model can be instantiated using many existing standards\n  and is in not intended
    to be a one off just for email, being\n  applicable to other data types.\n\n  This
    document also presents requirements for the abstraction of the\n  specifics of
    the authentication technologies used by S/MIME users. The\n  abstraction makes
    it possible for other forms of authentication\n  credentials to be used with S/MIME
    thereby enabling much broader\n  adoption. The authentication abstraction model
    also removes the\n  dependency on the need to discover encryption keys by the
    sender. This\n  abstraction can be used independently from access control to enable\n
    \ simple scenarios where authentication of the recipient is sufficient\n  to grant
    access to the message.\n\n  The name Plasma was assigned to this effort as part
    of the IETF\n  process. It is derived from PoLicy enhAnced Secure eMAil.\n\n\t "

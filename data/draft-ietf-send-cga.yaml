  content: "This document describes a method for binding a public signature key to
    an IPv6 address in the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol.  Cryptographically
    Generated Addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses for which the interface identifier
    is generated by computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public
    key and auxiliary parameters.  The binding between the public key and the address
    can be verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with
    the interface identifier.  Messages sent from an IPv6 address can be protected
    by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the message
    with the corresponding private key.  The protection works without a certification
    authority or any security infrastructure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

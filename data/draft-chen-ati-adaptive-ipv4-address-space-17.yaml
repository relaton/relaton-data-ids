  content: "   This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion\n
    \  issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of\n   the
    original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy IPv4),
    outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system architecture
    enhancement considerations. EzIP may\n   expand an IPv4 address by a factor of
    256M without affecting the\n   existing IPv4 based Internet, or the current private
    networks. It is\n   in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not
    only\n   both direct and private network connectivity, but also their\n   interoperability.
    EzIP deployments may coexist with existing Internet\n   traffic and IoTs (Internet
    of Things) operations without perturbing\n   their setups, while offering end-users
    the freedom to indepdently\n   choose which service. EzIP may be implemented as
    a software or\n   firmware enhancement to Internet edge routers or private network\n
    \  routing gateways, wherever needed, or simply installed as an inline\n   adjunct
    hardware module between the two, enabling a seamless\n   introduction. The 256M
    case detailed here establishes a complete\n   spherical layer of an overlay of
    routers for interfacing between the\n   Internet fabic (core plus edge routers)
    and the end user premises or\n   IoTs. Incorporating caching proxy technology
    in the gateway, a fairly\n   large geographical region may enjoy address expansion
    based on as few\n   as one ordinary IPv4 public address utilizing IP packets with\n
    \  degenerated EzIP header. If IPv4 public pool allocations were\n   reorganized,
    the assignable pool could be multiplied 512M fold or\n   even more. Enabling hierarchical
    address architecture which\n   facilitates both hierarchical and mesh routing,
    EzIP can provide\n   nearly the same order of magnitude of address pool resources
    as IPv6\n   while streamlining the administrative aspects of it. The basic EzIP\n
    \  will immediately resolve the local IPv4 address shortage, while being\n   transparent
    to the rest of the Internet as a new parallel facility.\n   Under the Dual-Stack
    environment, these proposed interim facilities\n   will relieve the IPv4 address
    shortage issue, while affording IPv6\n   more time to reach maturity for providing
    the availability levels\n   required for delivering a long-term general service.
    The basic EzIP\n   may be deployed in two distinctive phases. First, the CG-NAT\n
    \  operation may be enhanced by enabling the use of 240/4 netblock in\n   addition
    to the current 100.64/10 netblock of RFC6598. This makes\n   end-to-end connectivity
    feasible within the service area of each\n   240/4 netblock. Second, this capability
    may extend to global coverage\n   with the use of the Option Word mechanism in
    the IP header.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The CAA DNS record allows a domain to communicate issuance policy to\n
    \  CAs, but only allows a domain to define policy with CA-level\n   granularity.
    \ However, the CAA specification also provides facilities\n   for extension to
    admit more granular, CA-specific policy.  This\n   specification defines two such
    parameters, one allowing specific\n   accounts of a CA to be identified by URI
    and one allowing specific\n   methods of domain control validation as defined
    by the ACME protocol\n   to be required.\n\n\t "

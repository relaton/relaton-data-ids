  content: "   This document describes the integration of the Network Service Header\n
    \  (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR), as well as encapsulation details, to\n   efficiently
    support Service Function Chaining (SFC) while maintaining\n   separation of the
    service and transport planes as originally intended\n   by the SFC architecture.\n\n
    \  Combining these technologies allows SR to be used for steering\n   packets
    between Service Function Forwarders (SFF) along a given\n   Service Function Path
    (SFP) while NSH has the responsibility for\n   maintaining the integrity of the
    service plane, the SFC instance\n   context, and any associated metadata.\n\n
    \  This integration demonstrates that NSH and SR can work cooperatively\n   and
    provide a network operator with the flexibility to use whichever\n   transport
    technology makes sense in specific areas of their network\n   infrastructure while
    still maintaining an end-to-end service plane\n   using NSH.\n\n\t "

  content: "Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user shared\nsimulations,
    are becoming increasingly used for serious work in\naddition to the traditional
    uses of research and entertainment.\nWhereas previous distributed simulation protocols
    have been designed\nwith narrow, time-definite scope, the LESS (Live Entity State
    Stream)\nprotocol is designed to allow open-ended join and leave for a\nmultitude
    of simulation peers.  The LESS protocol specifies how peers\nof a simulation collaborate
    and share state to achieve a mutually\nagreed \"collective hallucination,\" leading
    to a user-perceivable\nshared state of a simulated worlds.\n\t "

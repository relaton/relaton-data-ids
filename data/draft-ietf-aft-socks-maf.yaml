  content: "SOCKS V5 [RFC 1928] provides a means to select one from among a number
    \nof authentication methods but does not provide any means for utilizing \nmultiple
    authentication methods to obtain certain desired authentication \nproperties.\nMAF
    is a client-initiated but server-managed framework.  MAF relies on a \ntrusted
    Authentication Management Server (AMS) to: 1) Select the \nauthentication methods
    to be invoked, 2) order the execution of methods \nat the client, as appropriate,
    and 3) assign integrity grades to the \nfinal, composite authentication after
    all methods that were invoked have \ncompleted.\n\t "

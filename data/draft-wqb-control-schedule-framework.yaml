    \  scenarios and identifies the entities involved in requesting\n   scheduled
    changes of network resources or policy/action execution.\n   It also addresses
    additional challenges such as conflict resolution,\n   priority handling, and
    synchronization of scheduled tasks, ultimately\n   enhancing the reliability and
    performance of network services.\n\n   This document also describes the applicability
    of various network\n   management tools and data models may be used, to meet the\n
    \  requirements of a set of representative use cases.\n\n\t "

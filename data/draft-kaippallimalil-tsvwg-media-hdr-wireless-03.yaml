  content: "   Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant\n
    \  variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless\n   channel
    conditions, interference, or the end-user's movement.  These\n   variations in
    capacity take place in the order of hundreds of\n   milliseconds and is much too
    fast for end-to-end congestion signaling\n   by itself to convey the changes for
    an application to adapt.  Media\n   applications on the other hand demand both
    high throughput and low\n   latency, and can dynamically adjust the size and quality
    of a stream\n   to match available network bandwidth.  However, catering to such\n
    \  media flows over a radio link with rapid changes in capacity requires\n   the
    buffers and congestion to be managed carefully.  This draft\n   proposes to provide
    metadata about the media transported in each\n   packet to allow the wireless
    network to manage radio resources\n   optimally and to maximize network utilization
    while also improving\n   application performance.\n\n   This draft discusses potential
    solution options to this problem and\n   the trade-offs involved.  The draft then
    defines a new UDP option to\n   carry media metadata between a UDP source and
    destination.  This\n   metadata is designed to be minimal, compact and has low
    processing\n   overhead per-packet for encoding and retrieval.\n\n\t "

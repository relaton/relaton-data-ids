  content: "   In SDN networks, applications need to discover the location of the\n
    \  local or specific SDN Orchestrator before requesting service.  Other\n   SDN
    Orchestrator may also need to know its nearby SDN Orchestrators.\n   This is called
    SDN Discovery.  This document introduces a discovery\n   scheme which employs
    the U-NAPTR mechanism to determine the URI of\n   the SDN Orchestrator.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the Adaptive Hybrid Domain Routing (AHDR)\n   protocol.
    It describes the parts of the protocol that are required\n   of all implementations
    as well as optional requirements that each\n   implementation may include. AHDR
    allows router nodes to form far-\n   reaching ad-hoc networks, especially in wireless
    environments. AHDR\n   uses a combination of proactive and reactive routing schemes
    to be\n   responsive to topology changes without incurring high protocol\n   overhead.
    AHDR adapts to network conditions in order to minimize\n   network overhead and
    maximize network reachability.\n\t "

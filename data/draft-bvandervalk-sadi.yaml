  content: "   This document describes Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration\n
    \  (SADI), a set of best practices for implementing stateless web\n   services
    that consume RDF data as input and generate RDF data as\n   output.  The goal
    of SADI is to establish conventions that will\n   enable a much higher level of
    interoperability between web services\n   from independent providers than is currently
    possible under the\n   widespread use of WSDL/XML and RESTful services.  Under
    SADI,\n   interoperability depends on the shared use of predicate vocabularies,\n
    \  rather than the shared use of particular XML schemas, JSON\n   structures,
    or ad hoc data formats.  Through the use of OWL to\n   describe service input
    and output datatypes, SADI enables: i)\n   automated discovery of services that
    provide data or computations of\n   interest, and ii) automated matchmaking between
    local data and\n   available services.  By iterative application of the former
    two\n   capabilities, SADI enables semi-automated construction of arbitrarily\n
    \  complex workflows across independent service providers.\n\n\t "

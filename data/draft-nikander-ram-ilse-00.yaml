  content: "\n   Implementing the so called identifier / locator separation may have\n
    \  far-reaching consequences to the Internet architecture, depending\n   very
    much on how exactly it is implemented.  That is, here as in many\n   other cases,
    the devil lies very much in the details.\n\n   In this document, we attempt to
    outline the various aspects of the\n   design space.  We briefly discuss six main
    aspects: identifiers,\n   dynamic traffic management, end-to-end issues, security,
    economics,\n   and deployment.  In this initial version of the document, we still\n
    \  lack many details.\n\n   This document is a reaction to the problem statement
    effort at the\n   Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop (RAWS).\n\n\t "

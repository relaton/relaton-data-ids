  content: "The Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group of the
    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined a number of certificate management
    protocols.  These protocols are primarily focused on X.509v3 public-key certificates.
    \ However, it is sometimes desirable to manage certificates in alternative formats
    as well.  This document specifies how such certificates may be requested using
    the Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) syntax that is used by several different
    protocols.  It also explains how alternative certificate formats may be incorporated
    into such popular protocols as PKIX Certificate Management Protocol (PKIX-CMP)
    and Certificate Management Messages over CMS (CMC).  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

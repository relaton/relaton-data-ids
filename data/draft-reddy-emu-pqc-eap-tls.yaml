  content: "   This document proposes enhancements to the Extensible Authentication\n
    \  Protocol with Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) and EAP Tunneled TLS\n   (EAP-TTLS)
    to incorporate post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms.  It\n   also addresses challenges
    related to large certificate sizes and long\n   certificate chains, as identified
    in [RFC9191], and provides\n   recommendations for integrating PQC algorithms
    into EAP-TLS and EAP-\n   TTLS deployments.\n\n\t "

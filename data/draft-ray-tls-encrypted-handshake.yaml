  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension\n
    \  which allows endpoints to negotiate the use of encryption with\n   forward
    secrecy at the beginning of the handshake.  Two levels of\n   functionality are
    defined.  Implementations are free to support one\n   or both levels, with the
    first level incurring no additional\n   computational or round-trip overhead.
    \ The TLS cryptographic\n   calculations are unchanged.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by\n
    \  which a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing\n   or
    hearing impaired user using an interpreter (\"Communications\n   Assistant\")
    connected via a videophone to the deaf/hard of hearing/\n   hearing impaired user
    and an audio telephone call to the hearing\n   user.  The CA interprets using
    sign language on the videophone link\n   and voice on the telephone link.  Often
    the interpreters may be\n   employed by a company or agency termed a \"provider\"
    in this document.\n   The provider also provides a video service that allows users
    to\n   connect video devices to their service, and subsequently to CAs and\n   other
    deaf/hard of hearing/hearing impaired users.  It is desirable\n   that the videophones
    used by the deaf, hard of hearing or hearing\n   impaired user conform to a standard
    so that any device may be used\n   with any provider and that direct video calls
    between deaf, hard of\n   hearing or hearing impaired users work.  This document
    describes the\n   interface between a videophone and a provider.\n\n\t "

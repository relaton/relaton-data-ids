  content: "   The Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501] requires a client to\n
    \  initiate a LOGOUT command to close the network connection. However,\n   it's
    often desirable to have the server initiate the termination of\n   the network
    connection. This allows the network to deactivate a\n   service provided to a
    client. This document specifies the syntax of a\n   server-initiated LOGOUT command,
    which will allow a server to tell\n   the client that the connection needs to
    be closed.\n\n\n\n\t "

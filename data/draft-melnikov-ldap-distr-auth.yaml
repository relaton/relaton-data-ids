  content: "   This document was prompted by a desire to allow deployments of\n   distributed
    SASL implementations, so that all authentication can be\n   performed in a one
    central place. It tries to fulfill the following\n   requirements:\n\n   1) The
    SASL framework is client/server authentication, but it doesn't\n   preclude either
    the client or the server implementations from being\n   distributed.\n\n   2)
    It might be also desirable to proxy an authentication exchange\n   whether it
    was initiated over LDAP or another SASL-supporting\n   protocol.\n\n   This document
    defines a Distributed Authentication LDAP extended\n   operation, that enables
    applications (including LDAP proxies and\n   gateways) that authenticate using
    SASL, to use LDAP for performing\n   authentication, by forwarding the SASL authentication
    requests to an\n   LDAP server.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document defines a normative framework for evaluating the\n   admissibility
    of speech acts produced by autonomous agents in goal-\n   directed activity.  The
    framework establishes rules for determining\n   whether an agent's statement is
    admissible based on its modality\n   (assertive, conditional, refusal, descriptive)
    and its grounding\n   state, independent of semantic truth.\n\n   This framework
    enables deterministic, auditable evaluation of agent\n   contributions without
    requiring truth verification or semantic\n   interpretation.\n\n\t "

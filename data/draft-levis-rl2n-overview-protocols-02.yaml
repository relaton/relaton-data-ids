  content: "   Networks of low power wireless devices introduce novel IP routing\n
    \  issues.  Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and\n   smart
    objects, have difficult constraints: very limited memory,\n   little processing
    power, and long sleep periods.  As most of these\n   devices are battery-powered,
    energy efficiency is critically\n   important.  Wireless link qualities can vary
    significantly over time,\n   requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize
    topology\n   change energy costs.  Such low power and lossy networks (L2Ns) have\n
    \  routing requirements that existing mesh protocols only partially\n   address.
    \ This document provides a brief survey of the strengths and\n   weaknesses of
    existing protocols with respect to L2Ns.  It provides\n   guidance on how lessons
    from existing and prior efforts can be\n   leveraged in future protocol design.\n\n\t "

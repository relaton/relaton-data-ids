  content: "   This document defines a loop-detection algorithm with a cumulative\n
    \  O(n) complexity (O(1) average complexity for each proxy) and average\n   O(log
    n) state-space, where n is the number of proxies that the\n   message passes through.
    \ Also, the backwards-compatibility and\n   security of this algorithm are discussed.\n\n
    \  Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the SIPPING working\n   group
    list at 'sipping@ietf.org'.\n\t "

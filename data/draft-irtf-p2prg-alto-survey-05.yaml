  content: "A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by peer-to-peer
    (P2P) applications used originally for file sharing, and more recently for real-time
    communications and live media streaming.  Such applications discover a route to
    each other through an overlay network with little knowledge of the underlying
    network topology.  As a result, they may choose peers based on information deduced
    from empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal choices.  This document,
    a product of the P2P Research Group, presents a survey of existing literature
    on discovering and using network topology information for Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

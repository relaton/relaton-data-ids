  content: "   This document specify a mechanism to allow IPv6 stack implementation\n
    \  to parse upcoming IPv6 extension header by reserving a small range of\n   protocol
    numbers for well defined IPv6 extension headers.  IPv6 stack\n   implementors
    can code these range into their network stack a priori.\n   These reserved range
    provide an guarantee that a given next header is\n   a well formed extension header
    and not a next layer protocol.\n   Operators, companies, vendors et cetera are
    in the ability to deploy\n   and test not standardized extension headers without
    modifying every\n   middle box parsing the complete extension header chain in
    between.\n\n\t "

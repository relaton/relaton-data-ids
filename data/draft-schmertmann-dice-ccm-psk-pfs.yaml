  content: "   RFC 6655 describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n
    \  in the Counter with Cipher Block Chaining - Message Authentication\n   Code
    (CBC-MAC) Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) and
    Datagram TLS (DTLS) to provide confidentiality and\n   data origin authentication.
    \ The AES-CCM algorithm is amenable to\n   compact implementations, making it
    suitable for constrained\n   environments.  It has been chosen as one of the preferred
    cipher\n   suites for use with DTLS in the Constrained Application Protocol,\n
    \  CoAP.\n\n   The present document defines additional cipher suites that provide\n
    \  forward secrecy.  It also discusses an option to replace the Hash-\n   based
    PRF in RFC 6655 by CMAC, reducing the number of cryptographic\n   primitives required
    for implementation.  (The intention is that the\n   option is either chosen or
    not chosen before this document is agreed,\n   not that both options are defined.)\n\n
    \  This document is initially addressed at the DICE working group in\n   order
    to build consensus that there is an actual gap to be filled and\n   about the
    technical parameters of a solution for that gap.  Once this\n   is agreed, the
    usual path for agreeing a cipher suite will need to be\n   taken.\n\n\t "

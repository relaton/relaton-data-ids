  content: "This document presents the routing requirements for in-vehicle low\npower
    and lossy networks.  Automobiles are already equipped with\nseveral sensors and
    devices named Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for\ncontrolling, monitoring and entertainment,
    etc.  For the future in-\nvehicle networks, the shift to wireless is desirable
    due to heavy\nweight and volume of cables in vehicles and to be able to efficiently\ninstall
    devices.  However, with the limitation of low power, in-\nvehicle network still
    requires reliability and scalability in nature\nof the rolls of ECU.  The routing
    protocol should support the\nfeatures of low-power, high-reliability, Subnetting,
    QoS, Mobility,\netc.  This document briefly explains the in-vehicle networks and\nECUs,
    then discusses the requirements for the future wireless in-\nvehicle networks.\n\t "

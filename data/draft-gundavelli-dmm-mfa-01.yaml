  content: "   IP mobility protocols are designed to allow a mobile node to remain\n
    \  reachable while moving around in the network.  The currently deployed\n   mobility
    management protocols are anchor-based approaches, where a\n   mobile node's IP
    sessions are anchored on a central node.  The mobile\n   node's IP traffic enters
    and exits from this anchor node and it\n   remains as the control point for all
    subscriber services.  This\n   architecture based on fixed IP anchors comes with
    some complexity and\n   there is some interest from the mobile operators to eliminate
    the use\n   of fixed anchors, and other residual elements such as the overlay\n
    \  tunneling that come with it.\n\n   This document describes a new approach for
    realizing a mobile user-\n   plane that does not require fixed IP anchors.  The
    architectural-\n   basis for this approach is the separation of control and user
    plane,\n   and the use of programmability constructs of the user-plane for\n   traffic
    steering.  This approach is referred to as, Mobility-aware\n   Floating Anchor
    (MFA).\n\n\t "

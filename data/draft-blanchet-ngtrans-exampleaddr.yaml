  content: "To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, an IPv6 prefix is\nreserved
    for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the\nlike.  Since site
    local addresses have special meaning in IPv6, these\ncannot be used in many example
    situations and are confusing.\nInstead, an IPv6 prefix 3ffe:ffff::/32 is reserved
    in the range of\nthe test address space.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides details of the Voice Profile for Internet Mail
    (VPIM) directory service. The service provides the email address of the recipient
    that is given a telephone number. It optionally provides the spoken name of the
    recipient and the media capabilities of the recipient.\n\n The VPIM directory
    Schema provides essential additional attributes to recreate the voice mail user
    experience using standardized directories. This user experience provides, at the
    time of addressing, basic assurances that the message will be delivered as intended.
    This document combines two earlier documents, one from Anne Brown and one from
    Greg Vaudreuil, that define a voice messaging schema into a single working group
    submission. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

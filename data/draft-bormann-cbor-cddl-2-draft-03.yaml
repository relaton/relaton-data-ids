  script: Latn
  content: "   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) today is defined by\n   RFC
    8610 and RFC 9165.  The latter (as well as some more application\n   specific
    specifications such as RFC 9090) have used the extension\n   point provided in
    RFC 8610, the control operator.\n\n   As CDDL is used in larger projects, feature
    requirements become known\n   that cannot be easily mapped into this single extension
    point.\n   Hence, there is a need for evolution of the base CDDL specification\n
    \  itself.\n\n   The present document provides a roadmap towards a \"CDDL 2.0\".
    \ It is\n   based on draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-freezer, but is more selective in\n
    \  what potential features it takes up and more detailed in their\n   discussion.
    \ It is intended to serve as a basis for prototypical\n   implementations of CDDL
    2.0.  What specific documents spawn from the\n   present one or whether this document
    is evolved into a single\n   CDDL 2.0 specification.\n\n\t "

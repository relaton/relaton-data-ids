  script: Latn
  content: "There are a number of instances in which the search for a particular value
    (for instance, a cryptographic key) can be distributed across a large number of
    machines, however there is not currently a standard protocol for doing so.  A
    great many algorithms may be used for searches; because these algorithms may differ
    greatly, the protocol used must be flexible enough to be easily extended.\n\t "

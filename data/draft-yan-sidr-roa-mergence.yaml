  content: "   The address space holder needs to issue an ROA object when it\n   authorizes
    one or more ASes to originate routes to multiple prefixes.\n   During the process
    of ROA issuance, the address space holder needs to\n   specify an origin AS for
    a list of IP prefixes.  Besides, the address\n   space holder has a free choice
    to put multiple prefixes into a single\n   ROA or issue separate ROAs for each
    prefix based on the current\n   specification.  This memo analyzes and presents
    some operational\n   problems which may be caused by the misconfigurations of
    ROAs\n   containing multiple IP prefixes.  Some suggestions and considerations\n
    \  also have been proposed.\n\n\t "

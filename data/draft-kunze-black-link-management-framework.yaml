  content: "This document provides a framework that describes a solution space\nfor
    the control and management of optical interfaces according to the\nBlack Link
    approach as specified by ITU-T [ITU.G698.2] and beyond\n(friendly wavelength).
    \ In particular, it examines topological\nelements and related network management
    measures.\n\nOptical Routing and Wavelength assignment based on WSON is out of\nscope.
    \ This document concentrates on the management of optical\ninterfaces.  The application
    of a dynamic control plane, e.g. for\nauto-discovery or for the distribtion of
    interface parameters, is\ncomplementary.  Anyway, this work is not in conflict
    with WSON but\nleverages and supports related work already done for management
    plane\nand control plane.\n\nFurthermore, support for Fast Fault Detection, to
    e.g. trigger\nProtection Switching is provided by the WDM interface capability
    of\nthe client interface (e.g.  ITU-T G.709) is out of scope for this\nwork.  Additionally
    the wavelength ordering process and the process\nhow to determine the demand for
    a new wavelength from A to Z is out\nof scope.\n\t "

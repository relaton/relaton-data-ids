  content: "Sigtran specifies association-level reliable transport for signaling \nusing
    SCTP, but in some scenarios a single association failure's \nreliability mechanism
    is not sufficient to achieve telco reliability. \nThis document specifies procedures
    for an SCTP association changeover \nsolution which will enable applications to
    meet a higher degree of \navailability. Two generic changeover solutions are presented
    in this \ndocument. One is implemented inside the SCTP protocol stack and the
    \nother requires SCTP and ULP to work in collaboration.\n\t "

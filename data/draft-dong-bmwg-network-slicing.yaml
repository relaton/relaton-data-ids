  content: "   Network slicing aims to provide assurance of specific network\n   performance
    objectives for network services which require both\n   connectivity and specific
    performance commitment.  Such network\n   services are considered as network slice
    services.  This document\n   provides a benchmarking methodology for network slicing,
    focusing on\n   evaluating the key functionalities of network slicing mechanisms
    and\n   the performance of network slice services.  The network slicing\n   functionalities
    includes the data plane, control plane and management\n   plane mechanisms for
    realizing network slice service, and the\n   performance of network slice service
    includes the service level\n   agreement (SLA) commitments (bandwidth, delay,
    and jitter), path\n   constraints and resource guarantee.\n\n   The tests aim
    to demonstrate how network slicing can support\n   competing services in a shared
    network, ensuring that critical\n   network services in one network slice remain
    unaffected by congestion\n   or unexpected behavior of other traffic in the same
    network.\n\n\n\t "

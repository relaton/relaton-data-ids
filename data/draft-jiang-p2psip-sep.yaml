  content: "This document describes the Service Extensible Protocol (SEP), which\n
    \  is the peer protocol spoken between P2PSIP Overlay peers to share\n   information
    and organize the P2PSIP Overlay Network.  SEP uses a\n   flexible forwarding mechanism
    to avoid congestion in the Overlay.  It\n   also proposes a general service discovery
    method and a built-in NATtraversal mechanism.  By using these methods, SEP tries
    to improve\n   the success rate and reduce the latency of the transaction.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   IEEE-754 NaN formations are not numbers and have no equivalence\n   class.
    \ They are not comparable to anything, including reflexively,\n   and therefore
    each attribute - sign bit, signaling/quiet bit, payload\n   bits, and representation
    width (binary16, binary32, binary64) - can\n   carry meaning for an implementation.
    \ CBOR permits encoding NaNs as\n   floating-point values, but generic processing,
    preferred\n   serialization, and deterministic profiles may canonicalize or\n
    \  otherwise alter NaN encodings, losing information.  This document\n   defines
    a CBOR tag, colloquially \"nan-bstr\", whose content is a byte\n   string carrying
    the exact IEEE-754 NaN bit pattern so that all\n   attributes are preserved across
    encode/decode, enabling use cases\n   like NaN boxing, platform-specific error
    signaling, diagnostics, and\n   forensics.\n\n\t "

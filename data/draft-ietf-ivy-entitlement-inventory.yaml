  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a YANG module for incorporating entitlements\n
    \  in a network inventory, encompassing both virtual and physical\n   network
    elements.  Entitlements define the rights for their holder to\n   use specific
    capabilities in a network element(s).  The model is\n   rooted by the concept
    of the capabilities offered by an element,\n   enabled by the held entitlements,
    and considers entitlement scope,\n   how they are assigned, and when they expire.
    \ The model introduces a\n   descriptive definition of capabilities and the entitlement
    use\n   restrictions, supporting entitlement administration and the\n   understanding
    of the capabilities available through the network.\n\n\t "

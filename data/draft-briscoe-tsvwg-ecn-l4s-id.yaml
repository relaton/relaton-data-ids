  content: "   This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP packets\n
    \  for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable\n   throughput
    (L4S).  It is similar to the original (or 'Classic')\n   Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN).  'Classic' ECN marking was\n   required to be equivalent to a drop, both
    when applied in the network\n   and when responded to by a transport.  Unlike
    'Classic' ECN marking,\n   for packets carrying the L4S identifier, the network
    applies marking\n   more immediately and more aggressively than drop, and the
    transport\n   response to each mark is reduced and smoothed relative to that for\n
    \  drop.  The two changes counterbalance each other so that the\n   throughput
    of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a 'Classic'\n   flow under the same
    conditions.  However, the much more frequent\n   control signals and the finer
    responses to them result in ultra-low\n   queuing delay without compromising link
    utilization, even during high\n   load.  Examples of new active queue management
    (AQM) marking\n   algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like
    or real-\n   time) are specified separately.  The new L4S identifier is the key\n
    \  piece that enables them to interwork and distinguishes them from\n   'Classic'
    traffic.  It gives an incremental migration path so that\n   existing 'Classic'
    TCP traffic will be no worse off, but it can be\n   prevented from degrading the
    ultra-low delay and loss of the new\n   scalable transports.\n\n\t "

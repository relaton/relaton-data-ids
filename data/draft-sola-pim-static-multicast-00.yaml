  content: "   The Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is\n   currently
    defined as an intra-domain multicast protocol. Although in\n   PIM-SM more than
    one Candidate Rendezvous Point (C-RP) may exist,\n   only one can be active at
    a given time, and this will be the one to\n   which receivers will send Join messages
    or sources will send Register\n   messages.  The method used in PIM-SM to make
    public the set of C-RPs\n   for a multicast group is to flood all over the domain
    packets with\n   the list of C-RPs using the so-called Bootstrap method.  This\n
    \  approach may scale in domains with few routers but does not scale if\n   the
    protocol would have to be applied to provide multicast throughout\n   the whole
    internet.\n \n   In this draft we specify the modifications needed in PIM-SM in
    order\n   to support more than one active RP simultaneously, and also show how\n
    \  Static Multicast can be used to make public in an scalable way the\n   information
    regarding RPs as well as the IP multicast address for the\n   multicast group.
    \ In the presence of more than one source, having\n   more than one RP and placing
    them according to sources and receivers'\n   distribution on the internet will
    reduce the average number of hops\n   from sources to receivers, and will also
    improve the multicast\n   protocol's fault tolerance.\n\n\t "

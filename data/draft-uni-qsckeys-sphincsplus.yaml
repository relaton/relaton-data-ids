  script: Latn
  content: "   This proposal defines key management approaches for the Quantum Safe\n
    \  Cryptographic (QSC) algorithm SPHINCS+ (or SPHINCS-PLUS) which has\n   been
    selected for standardization by the NIST Post Quantum\n   Cryptography (PQC) process.
    \ This includes key identification and key\n   serialization.  The purpose is
    to provide guidance such that the\n   adoption of quantum safe algorithms is not
    hampered with the\n   fragmented evolution of necessary key management standards.
    \ Early\n   definition of key material standards will help expedite the adoption\n
    \  of new quantum safe algorithms at the same time as improving\n   interoperability
    between implementations and minimizing divergence\n   across standards.\n\n\t "

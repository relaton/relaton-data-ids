  content: "   Creation and verification of Mesh Notarized Signatures is described
    .\n   A notarized signature is a signature whose time of creation is\n   attested
    by one or more parties in addition to the signer.  In the\n   case of Mesh Notarized
    Signatures, the attesting parties is the set\n   of all parties participating
    in a Notarization Mesh.  This ideally\n   includes the relying parties.\n\n   Each
    participant in a Notarization Mesh maintains their own notary\n   log in the form
    of a DARE sequence authenticated by a Merkle tree.\n   Participants periodically
    cross notarize their personal notary log\n   with those maintained by other parties.
    \ A Mesh Notarized Signature\n   is bound in time as having being created after
    time T1 by including\n   one or more sequence apex values as signed attributes.
    \ A Mesh\n   Notarized Signature is bound in time as having being created before\n
    \  time T2 by enrolling it in the signer's personal notarization log and\n   engaging
    in cross-notarization with a sufficient number of\n   Notarization Mesh participants
    to establish the desired proof.\n\n   Defection is controlled through an accountability
    model.  If a\n   trusted notary produces multiple inconsistent signed cross\n
    \  Notarization tokens, this provides non-repudiable evidence of a\n   default.\n\n
    \  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/mathmesh/\n   (http://whatever)Discussion
    of this draft should take place on the\n   MathMesh mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org),
    which is archived at .\n\n\t "

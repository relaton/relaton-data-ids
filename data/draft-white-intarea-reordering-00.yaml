abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Several link technology standards mandate that equipment guarantee\n
    \  in-order delivery of layer 2 frames, apparently due to a belief that\n   this
    is required by higher layer protocols.  In addition, certain\n   link types can
    introduce out-of-order arrivals at the end of the\n   layer 2 link, which the
    receiving equipment is required to rectify by\n   delaying higher sequenced frames
    until all lower sequenced frames can\n   be delivered or are deemed lost.  The
    delaying of higher sequenced\n   frames is generally done without any knowledge
    of the higher layer\n   protocols in use, let alone any knowledge of higher layer
    protocol\n   contexts (e.g. TCP connections) in the case that the layer 2 link
    is\n   carrying a multiplex of such contexts.  It could, for example, be the\n
    \  case that all of the higher sequenced frames being delayed are\n   carrying
    packets for different layer 4 contexts than a single lower-\n   sequenced frame
    that triggered the delay.  The result is that this\n   \"re-sequencing\" operation
    can introduce delays that result in\n   degradation of performance rather than
    improving it.  Moreover,\n   modern, performant TCP and QUIC implementations support
    features that\n   significantly improve their tolerance to out-of-order delivery.\n\n
    \  This draft is intended to promote an analysis and discussion of the\n   sensitivity
    of modern protocols to out-of-order delivery, and to\n   potentially develop new
    guidance to layer 2 technology standards\n   regarding the need to assure in-order
    delivery.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes a passive measurement method for one-way end-to-\nend
    quality.  This method reports both whether a flow of packets is\nin-sequence or
    not and error types on detecting out-of-sequence.  The\nmethod consumes small
    resource therefore it can be adapted to many\nprotocols that have sequence number
    field.\n\t "

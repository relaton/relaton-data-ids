  content: "   HTTP resources from one origin often have relationships to resources\n
    \  on other origins.  This document outlines how a \"preconnectHint\"\n   SvcParamKey
    for SVCB, could be used to provide an early indication of\n   origins that are
    related to the current origin.  Clients could use\n   this information to opportunistically
    prepare and open connections,\n   with the expectation that they will be used
    to fetch related\n   resources.  This mechanism provides information from a source
    that is\n   not the authenticated origin, which could cause the client to perform\n
    \  actions that no other party would ask them to do; privacy\n   considerations
    due to this are visited.\n\n\t "

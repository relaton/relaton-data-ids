  content: "This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an
    authentication framework which supports multiple authentication methods.  EAP
    typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol
    (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate
    elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.
    \ Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods
    may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.  A summary of the changes
    between this document and RFC 2284 is available in Appendix A. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

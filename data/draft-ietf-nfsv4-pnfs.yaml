  content: "   This Internet-Draft provides a description of the pNFS extension for\n
    \  NFSv4.\n\n   The key feature of the protocol extension is the ability for clients\n
    \  to perform read and write operations that go directly from the client\n   to
    individual storage system elements without funneling all such\n   accesses through
    a single file server.  Of course, the file server\n   must provide sufficient
    coordination of the client I/O so that the\n   file system retains its integrity.\n\n
    \  The extension adds operations that query and manage layout\n   information
    that allows parallel I/O between clients and storage\n   system elements.  The
    layouts are managed in a similar way to\n   delegations in that they are associated
    with leases and can be\n   recalled by the server, but layout information is independent
    of\n   delegations.\n\t "

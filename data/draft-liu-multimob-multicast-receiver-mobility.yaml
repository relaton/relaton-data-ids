  content: "This document proposes the architecture and solution options for \nmulticast
    receiver mobility.  The discussions are restricted only to \nthe receiver mobility
    with the assumption that the multicast source \nand network are stationary while
    the receiver is in the moving state.  \nThe suggestions are given on how to integrate
    mobile IP and fixed \nmulticast protocols to provide the feasible solutions, which
    \ninvolves the aspects of mobile receiver registration, group \nmembership management,
    tunnel or optimal multicast routing, and \nhandover optimization. \n\nConventions
    used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [RFC2119].\n\t "

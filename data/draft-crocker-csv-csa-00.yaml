  content: "   Internet operation has typically required no public mechanism for\n
    \  announcing restriction or permission of particular hosts to operate\n   clients
    or servers for particular services on behalf of particular\n   domains.  What
    is missing is an open, interoperable means by which a\n   trusted agency can announce
    authorization for a host to operate a\n   service.  The current specification
    supports this capability for\n   sending SMTP clients.  Specifically, is a sending
    SMTP client\n   permitted to act as a client MTA?  Has a separate authority given
    it\n   permission to perform this service?  Client SMTP Authorization (CSA)\n
    \  specifies a DNS-based record that states whether an associated host\n   has
    permission to operate as a client MTA.\n\t "

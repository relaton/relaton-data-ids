  content: "This document requests a DSCP from the IANA for a class of real-time\n
    \  traffic conforming to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior and\n   admitted
    using a CAC procedure involving authentication,\n   authorization, and capacity
    admission, as compared to a class of\n   real-time traffic conforming to the Expedited
    Forwarding Per Hop\n   Behavior but not subject to capacity admission or subject
    to very\n\n   coarse capacity admission.\n\n   One of the reasons behind this
    is the need for classes of traffic\n   that are handled under special policies,
    such as the non-preemptive\n   Emergency Telecommunication Service, the US DoD's
    Assured Service\n   (which is similar to MLPP), or e-911.  These do not need separate\n
    \  DSCPs or separate PHBs that are separate from each other, but they\n   need
    a traffic class from which they can deterministically obtain\n   their service
    requirements from including SLA matters.\n\t "

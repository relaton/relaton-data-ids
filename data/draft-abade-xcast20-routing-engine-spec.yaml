  content: "XCAST6 (Explicit Multiunicast on IPv6) is a new protocol defined in\nRFC
    5058. In XCAST, the list of destinations is explicitly encoded\nwithin the data
    packets instead of using a multicast group address.\nResearch is currently ongoing
    on two versions of XCAST6 and this\ndocument describes the design and implementation
    of a routing engine\nfor the new version in which the use of hop-by-hop options
    header has\nbeen eliminated. This draft explains why there is a need for an\nXCAST6
    routing engine, highlights the requirements for its\nimplementation, the design
    process and how to eventually implement\nthe routing engine to allow for deployment
    of XCAST6 protocol.\n\nConventions used in this document\n\n\nThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL\nNOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\nthis document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC-2119\n[RFC2119].\n\t "

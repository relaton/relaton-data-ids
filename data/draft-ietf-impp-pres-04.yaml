  content: "At the time this document was written, numerous presence protocols were
    in use (largely as components of commercial instant messaging services), and little
    interoperability between services based on these protocols has been achieved.
    \ This specification defines common semantics and data formats for presence to
    facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

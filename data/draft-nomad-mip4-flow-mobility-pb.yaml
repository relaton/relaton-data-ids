  content: "Internet capable mobile or portable devices are already a modern \ncommodity
    while it is becoming all the more common that such devices are \nhosts to more
    then one wireless interface. The aim of this document is \nto show that a mobile
    user may make best use of this property by using \nmultiple wireless interfaces
    in parallel. This would incline that the \nmobile user can distribute active flows
    across the available wireless \ninterfaces and is able to seamlessly transfer
    them between the wireless \ninterfaces in mid-session without interruption. \n

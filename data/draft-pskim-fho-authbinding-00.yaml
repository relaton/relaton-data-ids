  script: Latn
  content: "\n   In Mobile IPv6 based IEEE 802.16e wireless networks, to reduce \n
    \  authorizing binding latency, the return routability procedure and \n   the
    binding update & acknowledgement procedure are defined newly \n   with parameters
    specified by information on candidate networks where\n   the mobile node can be
    attached newly, and cryptographic functions\n   of authentication and encryption
    are also defined newly. The care-of \n   address configuration and the authorizing
    binding are performed \n   before actual handover for candidate networks where
    the mobile node \n   can be attached newly. Therefore, the proposed mechanism
    can make \n   fast authorizing binding, which can reduce binding latency between
    \n   two nodes and thus enhance throughput degradation caused by the \n   bidirectional
    tunneling. \n        \n\n\t "

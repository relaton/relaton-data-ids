  content: "This document describes a simple, incremental, autonomous system \n\n
    (AS)-based inter-domain routing architecture to solve the scalability \n\n problems
    of the Internet, by separation of Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) \n\n for identifying
    endpoints and Routing Identifiers (RIDs) for locating \n\n endpoints in the Internet.
    The proposed architecture uses AS numbers \n\n as RIDs so that global routing
    tables can grow only with of AS \n\n numbers, thus avoiding the rapid growth driven
    by constantly \n\n increasing IP prefixes. \n\n\n This proposal was stimulated
    by the problem statement effort at the \n\n Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing
    Workshop in October 2006.\n\t "

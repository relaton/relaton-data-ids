  content: "\n  Networks in the home and similar environments typically do not\n  have,
    and should not be expected to have a full range of network\n  services such as
    DHCP servers, DNS and the like.  Further,\n  networks in the home and similar
    environments may have only\n  occasional connectivity to a larger network such
    as the Internet\n  where these types of services may exist.  Typical users of\n
    \ home networks may not have the skills or desire to install,\n  configure, administer
    and maintain a sophisticated home network.\n \n  To enable the effective use of
    networks in the home and similar\n  environments, methods for discovering devices
    and services in\n  the network are needed.  These methods need to work for\n  occasionally
    connected and often resource-poor networks such as\n  are typically found in the
    home.  These methods also need to\n  be self-configuring, requiring only minimal
    involvement of users\n  of a home or similar network to configure and maintain
    that\n  network.\n \n  This document presents requirements for the discovery of
    devices\n  and services in a home network or similar environment.  These\n  requirements
    are intended to form a basis that enables further\n  work toward solutions in
    this area.\n\n\t "

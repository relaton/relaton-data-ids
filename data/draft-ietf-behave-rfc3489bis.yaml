  content: "Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as
    a tool for other protocols in dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.
    It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to
    it by a NAT. It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints,
    and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing
    NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.\n\n STUN is not a NAT
    traversal solution by itself. Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of
    a NAT traversal solution. This is an important change from the previous version
    of this specification (RFC 3489), which presented STUN as a complete solution.\n\n
    This document obsoletes RFC 3489. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "This draft discusses the different requirements that mapping to\nsupport
    mobility has versus mapping to support routing scalability.\nIn mobility solutions,
    packets are forwarded to the location where\nmapping information is stored so
    that they can be encapsulated to the\nfinal destination.  In routing scalability
    solutions, mapping\ninformation needs to be available at packet entry points to
    the\nnetwork.  Attempts to use one mapping system for both purposes can\nlead
    to high overhead in either mapping information distribution or\notherwise mapping
    information discovery, as well as stale mapping\ninformation being used for data
    forwarding.\n\t "

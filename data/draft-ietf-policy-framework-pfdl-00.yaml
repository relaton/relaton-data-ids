  content: "Recently, the IETF has developed protocols that classify packets in\norder
    to treat certain classes or flows of packets in a particular\nway compared to
    other classes or flows of packets. The successful\nwide-scale deployment of these
    protocols depends on the ability to\nadminister and distribute consistent policy
    information to different\ntypes of network devices as well as hosts and servers
    that participate\nin policy decision making, administration, distribution and
    control.\nThere is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policy\nadministration
    and distribution that will enable interoperability\namong multiple devices and
    device types that must work together to\nachieve a consistent implementation of
    policy.\nThis document defines a language, called the Policy Framework\nDefinition
    Language (PFDL), that maps requirements for services to be\nprovided by the network
    as defined in a business specification (e.g.,\nan SLA) to a common vendor- and
    device-independent intermediate form.\nThis enables policy information and specifications
    to be shared among\nthe heterogeneous components that comprise the policy framework,
    and\nallows multiple vendors to use multiple devices to implement that\nframework.
    The PFDL is the common 'currency' that is exchanged between\nthese heterogeneous
    components to enable them all to perform their\nfunction in providing, securing,
    distributing, and administering\npolicy. The PFDL becomes the way to ensure that
    multiple vendors\ninterpret the policy the same way while enabling vendors to
    provide\nvalue-added services.\n\n\t "

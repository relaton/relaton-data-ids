  content: " This document describes IP-LOC, a proposed extension which suggests\nadding
    GPS coordinates to IPv6 header. \n\nThe current method of determining location
    of IP traffic is through\nIP address registration database, which is not very
    accurate as it\ndepends on how the ISP registers its IP subnets, that is normally\ndone
    in a country/city format.\n\nIt also assumes that in the future, GPS capability
    will be added to\nthe router itself (just like smart phones) and packet marking
    and\nclassification based on geo-location will be required.\n\nQoS, firewall and
    routing based on geo-location will be highly\nrequired when mobile routers move
    from one geo-location to another\nwhich has different policy.\n\n\t "

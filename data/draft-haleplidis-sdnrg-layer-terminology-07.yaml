- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can be defined as a new approach\n
    \  for network programmability.  Network programmability in this context\n   refers
    to the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage\n   network behavior
    dynamically via open interfaces as opposed to\n   relying on closed-box solutions
    and their associated proprietary\n   interfaces.  SDN emphasizes the role of software
    in running networks\n   through the introduction of an abstraction for the data
    forwarding\n   plane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane.  This\n
    \  separation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as\n   experience
    has already shown.  However, there is increasing confusion\n   as to what exactly
    SDN is, what is the layer structure in an SDN\n   architecture and how do layers
    interface with each other.  This\n   document aims to answer these questions and
    provide a concise\n   reference document for SDNRG, in particular, and the SDN
    community,\n   in general, based on relevant peer-reviewed literature and documents\n
    \  in the RFC series.\n\n\t "

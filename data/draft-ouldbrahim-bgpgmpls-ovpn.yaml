  content: "Consider a service provider network that offers Optical/TDM \nVirtual
    Private Network service. An important goal of such \nservice is the ability to
    support what is known as 'single end \nprovisioning', where addition of a new
    port to a given \nOptical/TDM VPN would involve configuration changes only on
    the \ndevices connected to that port. Another important goal in the \nOptical/TDM
    VPN service is the ability to establish/terminate \nan optical connection between
    a pair of (existing) ports within \nan Optical/TDM VPN without involving configuration
    changes in \nany of the provider devices.\n\t "

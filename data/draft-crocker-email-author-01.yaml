  content: "   Internet mail defines the From: field to indicate the author of the\n
    \  message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who initially\n   handled
    the message, on the author's behalf.  The Sender: field is\n   optional, if it
    has the same information as the From: field.  That\n   is, when the Sender: field
    is absent, the From: field has conflated\n   semantics, as both a handling identifier
    and a content creator\n   identifier.  This was not a problem, until development
    of stringent\n   protections on use of the From: field.  It has prompted Mediators,\n
    \  such as mailing lists, to modify the From: field, to circumvent mail\n   rejection
    caused by those protections.\n\n   This affects end-to-end behavior of email,
    between the author and the\n   final recipients, because mail from the same author
    is not treated\n   the same, depending on what path it followed.  In effect, the
    From:\n   field has become dominated by its role as a handling identifier.  The\n
    \  current specification augments the altered use of the From: field, by\n   specifying
    the Author: field, which identifies the original author of\n   the message and
    is not subject to modification by Mediators.\n\n\t "

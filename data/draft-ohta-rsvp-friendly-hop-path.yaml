  content: "QoS routing needs some stabilization mechanism to prevent a delayed negative
    feedback on the link QoS information by the routed traffic.       So far, route
    pinning was the only known way of the stabilization.         But, as RSVP merges
    multiple RESV messages to create a new one, pinned route computed elsewhere for
    different QoS requirement is not useful after the merge.                                                                 That
    is, we need a sticky hop-by-hop QoS routing algorithm.                Path QoS
    Collection is such an algorithm to collect true upstream link QoS in PATH messages
    to correct the link QoS information distributed by QoS routing protocols.\n\t "

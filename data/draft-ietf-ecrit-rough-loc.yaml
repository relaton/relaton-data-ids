  content: "   Emergency calling works best when precise location is available for\n
    \  emergency call routing.  However, there are situations in which a\n   location
    provider is unable or unwilling to provide precise location,\n   yet still wishes
    to enable subscribers to make emergency calls.  This\n   document describes the
    level of location accuracy that providers must\n   provide to enable emergency
    call routing.  In addition, we describe\n   additional rules for networks and
    endpoints to enable emergency\n   calling by endpoints that do not have access
    to precise location.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A bulk report submission endpoint and format are described for the\n
    \  Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP).  This provides modest, but\n   meaningful,
    efficiency benefits over the core protocol for cases\n   where an intermediary
    is able to collect large numbers of reports.\n\n\t "

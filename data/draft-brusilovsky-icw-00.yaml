  content: "   The purpose of this Internet Draft is  to  start  discussion  on  the\n
    \  issues  involved  in  Internet Call Waiting Service (ICW), as part of\n   interconnecting
    IP and Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN)  with\n   the  intent  of providing
    ICW service that is much needed by numerous\n   dial-up Internet users.  Interworking
    of the  IP  network  and  GSTN,\n   based  on  open well-defined protocols, will
    promote interoperability\n   of both the networks and systems built by different
    \ vendors.    This\n   Internet   Draft   is   submitted   with  the  goal  of
    \ becoming  an\n   informational RFC. \n\n  The rest of this document is as follows:\n
    \n   Section  2  briefly  describes  the  services  offered  to  the   end\n   Subscriber.
    It is the support of these services that necessitates the\n   proposed internetworking
    project. \n  \n   Section  3 describes the scope of the proposed project by introducing\n
    \  its  overall  architecture,  identifying   the   interfaces   to   be\n   standardized,
    describing experience with SIP for ICW. \n  \n   Sections  4,  5,  and 6 respectively
    address security considerations,\n   supply references, and provide the authors
    address,  as  required  by\n   [1]. \n  \n   Section  7  acknowledges  individuals
    \ providing  assistance  in  the\n   creation of this document. \n  \n   Section
    8 is the Appendix, which contains IN Tutorial and Figure A.\n  \n\n\t "

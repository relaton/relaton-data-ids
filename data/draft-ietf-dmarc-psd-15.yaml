abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC),
    defined in RFC 7489, permits a domain-controlling organization to express domain-level
    policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, which
    a mail-receiving organization can use to improve mail handling. DMARC distinguishes
    the portion of a name that is a Public Suffix Domain (PSD), below which Organizational
    Domain names are created. The basic DMARC capability allows Organizational Domains
    to specify policies that apply to their subdomains, but it does not give that
    capability to PSDs. This document describes an extension to DMARC to fully enable
    DMARC functionality for PSDs. Some implementations of DMARC consider a PSD to
    be ineligible for DMARC enforcement. This specification addresses that case.</p>"

  content: "   This memo defines Global Postion/Encryption Protocol (GP/EP), a\n   proposal
    for a universal wireless computer network. Global position\n   is defined as region
    in space-time. The network routes data to a\n   global position using routing
    information provided as part of the\n   protocol data and proposes use of encryption
    algorithms to prevent\n   unauthorised  access.\n \n   This protocol is proposed
    as an alternative for IP, the Internet\n   Protocol. The memo also describes how
    a network can work with no real\n   network address other than its global position
    in the universe.\n\n\t "

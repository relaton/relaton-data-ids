abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   End-to-end applications have difficulty distinguishing between\n   packets
    that have been passed through a Network Address Translator\n   (NAT) and packets
    that have been passed along a clear end-to-end\n   path.  We propose mechanisms
    for IPv4 and IPv6 whereby NAT devices\n   explicitly signal their operation as
    a means of allowing applications\n   to distinguish the presence of otherwise
    undetected NATs in the end-\n   to-end path.\n\n\t "

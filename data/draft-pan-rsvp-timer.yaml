  content: "The current resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) design has\n   no reliability
    mechanism for the delivery of control messages.\n   Instead, RSVP relies on periodic
    refresh between routers to\n   maintain reservation states.  This approach has
    several problems\n   in a congested network.  End systems send Path and Resv messages\n
    \  to set up RSVP connections.  If the first Path or Resv message\n   from an
    end system is accidentally lost in the network, a copy of\n   the message will
    not be retransmitted until the end of a refresh\n   interval, causing a delay
    of 30 seconds or more until a reservation\n   is established.  If a congested
    link causes a tear-down message\n   (PathTear or ResvTear) to be dropped, the
    corresponding reservation\n   will not be removed from the routers until the RSVP
    cleanup timer\n   expires.\n\t "

  content: "The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and\nMultipoint-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Paths (\"MP LSPs\") contains a\nfield that identifies the address
    of a \"root node\".  Intermediate\nnodes are expected to be able to look up that
    address in their\nrouting tables.  However, if the route to the root node is a
    BGP\nroute, and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core, this\nis not
    possible.  This document specifies procedures which enable a\nMP LSP to be constructed
    through a BGP-free core.  In these\nprocedures, the root node address is temporarily
    replaced by an\naddress which is known to the intermediate nodes.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A BoF, identified as RFC++ and focused on possible changes to the\n
    \  identification of a broad range of documents and sources with the\n   term
    \"RFC\", has been scheduled for IETF 102 and extensively discussed\n   on an associated
    mailing list.  At least based on the BoF proposal,\n   the BoF was expected to
    accept a particular problem description as\n   both adequate and sufficiently
    important to justify changes and then\n   to consider one particular proposal.
    \ Mailing list discussions have\n   indicated that neither the problem statement
    nor the proposal are\n   without controversy.  An Internet Draft has been posted
    that\n   describes that particular proposal in more detail.  Without\n   significant
    analysis of the problem statement, this draft mentions\n   that proposal as a
    possible member of a family of similar proposals\n   and then outlines some other
    families of proposals for the\n   convenience of BoF participants and the community
    more generally.\n\n\t "

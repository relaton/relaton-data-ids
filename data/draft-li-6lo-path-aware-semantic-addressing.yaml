  content: "   This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Path-Aware\n
    \  Semantic Addressing (PASA) that enables IP packet stateless\n   forwarding.\n
    \  No routing table needs to be built, rather, the forwarding decision\n   is
    based solely on the destination address structure.  This document\n   focuses
    on carrying IP packets across an LLN (Low power and Lossy\n   Network), in which
    the topology is static, the location of the nodes\n   is fixed, and the connection
    between the nodes is also rather stable.\n   This specifications describes the
    PASA architecture, along with PASA\n   address allocation, forwarding mechanism,
    header format design,\n   including length-variable fields, and IPv6 interconnection
    support.\n\n\t "

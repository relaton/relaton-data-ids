  content: "This document proposes an extension to the Mobile IP base protocol\n(RFC
    2002) to allow Mobile Nodes (Hosts) and Mobility Agents (both\nhome network and
    foreign network) to use X.509 digital certificates,\npublic keys and digital signatures
    as the basis of authenticating\nMobile IP control messages in addition to secret
    key authentication.\nThe use of these mechanisms will allow Mobile IP to scale
    from small\nresearch environments to potentially millions of mobile nodes across\nthousands
    of networks owned-operated by different organizations and\nservice providers.
    \ A Public Key Infrastructure is proposed that\nfocuses specifically on authentication
    of Mobile IP knowledgeable\nnodes, NOT general use for authenticating individuals.\n\t "

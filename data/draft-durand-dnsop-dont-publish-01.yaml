- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document aims at restarting the discussion on what a site\n   network
    administrator should publish in the global DNS and what they\n   should not.  The
    latest attempt was documented in a previous draft\n   [4] was was ultimately an
    unsuccessful effort to clarify what to do\n   with IPv4 private addresses RFC1918
    [1] in the DNS.  Since then, a\n   number of similar issues coming from the IPv6
    world have arisen and\n   there is a sense that the situation needs to be clarified
    by a BCP\n   document.\n\t "

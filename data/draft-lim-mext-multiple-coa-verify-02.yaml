abstract:
- content: "<p>Using multiple care-of address registration, there is a possibility
    that a malicious mobile node could create multiple care-of address bindings that
    does not belong to the mobile node at its home agent. The home agent would accept
    these bindings without verifying them due to the trust relationship it has with
    the mobile node. With these bindings, the mobile node can launch attacks by asking
    the home agent to flood the victims of these care-of addresses with useless packets.
    To mitigate such a problem, this memo introduces a few possible verification mechanisms
    that the home agent would use in order to verify the care-of addresses for the
    mobile node before using them for packet routing.</p>"

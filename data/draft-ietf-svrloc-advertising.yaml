  content: "   This document proposes a solution to the problem of finding\n   information
    about that services are being offered at a particular\n   Internet domain, based
    on deployment experience with the Netfind\n   White Pages directory software.\n
    \n   This approach makes it possible to supply clients with more\n   information
    than the DNS aliases that have been widely deployed in\n   this role - notably
    the port numbers being used by servers.  However,\n   it is not without problems,
    and we have tried to take account of\n   these.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [3] was used to announce\n   information
    for all available multicast sessions to the prospective\n   receiver in an experimental
    network.  It is usefull and easy to use,\n   but difficult to control the SAP
    message transmission in a wide area\n   network.  This document describes the
    several major limitations SAP\n   has and the requirement of multicast session
    announcement in the\n   global Internet.\n\t "

  content: "The DHCP protocol [RFC 2131] [1] allows multiple DHCP servers.  A\n   recent
    draft, the DHCP Failover Protocol [3], has been distributed\n   which is designed
    to provide a redundant DHCP solution.  While\n   clearly a work in progress, it
    is equally clear that it can be made\n   to work and meet the goals that the authors
    have set for it.  One of\n   the goals of the Failover protocol is that it should
    avoid duplicate\n   IP address allocations, except under some rare circumstances.
    \ While\n   this approach may be quite reasonable in a wide variety of environ-\n
    \  ments, some environments require a DHCP redundancy solution which can\n   (optionally)
    ensure that no possibility of duplicate IP address allo-\n   cation exists.\n
    \n   The Safe Failover protocol is designed to build on top of the\n   Failover
    protocol, and add to it certain protocol exchanges, prac-\n   tices and algorithms
    which will create a DHCP redundancy solution\n   which avoids duplicate IP address
    allocation.\n\t "

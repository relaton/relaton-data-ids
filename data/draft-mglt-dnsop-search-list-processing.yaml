  content: "   Domain Names can be Qualified or Unqualified Domain Names.  Qualified\n
    \  Domain Names are resolved over the public DNS infrastructure, whereas\n   Unqualified
    Domain Names are resolved using search lists.  How search\n   lists are generated
    and interpreted varies from one application to\n   another and from one operating
    system to another.  This makes\n   Unqualified Domain Name resolution unpredictable,
    non deterministic,\n   and as such neither reliable nor stable.\n\n   In addition,
    there is neither clear rules to define whether a name is\n   a Qualified or an
    Unqualified Domain Name.  This also contributes in\n   making the naming resolution
    unreliable, as the resolution of a given\n   name can result in different responses.\n\n
    \  As a consequence, most resolution systems currently end with a \"try\n   and
    error\" strategy.  More specifically, according to some system\n   dependent heuristics,
    a resolver initiates an Unqualified (resp.\n   Qualified) Domain Name resolution,
    and, in case of a NXDOMAIN\n   response, fails back in a Qualified (resp. Unqualified)
    Domain Name\n   resolution.  Such strategies were acceptable as the probability
    of\n   collision between domains within search list and those published in\n   the
    public DNS infrastructure remains low.  In the context of the\n   generalization
    of Top Level Domain, this assumption is not acceptable\n   anymore, resulting
    in an unreliable and unstable naming resolution.\n\n   This document describes
    how search list should be generated and\n   interpreted.  Then, it describes how
    resolvers distinguish between\n   Qualified and Unqualified Domain Names as well
    as how to resolve\n   them.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Multipath Traffic Engineering (MPTE) combines two approaches to\n   traffic
    management: equal-cost multipath and constraint-based traffic\n   engineering,
    offering a powerful new way to engineer networks.  To\n   avail of this, a node
    (possibly an ingress of a MPTE tunnel, or a\n   path computation agent) must have
    information about the topology,\n   link and node characteristics of a network
    so that it can compute the\n   components of the MPTE tunnel.  One important (node)
    characteristic\n   is whether a given node supports MPTE, i.e., whether it can\n
    \  participate in the provisioning and maintenance of the tunnel.\n\n   This memo
    shows how this information can be distributed in the IGP\n   via Link State Routing
    TE Capabilities.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture\n
    \  called TURN-Lite which could simplify the data communication process\n   between
    two hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant\n   [RFC4787] [RFC5382]
    NAT devices.  The key mechanism in TURN-Lite is\n   the newly defined \"Couple\"
    operation (using STUN [RFC5389] message\n   format) which allows the TURN-Lite
    servers to be easily incorporated\n   into existing CGN devices/CDN nodes which
    are already deployed within\n   the network in a distributed manner.\n\n\t "

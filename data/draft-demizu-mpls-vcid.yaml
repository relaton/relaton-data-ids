  content: "   Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse and\n   integrate
    the cost-performance and QoS assurance of Layer 2 devices\n   and the flexibility
    and functionality of Layer 3 protocols.\n \n   Some of these proposals assume
    that Label Switching Routers (LSRs)\n   are placed in a homogeneous LSR cloud
    in a campus area network or a\n   backbone network, and they are connected directly
    to each other.\n   However, this assumption sometimes does not hold true in the
    real\n   situation.  For example, some campuses will be connected via ATM SVC\n
    \  service, and LSR networks will be constructed hierarchically.\n \n   To deal
    with Virtual Connections (VCs) in these environments, this\n   document proposes
    to identify a VC with a VCID instead of a label.\n\t "

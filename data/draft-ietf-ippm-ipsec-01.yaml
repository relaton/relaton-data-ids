  content: "   IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable\n   implementations.
    \ Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly\n   gaining popularity in several
    deployment scenarios, not the least in\n   what used to be solely areas of traditional
    telecommunication\n   protocols.  Wider IPsec deployment calls for mechanisms
    and methods\n   that enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure
    one-\n   way and two-way network performance in a standardized manner.\n   Unfortunately,
    however, standard IP performance measurement security\n   mechanisms cannot be
    readily used with IPsec.  This document makes\n   the case for employing IPsec
    to protect the One-way and Two-Way\n   Active Measurement Protocols (O/TWAMP)
    and proposes a method which\n   combines IKEv2 and O/TWAMP as defined in RFC 4656
    and RFC 5357,\n   respectively.  This specification aims, on the one hand, to
    ensure\n   that O/TWAMP can be secured with the best mechanisms we have at our\n
    \  disposal today while, on the other hand, it facilitates the\n   applicability
    of O/TWAMP to networks that have already deployed\n   IPsec.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes the use of IPSec [KeAt98a-c] for secure access to\nprotected
    networks by authorized users connected to the Internet.  An\nexample target scenario
    is a corporate employee on the road accessing\nresources on his company's Intranet.
    It addresses firewall traversal,\nuser authentication, data confidentiality and
    the use of private\naddress spaces (the latter impacts routing and name lookups).
    \ A\ncomparison to other mechanisms such as those based on Layer-2\ntunneling
    or session layer security, is also included.\n \n   This memo draws upon several
    ideas from [Dora97,Mosk98] and would not\n   have been possible without the contributions
    of the IETF working\n   groups on IP Security (IPSec) and Network Address Translation
    (NAT).\n\t "

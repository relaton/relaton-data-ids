  content: "   This document proposes a new approach for the Designated\n   Forwarder
    (DF) selection algorithm. This is besides the existing\n   algorithm types discussed
    in RFC7432 and RFC8584.\n   A DF is a PE part of an Ethernet-Segment, forwarding
    BUM traffic\n   to multi-homed hosts. This document discusses methods to achieve\n
    \  efficient service carving in Evpn Multi-homed networks by\n   extending the
    DF selection algorithm type in RFC7432 by\n   suggesting a new approach for service
    carving.\n\n\n\t "

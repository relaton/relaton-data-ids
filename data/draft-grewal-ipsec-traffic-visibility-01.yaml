  content: "This document describes an ESP encapsulation for IPsec, allowing\n   intermediate
    devices to ascertain if ESP-NULL is being employed and\n   hence inspect the IPsec
    packets for network monitoring and access\n   control functions.  Currently in
    the IPsec standard, there is no way\n   to differentiate between ESP encryption
    and ESP NULL encryption by\n   simply examining a packet.\n\t "

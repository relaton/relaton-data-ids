  content: "   Anecdotally, every IESG complains about the Area Director (AD)\n   workload,
    and says that it takes the first full term to understand\n   the job.  Empirically,
    the AD workload is high sometimes causing\n   backlogs in processing of Internet-Drafts
    and stressing the ADs.\n\n   Empirically, the AD workload is high sometimes causing
    backlogs in\n   processing of Internet-Drafts and stressing the ADs.  This is\n
    \  evidenced by the limits applied to the number of pages on the regular\n   IESG
    telechats, and by the number of documents waiting in excess of\n   fifty days
    for initial AD review after a working group has requested\n   publication.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a number of ways that the AD workload can be\n   reduced.
    \ It will be up to the IETF consensus process to determine\n   which proposals
    to adopt.\n\n   A major goal of this effort is to make it feasible for a wider\n
    \  diversity of people to volunteer as candidates for AD possitions by\n   reducing
    the barriers and costs to individuals and their employers.\n\n\t "

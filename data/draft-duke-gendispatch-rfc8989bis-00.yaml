  content: "   The IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom) appoints candidates to most\n
    \  IETF leadership committee.  RFC8713 provides criteria for membership\n   on
    Nomcom that attempts to ensure that NomCom volunteers are members\n   of the loosely
    defined IETF community, by requiring in-person\n   attendance in three of the
    past five in- person meetings.  In 2020\n   and 2021, the IETF had six consecutive
    fully online plenary meetings\n   that drove rapid advancement in remote meeting
    technologies and\n   procedures, including an experiment that included remote
    attendance\n   for NomCom eligibility.  This document updates RFC8713 by building
    a\n   new set of eligibility criteria from first principles, with\n   consideration
    for the increased salience of remote attendance.\n\n\t "

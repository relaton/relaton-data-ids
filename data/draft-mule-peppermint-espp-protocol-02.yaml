abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a provisioning protocol for ENUM-SIP addressing
    servers. An ENUM-SIP addressing server is a host that acts as Lookup Function
    in session peering to determine the target domain of a given SIP request and it
    may also act as a Location Routing Function to develop the location of the SIP
    signaling entity in that target domain. This protocol allows SIP service providers
    to provision and manage session establishment data used by SIP network elements
    to route SIP sessions to the target destinations which may be served by the SIP
    service provider's own internal network or by a session peering partner. The data
    provisioned into an ENUM-SIP addressing server is queried by SIP entities using
    ENUM or SIP. This version of the protocol integrates comments received on the
    IETF peppermint and drinks mailing lists before July 2008. This document is an
    Internet-Draft and the protocol it describes is subject to technical changes that
    may make this version incompatible with future versions defined in Internet-Drafts.
    It is expected that the authors will continue to update this protocol based on
    the drinks working group requirements on the session establishment data.</p>"

  content: "There are times that an LSP source node needs to know change(s) has\noccurred
    along the originally established LSP path. This is\nespecially true in the Mobile
    Backhaul environment where microwave\ntransport is widely deployed. The bandwidth
    provided by the microwave\ntransport can change with weather. The source LSR,
    e.g. LTE's eNodeB,\nneeds to adjust its admission rate or shift more load to alternative\npaths
    when the backhaul transport path condition is changed.\n\nThis draft describes
    a simple mechanism for transit LSRs to notify\nSource LSR of the path condition
    changes.\n\n\n\nConventions used in this document\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC-2119 0.\n\t "

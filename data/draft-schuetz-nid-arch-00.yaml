  content: "   This document describes a new proposal for a future Internet\n   architecture.
    \ Similar to many other proposals it employs a locator/\n   identifier split to
    overcome the short-comings arising from the dual\n   role of IP addresses.  Similar
    to the Host Identity Protocol, each\n   node carries a unique, randomly self-generated
    identifier - the\n   public part of a public/private key pair.  It can therefore
    directly\n   be used for authentication and authorisation purposes.  Different\n
    \  from some other proposals, the Node Identity Internetworking\n   architecture
    does not try to converge on a single (globally managed)\n   address space, but
    instead accepts the co-existence of different\n   networking domains - here called
    locator domains.  Routing within the\n   architecture is based on a two-level
    approach.  First, routing within\n   a locator domain is managed by the internal
    addressing and routing\n   scheme of the locator domain.  Second, routing between
    locator\n   domains involves specialized nodes at locator domain borders.  By\n
    \  grouping the nodes into locator domains, the effects of certain\n   events
    such as mobility can often be localised, thus reducing the\n   impact on the global
    network.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines a protocol for delegating client\n   authentication
    and authorization in a constrained environment for\n   establishing a Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS) channel\n   between resource-constrained nodes.
    \ The protocol relies on DTLS to\n   transfer authorization information and shared
    secrets for symmetric\n   cryptography between entities in a constrained network.
    \ A resource-\n   constrained node can use this protocol to delegate authentication
    of\n   communication peers and management of authorization information to a\n
    \  trusted host with less severe limitations regarding processing power\n   and
    memory.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo documents the various methods known to be in use by\n   peer-to-peer
    (P2P) applications for communication in the presence\n   of Network Address Translators
    (NATs) at the current time. This\n   memo covers NAT traversal approaches used
    by both TCP and UDP\n   based applications. This memo is not an endorsement of
    the methods \n   described, but merely an attempt to capture them in a document.\n\t "

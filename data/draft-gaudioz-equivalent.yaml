  content: "This document describes EDS (Equivalent Differentiated Services), a\nnew
    building-block for a simple, robust, free and scalable end-to-end\nservice differentiation
    in IP networks.  The EDS scheme aims at\nproviding a spectrum of 'different but
    equivalent' network services\nthat offer a trade-off between delay and loss rate
    to the end-to-end\nflows.  The EDS scheme can be deployed incrementally in the
    Internet.\n\t "

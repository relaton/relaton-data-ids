  content: "   Based on the analysis of current centralized mobility management\n
    \  approaches, three main functions of current centralized mobility\n   anchor
    are introduced, which are Mobility Routing (MR), Home Address\n   Allocation (HAA),
    and Location Management (LM).\n\n   Based on the proposal of decoupling those
    functions, this document\n   provides a concept of architecture for Distributed
    Mobility\n   Management (DMM) with some key approaches for DMM.\n\n\n\t "

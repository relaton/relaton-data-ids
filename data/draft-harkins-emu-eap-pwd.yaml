  content: "This memo describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method,
    EAP-pwd, which uses a shared password for authentication.  The password may be
    a low-entropy one and may be drawn from some set of possible passwords, like a
    dictionary, which is available to an attacker.  The underlying key exchange is
    resistant to active attack, passive attack, and dictionary attack.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

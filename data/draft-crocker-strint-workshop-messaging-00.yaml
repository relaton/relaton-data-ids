  script: Latn
  content: "   Given a concern for pervasive monitoring, messaging information\n   needing
    protection includes primary payload, descriptive meta-data,\n   and traffic-related
    analysis.  Complete protection against pervasive\n   monitoring (PM), for traffic
    through complex handling sequences, has\n   not yet been achieved reliably in
    real-world operation.\n   Consequently, it is reasonable to consider a range of
    mechanisms, for\n   protecting differing amounts of information and against monitoring
    of\n   different kinds.  Although channel-based encryption can be helpful,\n   it
    is not sufficient.  This paper considers pursuing different levels\n   of end-to-end
    protection, referencing examples of component\n   mechanisms that already have
    encouraging field experience.\n\n\t "

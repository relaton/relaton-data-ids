  content: "   This memo provides an analysis of the Host Density metric as\n   currently
    used to guide registry allocations of IPv6 unicast address\n   blocks.  This document
    contrasts the address efficiency as currently\n   adopted in the allocation of
    IPv4 network addresses and that used by\n   the IPv6 protocol.  It is noted that
    for large allocations there are\n   very significant variations in the target
    efficiency metric between\n   the two approaches.  The memo notes that the IPv6
    address assignment\n   efficiency metric would benefit from a detailed technical
    review,\n   particularly relating to large scale deployments of public\n   infrastructure.\n\t "

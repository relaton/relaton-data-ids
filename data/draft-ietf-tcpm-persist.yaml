  content: "This document clarifies the Zero Window Probes (ZWPs) described in RFC
    1122 (\"Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers\").  In particular,
    it clarifies the actions that can be taken on connections that are experiencing
    the ZWP condition.  Rather than making a change to the standard, this document
    clarifies what has been until now a misinterpretation of the standard as specified
    in RFC 1122.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

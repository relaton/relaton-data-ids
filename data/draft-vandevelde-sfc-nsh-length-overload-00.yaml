abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The specification of the NSH MD Type 1 header [draft-ietf-sfc-nsh]\n
    \  mandates four Context Headers, 4-byte each, and they MUST be added\n   immediately
    following the Service Path Header.  As direct\n   consequence, an NSH MD Type
    1 header is always Length 0x6 (six 4-byte\n   words).  As a result, the Length
    field of the NSH MD Type 1 header\n   provides an information which is known by
    simply looking at the \"MD\n   Type\" field.  However, while [draft-ietf-sfc-nsh]
    does not specify\n   the encoding of these Context Headers, other specifications
    have\n   started to do so.  A need to distinguish types of Context Headers\n   therefore
    arises.\n\n   This draft proposes to overload the Length field of an NSH MD Type
    1\n   as Meta-Data context allocation identifier and to create a IANA\n   repository
    for NSH MD Type 1 allocation schemes.  The NSH MD Type 1\n   Length field overload
    intends to allow universal understanding at any\n   network location and by any
    network device of the context allocation\n   structure.\n\n\n\t "

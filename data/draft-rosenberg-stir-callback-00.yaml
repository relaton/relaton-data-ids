- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Robocalling has become an increasing problem in the Public Switched\n
    \  Telephone Network (PSTN).  A partial remedy for it is the provision\n   of
    an authenticated caller ID in the PSTN, which today is lacking.\n   Secure Telephone
    Identity Revisited (STIR) provides this through the\n   usage of signed payloads
    in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) calls.\n   However, STIR deployment requires
    a global certificate system which\n   allows for worldwide issuance of certifications
    that attest to which\n   numbers a provider is responsible for.  Such a system
    is likely to\n   take years to rollout.  To accelerate STIR deployment, this draft\n
    \  proposes a technique wherein STIR can be used without certificates\n   that
    attest to number ownership.  This is done through a combination\n   of self-signed
    certificates, reverse callbacks and cached\n   validations.\n\n\t "

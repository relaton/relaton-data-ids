  content: "   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  RFC 6374\n
    \  specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate\n   measurement
    of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as\n   related metrics such
    as delay variation in MPLS networks using probe\n   messages.  This document utilizes
    these mechanisms for Performance\n   Delay and Loss Measurements in Segment Routing
    (SR) networks with\n   MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both SR links and end-to-end
    SR\n   Policies.  In addition, this document defines Return Path TLV for\n   two-way
    performance measurement and Block Number TLV for loss\n   measurement.\n\n\n\t "

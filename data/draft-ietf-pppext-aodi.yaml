    for dial-up access to Internet\nservices.\n* For the end-user, there is no need
    to dial-up the service each\ntime access is desired.\n* For the Internet service
    provider, it is possible to give the\nend-user a notification, such as the arrival
    of new mail.\n* For the Local Exchange Carrier, the switched circuit trunk\nutilization

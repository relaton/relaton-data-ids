  content: "   This document describes how control loops are used in Autonomic\n   Networking.
    Control loops provide a generic mechanism to enable\n   the Autonomic System to
    adapt (on its own) to various factors\n   that can change the goals that the Autonomic
    System is trying to\n   achieve, or how those goals are achieved. For example,
    as user\n   needs, business goals, and the Autonomic Network Infrastructure\n
    \  (ANI) itself changes, self-adaptation enables the ANI to change the\n   services
    and resources it makes available to adapt to these changes.\n\n   Control loops
    operate to continuously observe and collect data\n   that enables the Autonomic
    Management System system to understand\n   changes to the behavior of the system
    being managed, and then\n   provide actions to move the state of the system being
    managed\n   toward a common goal. Self-adaptive systems move decision-making\n
    \  from static, pre-defined commands to dynamic processes computed at\n   runtime.\n\n
    \  This document defines the requirements for an autonomic control\n   loop, describes
    different types of control loops, and explains how\n   control loops are used
    in an Autonomic System.\n\n\n\t "

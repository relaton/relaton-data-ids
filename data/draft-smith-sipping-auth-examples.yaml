  content: "   RFC3261 [2] recommends that SIP requests be authenticated using HTTP\n
    \  Digest authentication as defined in RFC2617 [3], and many vendors\n   have
    successfully added this function to their products.  However\n   implementation
    bugs are still being observed both at interoperability\n   events and in the field.\n\n
    \  This document provides worked examples of Digest authentication usage\n   in
    SIP.  It is intended to help new SIP implementers, and to provide\n   a common
    set of test authentication examples against which an\n   implementation may be
    checked.\n\t "

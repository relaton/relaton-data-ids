  script: Latn
  content: "   L4S and Diffserv offer somewhat overlapping services (low latency and\n
    \  low loss), but bandwidth allocation is out of scope for L4S.\n   Therefore
    there is scope for the two approaches to complement each\n   other, but also to
    conflict.  This informational document explains\n   how the two approaches interact,
    how they can be arranged to\n   complement each other and in which cases one can
    stand alone without\n   needing the other.\n\n\t "

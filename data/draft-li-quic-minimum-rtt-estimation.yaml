abstract:
- content: <p>In traditional acknowledgment mechanisms, the sender frequently "pulls"
    ACK packets, resulting in significant protocol control overhead. This leads to
    wasted CPU and I/O resources, contention for packet spectrum on half-duplex links
    (e.g., WLAN), and reverse-path congestion in asymmetric links (e.g., satellite
    network). Reducing the number of ACKs is essential in scenarios where ACK overhead
    is non-negligible. However, a lower ACK frequency can introduce biases in delay
    estimation, such as overestimating the minimum round-trip time (minRTT). This
    document proposes how to calibrate the estimation of the minRTT under low ACK
    frequency conditions.</p>

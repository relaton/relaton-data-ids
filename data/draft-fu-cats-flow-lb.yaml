- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a flow-level load balancing solution for CATS,\n
    \  and is designed to effectively manage CS-ID traffic by addressing\n   issues
    like frequent control plane operations and uneven use of\n   computing resources.
    \ The approach entails concurrently identifying\n   multiple next-hop choices,
    factoring in both network pathways and\n   service instances.  Traffic is then
    distributed among these service\n   instances using flow-based load balancing,
    which relies on the five-\n   tuple characteristics of packets.\n\n\t "

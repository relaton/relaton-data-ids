  script: Latn
  content: "   Acknowledgement packets (ACKs) are used by transport protocols to\n
    \  confirm the delivery of packets, and their reception is used in a\n   variety
    of other ways (to measure path round trip time, to gauge path\n   congestion,
    etc).  However, the transmission of ACKs also consumes\n   resources at the receiver,
    forwarding resource in the network and\n   processing resources at the sender.\n\n
    \  On network paths with significant path asymmetry, transmission of\n   ACKs
    can limit the available throughput or can reduce the efficient\n   use of network
    capacity.  This occurs when the return capacity is\n   significantly more constrained
    than the forward capacity, and/or the\n   cost of transmission per packet is a
    significant component of the\n   total transmission cost.  In these cases, reducing
    the ratio of ACK\n   packets to data packets can improve link utilisation and
    reduce link\n   transmission costs.  It can also reduce processing overhead at
    the\n   sender and receiver.\n\n   This document proposes a change to the default
    acknowledgement policy\n   of the QUIC transport protocol to improve performance
    over paths with\n   appreciable asymmetry.\n\n\t "

  content: "Transfer features in SIP have been enabled via the REFER method  and\nReplaces
    header.  These constructs have been around for a while now\nwith stable definitions
    for how they work.  However, there appear to\nbe a small set of edge cases and
    requirements that are not yet\nsatisfied.  This draft attempts to define some
    of those cases and\nrequirements.  This is intended to spark discussion to whether
    these\nare legitimate requirements on which further standards work is\nappropriate.\n\t "

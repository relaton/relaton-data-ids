  script: Latn
  content: "   Various time synchronization and delay measurement protocols are\n
    \  transported over UDP, e.g., PTP, NTP, and OWAMP/TWAMP. These\n   protocols
    use timestamped packets that often have to be modified by\n   intermediate nodes
    in the network. In such cases the UDP checksum\n   field must be updated to reflect
    these modifications. The IEEE 1588\n   standard suggests to append 2 octets to
    every protocol message,\n   allowing intermediate nodes to reflect the checksum
    modification in\n   the last 2 octets rather than in the UDP checksum field. This\n
    \  document generalizes this concept, and defines a UDP Checksum Trailer\n   for
    NTP and for OWAMP/TWAMP.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries and\n
    \  everyday life, fueled by advances in model architectures, training\n   paradigms,
    and data infrastructure for generation and consumption.\n   Today, machine learning
    models are embedded in many of our daily\n   activities, ranging from simple classification
    systems to advanced\n   architectures such as large language models (LLMs) like
    ChatGPT,\n   Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek.  These models highlight the\n   transformative
    potential of AI across diverse applications—from\n   productivity tools to complex
    decision-making systems.\n\n   However, the effectiveness and reliability of AI
    depend on two\n   foundational processes: training and inference.  Each process\n
    \  introduces unique challenges related to data management, computation,\n   connectivity,
    privacy, trust, security, and governance.\n\n   In this draft, we introduce the
    Data and Agent Aware-Inference and\n   Training Network (DA-ITN)—a unified, intelligent,
    multi-plane network\n   architecture designed to address the full spectrum of
    requirements\n   needed to enable AI networks.  DA-ITN provides a scalable and\n
    \  adaptive infrastructure that connects AI clients, data providers,\n   model
    providers, agent providers, service facilitators, and\n   computational resources
    to support end-to-end training, inference,\n   and agentic interaction lifecycle
    operations.  The architecture\n   features dedicated control, data, and operations
    & management (OAM)\n   planes to orchestrate training, inference, and agentic
    services while\n   ensuring reliability, transparency, and accountability.  By
    outlining\n   the key requirements of such an AI ecosystem and demonstrating how\n
    \  DA-ITN fulfills them, this document presents an architecture for the\n   future
    of AI-native networking—an \"AI internet\"—optimized for AI\n   learning, efficient
    inference, scalable deployment, and seamless\n   agent-to-agent collaboration.\n\n\t "

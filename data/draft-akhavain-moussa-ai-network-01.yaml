abstract:
- content: '<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries and
    everyday life, fueled by advances in model architectures, training paradigms,
    and data infrastructure for generation and consumption. Today, machine learning
    models are embedded in many of our daily activities, ranging from simple classification
    systems to advanced architectures such as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT,
    Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek. These models highlight the transformative potential
    of AI across diverse applications—from productivity tools to complex decision-making
    systems. However, the effectiveness and reliability of AI depend on two foundational
    processes: training and inference. Each process introduces unique challenges related
    to data management, computation, connectivity, privacy, trust, security, and governance.
    In this draft, we introduce the Data and Agent Aware-Inference and Training Network
    (DA-ITN)—a unified, intelligent, multi-plane network architecture designed to
    address the full spectrum of requirements needed to enable AI networks. DA-ITN
    provides a scalable and adaptive infrastructure that connects AI clients, data
    providers, model providers, agent providers, service facilitators, and computational
    resources to support end-to-end training, inference, and agentic interaction lifecycle
    operations. The architecture features dedicated control, data, and operations
    &amp; management (OAM) planes to orchestrate training, inference, and agentic
    services while ensuring reliability, transparency, and accountability. By outlining
    the key requirements of such an AI ecosystem and demonstrating how DA-ITN fulfills
    them, this document presents an architecture for the future of AI-native networking—an
    "AI internet"—optimized for AI learning, efficient inference, scalable deployment,
    and seamless agent-to-agent collaboration.</p>'

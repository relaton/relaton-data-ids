  content: "In this document we define two new ICMP message types. These new\ntypes
    of ICMP messages can be used as probe packets to support a\nvariety of measurement
    applications.  This draft gives detailed\ndefinition and format of these two new
    ICMP message types. It is in\nfull conformance with the original RFC on ICMP [1],
    and complements\nthe work of the IPPM working group [6][7][8]. The extension of
    ICMP\nfor one-way traffic measurement is also useful for traffic\nengineering.\n\t "

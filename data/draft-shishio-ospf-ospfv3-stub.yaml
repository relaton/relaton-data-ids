  content: "OSPFv3 accommodates for the possibility to indicate through the R-bit\nif
    a router is an active router and should be taken into\nconsideration as a transit
    device.  Another method available is the\nv6-bit indicating if a router or link
    should be excluded from IPv6\nrouting calculations.\n\nA direct result is that
    OSPFv3 has \"no transit capability\"\npotentially based upon the setting of R-bit
    and V6-bit, unlike the\nstub OSPFv2 router functionality.  This feature proposal
    has as\npurpose to re-introduce existing OSPFv2 stub router behavior into\nOSPFv3
    to keep the operational service provider experience used to\ndeploy, troubleshoot
    and be familiar with OSPFv2 stub routing.\n\nOSPFv3 has similar metric field information
    field of all of LSAs,\nwith exception of the Link-LSA, so RFC3137 method can be
    re-utilized\nin OSPFv3.\n\nTo drive consistency between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, there
    should be next\nto supporting both R-bit and v6-bit be support for\"max-metric\".\n\t "

  content: "   The secure shell (SSH) traditionally offers its secure services over\n
    \  an insecure network using the TCP transport protocol.  This document\n   defines
    mechanisms to run the SSH protocol over HTTP/3 using Extended\n   CONNECT.  Running
    SSH over HTTP/3 enables additional benefits such as\n   the scalability offered
    by HTTP multiplexing, relying on TLS for\n   secure channel establishment leveraging
    X.509 certificates, HTTP\n   Authentication schemes for client and server authentication,
    UDP port\n   forwarding and stronger resilience against packet injection attacks\n
    \  and middlebox interference.\n\n\t "

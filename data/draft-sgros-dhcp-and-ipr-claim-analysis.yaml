- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The purpose of this draft is to analyze different options on how DHCP\n
    \  can be used to configure PvD aware client.  This is done in light of\n   IPR
    claim made by Huawei and the necessity to find an option for\n   implementation.
    \ In order for an option to be selected it obviously\n   must not interfere with
    IPR, or, IPR has to be somehow invalidated.\n\n\t "

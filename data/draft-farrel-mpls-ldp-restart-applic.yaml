  content: "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) systems will be used in core\nnetworks
    where system downtime must be kept to a minimum. Similarly,\nwhere MPLS is at
    the network edges (for example, in Provider Edge\nrouters) system downtime must
    also be kept as small as possible.\nMany MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSRs) may,
    therefore, exploit\nFault Tolerant (FT) hardware or software to provide high availability\nof
    the core networks.\nThe details of how FT is achieved for the various components
    of an\nFT LSR, including the switching hardware and the TCP stack are\nimplementation
    specific.  How the software module itself chooses to\nimplement FT for the state
    created by the Label Distribution Protocol\n(LDP) is also implementation specific
    but there are several issues in\nthe LDP specification in RFC 3036 'LDP Specification'
    that make it\ndifficult to implement an FT LSR using the LDP protocols without
    some\nextensions to those protocols.\nProposals have been made in 'Fault Tolerance
    for the Label\nDistribution Protocol (LDP)' [LDP-FT] and 'Graceful Restart Mechanism\nfor
    LDP' [LDP-RESTART] to address these issues.\nThis document gives guidance on when
    it is advisable to implement\nsome form of LDP restart mechanism and which approach
    might be more\nsuitable. The issues and extensions described here are equally\napplicable
    to RFC 3212, 'Constraint-Based LSP Setup Using LDP'\n(CR-LDP).\n\t "

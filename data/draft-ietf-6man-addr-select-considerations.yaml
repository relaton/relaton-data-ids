    \  team's considerations about the address selection issues mainly\n   raised
    in [RFC5220].  This considerations led to the revision of RFC\n   3484 [RFC6724],
    and Address Selection DHCP option.  Although it does\n   not perfectly match the
    current state, this document captures the\n   past discussion and considerations
    for the historical record.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides a problem statement and requirements with\nrespect
    to the presence of a single packetization time (ptime/\nmaxptime) attribute in
    SDP media descriptions that contain several\nmedia formats (audio codecs).  Furthermore,
    a best common practice\nsolution for the use of 'ptime/maxptime' is proposed based
    on\n'static', 'dynamic' and 'indicated' values.  Some methods already\nproposed
    as ad-hoc solutions and background information is included\nin an appendix.\n\t "

  content: "   This note describes a digital signature system based on cryptographic\n
    \  hash functions, following the seminal work in this area.  It\n   specifies
    a one-time signature scheme based on the work of Lamport,\n   Diffie, Winternitz,
    and Merkle (LDWM), and specifies a general\n   signature system using a Merkle
    tree.  These systems provide\n   asymmetric authentication without using large
    integer mathematics,\n   and achieve a high security level.  They are suitable
    for compact\n   implementations, are relatively simple to implement, and naturally\n
    \  resist side-channel attacks.  Unlike most other signature systems,\n   hash-based
    signatures would still be secure even if it proves\n   feasible for an attacker
    to build a quantum computer.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses most common scenarios of connecting an\n   enterprise
    network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned\n   by an ISP.  The problem
    of enterprise multihoming without address\n   translation of any form has not
    been solved yet as it requires both\n   the network to select the correct egress
    ISP based on the packet\n   source address and hosts to select the correct source
    address based\n   on the desired egress ISP for that traffic.\n   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming]
    proposes a solution to\n   this problem by introducing a new routing functionality
    (Source\n   Address Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink selection issue and\n
    \  using Router Advertisements to influence the host source address\n   selection.
    \ While the above-mentioned document focuses on solving the\n   general problem
    and on covering various complex use cases, this\n   document describes how the
    solution proposed in\n   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] can be adopted
    for limited\n   number of common use cases.  In particular, the focus is on scenarios\n
    \  where an enterprise network has two Internet uplinks used either in\n   primary/backup
    mode or simultaneously and hosts in that network might\n   not yet properly support
    multihoming as described in [RFC8028].\n\n\t "

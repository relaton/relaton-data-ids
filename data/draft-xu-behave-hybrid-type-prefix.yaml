  content: "To build IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses for IPv4/IPv6 translation, the \nWell-Known
    Prefix (WKP) and Network Specific Prefix (NSP)-based \naddress formats have been
    defined in [Address-Format]. However, both \nof them have some limitations in
    several use cases. Hence, this \ndocument aims at discussing the validity of the
    use cases and assess \nthe interest of the BEHAVE WG to meet the requirement of
    \nunambiguously distinguishing IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses from \nnative IPv6
    ones. Doing so would guide the address selection and \ntherefore allow avoiding
    crossing unnecessary or even useless \naddress family translators.  \n\nConventions
    used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [RFC2119].\n\t "

  content: "This document defines two extensions to the capabilities of a Bundle\nProtocol
    Agent (BPA) (as defined in [refs.DTNBP]) that is processing\nbundles within the
    context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture\n[refs.DTNarch].  It defines
    an operation called \"diversion\", which is\nthe act of a bundle protocol agent
    moving an entire bundle from some\npoint in bundle processing in the BPA to a
    DTN application agent.\nThis diversion of a bundle from the BPA to an application
    agent is\ndistinct from delivery of the bundle at that application agent.  This\ndocument
    defines a second operation, called \"injection\", which is the\ninverse of diversion.
    \ Injection is the act of an application agent\nmoving an entire bundle from the
    application agent into some point in\nbundle processing in the BPA.  This injection
    of a bundle from an\napplication agent to the BPA is distinct from bundle transmission.\n\t "

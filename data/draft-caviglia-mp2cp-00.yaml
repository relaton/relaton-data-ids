  content: "This memo introduces a new object for carrying GRSVP-TE labels, \nnamely
    Mp2Cp Label object.  This new object SHOULD be used in order \nto move under the
    Control Plane (CP) domain LSPs that were created by \nthe Management Plane (MP).
    \n                   \nThe result of using Mp2Cp Label in GRSVP-TE is that, at
    the end of \nthe signaling flow, an LSP that was created by Management Plane is
    \nmoved under to Control Plane domain. \n\t "

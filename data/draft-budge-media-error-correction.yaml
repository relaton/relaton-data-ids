- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document specifies a media-independent error-correction scheme using
    the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP), along with the payload format for encapsulating
    both error-correction signaling and media bitstreams in RTP. It enables the reconstruction
    of lost packets across a connectionless transport such as RTP over UDP. The goal
    of this scheme is to maximize isochrony, the regular and timely delivery of data,
    with minimal bandwidth, latency, and computational costs.\n\t "

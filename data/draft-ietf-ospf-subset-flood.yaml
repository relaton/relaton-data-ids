  content: "This memo defines a method for limiting the flooding of OSPF LSAs to\na
    configurable subset of the network topology.  The following OSPF\nproperties are
    maintained: (1) routers are omitted from the routing\ncalculation until their
    link-state databases are synchronized and\n(2) links must be bidirectional before
    they can be used in the\ncalculation. Backward-compatibility with unmodified OSPF
    routers is\nalso provided.\n\t "

  content: "   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is\n   designed
    to allow entities with knowledge about the network\n   infrastructure to export
    such information to applications that need\n   to choose one or more endpoints
    to connect to among large sets of\n   logically equivalent ones.  The primary
    use case for the ALTO\n   protocol was peer-to-peer applications for file sharing,
    video\n   streaming and realtime communications, usually running on end-user\n
    \  devices.  However, a number of other applications executing in more\n   controlled
    environments may also benefit from the information that\n   can be exported through
    the ALTO protocol.  The use cases that have\n   received significant attention
    include Content Delivery Networks\n   (CDNs), distributed applications running
    in large datacenters, as\n   well as systems made of inter-communicating ALTO
    servers.\n\n   To apply ALTO to these new use cases, this document aims to foster
    a\n   discussion to determine if, and how, the ALTO protocol could be\n   extended
    to provide a simple yet useful view of a computational\n   environment that goes
    beyond the static (or near static) network\n   topology and cost map information.\n\n\t "

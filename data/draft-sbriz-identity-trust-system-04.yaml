abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines an *identity trust system*, which is a digital
    identity authentication system based on a symmetric exchange of authentication
    messages that does not require federation of authentication domains. The main
    components are: 1. *Symmetric authentication protocol* - A protocol for the mutual
    recognition of entities based on a symmetric exchange of authentication messages
    through the mediation of Identity Providers (IdPs). It builds on and extends the
    OAuth Authorization Framework RFC6749. 2. *Trustees network* - The IdPs network
    infrastructure that provides a secure environment for exchanging authentication
    messages. 3. *Custodian concept* - A special category of IdPs to protect physical
    identity and personal data. The generic IdP is called "*_trustee_*" and is only
    responsible for digital authentication, while the special IdP called "*_custodian_*"
    has the legal right to process the individual''s real data and maintain the relationship
    with the digital identity. Custodian acts under the direct control of the authorities
    of the individual''s country.</p>'

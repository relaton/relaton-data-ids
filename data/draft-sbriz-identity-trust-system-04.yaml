  content: "   This document defines an *identity trust system*, which is a digital\n
    \  identity authentication system based on a symmetric exchange of\n   authentication
    messages that does not require federation of\n   authentication domains.  The
    main components are: 1. *Symmetric\n   authentication protocol* - A protocol for
    the mutual recognition of\n   entities based on a symmetric exchange of authentication
    messages\n   through the mediation of Identity Providers (IdPs).  It builds on
    and\n   extends the OAuth Authorization Framework RFC6749. 2. *Trustees\n   network*
    - The IdPs network infrastructure that provides a secure\n   environment for exchanging
    authentication messages. 3. *Custodian\n   concept* - A special category of IdPs
    to protect physical identity\n   and personal data.  The generic IdP is called
    \"*_trustee_*\" and is\n   only responsible for digital authentication, while
    the special IdP\n   called \"*_custodian_*\" has the legal right to process the\n
    \  individual's real data and maintain the relationship with the digital\n   identity.
    \ Custodian acts under the direct control of the authorities\n   of the individual's
    country.\n\n\t "

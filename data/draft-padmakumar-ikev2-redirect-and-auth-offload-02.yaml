  content: "IKEv2 supports multiple authentication mechanisms like public key\nsignatures,
    shared secrets and EAP.  EAP based authentication\nrequires server to maintain
    information about the client until EAP\ncompletes.  Public key based authentication
    mechanisms are highly\ncomputational intensive and demands server CPU resources.\n\nRedirect
    Mechanism for IKEv2 proposes a mechanism for IKEv2 that\nenables a VPN gateway
    to redirect the VPN client to another VPN\ngateway, for example, based on the
    load condition.\n\nIKEv2 Session Resumption proposes an extension to IKEv2 that
    allows a\nclient to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient\nmanner,
    utilizing a previously established IKE SA.\n\nRedirect mechanism can also be used
    to redirect a client to another\nrouter (trust anchor) to do mutual authentication
    and an optional\nproxy session negotiation on behalf of the server.  This redirection\nhappens
    during the IKE_SA_INIT and server does not maintain any\ninformation about the
    redirected client.  After mutual authentication\nand optional proxy session negotiation
    trust anchor redirects the\nclient back to the server with an Access Token which
    can be used as a\ndynamic pre-shared key between the server and client for password\nbased
    IKE_AUTH exchange.  Mechanism described here allows servers to\ncompute the same
    pre-shared key dynamically, without contacting trust\nanchors, based on the information
    provided by the client during\nIKE_AUTH exchange.  Access Token based authentication
    permits IDr of\nthe responder to be different from that specified in Ticket and\npermits
    client to reuse the proxy session (negotiated between client\nand trust anchor)
    between client and server.\n\nSuch a mechanism is useful especially for low power
    devices like\nhandsets.  For example, a mobile node can redirect a correspondent\nnode
    to its home agent.  Home agent can form a proxy session with\ncorrespondent node
    and then redirect it back to mobile node.\n\nStatus of this Memo\nThis Internet-Draft

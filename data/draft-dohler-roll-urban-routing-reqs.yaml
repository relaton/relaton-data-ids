  content: "The application specific routing requirements for Urban Low Power and\nLossy
    Networks (U-L2Ns) are presented in this document. In the near\nfuture, sensing
    and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban\nenvironments so as to improve
    the citizens' living conditions as well\nas to monitor compliance with increasingly
    strict environmental laws.\nThese field nodes are expected to measure and report
    a wide gamut of\ndata, such as required in smart metering, waste disposal,\nmeteorological,
    pollution and allergy reporting applications. The\nmajority of these nodes is
    expected to communicate wirelessly which\n- given the limited radio range - requires
    the use of suitable\nmulti-hop routing protocols. The design of such protocols
    will be\nmainly impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory,\nprocessing
    power, battery, etc) and the particularities of the\noutdoors urban application
    scenario. As such, for a wireless roll\nsolution to be competitive with other
    incumbent and emerging\nsolutions, the protocol ought to be energy-efficient,
    scalable and\nautonomous. This documents aims to specify a set of requirements\nreflecting
    these and further U-L2Ns tailored characteristics.\n\t "

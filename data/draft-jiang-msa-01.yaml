  content: "This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow seamless\nIP
    multicast datagram delivery to mobile nodes in the Internet. In\norder to receive
    IP multicast datagrams, mobile nodes are not\nrequired to be identified by their
    unicast IP addresses. For\nunicast communication using Mobile IP, each mobile
    node needs to\nhave a unicast home address and a care-of address. Following a\nhandover
    to another IP subnet, such a mobile node is able to\nreceive IP multicast traffic
    after exchanging IGMP messages with\nthe multicast routers on the currently visiting
    network. However,\nin the worst case, it takes an unreasonably long time (especially\nwith
    respect to streaming media) to resume receiving multicast IP\ntraffic in the visiting
    network.\nThis draft specifies a Mobility Support Agent (MSA) protocol which\nprovides
    a mechanism to help ensure seamless reception of IP\nmulticast traffic despite
    a mobile node handover. This is possible\nbecause in advance of its handover,
    a mobile node pre-registers\nwith the MSA on the next network to be visited. The
    MSA acts as a\nproxy for this mobile node and is thus able to set up all the\nnecessary
    states for the seamless delivery of multicast traffic to\nthis mobile node.\n\n\t "

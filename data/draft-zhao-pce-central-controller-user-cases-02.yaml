abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers would like
    to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and GMPLS network while
    removing the complexity of existing signaling protocols such as LDP and RSVP-TE.
    In this document, we propose to use the PCE as a central controller so that LSP
    can be calculated/ signaled/initiated/downloaded/managed through a centralized
    PCE server to each network devices along the LSP path while leveraging the existing
    PCE technologies as much as possible. This draft describes the use cases for using
    the PCE as the central controller where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated/downloaded/
    maintained through extending the current PCE architectures and extending the PCEP.</p>"

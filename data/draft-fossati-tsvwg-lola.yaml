  content: "   This document proposes a marking scheme for tagging low-latency flows\n
    \  (for example: interactive voice and video, gaming, machine to machine\n   applications)
    that is safe to use by the mobile network for matching\n   such flows to suitable
    per-hop behaviors (EPS bearers defined by\n   3GPP) in its core and radio segments.
    \ The suggested scheme re-uses\n   NQB, a DiffServ-based signalling scheme with
    compatible rate-delay\n   trade-off semantics that has been recently introduced
    in the context\n   of fixed access to allow differential treatment of non-queue
    building\n   vs queue building flows.\n\n\t "

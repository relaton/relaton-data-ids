  script: Latn
  content: "   During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the\n   interoperation
    between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential.\n   Multicast services across
    IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed.\n   Besides the packet-based multicast
    translation mechanism, this\n   document describes a multicast proxy solution.
    The solution is a\n   multicast deployment for transition scenario. It does not
    propose\n   any new protocol or protocol modification/extension for multicast.\n
    \  The multicast proxy is deployed at the border of IPv6/IPv4 networks.\n   It
    is mainly based on content\n   cache. Without packet-based translation, it acquires
    the content data\n   from IPvX network, caches the data, and multicasts the data
    in IPvY\n   network. It acts as a multicast leaf in the IPvX network where the\n
    \  data source locates while acting as a multicast source in IPvY\n   network
    where the multicast client locates.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The session initiation protocol(SIP) which designed by IETF is also\n
    \  being considered as the core protocol for multimedia communication.\n   This
    document describes a source address validation Improvement(SAVI)\n   solution
    for SIP protocol or other security mechanisms. The SAVI was\n   developed to prevent
    IP source address spoofing which can enable\n   impersonation and malicious traffic
    redirection. The SAVI can be used\n   in both IPV4/V6 networks. In the work we
    presented here, we describe\n   the advantages of using SAVI in SIP and the approaches
    for using SIP\n   in networks, whether in the registrar, redirect, and any procedures\n
    \  of the SIP protocol .This document describes different deployment\n   scenarios,
    with solutions for when the nodes in the network using the\n   SIP to contact
    each other.\n\n\t "

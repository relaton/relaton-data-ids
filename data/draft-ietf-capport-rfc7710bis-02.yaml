  content: "   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access\n
    \  (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n   captive
    portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do\n   until the customer
    has authenticated.\n\n   This document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement\n
    \  (RA) extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of\n   captive-portal
    device, and that they will need to authenticate to get\n   Internet access.  It
    is not a full solution to address all of the\n   issues that clients may have
    with captive portals; it is designed to\n   be used in larger solutions.  The
    method of authenticating to, and\n   interacting with the captive portal is out
    of scope of this document.\n\n   RFC7710 used DHCP code point 160.  Due to a conflict,
    this document\n   specifies TBD.\n\n   [ This document is being collaborated on
    in Github at:\n   https://github.com/capport-wg/7710bis.  The most recent version
    of\n   the document, open issues, etc should all be available here.  The\n   authors
    (gratefully) accept pull requests.  Text in square brackets\n   will be removed

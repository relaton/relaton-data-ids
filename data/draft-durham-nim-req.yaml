  content: "As networking technology has evolved, a diverse set of technologies \nhas
    been deployed to manage the resulting products.  These very from \nWeb based products,
    standard management protocols, and text scripts.  \nThe underlying systems to
    be manipulated are represented in varying \nways including implicitly in the programmatics,
    with proprietary \ndata descriptions, or with standardized descriptions using
    a range \nof technologies including MIBs, PIBs, or LDAP schemas.  The result \nis
    that a single application such as DHCP or Differentiated Services \nmay be represented
    in many different inconsistent fashions.  Even \nthe existing standard descriptive
    technologies have not been \nfocussed on re-use across domains and commonality.
    \ The situation \nwould be significantly improved if there were to be a common
    \nrepresentation of data (an 'information model') from which \ntechnology-specific
    data models can be derived to suit application-\nspecific configuration and management
    needs.  This would allow the \nindustry to build common descriptions, resulting
    in consistency \nacross the paradigms, and better interoperability.  Such an \n'information
    model' would also assist other IETF working groups by \nreducing the work needed
    to determine how to represent those parts \nof their technology that are already
    in the common model.\n\t "

  content: "Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are typically composed of\nresource
    constrained nodes communicating over links that have dynamic\ncharacteristics.
    \ Memory constraints coupled with temporal variations\nin link connectivity makes
    the use of topology maintenance to support\nIPv6 multicast challenging.  This
    document describes the use of\nTrickle to efficiently forward multicast messages
    without the need\nfor topology maintenance.\n\t "

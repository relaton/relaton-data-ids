abstract:
- content: "<p>Network equipments are often configured by a variety of network management
    systems (NMS), protocols, and people. If a network issue arises because of a wrong
    configuration modification, it's important to quickly identify the specific service
    request and obtain the reason for pushing that modification. Another potential
    network issue can stem from concurrent NMS's with overlapping intent, each having
    their own tasks to perform: in such a case, it's important to map the respective
    modifications to its originating NMS. This document specifies a mechanism to automatically
    map the configuration modifications to their source, up to a specific NMS service
    request, in the context of NETCONF. Such a mechanism is required for autonomous
    networks, to trace the reason of a particular configuration change that lead to
    an anomaly detection or a broken SLA. This mechanism facilitates the troubleshooting,
    the post mortem analysis, and in the end the closed loop automation required for
    self-healing networks. The specifications contain a new YANG module mapping a
    local configuration change to the corresponding northbound transaction, up to
    the controller or even the orchestrator.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case for conveying remote attestation
    information in association with Transport Layer Security (TLS) sessions in the
    context of AI agent communication. It focuses on long-lived secure channel sessions
    where an AI agent runtime posture, covering the platform Trusted Computing Base
    (TCB), agent manifest (models, tools and policies) and committed runtime context,
    can change frequently and unpredictably. The document highlights requirements
    for dynamic attestation so that relying parties can base authorization decisions
    on the current runtime posture of the communicating agent.</p>"

  content: "   This document describes a use case for conveying remote attestation\n
    \  information in association with Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n   sessions
    in the context of AI agent communication.  It focuses on\n   long-lived secure
    channel sessions where an AI agent runtime posture,\n   covering the platform
    Trusted Computing Base (TCB), agent manifest\n   (models, tools and policies)
    and committed runtime context, can\n   change frequently and unpredictably.  The
    document highlights\n   requirements for dynamic attestation so that relying parties
    can base\n   authorization decisions on the current runtime posture of the\n   communicating
    agent.\n\n\t "

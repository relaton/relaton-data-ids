  content: "The principle intention of this specification is to facilitate the \ndeployment
    of a completely internationalized domain name syntax \nand service which new protocols,
    applications and host systems can \nuse, but without disrupting the existing infrastructure.
    Towards \nthat end, this document describes a series of elective \nencapsulation
    services and protocol extensions which cumulatively \nallow internationalized
    domain names to be stored and transmitted \nin the existing DNS message and within
    application data streams, \naccording to the compliance level of the participating
    systems. \n\n\t "

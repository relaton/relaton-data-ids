  content: "This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in RFC 3979.  Specifically,
    when third party Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) disclosures are made, the
    intention is that the IETF Executive Director notify the IPR holder that a third
    party disclosure has been filed, and to ask the IPR holder whether they have any
    disclosure that needs to be made, per applicable RFC 3979 rules.  This document
    specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

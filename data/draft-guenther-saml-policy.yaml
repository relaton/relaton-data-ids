- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Rules of an authorization policy prescribe under which conditions an\n
    \  entity or subject has which permissions.  Existing policies support\n   identity-based
    authorization by matching the authenticated identity\n   of the entity requesting
    access to a resource with the available\n   policies.  This document is about
    formulating policy rules that\n   express conditions with respect to SAML assertions,
    thereby\n   supporting non-identity-based authorization and anonymity.\n\t "

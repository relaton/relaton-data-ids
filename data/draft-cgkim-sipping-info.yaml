  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes the INFO usage for IP-surveillance\n   application.
    SIP is used as a means of incorporating terminals of\n   different vendors. In
    this draft, mid-control\n   commands, for example, retrieving server images or
    saving images in\n   the server are defined and delivered as session names of
    INVITE messages.\n   IN addition to that, INFO definitions specific to the\n   application
    are described. For example, camera control like PTZ(Pen,\n   Tilt, Zoom) information
    is defined for the purpose of\n   standardization of controls. \n\t "

  content: "This document presents an application framework and associated use\ncases
    to help define the scope of the SDNP working group. The use cases\nstart with
    an abstract representation of a multi-tier application and\nillustrate the composition
    of a network service that can meet the\nrequirements of the particular application.
    The service composition\nprocess is split into several steps, including application
    requirement\nspecification, network mapping, service binding, and policy control.
    We\nalso provide examples of interactions between an SDNP controller and L2\nand
    L3 control layer protocols in order to deliver the end-to-end\nservice. Finally,
    as a derivate of that, an architecture framework for\nSDNP that meets these requirements
    is proposed.\n\n\t "

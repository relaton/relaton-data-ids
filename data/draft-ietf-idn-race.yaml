  content: "This document describes a transformation method for representing\nnon-ASCII
    characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completely\ncompatible with
    the current DNS. It is a potential candidate for an\nASCII-Compatible Encoding
    (ACE) for internationalized host names, as\ndescribed in the comparison document
    from the IETF IDN Working Group.\nThis method is based on the observation that
    many internationalized\nhost name parts will have all their characters in one
    row of the ISO\n10646 repertoire.\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes CTFRC (Coupon TFRC), an end-to-end congestion\ncontrol
    mechanism friendly to both continuous streams and TCP flows,\nbased on the modification
    of TFRC protocol and RED protocol. Taking \naccount of the specific requirements
    of continuous streams, CTFRC \nprotocol introduces a coupon function into TFRC
    to represent the \nbandwidth utilization of each stream, and revises RED to adjust
    drop \nprobability according to the coupon value carried in each packet header.\nIt
    inherits the merits of TFRC and promotes the QoS for continuous \nstreams to a
    much higher level.\n\n\t "

  content: "The simple mode for Internet fax described in [1] relies on\n  transmission
    of documents using a minimum feature set to achieve\n  interoperability between
    sender and receiver.  Proposals for\n  extended Internet fax [2,3] aim to provide
    for transmission of\n  enhanced documents (e.g. higher resolutions, colour) by
    employing\n  mechanisms to identify recipient capabilities to the sender, in the\n
    \ same fashion as traditional Group 3 fax [4].\n \n  This memo describes some
    of the scenarios for capability exchange\n  in Internet fax, taking account of
    the particular nature and goals\n  of the application [5], with a view to informing
    the debate over\n  what mechanisms should be used for this purpose.\n\t "

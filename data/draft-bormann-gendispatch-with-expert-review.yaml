  content: "   This document updates RFC 8126, adding registry policies that augment\n
    \  an existing policy that is based on a review body action with the\n   additional
    requirement for a Designated Expert review.\n\n   It also updates RFC 7120 with
    the necessary process to perform early\n   allocations for registries with one
    of the augmented policies.\n\n   To support its objectives for the period of time
    while the above\n   updates have not yet been finalized, this document offers
    text that\n   can be copy-pasted into specifications that want to make use of
    the\n   augmented policies.\n\n\n   // —— Editors' note: —— As to augmenting existing
    policies, the\n   // provided proposals have been considered in\n   // [I-D.baber-ianabis-rfc8126bis]
    within the IANABIS Working Group.\n   // This topic is covered by Section 2 of
    our draft and there is a\n   // placeholder \"ADD NEW PROCEDURE\" about it at
    Section 4 of\n   // [I-D.baber-ianabis-rfc8126bis].  However, compared to our
    draft,\n   // this is not augmenting the policy \"IESG Approval\".  On the topic\n
    \  // of early registration covered by Section 3 of our draft, we were\n   //
    under the impression that something similar could be argued about\n   // it too,
    but not quite (yet).  Looking at\n   // [I-D.baber-ianabis-rfc7120bis], there
    seems to be no text or\n   // placeholders on that topic yet.  We expect such
    text to come in\n   // the future, to ensure that the early allocation procedure
    is fully\n   // specified also for registries that use the augmented policies.\n\n\t "

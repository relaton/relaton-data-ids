  content: "This document redefines selected ICMP messages to support multi-part operation.
    A multi-part ICMP message carries all of the information that ICMP messages carried
    previously, as well as additional information that applications may require.\n\n
    Multi-part messages are supported by an ICMP extension structure. The extension
    structure is situated at the end of the ICMP message. It includes an extension
    header followed by one or more extension objects. Each extension object contains
    an object header and object payload. All object headers share a common format.\n\n
    This document further redefines the above mentioned ICMP messages by specifying
    a length attribute. All of the currently defined ICMP messages to which an extension
    structure can be appended include an \"original datagram\" field. The \"original
    datagram\" field contains the initial octets of the datagram that elicited the
    ICMP error message. Although the original datagram field is of variable length,
    the ICMP message does not include a field that specifies its length. Therefore,
    in order to facilitate message parsing, this document allocates eight previously
    reserved bits to reflect the length of the \"original datagram\" field.\n\n The
    proposed modifications change the requirements for ICMP compliance. The impact
    of these changes on compliant implementations is discussed, and new requirements
    for future implementations are presented.\n\n This memo updates RFC 792 and RFC
    4443. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

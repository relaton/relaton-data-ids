  content: "QTP is a simple protocol for multiplexing short-duration connections\nover
    an arbitrary transport service such as UDP.  QTP is an open\nstandard to allow
    dial-up Credit Authorization Terminals (CAT) or\nPoint-Of-Sale (POS) terminals
    to connect into IP hosts.\n\nThese transactions require fast connection times,
    efficient\nconcentration of many sessions, fault tolerant operation, and the\nability
    to transfer access network addressing (called and calling\nnumbers) along with
    transaction data.\n\t "

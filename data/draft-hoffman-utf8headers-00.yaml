  content: "Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of these\nusers
    throughout the world have names that are not normally represented\nby the users
    with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would therefore like to use
    their real names in their mailbox names. These users are also likely to use non-ASCII
    text in their common names and subjects of email messages, both in what they send
    and what they receive. This protocol specifies how to represent all headers\nof
    email messages encoded in UTF-8.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per\nconnection,
    yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The\nsimultaneous use of these
    multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would\nimprove resource usage within the network,
    and thus improve user\nexperience through higher throughput and improved resilience
    to\nnetwork failure.\n\nMultipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use
    multiple\npaths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to\ntraditional
    TCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers\nthe same type of service
    to applications as TCP - reliable bytestream\n- and provides the components necessary
    to establish and use multiple\nTCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.\n\t "

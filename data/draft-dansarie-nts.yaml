  content: "   This memo specifies Network Time Security (NTS), a mechanism for\n
    \  using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Authenticated Encryption\n   with
    Associated Data (AEAD) to provide cryptographic security for the\n   client-server
    mode of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).\n\n   NTS is structured as a suite of
    two loosely coupled sub-protocols:\n   the NTS Key Establishment Protocol (NTS-KE)
    and the NTS Extension\n   Fields for NTPv4.  NTS-KE handles NTS service authentication,
    initial\n   handshaking, and key extraction over TLS.  Encryption and\n   authentication
    during NTP time synchronization is performed through\n   the NTS Extension Fields
    in otherwise standard NTP packets.  Except\n   for during the initial NTS-KE process,
    all state required by the\n   protocol is held by the client in opaque cookies.\n\n\t "

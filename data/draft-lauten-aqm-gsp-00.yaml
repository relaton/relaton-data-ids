  content: "   Transmission capacity sharing TCP flows tend to synchronize among\n
    \  each other. This way rate variations of the individual flows, which\n   are
    caused by the congestion control algorithms, do not even out. The\n   effect is
    known as global synchronization. Large queuing buffer\n   demand and large latency
    and jitter are the consequences. Global\n   Synchronization Protection (GSP) is
    an extension of regular tail drop\n   packet queuing schemes that prevents global
    synchronization. For\n   large traffic aggregates the de-correlation between the
    individual\n   flow variations reduces buffer demand and packet sojourn time by
    an\n   order of magnitude and more. Even though quite simple, the solution\n   has
    a theoretical rationale and is not heuristic, and it has been\n   tested with
    a Linux implementation.\n\n\t "

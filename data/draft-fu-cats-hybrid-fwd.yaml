  content: "   This document proposes a hybrid forwarding mechanism for CATS\n   (Computing-Aware
    Traffic Steering).  The mechanism integrates the\n   CATS forwarding table with
    the IP forwarding table, optimizing the\n   utilization of forwarding table capacity.
    \ By customizing the\n   forwarding model based on service identifiers, it can
    accommodate\n   both experience-sensitive and non-experience-sensitive services.\n
    \  Additionally, it supports flow-granularity load balancing, enhancing\n   the
    utilization of computing and networking resources while ensuring\n   differentiated
    service requirements are satisfied.\n\n\t "

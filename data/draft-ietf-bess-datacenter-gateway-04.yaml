  content: "   Data centers are critical components of the infrastructure used by\n
    \  network operators to provide services to their customers.  Data\n   centers
    are attached to the Internet or a backbone network by gateway\n   routers.  One
    data center typically has more than one gateway for\n   commercial, load balancing,
    and resiliency reasons.\n\n   Segment Routing is a popular protocol mechanism
    for use within a data\n   center, but also for steering traffic that flows between
    two data\n   center sites.  In order that one data center site may load balance\n
    \  the traffic it sends to another data center site, it needs to know\n   the
    complete set of gateway routers at the remote data center, the\n   points of connection
    from those gateways to the backbone network, and\n   the connectivity across the
    backbone network.\n\n   Segment Routing may also be operated in other domains,
    such as access\n   networks.  Those domains also need to be connected across backbone\n
    \  networks through gateways.\n\n   This document defines a mechanism using the
    BGP Tunnel Encapsulation\n   attribute to allow each gateway router to advertise
    the routes to the\n   prefixes in the Segment Routing domains to which it provides
    access,\n   and also to advertise on behalf of each other gateway to the same\n
    \  Segment Routing domain.\n\n\t "

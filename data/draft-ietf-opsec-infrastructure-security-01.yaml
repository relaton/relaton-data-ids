  content: "   This RFC describes best current practices for implementing Service\n
    \  Provider network infrastructure protection for network elements.\n   This RFC
    complements and extends RFC 2267 and RFC 3704.  RFC 2267\n   provides guidelines
    for filtering traffic on the ingress to service\n   provider networks.  RFC 3704
    expands the recommendations described in\n   RFC 2267 to address operational filtering
    guidelines for single and\n   multi-homed environments.  The focus of those RFCs
    is on filtering\n   packets on ingress to a network, regardless of destination,
    if those\n   packets have a spoofed source address, or if the source address fall\n
    \  within \"reserved\" address space.  Deployment of RFCs 2267 and 3704\n   has
    limited the effects of denial of service attacks by dropping\n   ingress packets
    with spoofed source addresses, which in turn offers\n   other benefits by ensuring
    that packets coming into a network\n   originate from validly allocated and consistent
    sources.  This\n   document focuses solely on traffic destined to elements of
    the the\n   network infrastructure itself.  This document presents techniques\n
    \  that, together with network edge ingress filtering and RFC 2267 and\n   RFC
    3704, provides a defense in depth approach for infrastructure\n   protection.
    \ This document does not present recommendations for\n   protocol validation (i.e.
    \"sanity checking\") nor does it address\n   guidelines for general security configuration.\n\n\t "

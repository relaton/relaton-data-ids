  content: "   This document updates RFC6761 with the goal of ensuring that\n   \"localhost\"
    can be safely relied upon as a name for the local host's\n   loopback interface.
    \ To that end, stub resolvers are required to\n   resolve localhost names to loopback
    addresses.  Recursive DNS servers\n   are required to return \"NXDOMAIN\" when
    queried for localhost names,\n   making non-conformant stub resolvers more likely
    to fail and produce\n   problem reports that result in updates.\n\n   Together,
    these requirements would allow applications and\n   specifications to join regular
    users in drawing the common-sense\n   conclusions that \"localhost\" means \"localhost\",
    and doesn't resolve\n   to somewhere else on the network.\n\n\t "

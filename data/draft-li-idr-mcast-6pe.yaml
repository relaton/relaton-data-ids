  content: "   This document defines a new Network Layer Reachability Information\n
    \  (NLRI), called as the MCAST-6PE NLRI.  The MCAST-6PE NLRI is used to\n   interconnect
    IPv6 C-Multicast islands over a Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS)-enabled
    IPv4 cloud.  This approach relies on IPv6\n   Provider Edge routers (6PE), which
    can exchange the IPv6 C-Multicast\n   reachability information transparently over
    the core using the\n   Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4.
    \ This\n   document describes the BGP encodings and procedures for exchanging\n
    \  the information elements required by IPv6 Multicast in 6PE.  MPLS-\n   based
    Service Providers may use the 6PE Multicast mechanism to\n   provide IPv6 Multicast
    service for customers.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "The NSIS working group is considering protocols for signaling for \nresources
    for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The \nrequirements for such
    signaling are being developed in [2] and a \nframework in [3]. The framework describes
    a 2-layer protocol \narchitecture, with a common lower NSIS 'transport' layer
    protocol \n(NTLP) supporting a variety of upper layer NSIS signaling layer \nprotocols
    (NSLPs). \nIt is an open issue where within this architecture to place the \nresponsibility
    for handling overload conditions. These conditions \nrelate both to overload of
    the IP layer itself, as well as overload \nof buffer/processing resources within
    the NTLP/NSLPs. This note \ndiscusses the requirements and the implications of
    various \napproaches, and proposes a way forwards. \n\t "

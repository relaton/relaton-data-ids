  script: Latn
  content: "   TCP option space is scarce resource as its max length is limited to\n
    \  40 bytes.  This limitation becomes more significant in SYN segments\n   as
    all options used in a connection should be exchanged during SYN\n   negotiations.
    \ This document proposes a new SYN option negotiation\n   scheme that provide
    a feature to compress TCP options in SYN segments\n   and provide more option
    space.  The proposed scheme does not update\n   the format of TCP header nor transmit
    any additional SYN or SYN-like\n   segments so that it has lower risks for middlebox
    interventions.  In\n   addition, by combining another proposal for option space
    extension,\n   it is possible to provide further option space.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 /127 prefix
    lengths, especially on point-to-point links between routers.  Under certain situations,
    this may lead to one router claiming both addresses due to subnet-router anycast
    being implemented.  This document discusses the issue and offers a couple of solutions
    to the problem; nevertheless, /127 should be avoided between two routers.\n\t "

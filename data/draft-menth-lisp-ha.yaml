  content: "   Hybrid access (HA) allows simultaneous usage of multiple access\n   links.
    \ Advantages are increased bandwidth and improved resilience.\n   This document
    presents LISP Hybrid Access (LISP-HA), a mechanism to\n   provide HA based on
    LISP technology.  The document discusses\n   potential changes needed to perform
    dynamic load-balancing and per\n   packet load-balancing, which both increase
    the efficiency of HA.  To\n   that end, modified usage of some fields in the LISP
    header is\n   proposed.  Discussed use cases include the bundling of multiple\n
    \  access technologies for mobile devices and residential access\n   routers.
    \ Additionally, we provide some considerations how LISP-HA\n   can be deployed
    by providers.\n\n\t "

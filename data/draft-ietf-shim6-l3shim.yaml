  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a particular approach to IPv6 multihoming.\n
    \  The approach is based on using a multihoming shim placed between the\n   IP
    endpoint sublayer and the IP routing sublayer, and, at least\n   initially, using
    routable IP locators as the identifiers visible\n   above the shim layer.  The
    approach does not introduce a \"stack name\"\n   type of identifier, instead it
    ensures that all upper layer protocols\n   can operate unmodified in a multihomed
    setting while still seeing a\n   stable IPv6 address.\n\n   This document does
    not specify the mechanism for authenticating and\n   authorizing the \"rehoming\"
    - this is specified in the HBA document.\n   Nor does it specify the messages
    used to establish multihoming state.\n\n   The document does not even specify
    the packet format used for the\n   data packets.  Instead it discusses the issue
    of receive side\n   demultiplexing and the different tradeoffs.  The resolution
    of this\n   issue will affect the packet format for the data packets.\n\t "

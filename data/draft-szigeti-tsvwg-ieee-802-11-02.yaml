  content: "   As internet traffic is increasingly sourced-from and destined-to\n
    \  wireless endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service be aligned\n   between
    wired and wireless networks; however, this is not always the\n   case by default.
    \ This is due to the fact that two independent\n   standards bodies provide QoS
    guidance on wired and wireless networks:\n   specifically, the IETF specifies
    standards and design recommendations\n   for wired IP networks, while a separate
    and autonomous standards-\n   body, the IEEE, administers the standards for wireless
    802.11\n   networks.  The purpose of this document is to propose a set\n   Differentiated
    Services Code Point (DSCP) to IEEE 802.11 User\n   Priority (UP) mappings to reconcile
    the marking recommendations\n   offered by these two standards bodies, and, as
    such, to optimize\n   wired-and-wireless interconnect QoS.\n\n\t "

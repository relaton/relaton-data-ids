  content: "This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements and\n   captures
    discussions for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration\n   Protocol (LCP).  This
    protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain\n   location information, by value
    or by reference, from a Location\n   Information Server (LIS) that is located
    in the access network.  The\n   obtained location information can then be used
    for a variety of\n   different protocols and purposes.  For example, it can be
    used as\n   input to the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) or to\n
    \  convey location within SIP to other entities.\n\t "

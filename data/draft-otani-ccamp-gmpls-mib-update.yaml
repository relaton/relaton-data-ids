  content: "   This memo describes the necessity of generalized multi-protocol label
    \n   switching (GMPLS) management information base (MIB) family update. \n   Since
    the establishment of basic GMPLS protocol specifications, \n   additional functionalities
    has been proposed and standardized so far, \n   such as recovery, call support,
    optical transport network (OTN) \n   support and so forth. Coinciding with these
    additional specifications, \n   GMPLS MIB family is also desired to be updated
    to manage GMPLS \n   networks appropriately. This document is to clarify missing
    pieces in \n   currently defined GMPLS MIB family due to the enhancement of original
    \n   GMPLS protocols. \n\n\t "

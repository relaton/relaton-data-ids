  content: "   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) today is defined by\n   RFC
    8610, RFC 9165, RFC 9682, and draft-ietf-cbor-cddl-more-control\n   (RFC-to-be
    9741).  RFC 9165 and the latter (as well as some more\n   application specific
    specifications such as RFC 9090) have used the\n   extension point provided in
    RFC 8610, the control operator.\n\n   As CDDL is used in larger projects, feature
    requirements become known\n   that cannot be easily mapped into this single extension
    point.\n   Hence, there is a need for evolution of the base CDDL specification\n
    \  itself.\n\n   The present document provides a roadmap towards a \"CDDL 2.0\";
    it is\n   intended to serve as a basis for implementations that evolve with the\n
    \  concept of CDDL 2.0.  It is based on draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-freezer,\n   but
    is more selective in what potential features it takes up and more\n   detailed
    in their discussion.  This document is intended to evolve\n   over time; it might
    spawn specific documents and then retire, or it\n   might eventually be published
    as a roadmap document.\n\n\t "

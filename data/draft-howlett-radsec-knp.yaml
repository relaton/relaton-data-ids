  content: "   The Key Negotiation Protocol enables an untrusting RADIUS client and\n
    \  RADIUS server to derive a key by reference to a mutually trusted\n   actor
    called the Introducer.  This key may subsequently be used for\n   one of two purposes.
    \ First, it can credential a TLS PSK ciphersuite\n   applied to a RadSec connection
    between the RADIUS client and RADIUS\n   server; or secondly, to establish a trust
    relationship between the\n   RADIUS client and a second Introducer that is trusted
    by the first\n   Introducer.\n\n   The composition of these capabilities enables
    a RADIUS client to\n   establish a RadSec connection with any RADIUS server with
    whom it\n   shares a direct or indirect trust relationship via one or more\n   Introducers.\n\n\t "

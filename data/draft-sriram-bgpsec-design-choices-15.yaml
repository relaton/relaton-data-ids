  content: "   This document is written to capture the design rationale primarily\n
    \  for the individual draft-00 version of BGPsec protocol specification\n   [I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol].
    \ However, where appropriate, the\n   document also provides brief notes on design
    decisions that changed\n   (relative to individual draft-00 version) in the finalized
    protocol\n   specification [RFC8205].  The notes mention what the differences
    are\n   and provide pointers to where the details and/or rationale can be\n   found
    about those changes in design.  The document lists the\n   decisions that were
    made in favor of or against each design choice,\n   and presents brief summaries
    of the arguments that aided the decision\n   process.\n\n\t "

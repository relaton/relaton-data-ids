  content: "   The issue concerns auditing financial records from several sources\n
    \  over time. To validate proper legal money usage and flow is a\n   difficult
    task. Each financial institution has non-common reporting\n   methods. Seek to
    create a common export record to merge transactions\n   and easily sort by date
    , time , and institution. The first goal is\n   to create a traceability file
    of transactions. The second goal is to\n   create a \"simple\" standard record
    for \"anyone\" to sift and sort\n   records.\n\n\t "

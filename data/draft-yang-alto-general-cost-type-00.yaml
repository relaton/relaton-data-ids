  content: "   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has defined\n
    \  both the endpoint cost service (ECS) and cost maps to provide\n   information
    to applications about network path properties (e.g.,\n   routingcost) from a set
    of source network points to a set of\n   destination network points, where each
    network point can be a single\n   endpoint (in ECS) or a PID which represents
    a set of endpoints (in a\n   cost map).  Considering, conceptually, both ECS and
    cost map as\n   returning a matrix, indexed by sources and destinations as row
    and\n   column, the current ALTO protocol [RFC7285] allows the elements in\n   the
    matrix to be only scalar (i.e., numerical or ordinal).  This,\n   however, is
    limiting in many use cases.  This document discuss\n   multiple use cases where
    scalar-elements can be limitations.  It then\n   defines new cost types to allow
    general cost types, such as vectors\n   to represent use cases such path vectors.\n\n\n\t "

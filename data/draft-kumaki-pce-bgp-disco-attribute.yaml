  content: "Connectivity between customer sites in an IP Virtual Private Network\n(VPN)
    supported by BGP/MPLS may be achieved using MPLS Traffic\nEngineered (TE) Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs). The paths of these LSPs\nmust be computed to provide the
    end-to-end connectivity desired, and\nthe paths selected may depend upon the VPN
    being served, and the\nlocation and reachability of target addresses within customer
    sites.\n\nThe Path Computation Element (PCE) is a server that can compute the\npaths
    of TE LSPs in an MPLS network. Where one or more VPNs is\nsupported over a core
    network, different PCEs may serve computations\nfor different VPNs.\n\nPCE discovery
    allows a Path Computation Client (PCC) to determine\nwhich PCEs are available
    to service its computation requests.\nUsing an IGP to distribute PCE discovery
    information for VPN use\nwould result in the information being needlessly flooded
    to all core\nnodes regardless of whether they are aware of the VPN. These nodes
    do\nnot need to be aware of per-VPN PCE function. This document describes\nhow
    BGP can be used to distribute PCE discovery information\nspecifically for use
    in VPN path computation.\n\t "

  content: "The Switch Broadcast Control and Delivery (SBCD) protocol is part of the
    InterSwitch Message Protocol (ISMP).  ISMP was designed to facilitate interswitch
    communication within distributed connection-oriented switching networks.  The
    SBCD protocol is used to reduce the amount of broadcast traffic across the switch
    fabric by restricting unresolved broadcast packets to only those ports that belong
    to the same VLAN as the source.\n\t "

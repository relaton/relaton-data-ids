- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Autonomous agents increasingly maintain durable persistent state\n
    \  containing user preferences, embedding vectors, safety logs,\n   intermediate
    reasoning steps, and audit traces.  Today, agent\n   frameworks treat storage
    as a generic file system, while storage\n   administrators treat agents as stateless
    virtual machines.  This\n   \"layer mismatch\" leads to fragility, poor performance,
    and privacy\n   risks.\n\n   The Agent Persistent State (APS) Profile defines
    an experimental,\n   vendor-neutral storage service class for durable agent state.
    \ APS\n   emphasizes *compliance*: ensuring that memory associated with a\n   specific
    user or agent identity can be retained, audited, and\n   cryptographically erased.
    \ APS also addresses high-frequency small I/\n   O, vector index workloads, crash
    consistency, and Kubernetes/CSI\n   [CSI] integration.\n\n   APS introduces a
    Usage Class (\"AgentPersistentState\"), a versioned\n   PersistentStateLineOfService
    schema, guidance for container\n   orchestration systems, non-normative bindings
    for Swordfish\n   [Swordfish] and Redfish [Redfish], and considerations for multi-\n
    \  tenancy.  APS is intended as an Experimental RFC to gather\n   implementation
    feedback prior to any standards-track work.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: '<p>Autonomous agents increasingly maintain durable persistent state containing
    user preferences, embedding vectors, safety logs, intermediate reasoning steps,
    and audit traces. Today, agent frameworks treat storage as a generic file system,
    while storage administrators treat agents as stateless virtual machines. This
    "layer mismatch" leads to fragility, poor performance, and privacy risks. The
    Agent Persistent State (APS) Profile defines an experimental, vendor-neutral storage
    service class for durable agent state. APS emphasizes *compliance*: ensuring that
    memory associated with a specific user or agent identity can be retained, audited,
    and cryptographically erased. APS also addresses high-frequency small I/ O, vector
    index workloads, crash consistency, and Kubernetes/CSI [CSI] integration. APS
    introduces a Usage Class ("AgentPersistentState"), a versioned PersistentStateLineOfService
    schema, guidance for container orchestration systems, non-normative bindings for
    Swordfish [Swordfish] and Redfish [Redfish], and considerations for multi- tenancy.
    APS is intended as an Experimental RFC to gather implementation feedback prior
    to any standards-track work.</p>'

  content: "   The companion draft [I-D.zzhang-dmm-5g-distributed-upf] has described\n
    \  the 5G mobile user plane (MUP) via the refinement of distributed\n   UPFs,
    along with various user plane implementations that some vendors\n   and operators
    are exploring, with the requirement of not introducing\n   changes to 3GPP architecture
    & signaling.  The document 3GPP TS\n   23.247 [_3GPP-23.247] for 5G multicast
    and broadcast services, or\n   5MBS, specifies the 5GS architecture to support
    MBS communication.\n   Thanks to the addition of new 5GS network functions (NFs)
    and MB-\n   interfaces on 5G CP & UP, this might post additional provisioning
    &\n   implementation challenges to the underlay transport infrastructure.\n\n
    \  This document is not an attempt to do 3GPP SDO work in IETF.\n   Instead, it
    discusses how to potentially integrate distributed UPFs\n   with the delivery
    of 5MBS communication, as well as the benefits of\n   using distributed UPFs to
    handle 5MBS traffic delivery.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document analyses the routing requirements of different types
    of \n   clients, and then proposes a P2P client routing mechanism for    REsource
    LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD). This mechanism is designed \n   to solve the
    issues in one of the client routing options described in \n   the RELOAD Base
    protocol [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base], where clients are \n   allowed to connect with
    arbitrary peers. The solution is to store the \n   information of a client's Attached
    Peer in the overlay together with \n   the registration data of the client. The
    extension could be deployed \n   on SIP usage of RELOAD easily [I-D.draft-ietf-p2psip-sip].

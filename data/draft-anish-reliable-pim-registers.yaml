  content: "   This document introduces a hard-state, reliable transport for the\n
    \  existing PIM-SM registers states.  This eliminates the needs for\n   periodic
    NULL-registers and register-stop in response to each data-\n   register or NULL-registers.\n\n
    \  This specification uses the existing PIM reliability mechanisms\n   defined
    by PIM Over Reliable Transport [RFC6559].  This is simply a\n   means to transmit
    reliable PIM messages and does not require the\n   support for Join/Prune messages
    over PORT as defined in [RFC6559].\n\n\n\t "

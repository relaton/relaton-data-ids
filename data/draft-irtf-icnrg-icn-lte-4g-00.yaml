  script: Latn
  content: "   LTE, 4G mobile networks use IP based transport for control plane to\n
    \  establish the data session and user plane for actual data delivery.\n   In
    existing architecture, IP transport used in user plane is not\n   optimized for
    data transport, which leads to an inefficient data\n   delivery. IP unicast routing
    from server to clients is used for\n   delivery of multimedia content to User
    Equipment (UE), where each\n   user gets a separate stream. From bandwidth and
    routing perspective\n   this approach is inefficient. Multicast and broadcast
    technologies\n   have emerged recently for mobile networks, but their deployments
    are\n   very limited or at an experimental stage due to complex architecture\n
    \  and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly emerging technology with\n   built-in
    features for efficient multimedia data delivery, however\n   majority of the work
    is focused on fixed networks. The main focus of\n   this draft is on native deployment
    of ICN in cellular mobile networks\n   by using ICN in 3GPP protocol stack. ICN
    has an inherent capability\n   for multicast, anchorless mobility, security and
    it is optimized for\n   data delivery using local caching at the edge. The proposed\n
    \  approaches in this draft allow ICN to be enabled natively over the\n   current
    LTE stack comprising of PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY or in a dual stack\n   mode (along with
    IP) help optimize the mobile networks by leveraging\n   the inherent benefits
    of ICN.\n\n\t "

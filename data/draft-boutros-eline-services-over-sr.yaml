- language: en

  content: "   This document proposes a new approach for realizing Ethernet line\n
    \  (E-Line) services over Segment Routing (SR) networks.  This approach\n   significantly
    improves scalability and convergence of control plane,\n   and simplifies network
    operation.  Furthermore, it naturally yields\n   All-Active multi-homing support
    for E-Line services without relying\n   on any overlay techniques.\n\n\t "

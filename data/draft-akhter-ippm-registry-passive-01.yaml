  content: "   This memo defines the Passive Performance Metrics sub-registry of the\n
    \  Performance Metric Registry.  This sub-registry will contain Passive\n   Performance
    Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the\n   IP Performance Metrics
    (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and possibly\n   applicable to other IETF metrics.\n\n
    \  IPPM Passive metric registration is meant to allow wider adoption of\n   common
    metrics in an inter-operable way.  There are challenges with\n   metric interoperability
    and adoption (to name a few) due to flexible\n   input parameters, confusion between
    many similar metrics, and varying\n   output formats.\n\n   This memo proposes
    a way to organize registry entries into columns\n   that are well-defined, permitting
    consistent development of entries\n   over time (a column may be marked NA if
    it is not applicable for that\n   metric).  The design is intended to foster development
    of registry\n   entries based on existing reference RFCs, whilst each column serves\n
    \  as a check-list item to avoid omissions during the registration\n   process.
    \ Every entry in the registry, before IANA action, requires\n   Expert review
    as defined by concurrent IETF work in progress\n   \"Registry for Performance
    Metrics\" (draft-manyfolks-ippm-metric-\n   registry).\n\n   The document contains
    example entries for the Passive Performance\n   Metrics sub-registry: a registry
    entry for a passive metric based on\n   octetTotalCount as defined in RFC5102
    and a protocol specific passive\n   metric based on RTP packets lost as defined
    in RFC3550.  The examples\n   are for Informational purposes and do not create
    any entry in the\n   IANA registry.\n\n\n\t "

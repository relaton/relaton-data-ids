  content: "   This document describes a method for enabling and configuring network\n
    \  access for IoT devices that are first authenticated at a server.\n   This server
    may be run by the manufacturer of the IoT device as an\n   online cloud service.
    \ This specification is intended for off-the-\n   shelf IoT devices that have
    just been purchased by the user.  Many of\n   these devices have only limited
    user interfaces that can be used for\n   configuring network access credentials.
    \ The device configuration is\n   also made more challenging by the fact that
    these devices may exist\n   in large numbers.\n\n\t "

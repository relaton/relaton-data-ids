  content: "Unwanted Email ('SPAM') is a constantly growing scourge of the \nInternet.
    \ SPAM takes full advantage of the open system that was \ncreated in the spirit
    of cooperation that represents the original \nunderpinnings of the Internet.\n\nUnderstanding
    that making airtight mail systems without completely \ndestroying old software,
    the authors of this proposal considered the \ncontinued operation of these legacy
    systems while tightening up the \ncurrent standards.  This new proposal calls
    for a new DNS resource \nrecord type and a new standard of operation for organization
    mail-\nexchangers.  Using this new resource record along with other standard \nDNS
    resources provides system operators to minimize exploitable inbound \nSPAM pathways
    into their systems.\n\t "

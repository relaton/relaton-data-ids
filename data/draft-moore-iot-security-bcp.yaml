  content: "   In recent years, embedded computing devices have increasingly been\n
    \  provided with Internet interfaces, and the typically-weak network\n   security
    of such devices has become a challenge for the Internet\n   infrastructure.  This
    document lists a number of minimum requirements\n   that vendors of Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices need to take into\n   account during development and when
    producing firmware updates, in\n   order to reduce the frequency and severity
    of security incidents in\n   which such devices are implicated.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile nodes (e.g., aircraft of various configurations, terrestrial
    vehicles, seagoing vessels, space systems, enterprise wireless devices, pedestrians
    with cell phones, etc.) communicate with networked correspondents over wireless
    and/or wired-line data links and configure mobile routers to connect end user
    networks. A multilink virtual interface specification is presented that enables
    mobile nodes to coordinate with a network-based mobility service, fixed node correspondents
    and/or other mobile node peers. The virtual interface provides an adaptation layer
    service that also applies for more static deployments such as enterprise and home
    networks. This document specifies the transmission of IP packets over Overlay
    Multilink Network (OMNI) Interfaces.</p>"

  content: "   This document elaborates a threat model for inherent backdoor in a\n
    \  telecom router. We assume a malicious router can have inherent\n   backdoor
    with an interest in eavesdropping or disabling the\n   functioning of the router
    or the whole network. It is intended to\n   demonstrate to the system designers
    and network administrators how\n   the backdoor works, so as to assist in the
    security evaluation of the\n   routers, and especially the standard design that
    is immune to\n   inherent backdoors.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Standardization of Instant Message and Presence Protocols in the IETF\n
    \  has resulted in multiple protocols. There are significant industry\n   and
    technical advantages to standardizing a unified approach for\n   server-to-server
    Instant Messaging and Presence.  This document\n   proposes a server profile which
    uses SIP to exchange presence and\n   setup sessions, and XMPP for message transport.\n\t "

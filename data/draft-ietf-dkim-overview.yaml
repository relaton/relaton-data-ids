  content: "This document provides an overview of the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
    service and describes how it can fit into a messaging service.  It also describes
    how DKIM relates to other IETF message signature technologies.  It is intended
    for those who are adopting, developing, or deploying DKIM.  DKIM allows an organization
    to take responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be verified
    by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending
    site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can contain multiple
    signatures from the same or different organizations involved with the message.
    \ DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email,
    using public-key cryptography, with the domain name service as its key server
    technology (RFC 4871).  This permits verification of a responsible organization,
    as well as the integrity of the message contents.  DKIM also enables a mechanism
    that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email
    signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments
    about messages.  DKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global
    control of \"spam\" and \"phishing\".  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

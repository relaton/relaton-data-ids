  content: "   This document enumerates requirements for emergency calls in VoIP and\n
    \  general Internet multimedia systems.  We divide the requirements into\n   'trunk
    replacement' and 'end-to-end'.  Trunking solutions only\n   exchange the emergency
    call center's circuit-switched access by an\n   IP-based system.  The requirements
    for end-to-end IP-based emergency\n   calling address functional and security
    issues for determining the\n   correct emergency address, for identifying the
    appropriate emergency\n   call center and for identifying the caller and its location.
    \ While\n   we focus on systems that employ the Session Initiation Protocol\n
    \  (SIP), many of the requirements may also apply to other environments,\n   such
    as those using H.248/Megaco, MGCP or H.323.\n\t "

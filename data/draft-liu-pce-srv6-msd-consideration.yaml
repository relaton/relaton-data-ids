  content: "   This document analyzes the impact of different SRv6 MSDs when PCE\n
    \  sends SR-TE paths to the PCE.  And it updates the MSD restrictions in\n   RFC9603
    based on the analysis.  This document also specifies a\n   procedure for optimizing
    the number of SIDs in an SRv6-TE path that\n   PCE can compute when the reduced
    SRH mode is used.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the impact of different SRv6 MSDs when PCE sends
    SR-TE paths to the PCE. And it updates the MSD restrictions in RFC9603 based on
    the analysis. This document also specifies a procedure for optimizing the number
    of SIDs in an SRv6-TE path that PCE can compute when the reduced SRH mode is used.</p>"

  content: "   OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a communication protocol for\n
    \  industrial automation developed by the OPC Foundation. Compared with\n   OPC,
    OPC UA provides a complete set of security mechanisms to ensure\n   data confidentiality,
    data integrity and data availability. With the\n   development of industrial internet
    of things, more and more nodes\n   are expected to be implemented OPC UA, which
    are resource\n   constrained. This draft discusses OPC UA security mechanisms
    and the\n   applicability in a constrained environment. An outline of a\n   lightweight
    security mechanism for OPC UA using in constrained\n   device is proposed.\n\n\t "

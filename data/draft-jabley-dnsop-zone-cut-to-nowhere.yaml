  content: "   This document defines a standard means to signal that a zone cut\n
    \  exists in the DNS without specifying a set of nameservers to which a\n   child
    zone is delegated.  This is useful in situations where it is\n   important to
    make it clear to clients that a zone cut exists, but\n   when the child zone is
    only provisioned in a private namespace.\n\n\t "

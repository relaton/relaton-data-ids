  content: "   This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Native Short\n
    \  Address (NSA) that enables IP packet transmission over links where\n   the
    transmission of a full length address may not be desirable.\n   Furthermore, packet
    forwarding is stateless, meaning that no routing\n   table needs to be built,
    rather, the forwarding decision is based\n   solely on the destination address
    structure.  This document focuses\n   on carrying IP packets across an LLN (Low
    power and Lossy Network),\n   in which the topology is static, where nodes' location
    is fixed, and\n   the connection between nodes is also rather stable.  This\n
    \  specifications details the NSA architecture, address allocation,\n   forwarding
    mechanism, header format design, including length-variable\n   fields, and IPv6
    interconnection support.\n\n\t "

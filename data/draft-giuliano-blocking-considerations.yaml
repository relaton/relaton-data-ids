  content: "   Geopolitical conflicts can cause policy makers to question whether
    or\n   not blocking the Internet connectivity for an opposing region is a\n   constructive
    tactic.  This document provides an overview of the\n   various technologies that
    can be used to implement regional blocking\n   of Internet connectivity and discusses
    the implications of these\n   options.  This document does not advocate any policy
    or given\n   blocking mechanism, but does attempt to articulate the implications\n
    \  of these blocking technologies for policy makers.  The document also\n   intends
    to help inform policy makers from countries who could be\n   exposed to such blocking
    techniques on the implications of these\n   methods.\n\n\t "

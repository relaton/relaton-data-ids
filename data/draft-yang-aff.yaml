  content: "   Alert Filtration and Fusion (AFF) is proposed to solve the problems
    \n   of existing IMS(Intrusion Management System).  The Alert Filtration \n   is
    used to filtrate original alerts and reduce the alerts which are \n   obviously
    unavailable.  The Alert Fusion is used to reduce redundant \n   alerts and find
    the relationships of alerts.  The false positive \n   rate and false negative
    rate can be reduced by Alert Filtration and \n   Fusion.\n\t "

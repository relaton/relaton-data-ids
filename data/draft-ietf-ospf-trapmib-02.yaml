  content: "OSPF is an event driven routing protocol, where an event can be a change
    in an OSPF interface's link-level status, the expiration of an OSPF timer or the
    reception of an OSPF protocol packet.  Many of the actions that OSPF takes as
    a result of these events will result in a change of the routing topology.  As
    routing topologies become large and complex it is often difficult to locate the
    source of a topology change or unpredicted routing path by  polling a large number
    or routers.  Another approach is to notify a network manager of potentially critical
    OSPF events with SNMP traps.                                                    This
    draft document defines a set of traps, objects and mechanisms to enhance the ability
    to manage IP internetworks which use OSPF as its IGP.  It is meant as an extension
    to the OSPF MIB.\n\t "

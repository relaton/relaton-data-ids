  content: "   This method introduces a specification in the Mobile IPv6 MONAMI6\n
    \  work that allow nodes to bind a particular flow based on the service\n   port
    to a care-of address.  This method is different and more\n   flexible than a current
    solution in the Internet community in that\n   multiple ranges of ports and individual
    specific ports not in any\n   defined range may be specified within a single flow
    identification\n   message.  This is an idea that may be adopted or incorporated
    into\n   currently proposed MONAMI6 flow redirection proposals.\n\n\n\t "

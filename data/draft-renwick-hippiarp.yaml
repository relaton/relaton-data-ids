  content: "ANSI Standard X3.218-1993 (HIPPI-LE[3]) defines the encapsulation of IEEE
    802.2 LLC PDUs and, by implication, IP on HIPPI.  ANSI X3.222-1993 (HIPPI-SC[4])
    describes the operation of HIPPI physical switches.  The ANSI committee responsible
    for these standards chose to leave HIPPI networking issues largely outside the
    scope of their standards; this document describes one aspect of the use of HIPPI
    switches as IP local area networks.                  This draft is part of a split
    of RFC 1374, 'IP and ARP on HIPPI'.  RFC 1374 has been a Proposed Standard since
    November, 1992, with at least 10 implementations of IP encapsulation and HIPPI
    switch discipline.  No major changes to it are required.  However, the ARP part
    of RFC 1374 has not had sufficient implementation experience to be advanced to
    Draft Standard.  The present document contains the ARP material; the rest is retained
    in a separate document that is intended to remain on the standards track.\n\t "

  content: "   With the rapid development of large language models, it puts forward\n
    \  higher requirements for the networking scale of data centers.\n   Distributed
    model training has been proposed to shorten the training\n   time and relieve
    the resource demand in a single data center.This\n   document proposes a framework
    to address the challenge of efficient\n   lossless interconnection and reliable
    data transmission between\n   multiple data centers, which can connect multiple
    data centers to\n   form a larger cluster through network connection.  The document\n
    \  further conducts in-depth research on the key technologies and\n   application
    scenarios of this distributed AIDC network.\n\n\t "

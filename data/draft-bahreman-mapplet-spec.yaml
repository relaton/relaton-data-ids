  content: "The applets written in the Java programming [JAVA] language are becoming
    a household name on the World Wide Web.  Currently, web browsers are able to retrieve
    and display these applets.  This document describes a set of guidelines for conforming
    mail user agents to be able to send and display applets.  The applets are transferred
    within a MIME [MIME] message.  In order to do this, a new MIME subtype, Application/Applet,
    is being defined in this document.  We also discuss how other protocols for adding
    security to MIME objects could be used to provide additional security.\n\t "

  content: "The IETF 6LoWPAN working group has defined a number of optimizations\n
    \  to adapt traditional IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy\n   Networks
    (LLNs).  As these two ND protocols are incompatible, and\n   Neighbor Discovery
    has link-local scope, a side effect of these\n   optimizations is that communication
    between Full Function Devices\n   (FFDs) and 6LoWPAN nodes (6LNs) becomes impossible
    within the same\n   link, unless the proper proxy mechanisms are applied.  This
    document\n   specifies guidelines for such proxy mechanisms to enable transparent\n
    \  communication between FFDs and 6LNs within the same network link.\n\n\t "

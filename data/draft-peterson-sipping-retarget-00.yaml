  content: "   Retargeting, the alteration by intermediaries of the destination of
    a\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request, is a common practice\n   performed
    during the routing of a call.  Some forms of retargeting,\n   however, give rise
    to security problems and potential functional gaps\n   in SIP.  This document
    provides a general framework for discussion of\n   the security problems relating
    to retargeting, and gives requirements\n   for mechanisms that might overcome
    these problems.\n\t "

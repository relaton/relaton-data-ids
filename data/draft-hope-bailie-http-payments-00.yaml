  content: "   HTTP-Payments describes a mechanism for passing a standardized\n   payment
    request in the headers of an HTTP 402 response and the\n   expected behaviour
    of HTTP clients that receive such a response.\n\nFeedback\n\n   This specification
    is an early experiment in bringing the work of the\n   W3C Web Payments working
    group to the HTTP protocol.  It is\n   maintained at https://github.com/adrianhopebailie/http-payments
    [1].\n\n   The work is inspired by work in the Interledger community on\n   [HTTP-ILP]\n\n\t "

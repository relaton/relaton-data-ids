  content: "   The performance monitoring (PM) of BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private\n   Networks
    (L3VPN) is important for satisfying the Service Level\n   Agreement(SLA) for critical
    network services.  Since L3VPN is\n   essentially using a multipoint-to-point
    service model, flow\n   identification becomes a big challenge for L3VPN PM.  This
    document\n   specifies the framework and mechanisms for the application of PM
    in\n   L3VPN.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   The \"Historical\" category has been used to identify some documents
    in\n   the RFC Series for many years, but has never been precisely defined\n   except
    in various oral traditions.  More important, with one\n   exception that is now
    obsolete, the conditions under which documents\n   should be reclassified as Historic
    and the procedures for doing so\n   have never been defined, leading to a number
    of ad hoc and\n   inconsistent actions.  This document clarifies both the category
    and\n   procedures for putting documents into it.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document attempts to generate discussion on  methods to run  end\n
    \  2 end 'sensitive' protocols and capabilities, like IPSEC, on networks\n   that
    use Network Address Translators (NAT). The proposal does  so  by\n   outlining
    \ one  method  to bypass NAT, when the required capabilities\n   cannot be supported
    by NAT. The method uses a tunnel between a  local\n   host  and  the NAT box  in
    order to dynamically allocate addresses to\n   those hosts that need to communicate
    with external networks. With  an\n   allocated  external  address, the local hosts
    are able to communicate\n   with external hosts without breaking the end 2  end
    \ principle.  This\n   proposal  does  not  introduce  any  new  protocols, it
    simply reuses\n   existing protocols to provide an example solution.\n\n\t "

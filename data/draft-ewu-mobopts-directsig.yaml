  content: "   In Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes must complete Return Routability\n   Procedure
    and binding process before route optimization for data\n   packet transmission
    is performed.  This requires signaling exchange\n   between the mobile and correspondent
    node.  For the current\n   specification, signaling is restricted to be routed
    to the mobile's\n   and correspondent node's home addresses.\n\n   This document
    describes a mechanism to enable mobile and\n   correspondent nodes to send the
    signaling packets directly to their\n   care-of addresses.\n\t "

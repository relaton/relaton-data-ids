  content: "   This document describes Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions\n
    \  (VDAFs), a family of multi-party protocols for computing aggregate\n   statistics
    over user measurements.  These protocols are designed to\n   ensure that, as long
    as at least one aggregation server executes the\n   protocol honestly, individual
    measurements are never seen by any\n   server in the clear.  At the same time,
    VDAFs allow the servers to\n   detect if a malicious or misconfigured client submitted
    an input that\n   would result in an incorrect aggregate result.\n\n\t "

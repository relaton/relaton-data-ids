  content: "   This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application\n
    \  Protocol (CoAP).  The Publish Option is used by a CoAP Endpoint to\n   control
    the authority delegation of one of its resources to another\n   Endpoint.  All
    the phases of the authority delegation process (setup,\n   renewal, cancellation)
    are controlled by a simple RESTful protocol.\n\n   This memo also introduces the
    'proxies' Web Linking relation type, to\n   be used by a CoAP Proxy to explicitly
    advertise the resources that it\n   can serve - either from its cache, or by forwarding
    the Client's\n   request upstream.\n\n   The Publish Option and the 'proxies'
    relation provide the building\n   blocks for a comprehensive, in-protocol, solution
    to the sleepy/\n   intermittent Endpoint use case.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes the use of embedded trailer checksums in TCP,
    and proposes an extension to TCP to negotiate the use of embedded trailer checksums
    for a TCP connection.  Embedded trailer checksums reside in the last two octets
    of the segment's data field. The negotiation mechanism proposed in this document
    allows for new TCP implementations to exchange segments bearing embedded trailer
    checksums while still being able to inter-operate with TCP implementations that
    do not support them.      The performance gain achieved by assisting software's
    checksumming of TCP segments with hardware has been clearly demonstrated in some
    existing TCP  implementations.  The authors  claim that the price and performance
    gains achieved by providing hardware assists for Embedded Trailer Checksums are
    even greater.  These gains are particularly apparent when employed over segmenting
    links such as Fibre Channel and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).           TCP
    implementations that do not use hardware checksum assists will not suffer any
    performance penalty by supporting Embedded Trailer Checksums.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for LDPC-
    staircase codes that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined
    by the FECFRAME framework. These codes have many interesting properties: they
    are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases and
    they also feature very high encoding and decoding throughputs. LDPC-Staircase
    codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source flow,
    or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.
    They are also a good solution whenever the processing load of a software encoder
    or decoder must be kept to a minimum.</p>"

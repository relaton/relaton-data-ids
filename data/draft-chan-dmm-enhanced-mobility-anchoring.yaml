  content: "   This document initiates the discussion on enhanced mobility anchoring\n
    \  solutions in the context of a distributed mobility management\n   deployment.
    \ Such solutions consider the problem of assigning a\n   mobility anchor and a
    gateway at the initiation of a session.  In\n   addition, the mid-session switching
    of the mobility anchor in a\n   distributed mobility management environment is
    considered.\n\n\t "

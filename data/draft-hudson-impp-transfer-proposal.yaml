  content: "This document specifies transfer protocols for instant messages and\npresence
    information.  The Presence Information Transfer Protocol\n(PITP) allows clients
    to set presence information for presentities\nthey control and to request presence
    information from other\npresentities.  The Instant Message Transfer Protocol (IMTP)
    allows\nclients to send and receive instant messages.  Both protocols can also\nbe
    used to relay instant message and presence requests between servers\nas necessary.\nThese
    protocols are specified in the same document because they have\nvery similar structure.
    \ However, they are two logically separate\nprotocols.  Sections specific to one
    or the other protocol will be\nrecognizeable by a leading 'PITP' or 'IMTP'.\n\t "

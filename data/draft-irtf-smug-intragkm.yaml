  content: "This document describes a protocol for intra-domain group key\nmanagement
    for IP multicast security, based on the framework of\n[HCD00]. In order to support
    multicast groups, the domain is divided\ninto a number of administratively-scoped
    'areas'.  A host-member of\na multicast group is defined to reside within one
    (and only one) of\nthese areas.  The purpose of placing host-members in areas
    is to\nachieve flexible and efficient key management, particularly in the\nface
    of the problem of changes (joining, leaving, ejections) in the\nmembership of
    a multicast group. A separate administratively-scoped\narea control-group is defined
    for each (data) multicast group, for\nthe express purpose of key management and
    other control-message\ndelivery.\n\n\t "

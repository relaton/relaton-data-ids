  content: "   This document describes an attack vector, exemplified by the\n   \"DNSBomb\"
    attack, that leverages the emergent behavior of several\n   widely- implemented
    DNS resolver mechanisms.  By combining query\n   timeouts, query aggregation,
    and response timing, an attacker can\n   turn a set of resolvers into powerful
    amplifiers for a Pulsing\n   Denial-of-Service (PDoS) attack.  This attack is
    difficult to detect\n   due to its low average traffic rate but can be highly
    effective at\n   overwhelming a target's resources.\n\n   This document provides
    operational guidance and a set of best\n   practices for DNS resolver implementers
    and operators to mitigate\n   this threat.  The goal is to harden the DNS ecosystem
    by reducing the\n   potential for resolvers to be used in such a coordinated fashion,\n
    \  thereby improving the operational resilience of the DNS.\n\n\t "

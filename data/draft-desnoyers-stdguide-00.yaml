  content: "This document is a guide to Internet standards writers.  It is intended
    to capture some of those characteristics which have made certain standards clear,
    easy to interpret, and unambiguous.  At the same time, it singles out other usages
    which are believed to have led to unclear specifications and varying interpretations
    in the past.                                   This version of the document is
    a rough draft which is intended as a starting point for further discussion and
    addition by the working group.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies Mobile IP Regional Paging (MIRP), a small\nand
    link-layer independent extension to Mobile IP [2] with regional\nregistrations
    [3], to support power-constrained operation in the\nmobile nodes and to reduce
    routing state information in the visited\ndomain.  The extension allows a mobile
    node to enter a power saving\nidle mode during which its location is known with
    the coarse\naccuracy defined by a paging area. Downlink routes to idle mobile\nnodes
    terminate in a paging foreign agent, which re-establishes them\non demand by means
    of paging. This does not require snooping of data\npackets but is a natural extension
    to network-level routing.\nOptionally, the mobile node and the visited domain
    can agree on\ncommunication time slots used for Agent Advertisements and paging,\nto
    restrict link interface power-on time in the mobile node.\n\t "

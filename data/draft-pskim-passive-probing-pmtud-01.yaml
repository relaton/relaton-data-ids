  content: "   This draft consider a Path MTU Discovery(PMTUD) for QUIC. First, why\n
    \  it is important to determine the best PMTU for QUIC is explained, and\n   the
    active probing approach for discovering the best PMTU is briefly\n   introduced.
    Then, as an alternative to discover the best PMTU, the\n   passive probing approach
    is adopted. The process of discovering the\n   best PMTU is not carried out separately,
    but is carried out\n   simultaneously in the actual application data communication.
    A probe\n   packet is defined newly using 1-RTT packet which includes actual\n
    \  application data as well as a short packet header and a PING_EXT\n   frame.
    The PING_EXT frame is also defined newly. Until the best PMTU\n   is discovered,
    the size of the probe packet is changed according to\n   the size of the PMTU
    candidate. A simple discovery algorithm using\n   only the PMTU candidate sequence
    with linear upward is described in\n   this draft.\n\n\t "

  content: "Several useful applications of MPLS tunnels based on LSPs with\nsecond
    level labels between non adjacent LSRs have been\nidentified: IP-VPNs and VoIP
    over MPLS are just two examples. This\ntunnelling technique can easily be extended
    to non-MPLS core\nnetworks.\nThis Internet-Draft explains the motivation for encapsulating
    MPLS\nmessages in IP and provides the protocol specification of the\nencapsulation.\n\t "

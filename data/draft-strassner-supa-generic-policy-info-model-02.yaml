  content: "   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines an interface\n
    \  to a network management function that takes high-level, possibly\n   network-wide
    policies as input and creates element configuration\n   snippets as output. SUPA
    addresses the needs of operators and\n   application developers to represent multiple
    types of policy\n   rules, which vary in the level of abstraction, to suit the
    needs\n   of different actors. This document defines a single common\n   extensible
    framework for representing different types of policy\n   rules, in the form of
    a set of information model fragments, that\n   is independent of language, protocol,
    repository, and the level\n   of abstraction of the content of the policy rule.
    This enables a\n   common set of concepts defined in this set of information models\n
    \  to be mapped into different data models that use different\n   languages, protocols,
    and repositories to optimize their usage.\n   The definition of common policy
    concepts also provides better\n   interoperability by ensuring that each data
    model can share a set\n   of common concepts, independent of its level of detail
    or the\n   language, protocol, and/or repository that it is using.\n\n   Specifically,
    this document defines three information models:\n\n\t "

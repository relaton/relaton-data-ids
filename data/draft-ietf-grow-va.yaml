  content: "   The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)\n   stresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the\n   most costly stresses
    is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router\n   hardware simply because the FIB
    has run out of space, and router\n   vendors must design routers that have adequate
    FIB.  FIB suppression\n   is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by not
    loading selected\n   RIB entries into the FIB.  Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows
    ISPs to\n   shrink the FIBs of any and all routers, easily by an order of\n   magnitude
    with negligible increase in path length and load.  FIB\n   suppression can be
    deployed autonomously by an ISP without requiring\n   cooperation between adjacent
    ISPs, and can co-exist with legacy\n   routers in the ISP.\n\n\t "

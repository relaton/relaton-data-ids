  content: "   This document describes a set of recommendations to use when\n   implementing
    ACE/OAuth 2.0 clients that are working in disadvantaged\n   networks.  Issues
    such as token revocation have a much higher\n   priority in scenarios where Resource
    Servers are IoT devices, and\n   network connectivity is limited and intermittent.\n\n\t "

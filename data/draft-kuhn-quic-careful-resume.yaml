- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document discusses careful resumption of congestion control\n
    \  parameters in QUIC with a cautious method that enables faster startup\n   of
    new connections.\n\n   The method uses a set of computed congestion control parameters
    that\n   are based on the previously observed path characteristics, such as\n
    \  the bottleneck bandwidth, available capacity, or the RTT.  These\n   parameters
    are stored and can then used to modify the congestion\n   control behaviour of
    a subsequent connection.  The draft discusses\n   assumptions around how a server
    ought to utilise these parameters to\n   provide opportunities for a new connection
    to more quickly get up to\n   speed (i.e. utilise available capacity).  It discusses
    how these\n   changes impact the capacity at a shared network bottleneck and the\n
    \  response that is needed after any indication that the new rate is\n   inappropriate.\n\n\t "

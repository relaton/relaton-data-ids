  content: "   The introduction of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in carrier-\n
    \  grade networks promises improved operations in terms of flexibility,\n   efficiency,
    and manageability.  NFV is an approach to combine network\n   and compute virtualizations
    together.  However, network and compute\n   resource domains expose different
    virtualizations and programmable\n   interfaces.  In [I-D.unify-nfvrg-challenges]
    we argued for a joint\n   compute and network virtualization by looking into different
    compute\n   abstractions.\n\n   In this document we analyze different approaches
    to orchestrate a\n   service graph with transparent network functions into a commodity\n
    \  data center.  We show that a recursive compute and network joint\n   virtualization
    and programming has clear advantages compared to other\n   approaches with separated
    control between compute and network\n   resources.  The discussion of the problems
    and the proposed solution\n   is generic for any data center use case; however,
    we use NFV as an\n   example.\n\n\t "

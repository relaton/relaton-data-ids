  content: "RSVP has been extended in several directions [Policy], [Identity],\n[DCLASS],
    [AggrRSVP], [DiffModel],[COPS-RSVP], These extensions have\nbroadened the applicability
    of RSVP characterizing it as a signaling\nprotocol usable outside the IntServ
    model.\nWith the addition of the 'Null Service Type' [NullServ], RSVP is\nbeing
    adopted also by mission critical applications that require some\nform of prioritized
    service, but cannot readily specify their\nresource requirements. These applications
    do not need to set-up a\nreservation end-to-end, but only to signal to the network
    their\npolicy information [Policy], [Identity] and obtain in response an\napplicable
    DSCP [DCLASS].\nRSVP Receiver Proxy is an extension to the RSVP message processing\n(not
    to the protocol itself), mainly designed to operate in\nconjunction with the Null
    Service Type and with an extension of the\nCOPS for RSVP protocol [COPS-RSVP-EXT].\n\t "

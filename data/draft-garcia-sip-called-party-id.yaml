  content: "This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of a\nP-Called-Party-ID
    header. A proxy inserts this header typically in an\nINVITE, en-route to its destination.
    The header is populated with the\nRequest-URI received by the proxy in the request.
    The UAS identifies\nwhich ID out of several IDs the invitation was sent to (for
    example,\nthe user may be using simultaneously a personal and a business SIP URI\nto
    receive invitation to sessions). The UAS may use the information to\nrender different
    distinctive audiovisual alerting tones, depending on\nthe ID used to receive the
    invitation to the session.\n\t "

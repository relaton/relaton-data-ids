  content: "This document specifies, abstractly, how to interface applications and
    transport protocols with IPsec so as to create \"channels\" by latching \"connections\"
    (packet flows) to certain IPsec Security Association (SA) parameters for the lifetime
    of the connections. Connection latching is layered on top of IPsec and does not
    modify the underlying IPsec architecture.\n\n Connection latching can be used
    to protect applications against accidentally exposing live packet flows to unintended
    peers, whether as the result of a reconfiguration of IPsec or as the result of
    using weak peer identity to peer address associations. Weak association of peer
    ID and peer addresses is at the core of Better Than Nothing Security (BTNS); thus,
    connection latching can add a significant measure of protection to BTNS IPsec
    nodes.\n\n Finally, the availability of IPsec channels will make it possible to
    use channel binding to IPsec channels. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

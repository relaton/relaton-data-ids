  content: "This draft proposes Optimized Route Cache Protocol (ORC) to provide\n
    \  route optimization for the NEMO Basic Support protocol.  ORC provides\n   a
    dynamic route optimization mechanism, similar to route optimization\n   in Mobile
    IPv6.\n\n   The ORC aims to manage binding information as if routing information\n
    \  of each mobile network are located at special routers called\n   'Correspondent
    Router'.\n\t "

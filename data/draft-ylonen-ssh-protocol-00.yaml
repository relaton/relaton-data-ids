  content: "SSH (Secure Shell) is a program to log into another computer over a network,
    to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine to
    another.  It provides strong authentication and secure communications over insecure
    networks.  It is intended as a possible replacement for rsh, rlogin, rcp, and
    rdist.                               Ssh closes several security holes in existing
    remote login and file transfer protocols (IP spoofing, routing manipulation, DNS
    manipulation, trojan horses, man-in-the-middle attacks).  Additionally, all communications
    are encrypted to ensure privacy and integrity.  It automatically forwards X11
    connections over the secure channel (providing secure X11 sessions and automatic
    secure authentication information distribution).  Arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also
    be forwarded over the secure channel.  An authentication agent permits authentication
    keys to reside on a laptop, or eventually even on a smartcard.     Ssh also includes
    several convenience features, such as returning the correct exit status, automatic
    setting of DISPLAY and X11 authentication data, enhanced configurability, and
    the ability to run remote commands on a pty.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address\n
    \  Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier\n   Grade
    NAT (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT).  The CGN\n   infrastructure will often
    form a NAT444 environment as the subscriber\n   home network will likely also
    maintain a subscriber side NAT\n   function.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool
    is a major driver\n   compelling some operators to implement CGN.  Although operators
    may\n   wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near\n
    \  term needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This\n   document
    provides a practical integration model which allows the CGN\n   platform to be
    integrated into the network, meeting the connectivity\n   needs of the subscriber
    while being mindful of not disrupting\n   existing services and meeting the technical
    challenges that CGN\n   brings.  The model included in this document utilizes
    BGP/MPLS IP\n   VPNs which allow for virtual routing separation helping ease the
    CGNs\n   impact on the network.  This document does not intend to defend the\n
    \  merits of CGN.\n\n\t "

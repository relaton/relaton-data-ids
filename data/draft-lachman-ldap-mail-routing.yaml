  content: "   Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n
    \  (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store\n   information
    about users and other network entities.  One of the many\n   possible uses of
    a directory service is to store information about\n   users' email accounts, such
    as their email addresses, and how\n   messages addressed to them should be routed.
    \ In the interest of\n   interoperability, it is desirable to have a common schema
    for such\n   email-related information.\n \n   This document defines an object
    class called 'mailRecipient' to\n   support SMTP [3] message transfer agents (MTAs)
    in routing RFC 822-\n   based email messages [4] within an organization.  The
    intent is to\n   suggest a model for MTA interoperability via the directory, to\n
    \  provide information about a solution that has been implemented and\n   deployed,
    and to stimulate discussion about whether and how to\n   standardize the functionality
    in question.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the use cases of communication considering\n
    \  sleepy nodes and the problems of connecting to sleepy nodes in\n   constrained
    node networks.  The use cases of communications between\n   sleepy nodes and non-sleepy
    nodes are classified by the end-to-end\n   communication and the network topology.
    \ The adopt of power saving in\n   constrained nodes raises compelling problems
    in network layer/\n   transport/application layer.  In this document, problems
    of each\n   layer in a sleepy node are described.\n\n\t "

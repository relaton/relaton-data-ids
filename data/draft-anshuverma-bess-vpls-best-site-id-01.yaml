  script: Latn
  content: "   With network-based applications becoming prevalent, solutions that\n
    \  provide connectivity over wide area become more attractive for\n   customers.
    In small-to-medium enterprise sector, Virtual Private LAN\n   Service (VPLS),
    is a very useful service provider offering. It\n   creates an emulated LAN segments
    fully capable of learning and\n   forwarding Ethernet MAC addresses.\n\n   Today,
    in VPLS implementations, within the context of a VPLS PE (VE),\n   a single-site
    is selected from which all PWs are rooted. The site-\n   election mechanism is
    usually hard-coded by different vendors (e.g.\n   minimum or maximum site-id),
    and as such, is outside end-users\n   control. This offers no flexibility to end-users
    as it forces them to\n   define the site-id allocation scheme well in advance,
    or deal with\n   the consequences of a suboptimal site-id election. Moreover,
    whenever\n   the elected site-id is declared down, the traffic to and from all\n
    \  other sites hosted within the same VE is impacted as well.\n\n   This draft
    defines protocol extensions to keep core-facing\n   pseudowires (PWs) established
    at all times, regardless of the events\n   taking place on the attachment-circuit
    (AC) segment when using the\n   BGP-based signaling procedures.\n\n\t "

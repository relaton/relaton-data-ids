  content: "Adhoc networks are formed by the spontaneous collaboration of\nwireless
    nodes when no networking infrastructure is available. When\ncommunication to the
    Internet is desired, one or more nodes must act\nas gateways for the adhoc network.
    In this case, global addressing of\nadhoc nodes is required. This document specifies
    a protocol (node\nbehaviour, information propagation, message format) which allows\nnodes
    in an adhoc network to discover a gateway/prefix pair which is\nused in order
    to build an IPv6 global address and, when necessary, to\nmaintain a default route
    towards the Internet.\n\t "

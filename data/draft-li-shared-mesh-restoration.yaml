  content: "Efficient techniques for rapid restoration must be addressed within \nGMPLS.
    This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling in \nsupport of shared
    mesh restoration. Shared mesh restoration \ndescribes restoration plans in which
    restoration capacity is shared \nacross multiple independent failures. In particular,
    this document \nproposes extensions enabling reservation of restoration capacity,
    \nLSP restoration, LSP reversion and LSP deletion.\n\t "

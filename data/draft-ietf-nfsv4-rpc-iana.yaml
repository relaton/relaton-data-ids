  content: "Network services based on RPC [RFC1831] use program numbers rather\nthan
    well known transport ports to permit clients to find them, and\nuse authentication
    flavor numbers to define the format of the\nauthentication data passed.  The assignment
    of RPC program numbers\nand authentication flavor numbers is still performed by
    Sun\nMicrosystems, Inc.  This is inappropriate for an IETF standard\nprotocol,
    as such work is done well by the Internet Assigned Numbers\nAuthority (IANA).
    \ This document defines how IANA will maintain and\nassign RPC program numbers
    and authentication flavor numbers.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes two(2) extensions to the current diameter\nrouting
    scheme.  The first extension describes an explicit routing\nmechanism that MAY
    be employed by Diameter nodes to allow specific\nstateful Diameter proxies to
    remain in the path of all messages\nexchanges constituting a Diameter session.
    \ The second extension\ndescribes a realm based redirection scheme as an alternative
    to host\nbased redirection described in [RFC3588].\n\t "

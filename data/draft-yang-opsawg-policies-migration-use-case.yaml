  content: "   Draft I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration makes general problem\n   statement
    on state migration in Data Center (DC).  This use case\n   draft is composed to
    introduce the states on network devices that\n   need to be migrated with VM and
    the scenario that requires states\n   migration.  The authors of this draft make
    a survey among several DC\n   providers to make sure the use cases introduced
    in this draft are\n   real problem from these DC providers' perspective, instead
    of\n   technology driven.  The purpose of this draft is to figure out which\n
    \  states should be considered in the beginning stage of state migration\n   effort.\n\n\t "

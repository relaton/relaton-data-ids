  content: "The IPsec Architecture [RFC2401] and IPsec transform RFCs [RFC2402, \nRFC2406]
    define certain mechanisms for IP multicast traffic. The \nrecent revisions to
    each of the protocol documents [ESPbis, AHbis] \npropose changes to those semantics.
    However, neither the existing \nnor proposed semantics are sufficiently general
    such that IPsec can \nbe used to protect the wide variety of IPv4 and IPv6 multicast
    \napplications that are expected by the IP multicast community. In \nparticular,
    they are not compatible with the needs of the protocols \ndeveloped in the MSEC
    WG and for Source Specific Multicast [RFC3376, \nSSM-ARCH]. This document reviews
    these semantics and proposes some \nminor changes, which would enable IPsec to
    be suitable for these \nuses. \n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology
    information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. For example, views to
    Internet routing tables at Looking Glass servers are available and can be practically
    downloaded to many network application clients. What is missing is knowledge of
    the underlying network topologies from the point of view of ISPs. In other words,
    what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute
    it. The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services defined in this
    document provide network information (e.g., basic network location structure and
    preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption
    patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. The basic information
    of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network. These maps provide a simplified
    view, yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize
    them. Additional services are built on top of the maps. This document describes
    a protocol implementing the ALTO services. Although the ALTO services would primarily
    be provided by ISPs, other entities, such as content service providers, could
    also provide ALTO services. Applications that could use the ALTO services are
    those that have a choice to which end points to connect. Examples of such applications
    are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</p>"

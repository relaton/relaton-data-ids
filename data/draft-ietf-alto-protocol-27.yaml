  script: Latn
  content: "Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology information
    of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. For example, views to Internet routing
    tables at Looking Glass servers are available and can be practically downloaded
    to many network application clients. What is missing is knowledge of the underlying
    network topologies from the point of view of ISPs. In other words, what an ISP
    prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.\n\n The
    Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services defined in this document
    provide network information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences
    of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns
    while maintaining or improving application performance. The basic information
    of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network. These maps provide a simplified
    view, yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize
    them. Additional services are built on top of the maps.\n\n This document describes
    a protocol implementing the ALTO services. Although the ALTO services would primarily
    be provided by ISPs, other entities, such as content service providers, could
    also provide ALTO services. Applications that could use the ALTO services are
    those that have a choice to which end points to connect. Examples of such applications
    are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.\n\t "

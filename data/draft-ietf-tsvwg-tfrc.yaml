  content: "This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).  TFRC is a congestion
    control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best- effort Internet environment.
    \ It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a
    much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more
    suitable for applications such as telephony or streaming media where a relatively
    smooth sending rate is of importance. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes the Private Network-to-Network Interface\n
    \  (PNNI) signaling procedures used in Asynchronous Transfer Mode\n   (ATM) networks.
    PNNI is a hierarchical link-state routing\n   protocol that enables topology discovery,
    dynamic routing, and\n   call establishment across ATM networks. This document
    outlines\n   the signaling model, hierarchical routing structures, call setup\n
    \  procedures, and interoperability considerations for both modern\n   and legacy
    ATM network implementations.\n\n\t "

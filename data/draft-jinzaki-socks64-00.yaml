  content: "This memo describes an IPv4-IPv6 intercommunication method based on\n
    \  the SOCKS5 protocol.  The method is called SOCKS64, and was first\n   announced
    in the 40th IETF meeting at Washington DC in December 1997\n   as one of three
    translators being developed in the WIDE Project.\n   SOCKS64 is a gateway system
    that accepts SOCKS5 connections from IPv4\n   hosts and relays it to IPv4/IPv6
    hosts using proper protocols.  We\n   have designed and implemented a prototype
    SOCKS64 system and have\n   been testing the prototype in many environments.  Also
    we are\n   distributing the prototype as a KAME distribution package.  This\n
    \  article describes the SOCKS64; its principle, implementation,\n   experimental
    results and comparison to other IPv4-IPv6\n   intercommunication methods.\n\t "

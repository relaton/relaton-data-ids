  content: "CELT is an open-source voice codec suitable for use in very low delay\naudio
    communication applications, including Voice over IP (VoIP).\nThis document describes
    the payload format for CELT generated bit\nstreams within an RTP packet.  Also
    included here are the necessary\ndetails for the use of CELT with the Session
    Description Protocol\n(SDP).  At the time of this writing, the CELT bit-stream
    has NOT been\nfinalized yet, and compatibility is usually broken with every new\nrelease
    of the codec.\n\t "

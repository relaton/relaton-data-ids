  content: "   The ALTO protocol [RFC7285] provides network information to\n   applications
    so that applications can make network informed decisions\n   to improve the performance.
    \ However, the base ALTO protocol only\n   provides coarse-grained end-to-end
    metrics, which are insufficient to\n   satisfy the demands of applications to
    solve more complex network\n   optimization problems.  The ALTO Path Vector extension
    [DRAFT-PV] has\n   been introduced to allow ALTO clients to query information
    such as\n   capacity regions for a given set of flows.  However, the current\n
    \  design of this extension has a limited expressiveness.  The goal of\n   this
    document is to introduce a unified resource representation\n   service as an extension
    of ALTO (ALTO-UR), which allows the ALTO\n   clients to query and get the capacity
    regions of more complex\n   resource information, such as Shared-Risk-Link-Group
    (SRLG), multi-\n   path routing, multicast and on-demand routing, for a given
    set of\n   flows.\n\n\t "

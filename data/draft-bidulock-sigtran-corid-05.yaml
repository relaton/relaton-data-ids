  content: "    This Internet-Draft describes Correlation Id and Heartbeat\n  procedures
    to support lossless fail-over between SCTP [SCTP]\n  associations for SS7 [Q.700]
    Signalling User Adaptation Protocols\n  [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA], [ISUA], [TUA] supporting
    the concept of a\n  Routing Context or Interface Identifier.  These procedures
    permit\n  lossless fail-over between Application Server Processes (ASPs) at a\n
    \ Signalling Gateway (SG) and fail-over between Signalling Gateway\n  Processes
    (SGPs) and Signalling Gateways (SGs) at an Application\n  Server Process (ASP).
    \ Lossless fail-over permits these fail-overs to\n  occur without loss or duplication
    of UA-User messages.\n\n\n\t "

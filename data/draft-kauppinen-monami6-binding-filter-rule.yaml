  content: "   Mobile nodes using more than one interface for communicating with\n
    \  other nodes in the network need a mechanism that controls how these\n   interfaces
    are used.  One way of controlling the interface usage is\n   to define rules that
    map flows to network interfaces.  These rules\n   can also be called filter rules
    that are bound to Filter Interface\n   Identifiers.\n\n   This document describes
    a mechanism to associate Filter Interface\n   Identifiers with the current location
    information of a mobile node in\n   case when the mobility protocol used by the
    mobile node is Mobile\n   IPv6.\n\n\t "

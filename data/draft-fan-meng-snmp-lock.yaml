  content: "   This memo is intended to provide a lock mechanism to SNMP for\n   protecting
    SET operations from being interrupted by any other network\n   management operations
    such as NETCONF <edit-config> or CLI writes.\n   This memo defines a portion of
    the Management Information Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols.
    \ In particular, it extends\n   LOCK-MIB defined in [I-D.meng-fan-lock-mib] to
    define objects for\n   managing SNMP locks.  The lock acquisition and release
    can be\n   achieved through manipulating those objects.\n\t "

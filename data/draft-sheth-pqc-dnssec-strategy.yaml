- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes a post-quantum cryptography (PQC) strategy for\n
    \  Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) that includes two types of\n   algorithms:
    one or more conservatively designed algorithms that are\n   unlikely ever to need
    to be replaced, and one or more low-impact\n   drop-in algorithms that are used
    the same way as a traditional\n   signature algorithm.  The conservatively designed
    algorithms can be\n   used in a mode of operation that mitigates the operational
    impact of\n   a large signature size.  The combination provides both the routine\n
    \  performance of the low-impact algorithm and a resilient fallback to\n   the
    conservatively designed choice.  The draft outlines the strategy,\n   provides
    recommendations for future testing and deployment, and\n   highlights operational
    considerations in adopting PQC for DNSSEC.\n\n\t "

    identified several requirements and architectural features. In \nparticular several
    interfaces have been identified, however there \nare no detailed requirements
    for these interfaces. This document \npresents our understanding of requirements
    from the point of view of \nwhat an ASON customer can be expected to do with ASON.
    These are \nmainly requirements at the Client Application Programming Interface
    \n(API). Note that the Client API is the logical interface between a \nnetwork
    client (user domain) and the network server (service \nprovider domain). \n\n\n\t "

  content: "SIP as defined in RFC 3261 [1] defines a Via header as a construct to\nbe
    used for upstream response routing and for downstream assistance\nin loop detection.
    \ There is an increasing need on downstream\nadministrative domains (ADs) to gain
    visibility into all the ADs in\nits upstream path.  The information needed is
    not IP based as\ninternal architectures at upstream ADs is of no consequence to\ndownstream
    ADs.  Logical domain marking, however, is desperately\nneeded for any traffic
    analysis to occur at the receiving side.\nGathering AD information from Via headers
    is non obvious and in many\ninstances nearly impossible.  This documents identifies
    the\nrequirements for addressing this issue.\n\t "

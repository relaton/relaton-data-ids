  content: "   A number of application-layer protocols make use of IP broadcasts or\n
    \  multicast messages for functions like local service discovery or name\n   resolution.
    \ Some of these functions can only be implemented\n   efficiently using such mechanisms.
    \ When using broadcasts or\n   multicast messages, a passive observer in the same
    broadcast/\n   multicast domain can trivially record these messages and analyze\n
    \  their content.  Therefore, broadcast/multicast protocol designers\n   need
    to take special care when designing their protocols.\n\n\t "

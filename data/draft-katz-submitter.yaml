  content: "This memo defines an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
    service that allows an SMTP client to specify the responsible submitter of an
    e-mail message.  The responsible submitter is the e-mail address of the entity
    most recently responsible for introducing a message into the transport stream.
    \ This extension helps receiving e-mail servers efficiently determine whether
    the SMTP client is authorized to transmit mail on behalf of the responsible submitter's
    domain.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

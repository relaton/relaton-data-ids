  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support\n
    \  some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent\n   performance
    requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the\n   overlay VPN connectivity
    and the characteristics provided by the\n   underlay network.  A Virtual Transport
    Network (VTN) is a virtual\n   underlay network which has a customized network
    topology and a set of\n   network resources allocated from the physical network.
    \ A VTN could\n   be used to support one or a group of VPN+ services.  In the
    context\n   of network slicing, a VTN could be instantiated as a network resource\n
    \  partition (NRP).\n\n   This document specifies the IGP mechanisms with necessary
    extensions\n   to advertise the associated topology and resource attributes for\n
    \  scalable Segment Routing (SR) based NRPs.  Each NRP can have a\n   customized
    topology and a set of network resources allocated from the\n   physical network.
    \ Multiple NRPs may shared the same topology, and\n   multiple NRPs may share
    the same set of network resources on some\n   network segments.  This allows flexible
    combination of the network\n   topology and network resource attributes to build
    a relatively large\n   number of NRPs with a relatively small number of logical
    topologies.\n   A group of resource-aware SIDs and SRv6 Locators can be assigned
    to\n   each NRP.  The proposed mechanism is applicable to both Segment\n   Routing
    with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing with IPv6\n   data plane (SRv6).
    \ This document also describes the mechanism of\n   using dedicated NRP ID in
    the data plane instead of the per-NRP\n   resource-aware SIDs and SRv6 Locators
    to further reduce the control\n   plane and data plane overhead of maintaining
    a large number of NRPs.\n\n\t "

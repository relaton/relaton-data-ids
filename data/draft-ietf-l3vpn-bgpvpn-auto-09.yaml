  content: "In any provider-based VPN scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) devices \n   attached
    to a common VPN must exchange certain information as a \n   prerequisite to establish
    VPN-specific connectivity. The main \n   purpose of an auto-discovery mechanism
    is to enable a PE to \n   dynamically discover the set of remote PEs having VPN
    members in \n   common. The auto-discovery mechanism proceeds by having a PE \n
    \  advertises to other PEs, at a minimum, its own IP address and the \n   list
    of VPN members configured on that PE. Once that information is \n   received the
    remote PEs will then identify the list of VPN sites\n   members of the same VPN,
    and use the information \n   carried within the discovery mechanism to establish
    VPN \n   connectivity. This draft defines a BGP based auto-discovery \n   mechanism
    for Virtual Router-based layer-3 VPNs. This mechanism is \n   based on the approach
    used by BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN for distributing VPN \n   routing information within the
    service provider(s).\n\t "

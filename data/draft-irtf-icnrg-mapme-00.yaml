  content: "   Mobility has become a basic premise of network communications,\n   thereby
    requiring a native integration into 5G networks.  Despite\n   numerous efforts
    to propose and standardize effective mobility-\n   management models for IP, the
    result is a complex, poorly flexible\n   set of mechanisms.  The natural support
    for mobility offered by ICN\n   (Information Centric Networking) makes it a good
    candidate to define\n   a radically new solution relieving limitations of the
    traditional\n   approaches.  If consumer mobility is supported in ICN by design,
    in\n   virtue of its connectionless pull-based communication model, producer\n
    \  mobility is still an open challenge.  In this document, we focus on\n   two
    prominent ICN architectures, CCN (Content Centric Networking) and\n   NDN (Named
    Data Networking) and describe MAP-Me, an anchor-less\n   solution to manage micro-mobility
    of content producers via a name-\n   based CCN/NDN data plane, with support for
    latency-sensitive\n   applications.\n\n\t "

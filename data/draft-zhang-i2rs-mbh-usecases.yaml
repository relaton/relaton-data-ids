  content: "   In a mobile backhaul network, traditional configuration and diagnoses\n
    \  mechanisms based on device-level management tools and manual\n   processing
    are ill-suited to meet the requirements of today's\n   scalable, flexible, and
    complex network.  Thanks to the new\n   innovation of Interface to the Routing
    System's (I2RS) programmatic\n   interfaces, as defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture],
    an\n   alternative way is available to control the configuration and\n   diagnose
    the operational results.  This document discusses the use\n   case for I2RS in
    mobile backhaul network.\n\n\n\t "

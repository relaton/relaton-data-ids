  content: "        The objective of Energy Management (EMAN)is to provide an energy\n
    \       management framework for networked devices. This document\n        presents
    the applicability of the EMAN framework for a variety\n        of scenarios. This
    document lists use cases and target devices\n        that can potentially implement
    the EMAN framework and associated\n        SNMP MIB modules. These use cases are
    useful for identifying\n        monitoring requirements that need to be considered.
    Further, we\n        describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to relevant\n
    \       other energy monitoring standards and architectures.\n\n\n\t "

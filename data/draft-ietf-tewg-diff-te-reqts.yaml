  content: "This document presents Service Provider requirements for support of Differentiated
    Services (Diff-Serv)-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS- TE).  Its objective is
    to provide guidance for the definition, selection and specification of a technical
    solution addressing these requirements.  Specification for this solution itself
    is outside the scope of this document.  A problem statement is first provided.
    \ Then, the document describes example applications scenarios identified by Service
    Providers where existing MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms fall short and Diff-Serv-aware
    Traffic Engineering can address the needs.  The detailed requirements that need
    to be addressed by the technical solution are also reviewed.  Finally, the document
    identifies the evaluation criteria that should be considered for selection and
    definition of the technical solution.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

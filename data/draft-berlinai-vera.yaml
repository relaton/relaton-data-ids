abstract:
- content: "<p>AI agents take real actions with real data at machine speed. Compromised
    AI agents pose significant risks including data exfiltration, unauthorized financial
    transactions, and cascading failures across downstream systems. This document
    introduces VERA (Verifiable Enforcement for Runtime Agents), a zero trust reference
    architecture that provides a structured threat model, five enforcement pillars
    with typed schemas, four formally stated security properties, and an evidence-based
    maturity runtime where agents earn autonomy through cryptographic proof rather
    than calendar time.</p>"

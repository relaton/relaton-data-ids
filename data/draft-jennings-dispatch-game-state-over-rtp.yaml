  content: "   This specification defines an Real Time Protocol (RTP) payload to\n
    \  send game moves and the state of game objects over RTP.  This is\n   useful
    for games as well collaboration systems that use augment or\n   virtual reality.\n\n
    \  RTP provide a way to synchronize game state between players with\n   robust
    technique for recovery from network packet loss while still\n   having low latency.\n\n\t "

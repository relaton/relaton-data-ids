  content: "   IS-IS is a widely deployed link-state protocol in routing networks.\n
    \  During the past decades, it has been operated and maintained through\n   typical
    CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.  With the expansion and complication\n   of modern networks,
    the necessity for rapid and dynamic control has\n   been increased.  The I2RS
    is a standard-based interface which\n   provides a programmatic way to achieve
    this goal.\n\n   This document specifies a data model for the I2RS's interface
    to the\n   IS-IS protocol based the I2RS IS-IS informational model (draft-ietf-\n
    \  wu-info-model-00).  These two models satisfy the requirements\n   suggested
    by the I2RS use case requirements for the IGPs.  This yang\n   data model can
    be used by I2RS client-agent protocol to program IS-IS\n   routing entities.\n\n\n\t "

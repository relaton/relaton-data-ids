  content: "A mechanism is needed to permit web clients to locate nearby web \nproxy
    caches. Current best practice is for end users to hand \nconfigure their web client
    (i.e., browser) with the URL of an 'auto \nconfiguration file'. In large environments
    this presents a \nformidable support problem.  It would be much more manageable
    for \nthe web client software to automatically learn the configuration \ninformation
    for its web proxy settings. This is typically referred \nto as a resource discovery
    problem.\n\t "

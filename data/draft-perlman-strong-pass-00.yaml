  content: "This document specifies a new password-based protocol that can be\nused
    as the basis of mutual authentication, or downloading of a\nprivate key. The only
    thing the client needs to know is the user's\npassword. The protocol is constructed
    such that an eavesdropper\ncannot do off-line password-guessing attacks. Someone
    stealing the\nserver's database cannot directly impersonate the user, although
    they\ncan do an off-line password-guessing attack on the contents. The\nprotocol
    presented in this paper is similar in functionality, higher\nin performance at
    the server, but lower in performance at the client,\nto the extended EKE and SPEKE,
    and SRP schemes.  Additional\nproperties of this scheme are salt, no password-equivalent
    stored at\nthe server, and prevention of servers on which the user has the same\npassword
    from impersonating each other to the user. This document\ngives an overview of
    the approach, but not wire-formats, which are\npremature at this stage. The purpose
    of this document is to advertise\nthis new scheme to various groups that might
    be interested (CAT, for\na GSS-API mechanism, LDAP, for download of a private
    key).\n\n\t "

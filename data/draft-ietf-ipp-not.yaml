    aspects of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).  IPP is an application-level

    multiple parts to IPP, but the primary architectural components are the Model,
    the Protocol, and an interface to Directory Services.  This document provides
    a statement of the requirements for notifications as an optional part of an IPP
    Service.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

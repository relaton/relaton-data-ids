  content: "   Identification and treatment of application flows are critical for\n
    \  the successful deployment and operation of applications.\n   Historically,
    this functionality has been accomplished to the extent\n   possible using heuristics,
    which inspect and infer flow\n   characteristics.  Heuristics may be based on
    port ranges, network\n   separation, or deep packet inspection (DPI).  But many
    application\n   flows in current usages are dynamic, time-bound (short lived for
    some\n   of them), possibly encrypted (TLS for signaling), peer-to-peer,\n   possibly
    asymmetric, and used on non-dedicated devices, any\n   combination of which renders
    such techniques less effective or\n   results in compromises to application security
    or user privacy.\n\n\t "

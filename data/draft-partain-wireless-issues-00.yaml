  content: "The rapidly growing popularity of IP and its flexibility make it a\ngood
    candidate to be used for transmission in cellular networks.\nUsing IP-based transport
    on the wired transmission links in the\ncellular networks gives operators an opportunity
    to upgrade their\ntransport network to a packet-based one. When compared with
    a\ntraditional STM-based system, the gain is seen in the statistical\naggregation
    of traffic that can be done.  This results in increased\ntransmission efficiency
    and reduced leasing cost for the operator.\n\n\t "

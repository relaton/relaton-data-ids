  content: "   This document is a type of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for new\n
    \  STIR Working Group participants.  Since its inception three months\n   ago
    there have been over 1,500 emails on the mailing list, before\n   the WG was even
    formed.  Some of the emails repeat topics, because\n   newcomers cannot be expected
    to read all previous emails in the\n   archive.  This document is an attempt to
    capture some of the\n   previously asked and answered questions.\n\n   This document
    is written by one individual, is not intended to be\n   published as an RFC, and
    is only meant as a temporary FAQ while the\n   Working Group begins.  The document
    attempts to provide both high-\n   level information for non-experts, as well
    as low-level information\n   for protocol experts.\n\n\t "

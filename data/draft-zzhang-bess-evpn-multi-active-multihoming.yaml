  content: "   EVPN supports All-Active and Single-Active multihoming, where either\n
    \  all multihoming PEs are active or only one is active.  In some\n   situations,
    it is desired to support Multi-Active with multiple yet\n   not all active PEs.
    \ This document specifies the Multi-Active\n   multihoming - some multihoming
    PEs are in All-Active mode while\n   others are in Single-Active mode on the same
    multihoming Ethernet\n   Segment, and ingress PEs load-balance to those in All-Active
    mode.\n\n\t "

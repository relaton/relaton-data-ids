abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN supports All-Active and Single-Active multihoming, where either
    all multihoming PEs are active or only one is active. In some situations, it is
    desired to support Multi-Active with multiple yet not all active PEs. This document
    specifies the Multi-Active multihoming - some multihoming PEs are in All-Active
    mode while others are in Single-Active mode on the same multihoming Ethernet Segment,
    and ingress PEs load-balance to those in All-Active mode.</p>"

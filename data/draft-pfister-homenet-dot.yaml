  content: "   This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain\n
    \  Name System with regard to DNS queries for names ending with\n   '.homenet.',
    thereby defining this top-level domain as a special-use\n   domain name [RFC6761].
    \ The '.homenet' top-level domain intends to\n   replace '.home' which was originally
    proposed in [RFC7788] as default\n   domain-name for home networks.\n\n\t "

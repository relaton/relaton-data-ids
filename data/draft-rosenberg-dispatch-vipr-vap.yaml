  content: "Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for\ninter-domain
    SIP federation.  ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks,\nand SIP, and in doing
    so, addresses the phone number routing and VoIP\nspam problems that have been
    a barrier to federation.  The ViPR\narchitecture uses a server, the ViPR server,
    which performs P2P and\nvalidation services on behalf of call agents, which acts
    as clients\nto the server.  Such an architecture requires a client/server\nprotocol
    between call agents and the ViPR server.  That protocol,\ndefined here, is called
    the ViPR Access Protocol (VAP).\n\nLegal\n\nThis documents and the information

  content: "This paper describes an integrated services approach to supporting IP
    multicast over ATM, including both best-effort delivery and quality of service-based
    (QoS) traffic.  Best-effort traffic is assumed to be relatively low-volume and
    short-duration sessions, and thus should not incur ATM VC setup overhead.  QoS-based
    traffic is assumed to be high-volume, long-duration sessions, and ATM VC setup
    is thus both desirable and necessary (to support quality of service demands).
    \ Best-effort traffic delivery is based on standard IGMP and IP multicast routing.
    \ QoS support is provided by use of RSVP.  Various types of 'short-cut' ATM VC
    setup can be supported by minor changes to router behavior and the RSVP protocol.\n\t "

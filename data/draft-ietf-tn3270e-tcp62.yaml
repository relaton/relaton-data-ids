  content: "This draft describes IBM's support for running LU6.2 applications\n   over
    a TCP/IP network. This support is provided using a subset of the\n   X/Open architecture
    for Multiprotocol Transport Networking, which is\n   a general protocol conversion
    architecture for running any\n   application over any transport protocol.  This
    draft is being\n   distributed to members of the Internet community in order to
    solicit\n   their reactions to the proposals contained in it.  While the issues\n
    \  discussed may not be directly relevant to the research problems of\n   the
    Internet, they may be interesting to a number of researchers and\n   implementers.\n
    \n   Any questions or comments relative to the contents of this draft\n   should
    be sent to the following Internet address:\n   carmich@us.ibm.com.\n\t "

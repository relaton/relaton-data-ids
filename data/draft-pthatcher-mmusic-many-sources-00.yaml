- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document explains why it is preferable to have multiple media\n
    \  sources encoded in SDP as one m= section rather than many m=\n   sections,
    especially when there are a large number of video sources\n   which change frequently
    and need dynamic resolution changes, such as\n   in a video conferencing system.\n\n\t "

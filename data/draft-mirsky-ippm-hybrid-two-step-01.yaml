  content: "   Development of, and advancements in, automation of network operations\n
    \  brought new requirements for measurement methodology.  Among them is\n   the
    ability to collect instant network state as the packet being\n   processed by
    the networking elements along its path through the\n   domain.  This document
    introduces a new hybrid measurement method,\n   referred to as hybrid two-step,
    as it separates the act of measuring\n   and/or calculating performance metric
    from the act of collecting and\n   transporting network state.\n\n\t "

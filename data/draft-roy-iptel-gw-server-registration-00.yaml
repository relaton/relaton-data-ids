  content: "This contribution describes a registration protocol that can be used\nbetween
    gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra-\nITAD communications
    environment. The registration protocol is used\nby a GW just to inform its transport
    address and reachable alias\naddresses including telephone numbers through it
    along with other\ninformation (e.g., capacity, cost, traffic, usage, QoS, GoS)
    to the\nServer and does not deal with any routes or path attributes.\nThe registration
    protocol is also used to negotiate capabilities\nbetween the peers.\n\t "

  content: "   Multicasting over WDM optical networks has enabled many popular\n   Point-to-Multipoint
    (P2MP) applications, such as video conference,\n   interactive distance learning,
    replicated database, distributed\n   computing, and so on.  However, on the one
    hand, the low-rate\n   multicasting traffic demands cannot make full use of the
    capacity of\n   the entire wavelength, and on the other hand, new services such
    as\n   data center migration and cloud applications need higher transmission\n
    \  rates and higher spectrum efficiency.  Flexi-grid network is an\n   effective
    solution to address the problem of transmission rate and\n   spectrum utilization.
    \ It overcomes the fixed grid constraint of\n   Wavelength Swithched Optical Network
    (WSON) by using advanced\n   technologies such as coherent detection and Bandwidth
    Variable-\n   Wavelength Selective Switches (BV-WSS).  Therefore, it is essential\n
    \  to exploit multicasting over flexi-grid networks.  This document\n   covers
    the requirements for supporting P2MP over flexi-grid\n   infrastructure.  Specifically,
    the scope of requirements listed in\n   this document covers the functionality
    that should be supported by\n   the control plane.\n\n\t "

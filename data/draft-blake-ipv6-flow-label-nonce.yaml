  script: Latn
  content: "TCP and other transport-layer protocols are vulnerable to spoofing\nattacks
    from off-path hosts.  These attacks can be prevented through\nthe use of cryptographic
    authentication.  However, it is difficult to\nuse cryptographic authentication
    in all circumstances.  A variety of\nobfuscation techniques -- such as initial
    sequence number\nrandomization and source port randomization -- increase the effort\nrequired
    of an attacker to successfully guess the packet header\nfields which uniquely
    identify a transport connection.  This memo\nproposes the use of the IPv6 Flow
    Label field as a random, per-\nconnection nonce value, to add entropy to the set
    of packet header\nfields used to identify a transport connection.  This mechanism
    is\neasily implementable, allows for incremental deployment, and is fully\ncompliant
    with the rules for Flow Label use defined in RFC 3697.\n\t "

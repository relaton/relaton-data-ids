abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an OAuth 2.1 profile that enables a government
    authority to enforce age-based and content-based access restrictions for online
    services while preserving user privacy. The protocol allows relying parties to
    request government-defined regulatory scopes (such as pornography or social media
    access) and receive cryptographically verifiable eligibility decisions without
    disclosing user identity, exact age, or personally identifiable information. The
    profile constrains OAuth features to prevent abuse, cross-service correlation,
    and unauthorized token issuance.</p>"

  content: "    Recent opinions and sentiments expressed in the Internet\n    Service
    Provider (ISP) community, as well as the Internet\n    community at-large, have
    voiced concern over the applicability\n    and scalability of RSVP and the Integrated
    Service model in\n    the global Internet infrastructure. Convincing arguments
    have\n    been made for a differential services model which offers packet\n    delivery
    services better than traditional best effort, especially\n    in the face of congestion,
    yet not as resource intensive as RSVP.\n    As a result, the Differentiated Service
    (diffserv) working group\n    in the IETF has been examining methods to provide
    simpler, less\n    resource intensive methods of offering differentiated services.\n
    \   This draft provides a practical method to use bit values expressed\n    in
    the IP Type or Service (TOS) and IP precedence subfields of the\n    TOS byte
    in the IP packet header for delay indication and packet drop\n    preference,
    respectively.\n\n\t "

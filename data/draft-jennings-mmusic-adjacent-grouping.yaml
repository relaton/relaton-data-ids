  content: "   Applications such as multi-screen video conferencing systems or\n   advertisement
    boards often have multiple audio and video streams that\n   are organized to be
    rendered side by side or in a grid.  This\n   specification uses the RFC 5888
    Grouping Framework to define new\n   semantics for grouping the media streams
    to be rendered side by side\n   or in a grid and indicating their relative ordering.\n\n\t "

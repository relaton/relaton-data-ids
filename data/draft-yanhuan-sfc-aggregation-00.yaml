  content: "\tService chains specifying the ordered sequences of network functions\n\taccording
    to network policies requested, play a very important role\n\tin improving network
    performance in most networks. With the\n\tintroduction of Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) and Network\n\tFunction Virtualization (NFV) technologies, service chains
    can be\n\timmediately deployed in more effective ways. Since different\n\tcustomers
    or operators would request multiple service chains in the\n\tsame network but
    different administrative domains, and the multiple\n\tservice chains may apply
    to the same network connection, we propose\n\ta service chain aggregation architecture
    that has ability to\n\teffectively aggregate them before the deployment. In this\n\tarchitecture,
    we determine the aggregating order of service chains\n\taccording to different
    conditions verifying the aggregation\n\teffectiveness. The benefits of our architecture
    are 1) security, 2)\n\tnetwork resource (e.g., flow entries in switches) savings
    and 3)\n\tscalability.\n\n\t "

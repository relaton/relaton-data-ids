  content: "   This document describes a source-based time variant routing\n   methodology
    that can be used in a network with predicted variations.\n   By using source-based
    time variant routing, the source node uses\n   stable information (e.g. orbit
    of satellite) to calculate the\n   forwarding path between source and destination
    nodes.  The\n   intermediate node does not need to maintain routing information,
    such\n   that in case of neighbor variations (restoration, activation, change\n
    \  of quality, or loss), there are no routing information changes.  The\n   routing
    decision is done by the source node.  This makes building a\n   highly scalable
    network with predicted variations possible (e.g. tens\n   of thousands of satellites).\n\n\t "

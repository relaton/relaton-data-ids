  content: "The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a new reliable \ntransport
    protocol that provides the multihoming feature. Without \nsupport of routers in
    the networks, the SCTP with the ADDIP \nextension (called mobile SCTP) can be
    used to provide seamless \nhandover for the mobile host that is changing its IP
    subnetworks \nduring the session. In the present form, the use of mobile SCTP
    is \ntargeted for handover of the mobile sessions that are originated \nfrom the
    mobile clients (located in mobile networks) toward the \nfixed servers (located
    in the fixed networks). The support for the \nopposite directional session (initiated
    by fixed node to mobile \nnode) requires an additional location management scheme
    such as \nMobile IP. In this document, we discuss the generic procedures for \nseamless
    handover of mobile SCTP and the concerned implementation \nissues.  \n\t "

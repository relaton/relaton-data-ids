  content: "   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial\n   information
    networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network-\n   performance criteria
    (e.g., latency) are becoming as critical to\n   data-path selection as other metrics.\n\n
    \  This document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering\n   Extensions
    (RFC 5305) such that network-performance information can\n   be distributed and
    collected in a scalable fashion.  The information\n   distributed using IS-IS
    TE Metric Extensions can then be used to make\n   path-selection decisions based
    on network performance.\n\n   Note that this document only covers the mechanisms
    with which\n   network-performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms
    for\n   measuring network performance or acting on that information, once\n   distributed,
    are outside the scope of this document.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 7810.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies Binomial congestion control At Receivers for\nMulticast
    (BARM). BARM is a single rate multicast congestion control\nprotocol for streaming
    media applications in the best effort Internet\nenvironment. Combining aspects
    of window-based and rate-based congestion\ncontrol, the protocol shifts most of
    the congestion control mechanisms\nto multicast receivers. A congestion window
    is maintained and updated\nby each receiver independently according to TCP-friendly
    binomial\nalgorithm, and is converted to the expected sending rate which is then\nfed
    back to the sender if permitted. To suppress feedback implosion, a\nrepresentative
    receiver is selected among receivers and a distributed\nsuppression mechanism
    is used. BARM has good TCP-friendliness,\nsmoothness, scalability, and acceptable
    responsiveness.\n\t "

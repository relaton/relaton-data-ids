  content: "   Extended Reality & multi-modality communication, or XRM, is a type
    of\n   advanced service that has been studied and standardized in the 3GPP\n   SA2
    working group.  It targets at achieving high data rate, ultra-low\n   latency,
    and high reliability.  The streams of an XRM service might\n   be comprised of
    data from multiple modalities, namely, video, audio,\n   ambient-sensor and haptic
    detection, etc.  XRM service faces\n   challenges on various aspects, e.g. accurate
    multi-modality data\n   synchronization, QoS differentiation, large volume of
    packets, and\n   etc.  While a new 3GPP network slice type, HDLLC, has been recently\n
    \  introduced to handle the QoS requirements of XRM streams, the\n   ubiquitously-existential
    encryption of packet header and/or payload\n   post additional challenges to the
    transport of encoded video packets\n   via 5GS.  We have then discussed two potential
    IETF schemes, e.g.,\n   IP-DSCP based or UDP-option extension, that could be applied
    to\n   'expose' XRM QoS 'metadata' to 5GS.\n\n\t "

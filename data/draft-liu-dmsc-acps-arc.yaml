abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet of Agent (IoA) aims to facilitate interconnection and collaboration
    among heterogeneous agents to address complex tasks and support various applications.
    This IETF draft proposes the Agent Collaboration Protocols (ACPs) architecture,
    which outlines the key components and functionalities required for agent interoperability.
    ACPs cover all stages of agents in the network, from their access to collaboration,
    including: Agent Trusted Registration (ATR), Agent Identity Authentication (AIA),
    Agent Discovery (ADP), Agent Interaction (AIP), Tool Invocation (TIP), and Agent
    Monitoring (AMP). The long-term vision of ACPs is to support the future large-scale
    interconnected agents and construct the key infrastructure for IoA.</p>"

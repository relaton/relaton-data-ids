  content: "   Applications want simple ways to reference and access YANG objects\n
    \  and subtrees.  These simplifications might include aliasing of local\n   YANG
    information.  These simplifications might include remote\n   referencing of YANG
    information distributed across network.\n\n   For such applications, development
    complexity is a barrier to YANG\n   usage and therefore must be minimized.  Specific
    aspects of\n   complexity developers want to ignore include:\n\n   o  whether
    context specific aliases and paths to the same information\n      can be exposed
    on a single device,\n\n   o  whether authoritative information is actually sourced
    from local\n      or remote datastores,\n\n   o  whether the application needs
    to manage the overhead of session\n      establishment and maintenance in order
    to access information on\n      remote datastores,\n\n   o  whether objects have
    been locally cached or not, and\n\n   o  whether there is a mix of controllers,
    NMSs, and/or CLI which have\n      access permission to update the primary copy
    of a particular\n      object.\n\n   The solution requirements described in this
    document detail what is\n   needed to support application access to authoritative
    network YANG\n   objects locally (via aliasing), or remotely from controllers
    or\n   peering network devices in such a way to meet these goals.\n\n\t "

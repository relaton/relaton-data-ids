  content: "The trend has been to use different encryption mechanism for \ndifferent
    layers. Although it can be argued that multiple layers is \ngood protection, such
    an approach is higly inefficient from the view \nperformance and necessity. In
    some situations this kind separate \nencryption mechanism may afford the bytes
    7 levels of encryption, for \nexample : AES (from 802.11)+ 3DES (from IPSec) +
    3DES (from TLS/SSL).  \nRecently link layer encryption has become an important
    issue, \nspecially in the context of wireless networks. Although this document
    \ndoes not attempt to solve this multiple layer encryption issue, it is \nan effort
    to that goal. Specifically, this document describes a way \nto use ESP in several
    link layer technologies. \n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Black Lies method of providing compact DNSSEC denial of existence\n
    \  proofs has some operational implications.  Depending on the specific\n   implementation,
    it may provide no way to reliably distinguish Empty\n   Non-Terminal names from
    names that actually do not exist.  This draft\n   describes the use of a synthetic
    DNS resource record type to act as\n   an explicit signal for Empty Non-Terminal
    names and which is conveyed\n   in an NSEC type bitmap.\n\n\t "

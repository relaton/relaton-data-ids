  content: "This document describes a  virtual private LAN service (VPLS) \nsolution
    over MPLS, also known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). A \nVPLS creates an emulated
    LAN segment for a given set of users.  It \ndelivers a layer 2 broadcast domain
    that is fully capable of \nlearning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses that
    is closed to \na given set of users.  Many VPLS services can be supported from
    a \nsingle PE node. \nThis document describes the control plane functions of signaling
    \ndemultiplexor labels, extending [PWE3-CTRL] and rudimentary support \nfor availability
    (multi-homing).  It is agnostic to discovery \nprotocols.  The data plane functions
    of forwarding are also \ndescribed, focusing, in particular, on the learning of
    MAC \naddresses.  The encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by [PWE3-\nETHERNET].\n\t "

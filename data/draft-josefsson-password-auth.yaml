  content: "   There is a lack of a simple, standardized, secure and modern\n   password-based
    mechanism for user authentication in application\n   protocols.  This document
    specify a challenge/response protocol that\n   provide password-based authentication
    services.  We describe how the\n   protocol may be used as a GSS-API mechanism
    and, using the GS2\n   framework, how it may be used as a SASL mechanism.  The
    protocol\n   supports HMAC-SHA-256 as the mandatory to implement algorithm, and
    it\n   supports channel bindings.  The intended use is by application\n   protocol
    that today use CRAM-MD5 or DIGEST-MD5 via SASL, or by GSS-\n   API applications
    that needs a password based method.  The protocol is\n   applicable to other environments,
    such as EAP, should the need arise.\n\n   See <http://josefsson.org/password/>
    for more information.\n\t "

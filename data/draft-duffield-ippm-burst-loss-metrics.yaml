  content: "The IPPM Working Group has developed a one way packet loss metric\nthat
    measures the loss rate on a Poisson probe stream between two\nhosts.  However,
    the impact of packet loss on applications is in\ngeneral sensitive not just to
    the average loss rate, but alsoto the\nway in which packet losses are distributed
    in loss episodes (i.e.,\nmaximal sets of consecutively lost probe packets).  This
    draft\ndefines one-way packet loss episode metrics, specifically the\nfrequency
    and average duration of loss episodes, and a probing\nmethodology under which
    the loss episode metrics are to be measured.\n\t "

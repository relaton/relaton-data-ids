  content: "   In the past decade there has been growing awareness about the harmful\n
    \  effects of bufferbloat in the network, and there has been good work\n   on
    developments like L4S to address that problem.  However,\n   bufferbloat on the
    sender itself remains a significant additional\n   problem, which has not received
    similar attention.  This document\n   offers techniques and guidance for host
    networking software to avoid\n   network traffic suffering unnecessary delays
    caused by excessive\n   buffering at the sender.  These improvements are broadly
    applicable\n   across all datagram and transport protocols (UDP, TCP, QUIC, etc.)
    on\n   all operating systems.\n\n\t "

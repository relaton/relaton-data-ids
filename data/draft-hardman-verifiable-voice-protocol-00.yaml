  content: "   Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) authenticates and authorizes\n   organizations
    and individuals making telephone calls.  This\n   eliminates trust gaps that scammers
    exploit.  Like related\n   technolgies such as SHAKEN, RCD, and BCID, VVP binds
    cryptographic\n   evidence to a SIP INVITE, and verifies this evidence downstream.\n
    \  However, VVP builds from different technical and governance\n   assumptions,
    and uses stronger, richer evidence.  This allows VVP to\n   cross jurisdictional
    boundaries easily and robustly.  It also makes\n   VVP simpler, more decentralized,
    cheaper to deploy and maintain, more\n   private, more scalable, and higher assurance
    than alternatives.\n   Because it is easier to adopt, VVP can plug gaps or build
    bridges\n   between other approaches, functioning as glue in hybrid ecosystems.\n
    \  For example, it may justify an A attestation in SHAKEN, or an RCD\n   passport
    for branded calling, when a call originates outside SHAKEN\n   or RCD ecosystems.
    \ VVP also works well as a standalone mechanism,\n   independent of other solutions.
    \ An extra benefit is that VVP enables\n   two-way evidence sharing with verifiable
    text and chat (e.g., RCS and\n   vCon), as well as with other industry verticals
    that need\n   verifiability in non-telco contexts.\n\n\t "

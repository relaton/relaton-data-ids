  content: "   This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm.  BBR\n
    \  (\"Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time\") uses recent\n   measurements
    of a transport connection's delivery rate, round-trip\n   time, and packet loss
    rate to build an explicit model of the network\n   path.  BBR then uses this model
    to control both how fast it sends\n   data and the maximum volume of data it allows
    in flight in the\n   network at any time.  Relative to loss-based congestion control\n
    \  algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC [RFC9438], BBR offers\n   substantially
    higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers\n   or random losses, and
    substantially lower queueing delays for\n   bottlenecks with deep buffers (avoiding
    \"bufferbloat\").  BBR can be\n   implemented in any transport protocol that supports
    packet-delivery\n   acknowledgment.  Thus far, open source implementations are
    available\n   for TCP [RFC9293] and QUIC [RFC9000].  This document specifies\n
    \  version 3 of the BBR algorithm, BBRv3.\n\n\t "

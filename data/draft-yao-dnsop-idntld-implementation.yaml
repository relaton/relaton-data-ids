  content: "ICANN is pushing the IDN TLD into the root server.  Some IDN TLD has\nthe
    variants.  Currently, there are two proposals to implement the\nIDN TLD variants
    in the root servers:1, implement it with the DNAME\nrecord; 2, implement it with
    NS record.  The IDN TLD variants may be\nreserved or activated.  If the IDN TLD
    variants are activated, these\nvariants will be allocated to the same TLD manager
    in order to avoid\nthe possible phishing problems.  How to deal with the IDN TLD
    variant\nissue is a big challenge ahead of us.  This document discusses the\nIDN
    TLD variants implementation issues related with DNAME and NS\nresource record
    way.  This memo also gives a proposal about how to\navoid the possible phishing
    problem after putting the IDN TLD\nvariants into the root.\n\t "

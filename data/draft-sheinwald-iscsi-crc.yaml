  content: "Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes [Peterson] are shortened \ncyclic
    codes used for error detection. A number of CRC codes have \nbeen adopted in standards:
    ATM, IEC, IEEE, CCITT, IBM-SDLC, and \nmore [Baicheva].  The most important expectation
    from this kind \nof code is a very low probability for undetected errors.  The
    \nprobability of undetected errors in such codes has been, and \nstill is, subject
    to extensive studies that have included both \nanalytical models and simulations.
    Those codes have been used \nextensively in communications and magnetic recording
    as they \ndemonstrate good 'burst error' detection capabilities, but are \nalso
    good at detecting several independent bit errors.  Hardware \nimplementations
    are very simple and well known; their simplicity \nhas made them popular with
    hardware developers for many years. \nHowever, algorithms and software for effective
    implementations of \nCRC are now also widely available [Williams]. \nThe probability
    of undetected errors depends on the polynomial \nselected to generate the code,
    the error distribution (error \nmodel), and the data length. \nIn this memo, we
    attempt to give some estimates for the \nprobability of undetected errors to facilitate
    the selection of \nan error detection code for iSCSI.  \nWe will also attempt
    to compare CRCs with other checksum forms \n(Fletcher, Adler, weighted checksums),
    as permitted by available \ndata.\n\t "

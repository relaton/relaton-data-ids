  content: "Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths to\na
    regular TCP session.  Even though it is designed to be totally\nbackward compatible
    to applications, the data transport differs\ncompared to regular TCP, and there
    are several additional degrees of\nfreedom that applications may wish to exploit.
    \ This document\nsummarizes the impact that MPTCP may have on applications, such
    as\nchanges in performance.  Furthermore, it discusses compatibility\nissues of
    MPTCP in combination with non-MPTCP-aware applications.\nFinally, the document
    describes a basic application interface for\nMPTCP-aware applications that provides
    access to multipath address\ninformation and a level of control equivalent to
    regular TCP.\n\t "

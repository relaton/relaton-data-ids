  content: "We consider the unique address/prefix autoconfiguration problem for\n
    \  MANETs.  Specifically, we consider two cases.  First, a node without\n   a
    pre-assigned and valid local address/prefix acquires a new local\n   address/prefix
    and becomes a member of a new or existing MANET.\n   Second, two or more MANETs
    merge.  In the first case, a mechanism of\n   IP address/prefix generation is
    needed.  We may have MANET-wide\n   duplicate address/prefix detection (DAD) on
    newly generated address/\n   prefix (tentative address/prefix) for suppressing
    occurrence of\n   address/prefix conflict with existing address/prefixes (pre-service\n
    \  DAD).  In the second case, duplicate address/prefix may occur as the\n   result
    of a merger of two formerly independent networks.  We may have\n   DAD on addresses/prefixes
    in use for detecting and resolving\n   duplicate addresses/prefixes and suppressing
    routing information\n   contamination due to existence of duplicate addresses/prefixes
    (in-\n   service DAD).  To define pre-service DAD and in-service DAD, we use\n
    \  autoconfiguration phases that are common for both proactive and\n   reactive
    routing protocol.  Each node exists in one of the\n   autoconfiguration phases
    at any time.  A node, that detects duplicate\n   address/prefix between other
    nodes, may advertise the detected\n   duplicate address/prefix to all other nodes
    in the MANET.  This is\n   termed \"Duplicate address/prefix advertisement\" (DAA).
    \ The specific\n   DAD and DAA algorithm is beyond the scope of this document.\n\t "

  content: "   Open Shortest Path First stub neighbor is an enhancement to the\n   protocol
    to support large scale of neighbors in some topologies with\n   improved convergence
    behavior.  It introduces limited changes\n   protocol behavior to implement a
    scalable solution for hub and spoke\n   topologies by limiting the functionality
    changes to the hub.  The\n   concepts are also applicable to a host running in
    a virtual machine\n   environment.\n\n\t "

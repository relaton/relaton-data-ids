  content: "     This  API  is  a  means for sockets applications to request network\n
    \  security services from an operating system. It is  designed  to  move\n   most
    \ of the work and intelligence of security policy processing into\n   the operating
    system so that the burden  on  application  authors  is\n   light enough to encourage
    the use of network security.\n \n     It  is  documented  here  for  the benefit
    of others who might also\n   adopt and use  the  API,  thus  providing  increased
    \ portability  of\n   applications  that  use  network  security  services  (e.g.,
    \ the  IP\n   Security ESP and AH protocols).\n\n\t "

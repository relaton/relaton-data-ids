  content: "The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path \ncomputation
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label \nSwitching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. \n    \nMPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed
    from layered service \nnetworks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency
    to \nprovide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers. \nPCE
    is a candidate solution for such requirements. \n    \nGeneric requirements for
    a communication protocol between Path \nComputation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are
    presented in \"PCE \nCommunication Protocol Generic Requirements\". This document
    \ncomplements the generic requirements and presents a detailed set of \nPCC-PCE
    communication protocol requirements for inter-layer traffic \nengineering. \n\t "

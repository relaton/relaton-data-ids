  content: "   The Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support protocol enables a mobile\n
    \  network to change its point of attachment and keeps nodes in the\n   mobile
    network reachable when the mobile network moves in the\n   Internet.  However,
    using the NEMO Basic Support protocol, all\n   traffic must pass through the bi-directional
    tunnel between a mobile\n   router and its home agent when the mobile router leaves
    its home\n   network.  The bi-directional tunnel results in sub-optimal routing\n
    \  and long transmission delay.  This document describes the SIP-based\n   Network
    Mobility (SIP-NEMO) Route Optimization (RO) that achieves\n   optimal routing
    and reduces the limitation induced by Mobile IPv6.\n\n\n\t "

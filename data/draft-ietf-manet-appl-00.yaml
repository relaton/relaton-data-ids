  content: "   This memo puts forth a set of questions regarding Mobile Ad hoc\n   Network
    (MANET) routing protocol functionality and applicability.\n   Authors of MANET
    routing protocol draft submissions are requested to\n   include these questions
    (and corresponding answers) in a section in\n   their submissions.  The intent
    of this 'Applicability Section' is to\n   aid readers unfamiliar with the details
    of each protocol's design in\n   understanding the protocol's basic characteristics,
    functioning and\n   mechanisms, as well as to provide a general description of
    the\n   networking context for which the protocol was designed, and in which\n
    \  it is expected to perform well.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a method to support the IP transport service\n
    \  that could guarantee a certain level of service quality in bandwidth\n   and
    latency.  The new transport service is fine-grained and could\n   apply to individual
    or aggregated TCP/UDP flow(s).\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents POP, a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)\n   programming
    model for the Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF)\n   network. POF is an SDN forwarding
    plane technology proposed by\n   Huawei. A POF forwarding element (FE) does no
    need to understand the\n   packet format, and can be programmed to support new
    forwarding\n   protocols. POP enables user to define forwarding protocols and\n
    \  program the POF SDN network on the centralized control plane with\n   algorithmic
    policies that are expressed with high-level programming\n   languages.\n\n\n\t "

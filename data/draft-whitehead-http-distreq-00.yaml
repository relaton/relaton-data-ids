- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The HyperText Transfer Protocol, version 1.1 (HTTP/1.1), provides simple
    support for applications which allow remote editing of typed data. In practice,
    the existing capabilities of HTTP/1.1 have proven inadequate to support efficient,
    scalable remote editing free of overwriting conflicts.  This document presents
    a list of features in the form of requirements which, if implemented, would improve
    the efficiency of common remote editing operations, provide a locking mechanism
    to prevent overwrite conflicts, improve relationship management support between
    non-HTML data types, provide a simple attribute-value metadata facility, and provide
    for the creation and reading of container data types. These requirements are also
    supportive of versioning capability.\n\t "

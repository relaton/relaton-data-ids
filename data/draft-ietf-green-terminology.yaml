abstract:
- content: "<p>Energy-efficient network management is primarily meant to enhance conventional
    network management with energy-related management capabilities that optimize overall
    network energy consumption. To that aim, specific features and capabilities are
    required to control (and thus optimize) the energy use of involved network elements
    and their components. This document defines a set of key terms used within the
    IETF when discussing energy efficiency in network management. Such reference document
    helps framing discussion and agreeing upon a set of main concepts in this area.</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "   Steering traffic for computing-related services considering computing\n
    \  resources and circumstances is discussed in CATS WG.\n   Correspondingly, publishing
    services and updating computing\n   conditions turns out to be a significant issue.
    \ It SHOULD be\n   realized that multiple same common metrics are required from
    both\n   network and service instances in order to evaluate overall\n   performance
    and further achieve and fulfill appropriate traffic\n   steering and scheduling.
    \ Therefore, an implementation for\n   distributed CATS with generic metrics delivery
    and distribution based\n   on BGP is proposed and discussed in this draft.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document extends the STIR architecture by defining a secure\n
    \  telephone identity token and PASSporT with a type of “vesper” and\n   specifies
    the use of Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) for\n   representing persona related
    claim information intended to be\n   associated with verifiable information such
    as the assignment of a\n   telephone number or the output of a Know Your Customer
    (KYC) or Know\n   Your Business (KYB) type of vetting process or Rich Call Data
    (RCD)\n   or claims of consent provided to the telephone number holder.  It\n
    \  defines logical roles that form trusted relationships to establish\n   overall
    eco-system trust.  These roles are in the context of a\n   Subject Entity (SE)
    that is the end entity that is the holder and has\n   the right to use a telephone
    number.  An Issuing Agent (IA)\n   establishes the Subject Entity to the perform
    the initial vetting and\n   establishment of the persona to the eco-system.  A
    Notary Agent (NA)\n   is a neutral role that maintains a graph of relationships
    between all\n   roles, claims, and identities with a corresponding transparency
    log\n   that generates verifiable receipts to “notarize” the recording of\n   these
    relationships and claims being established.  Importantly,\n   privacy is enabled
    in this Notary role because the submitters have\n   the option of submitting hashes
    of claims to protect information, or\n   may usefully want to publicly declare
    their association to a claim to\n   allow the public monitoring to avoid duplicate,
    mistaken or negligent\n   claims which can be identified before enabling any illegitimate
    usage\n   in the eco-system.  A Claim Agent (CA) is a party that produces\n   claims
    in the form of SD-JWT + receipts from the NA.  There is\n   multiple specific
    claim agent types and the claims definitions of key\n   value pairs they are required
    or optionally can include.  These SD-\n   JWT + receipt objects are then collected
    by the SE into a digital\n   wallet that it can then use for selective disclosure
    presentation and\n   incorporate into a “vesper” PASSporT with different “vesper”
    claim\n   SD-JWT + receipt objects and signed by the delegate certificate with\n
    \  telephone number to tie the telephone number back to the SE.\n\n\t "

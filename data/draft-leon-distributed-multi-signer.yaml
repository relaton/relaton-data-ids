  content: "   This document presents an architecture for a distributed DNSSEC\n   multi-signer
    model that most closely resembles \"model 2\" in\n   [RFC8901].\n\n   It defines
    two multi-signer specific entities: the \"multi-signer\n   agent\" (MSA) that
    is responsible for the multi-signer process and the\n   \"combiner\", which is
    responsible for \"combining\" unsigned zone data\n   from the zone owner with
    zone data under control of the MSA.  It\n   introduces a new DNS RRtype, HSYNC,
    that is used by the zone owner to\n   designate the chosen DNS Providers (signing
    and/or serving the zone).\n   Furthermore it describes a mechanism for the MSAs
    to establish secure\n   communication with each other, either via “pure DNS” communication\n
    \  secured by DNS SIG(0) signatures on each message or via a RESTful API\n   secured
    by TLS.  Finally, the document describes two models for\n   multi-signer process
    synchronization: “leader/follower mode” and\n   “peer mode” and the mechanism
    by which a set of MSAs decide which\n   model to use for a given zone.\n\n   The
    scope of the document is only the distributed aspect of DNSSEC\n   multi-signer
    up to the point where secure communication and\n   synchronization method between
    MSAs has been established.  The\n   “multi-signer algorithms” that deal with the
    actual synchronization\n   required for multi-signer operation are described in\n
    \  [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-automation].\n\n   TO BE REMOVED: This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/johanix/draft-leon-dnsop-distributed-multi-signer\n
    \  (https://github.com/johanix/draft-leon-dnsop-distributed-multi-\n   signer).
    \ The most recent working version of the document, open\n   issues, etc, should
    all be available there.  The authors (gratefully)\n   accept pull requests.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides an overview of the Source-Specific Multicast\n(SSM)
    service model which supports source-based multicast trees\nacross multiple domains
    in the Internet.  SSM realizes components of\nthe EXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast service
    model in which there is a\nsingle source for every multicast channel, and channel
    membership is\nbased on the unique combination of multicast group address (G)
    as\nwell as the source's unicast address (S). End-hosts use version 3 of\nthe
    IGMP protocol (IGMPv3) to register their interest in a particular\nsource-group
    (S,G) pair. The PIM-SM protocol is then used to\nconstruct the multicast forwarding
    tree rooted at the source S.\nThis document is intended as a starting point for
    implementing and\ndeploying SSM services. It provides a brief architectural overview
    of\nSSM described in more detail in [HOLBOO] and describes associated\ndeployment
    challenges.  It summarizes changes to protocols and\napplications both at end-hosts
    and routers, with pointers to more\ndetailed documents, wherever appropriate.
    \ Issues of interoperability\nwith the current multicast architecture are also
    discussed.\n\t "

  content: "   Service function chaining (SFC) provides various services that can\n
    \  be tailored to different requirements from diversified user groups,\n   where
    each user group forms a collective client that requires\n   similar service. SFC
    is typically deployed as a service overlay with\n   its own service topology on
    top of existing network topology. This\n   kind of virtualized structure naturally
    enables recursive service\n   relationship where a client may become a service
    provider and resell\n   SFC services to its own user groups. Alternatively, a
    client may\n   also choose to ask its service provider to provide a structured\n
    \  service for its user groups. This document describes some exemplary\n   use
    cases that show the usage of recursive (e.g. nested) or\n   structured service
    function chaining relationship.\n\n\t "

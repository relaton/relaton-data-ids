abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Cookies, as specified in RFC 7873, are a lightweight DNS transaction
    security mechanism that provide limited protection to DNS servers and clients
    against a variety of denial-of-service amplification, forgery, or cache-poisoning
    attacks by off-path attackers. This document updates RFC 7873 with precise directions
    for creating Server Cookies so that an anycast server set including diverse implementations
    will interoperate with standard clients, with suggestions for constructing Client
    Cookies in a privacy-preserving fashion, and with suggestions on how to update
    a Server Secret. An IANA registry listing the methods and associated pseudorandom
    function suitable for creating DNS Server Cookies has been created with the method
    described in this document as the first and, as of the time of publication, only
    entry.</p>"

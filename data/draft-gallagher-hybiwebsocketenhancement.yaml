  content: "   This document proposes an update to RFC 6455 (WebSockets) which would\n
    \  enhance security by preventing network mapping via WebSockets. By\n   comparing
    timing differences between failed opening handshakes,\n   WebSockets can be abused
    within web browsers to discover details\n   about a target's private network.
    WebSocket network mapping is\n   more efficient than other in-browser mapping
    techniques as it can\n   take advantage of child WebWorker processes to bypass
    the throttling\n   mitigations in many browsers.  An attacker can exploit this
    browser\n   weakness when a victim accesses an attacker-controlled web page.\n\n\t "

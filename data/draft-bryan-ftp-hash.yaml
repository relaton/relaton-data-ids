  content: "The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify the\nintegrity
    of a transferred file, nor can two files be compared\nagainst each other without
    actually transferring them first.\nCryptographic hashes are a possible solution
    to this problem.  In the\npast, several attempts have been made to add commands
    to obtain\nchecksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified,\nleading
    to non-interoperability and confusion.  To solve these\nissues, this document
    specifies a new FTP command to be used by\nclients to request cryptographic hashes
    of files.\n\t "

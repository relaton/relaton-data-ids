  script: Latn
  content: "Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected in the \n   last
    ten years. As IPv4 address exhaustion gets closer, the IPv4/IPv6 \n   transition
    issues become more critical and complicated. Host-based \n   transition mechanisms
    are not able to meet the requirements while \n   most end users are not sufficiently
    expert to configure or maintain \n   these transition mechanisms. Carrier Grade
    NAT with integrated \n   transition mechanisms can simplify the operation of end
    users during \n   the IPv4/IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document
    proposes \n   an incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) approach for IPv6 transition.
    \n   It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled end hosts and \n   IPv4
    access services for IPv4 end hosts while remaining most of \n   legacy IPv4 ISP
    networks unchanged. It is suitable for the initial \n   stage of IPv4/IPv6 migration.
    Unlike CGN alone, it also supports and \n   encourages transition towards dual-stack
    or IPv6-only ISP networks.\n\t "

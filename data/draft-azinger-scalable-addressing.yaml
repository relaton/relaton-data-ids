  content: "This document presents a scalable architecture for assigning and\naggregating
    IPv6 address space.  The current IPv4 assignment and\naddressing architecture
    has been successful in helping to scale the\nIPv4 routing architecture.  This
    same architecture, when carried\nforward to IPv6, will help to ensure that the
    IPv6 routing\narchitecture is sustainable.\n\t "

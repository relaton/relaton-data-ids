  content: "   To enhance the reliability, bridged network is normally multi-homed\n
    \  to an EVPN network, there are two categories of mechanisms to avoid\n   the
    layer 2 traffic loop. The first category does not require the PEs\n   participating
    in the control protocol of the bridged network, while\n   the second category
    requires that. [EVPN] described one of the first\n   category mechanisms called
    \ designated forwarder (DF) election to\n   achieve loop avoidance and vlan-based
    load balancing. This draft\n   mainly focuses on the second category of mechanisms
    which can achieve\n   intra-vlan MAC-based load balancing. MAC-based VLAN balancing
    is more\n   applicable than DF election mechanism if all end stations in bridged\n
    \  network are on the same VLAN which can cause traffic congestion in DF\n   link.\n\n\t "

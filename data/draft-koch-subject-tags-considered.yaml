  content: "   Various mailing lists modify the Subject: header field of messages\n
    \  sent to the list to contain a kind of identifier enclosed in square\n   brackets.
    \ Every now and then this 'feature' is also requested for\n   the main IETF list.
    \ This document collects pros and cons of this\n   approach, tries to identify
    the real issue and will, in a later\n   stage, try to give a recommendation.\n\t "

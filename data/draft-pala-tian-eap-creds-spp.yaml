  content: "   With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that\n
    \  rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or\n   tokens)
    for network access, the need for a standardized credentials\n   provisioning and
    management framework is paramount.  The 802.1x\n   architecture allows for entities
    (e.g., devices, applications, etc.)\n   to authenticate to the network by providing
    a communication channel\n   where different methods can be used to exchange different
    types of\n   credentials.  EAP-CREDS is an EAP method that specifically designed\n
    \  for credential provisioning and management.  If implemented in Access\n   Networks
    (e.g., wired), EAP-CREDS can offer credentials management\n   services such as
    registration, provisioning, and renewal.  Besides,\n   EAP-CREDS provides protocol
    encapsulation mechanism that allows it to\n   use with other credential management
    protocols.  Therefore, this\n   document defines how to use EAP-CREDS with the
    Simple Provisioning\n   Protocol (SPP) to support the provisioning and management
    of\n   authentication credentials for user and/or devices in an access\n   network.
    \ Other credential provisioning protocols can also use this\n   document as a
    guideline and template for its own encapsulation with\n   EAP-CREDS.\n\n\t "

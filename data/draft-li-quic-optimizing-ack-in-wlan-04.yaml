abstract:
- content: "<p>The dependence on frequent acknowledgments (ACKs) is an artifact of
    current transport protocol designs rather than a fundamental requirement. This
    document analyzes the problems caused by contentions and collisions on wireless
    medium between data packets and ACKs in WLAN and it proposes an ACK mechanism
    that minimizes the intensity of ACK Frame in QUIC, improving the performance of
    transport layer connection.</p>"

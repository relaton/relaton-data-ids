  content: "   This document introduces an automatic congestion relief mechanism\n
    \  based on intelligent traffic analysis and dynamic regulation.  In the\n   event
    of congestion caused by fiber optic failures, it can respond\n   intelligently
    and self-heal in real time, ensuring the stable\n   operation of the network.\n\n\t "

  content: "This Internet Draft discusses a proposed extension to the set of\nInterface
    Identifier construction methods for 802 networks.  The\npurpose of this is to
    allow autoconf RA announcments of prefix length\nother than 64 bits.  It is intended
    to be fully backward compatible\nfor /64 announcements.  Instead of having one
    Interface Identifier\nconstruction method for all purposes, this adds an alternate
    method\nwhich is only used for autoconf, and only if the prefix length is not\n/64.
    \ No other IPv6 methods or protocols require modification.\nHowever, without modification,
    use of prefixes other than /64 likely\nwon't support many IPv6 enhanced functions.\n\nThe
    ultimate goal it providing enough bits between the top level\nallocation by Regional
    Internet Registristry (RIR) and the smallest\nautoconfiguration allocation, to
    allow both external aggregation by\nISPs into one prefix, as well as internal
    hierarchical aggregation to\nsupport a variety of ISP topologies and practices.
    \ Current policies\nare driven from below by the current 64 bit Interface Identifier.\nOnly
    by relaxing this to 48 bits for such technologies as 802\n(Ethernet), does the
    number of bits available reach a level deemed\n\"sufficient\".Author's Note\n\nThis
    Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related\ndraft(s) being
    placed on the Standards Track for 6man.\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described
    in [5].\n\t "

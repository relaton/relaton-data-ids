  content: "The IMAP4 specification allows the searching of only the selected mailbox.
    \ A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a client that wishes to
    support this must issue a series of SELECT and SEARCH commands, waiting for each
    to complete before moving on to the next.  This extension allows a client to search
    multiple mailboxes with one command, limiting the round trips and waiting for
    various searches to complete, and not requiring disruption of the currently selected
    mailbox.  This extension also uses MAILBOX and TAG fields in ESEARCH responses,
    allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.  This document updates
    RFC 4466.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

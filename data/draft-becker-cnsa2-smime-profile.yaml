  content: "   This document defines a base profile of S/MIME for use with the US\n
    \  Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a\n   cybersecurity
    advisory published by the United States Government\n   which outlines quantum-resistant
    cryptographic algorithm policy for\n   US national security applications.\n\n
    \  This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and\n   operation
    of all components of US National Security Systems that\n   employ S/MIME.  It
    is also appropriate for all other US Government\n   systems that process high-value
    information.\n\n   This memo is not an IETF standard, and has not been shown to
    have\n   IETF community consensus.  This profile is made publicly available\n
    \  for use by developers and operators of these and any other system\n   deployments.\n\n\t "

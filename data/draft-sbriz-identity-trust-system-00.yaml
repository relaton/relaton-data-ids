  content: "   This document describes the identity trust system, which is an open\n
    \  identity authentication system that does not require federation of\n   authentication
    domains.  It is based on a symmetric authentication\n   protocol and a specific
    infrastructure to ensure trust in the\n   identity providers (IdPs).  Regarding
    the main components:\n   1.  Symmetric authentication protocol - Both entities
    MUST recognize\n       each other and are authenticated by their identity provider\n
    \      according to a symmetric scheme.  This protocol builds on and\n       extends
    the OAuth Authorization Framework RFC6749.\n   2.  Trustees' network - A special
    network, dedicated to creating a\n       protected environment for exchanging
    authentication messages\n       between IdPs, constitutes the infrastructure to
    avoid domain\n       federation.\n   3.  Custodian concept - IdPs are divided
    into two typologies to\n       better protect personal data.  A generic IdP (called
    trustee) for\n       pure digital authentication and a specific IdP (called custodian)\n
    \      under the control of the country's authority with legal right to\n       the
    individual's real data to ensure physical identity.\n\t "

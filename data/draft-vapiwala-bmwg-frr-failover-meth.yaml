  content: "This draft provides the methodology for benchmarking the failover time
    \nof local protection (aka Fast Reroute). The failover to a backup tunnel \ncould
    happen at the headend of the primary tunnel or a midpoint and the \nbackup could
    offer link or node protection. It becomes vital to \nbenchmark the failover time
    for all the cases and combinations. The \nfailover time could also greatly differ
    based on the design and \nimplementation and by factors like the number of prefixes
    carried by the \ntunnel, the number of primary tunnels affected by the event that
    caused \nthe failover, number of primary tunnels the backup protects and type
    of \nfailure etc. All the required benchmarking criteria and benchmarking \ntopology
    required for measuring failover time of local protection is \ndescribed Conventions
    used in this document \n\t "

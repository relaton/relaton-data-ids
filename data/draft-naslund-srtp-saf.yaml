  content: "This memo describes the use of so called store-and-forward\ncryptographic
    transforms within the Secure Real-time Transport\nProtocol (SRTP).  The motivation
    is to support use cases when two\nend-points communicate via one (or more) store-and-forward\nmiddleboxes
    that are not fully trusted to access the media content.\nOne of the main aspects
    of the transform is to make the\nconfidentiality and message authentication independent
    of the RTP\nheader.  Another central aspect is to enable identification of the\ncryptographic
    context (keys etc.).  Besides the security of the end-\npoints, also trust assumptions
    regarding the store-and-forward\nmiddleboxes are addressed.\n\t "

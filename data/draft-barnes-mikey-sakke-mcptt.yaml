  content: "   3GPP TS 33.179 defines the group services and system aspects for the\n
    \  Security of Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT) service.  To create\n   a
    group's security association, a Group Master Key (GMK) and\n   associated identifier
    (GMK-ID) is distributed to MCPTT User Equipment\n   (UE) by a Group Management
    Server (GMS).  The GMK is distributed\n   encrypted specifically to a user and
    signed using an identity\n   representing the Group Management Server.  The GMK
    is distributed\n   within a Group Key Transport payload, which is a MIKEY-SAKKE\n
    \  I_MESSAGE, as defined in RFC 6509, which ensures the confidentiality,\n   integrity
    and authenticity of the payload.  In order to convey the\n   MCPTT specific service
    in the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE, this document\n   defines new values for the Type
    field of the General Extensions\n   Payload Field defined for MIKEY in RFC 3830
    the ID Role field in RFC\n   6043 and the ID Scheme field in RFC 6509.\n\n\t "

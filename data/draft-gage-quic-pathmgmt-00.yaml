  content: "   This document defines path management procedures for QUIC that\n   operate
    independently of the connection management procedures defined\n   in RFC9000.
    \ The path management procedures enable a multipath\n   configuration between
    endpoints by allowing QUIC packets associated\n   with any connection identifier
    to be transported over any of the\n   paths established between the endpoints.
    \ As a consequence, the\n   principles and operations of RFC9000 are retained
    regardless of the\n   path used to a convey QUIC packet.\n\n\t "

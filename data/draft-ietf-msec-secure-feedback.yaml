  content: "Members in a secure group may need to communicate to the GCKS to\nDeregister
    from the group, for SA resynchronization, or to request\nretransmission of a Rekey
    message. A simple solution is to keep the\nregistration SA around, but that comes
    at the expense of O(n) SA\nmaintenance, and storage at the GCKS. Each member is
    also responsible\nfor maintaining an extra SA. We propose an efficient method
    for mem-\nbers to securely send messages to the GCKS, using the Rekey SA.\n\n\n\t "

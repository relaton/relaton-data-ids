  content: "   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic\n   Optimization
    (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the\n   Endpoint Cost Service.
    \ However the base protocol defines only a\n   single cost metric, i.e., the generic
    \"routingcost\" metric (Sec. 14.2\n   of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).  In
    practice, applications may\n   request network information on other cost (including
    performance)\n   metrics.\n\n   In this document, we define five new base metrics
    which are delay,\n   jitter, pktloss (packet loss), bandwidth and hopcount.  These
    base\n   metrics are further extended with these nine new metrics linkdelay,\n
    \  linkjitter, linkloss, maxbw (Maximum Bandwidth), maxreservbw (Maximum\n   Reserved
    Bandwdith), unreservbw (Unreserved Bandwidth), residuebw\n   (Residual Bandwidth),
    availbw (Available Bandwidth), and utilbw\n   (Utilized Bandwidth).  Also a new
    parameter anomalousstate is added.\n   These fourteen cost metrics are derived
    from OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE and\n   can be either used as constraint attribute associated
    with\n   'routingcost' cost metric attribute or used as returned Cost metrics\n
    \  in the response, or both and hence provide a relatively comprehensive\n   set
    of cost metrics for ALTO.\n\n\t "

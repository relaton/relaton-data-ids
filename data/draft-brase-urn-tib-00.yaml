  content: "The German research agency (DFG) has started a project in 2004 to \nimprove
    the access to primary data especially for interdisciplinary \ndata use. Publications
    of primary data should be citable as \npublications so that the data set may be
    cited together with the author\nwhen being used further. \nBy this, scientific
    primary data should not be exclusively understood \nas part of a scientific publication,
    but may have its own identity. \nThe data records remain at their research institutes,
    but the metadata\nrecords will be stored at the German national library of Science
    and \nTechnology (TIB) as a central registration agency, the data records are\nidentified
    with a DOI as a persistent identifier. In cooperation with \nthe German Library
    the data record shall also be registered with an \nurn.\n\t "

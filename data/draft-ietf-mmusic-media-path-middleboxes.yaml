  content: "   Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions\n
    \  apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data\n   path
    between a source host and destination host.  Two such functions\n   are network
    address translation and firewalling.\n\n   When Application Layer Gateways, such
    as SIP entities, interact with\n   NATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM
    architecture, then\n   problems may occur in the transport of media traffic when
    signaling\n   protocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it is
    the\n   case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP).  This\n   document
    highlights problems that may arise.  Unfortunately, it is\n   difficult for the
    end points to detect or predict problematic\n   behavior and to determine whether
    the media path is reliably\n   available for packet exchange.\n\n   This document
    aims to summarize the various sources and effects of\n   NAT and firewall control,
    the reasons that they exist, and possible\n   means of improving their behavior
    to allow protocols that rely upon\n   signaling along the media path to operate
    effectively.\n\n\t "

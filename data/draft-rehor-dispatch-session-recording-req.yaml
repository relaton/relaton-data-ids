  content: "   Session recording is a critical requirement in many business\n   communications
    environments such as call centers and financial\n   trading floors.  In some of
    these environments, all calls must be\n   recorded for regulatory and compliance
    reasons.  In others, calls may\n   be recorded for quality control or business
    analytics.\n\n   Recording is typically done by sending a copy of the session
    media to\n   the recording devices.  This document specifies requirements for\n
    \  extensions to SIP that will manage delivery of media from an end-\n   point
    that originates media (or that has access to it) to a recording\n   device.  This
    is being referred to as SIP-based Media Recording.\n\t "

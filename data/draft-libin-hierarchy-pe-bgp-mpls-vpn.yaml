  content: "In the deployment of BGP/MPLS VPN,the PE(Provider Edge)Device should\nmaintain
    all the VPN routes of the VPNs which it belong to.When there \nare many VPNs converged
    by a PE,and the capacity of PE is relevant\nlimited,then the bottleneck will be
    encountered.Another problem is \nthat the current BGP/MPLS VPN model is something
    of a 'Plane Modle'\nwhere the demand of the performance of the PE device are all
    the \nsame no matter which layer the PE device is belongs to.However,the \ntypical
    network is 'Core-Convergence-Access(Edge)' model,and the \nperformance of the
    device is superior in Core Layer and inferior in \nAccess Layer,and the scale
    of network is large in Access Layer and \nsmall in Core Layer,the routes are converged
    in every layer,so in \ncurrent 'Plane Modle',when PE device push to the edge layer,it
    has \nto maintain more VPN routes,this makes it difficult to extend the PE\ndevice
    to edge layer.This document defines an model of Hierarchy of \nProvider Edge Device
    in BGP/MPLS VPN,where Hierarchy of Provider \nEdge Device can be composed of several
    device and every device take \non the different part,partake the function of the
    former \nconcentrative PE,we call this model 'Hierarchy Model',In this model\nthe
    demand of performance in Routing and Switching is strict to the \nPE device in
    High layer,loose to the PE device in edge layer.\n \n   One HoPE can be composed
    of a SPE and UPES connected to the SPE, \n   or be composed of a high-level SPE
    and HoPEs connected the high \n   level SPE and and build up a new HoPE.This build
    is called nesting \n   of HoPE,and this kind of nesting can be done for many times.Thus
    the \n   former HoPE connect to the high-level SPE as a role of UPE,and the \n
    \  new HoPE can connect a single UPE too.\n\t "

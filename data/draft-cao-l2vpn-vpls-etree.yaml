  content: "   This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum\n
    \  (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service [RFC4761]\n   [RFC4762].
    The proposed solution is characterized by breaking\n   pseudowire setup between
    Leaf endpoints in E-Tree instance to fulfill\n   the specific E-Tree requirement:
    Leaf cannot communicate with Leaf.\n   Backward compatibility is also considered
    in this document.\n\n\t "

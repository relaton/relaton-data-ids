  content: "   Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a critical part of IPv6. ND uses\n   multicast
    extensively and trusts all hosts and routers. In some\n   scenarios, such as wireless
    networks, multicast can be inefficient.\n   In other scenarios, such as public
    access networks, some hosts or\n   routers may not be trustworthy. Consequently,
    ND can have security\n   and operational issues in some scenarios. The issues
    and mitigation\n   solutions are documented in more than 20 RFCs, making it challenging\n
    \  to track all these issues and solutions. Therefore, an overview\n   document
    is helpful.\n\n   This document first summarizes the published ND issues and the\n
    \  solutions. This provides a one-stop reference as of the time of\n   writing.
    This document then points out that these more than 20\n   issues originate from
    just three causes. Addressing the issues is\n   made simpler by addressing the
    causes. This document also analyzes\n   the mitigation solutions to show that
    isolating hosts into different\n   subnets and links can help to address the three
    causes, and thus\n   prevent ND issues. Three isolation methods and their applicability\n
    \  are described. A simple guideline is suggested for selecting a\n   suitable
    isolation method to prevent potential ND issues.\n\n\t "

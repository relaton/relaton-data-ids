  content: "   Footprint advertisement is a very important step for CDN\n   interconnection
    and generates a lot of discussion.  Actually, each\n   CDN can serve the whole
    world if its surrogates are publicly\n   reachable by IP addresses.  But if a
    CDN does that, it can not\n   satisfy the requirements from the applications.
    \ So CDNs deliver\n   contents for applications, and the basic requirements should
    be from\n   the applications.  One CDN can serve different applications well with\n
    \  different footprint.  But there is rare discussion on service level\n   requirements
    based footprint.  This document is used to generate the\n   discussion on this
    aspect.\n\n\t "

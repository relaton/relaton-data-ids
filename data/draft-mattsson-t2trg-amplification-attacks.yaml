  content: "   Protecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices against attacks is not\n
    \  enough.  IoT deployments need to make sure that they are not used for\n   Distributed
    Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.  DDoS attacks are\n   typically done with compromised
    devices or with amplification attacks\n   using a spoofed source address.  This
    document gives examples of\n   different theoretical amplification attacks using
    the Constrained\n   Application Protocol (CoAP).  The goal with this document
    is to raise\n   awareness and to motivate generic and protocol-specific\n   recommendations
    on the usage of CoAP.  Some of the discussed attacks\n   can be mitigated by not
    using NoSec or by using the Echo option.\n\n\t "

  content: "The current flat-structured Host Identity Tag architecture has \nvarious
    problems and limitation. Hence, a hierarchical HIT \narchitecture that is compatible
    with the flat-structured HIT \narchitecture is introduced in the document. This
    architecture and the \nprocess of HIT generation ensure the global uniqueness
    of HITs. This \narchitecture also enables the multiple Host Identity Protocol
    \nadministrative domains, solves the deployment problem of current \nflat-structured
    HIT architecture. It also enhances the scalability \nand resolution efficiency
    of the mapping system from HIT to IP or \nFQDN.\n\t "

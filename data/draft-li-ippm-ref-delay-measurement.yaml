  content: "   The end-to-end network one-way delay is an important performance\n
    \  metric in the 5G network.  For realizing the accurate one-way delay\n   measurement,
    existing methods requires the end-to-end deployment of\n   accurate clock synchronization
    mechanism, such as PTP or GPS, which\n   results in relatively high deployment
    cost.  Another method can\n   derive the one-way delay from the round-trip delay.
    \ In this case,\n   since the delay of the downlink and uplink may be asymmetric,
    the\n   measurement accuracy is relatively low.  Hence, this document\n   introduces
    a method to measure the end-to-end network one-way delay\n   based on a reference
    delay guaranteed by deterministic networking\n   without clock synchronization.The
    advantage of this solution is that\n   it has high measurement accuracy and can
    test any flow type.\n\n\t "

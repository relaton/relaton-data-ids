  content: "   SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to diagnose user reported\n
    \  problems and for regression testing if network or user agent software\n   is
    upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected, including\n   connection
    via transit networks, it becomes impractical to predict\n   the path that SIP
    signaling will take between user agents, and\n   therefore impractical to monitor
    SIP signaling end-to-end.\n\n   This document describes an indicator for the SIP
    protocol which can\n   be used to mark signaling as being of interest to logging.
    \ Such\n   marking will typically be applied as part of network testing\n   controlled
    by the network operator and not used in normal user agent\n   signaling.  Operators
    of all networks on the signaling path can agree\n   to carry such marking end-to-end,
    including the originating and\n   terminating SIP user agents, even if a session
    originates and\n   terminates in different networks.\n\n\t "

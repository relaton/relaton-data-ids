    on X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates as defined in RFC 3280,
    for use in the Internet.  The term Proxy Certificate is used to describe a certificate
    that is derived from, and signed by, a normal X.509 Public Key End Entity Certificate
    or by another Proxy Certificate for the purpose of providing restricted proxying
    and delegation within a PKI based authentication system. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

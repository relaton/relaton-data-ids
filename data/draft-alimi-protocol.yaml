  content: "   Content distribution applications, such as those those employing\n
    \  peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, are widely used on the Internet and\n   make
    up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  Often,\n   however, content
    distribution applications use network resources in a\n   counter-productive manner.
    \ One way to improve efficiency is to\n   introduce storage capabilities within
    the network and enable\n   cooperation between end-host and in-network content
    distribution\n   mechanisms.  This is the capability provided by a DECADE-compatible\n
    \  system, which is introduced in this document.  DECADE enables\n   applications
    to take advantage of in-network storage when\n   distributing data objects as
    opposed to using solely end-to-end\n   resources.  This document presents the
    underlying principles and key\n   functionalities of such a system and illustrates
    operation through a\n   set of examples.\n\n\n\t "

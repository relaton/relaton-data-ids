  content: "This document presents the issues facing streaming media caching. It\nproposes
    a set of mechanisms to enable streaming media caching\nbetween standards-based
    RTSP/RTP servers and proxies. Streaming\nmedia caching refers to the process through
    which streaming content\nis dynamically replicated closer to users so as to provide
    a better\nviewing experience. A list of RTSP enhancements and open issues are\npresented.
    This document is intended to be a starting point for\ndiscussion between various
    parties interested in standardizing the\nmechanism used by RTSP/RTP servers to

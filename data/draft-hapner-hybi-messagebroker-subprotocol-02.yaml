  content: "   The WebSocket protocol [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol] provides\n
    \  a subprotocol extension facility.  The MessageBroker WebSocket\n   Subprotocol
    (MBWS) is a WebSocket Subprotocol used by messaging\n   clients to send messages
    to, and receive messages from an internet\n   message broker (herein called a
    message broker).  A message broker is\n   a messaging intermediary that queues
    messages sent by its clients for\n   asynchronous delivery to its clients.\n\n
    \  Messages are addressed to message-broker-specific address names.\n   Clients
    send messages to addresses and consume messages from\n   addresses.  Clients do
    not send messages directly to other clients.\n\n   Message brokers provide a range
    of functionality that is outside the\n   scope of MBWS.  Typically an internet
    message broker provides a REST\n   API for working with this functionality; such
    as configuring client\n   credentials; setting client access controls; configuring
    address\n   routing; etc.\n\n   MBWS limits its scope to the definition of a WebSocket
    subprotocol\n   that provides a full duplex, reliable message transport protocol\n
    \  between message brokers and their clients; and, between message\n   brokers.\n\n
    \  Since reliable message transport is often independent of a broker's\n   particular
    features, MBWS can be used as the message transport\n   protocol for a wide range
    of message brokers.\n\n   The MBWS subprotocol defines a binary message frame
    and a text\n   message frame.  Both types of frame carry the same protocol; however,\n
    \  the protocol bindings differ slightly.  The binary frame is a\n   WebSocket
    binary message that contains an MBWS binary header followed\n   by a binary message
    body.  The text frame is a WebSocket UTF-8 text\n   message that contains an MBWS
    text header followed by a text message\n   body.\n\n\t "

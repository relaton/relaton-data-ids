  content: "   There are deployments where the Layer 3 interface on which a BGP peer\n
    \  session is established is a Layer 2 interface bundle.  In order to\n   allow
    BGP-EPE to control traffic flows on individual member links of\n   the underlying
    Layer 2 bundle, BGP Peering SIDs need to be allocated\n   to individual bundle
    member links, and advertisement of such BGP\n   Peering SIDs in BGP-LS is required.
    \ This document describes how to\n   support Segment Routing BGP Egress Peer Engineering
    over Layer 2\n   bundle members.  This document updates RFC9085 to allow the L2
    Bundle\n   Member Attributes TLV to be added to the BGP-LS Attribute associated\n
    \  with the Link NLRI of BGP peering link.  This document updates\n   RFC9085
    and RFC9086 to allow the PeerAdj SID TLV to be included as a\n   sub-TLV of the
    L2 Bundle Member Attributes TLV.\n\n\t "

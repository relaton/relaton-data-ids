  content: "   As IP networks grow more complicated, these networks require a new\n
    \  interaction mechanism between customers and their networks based on\n   intent
    rather than detailed specifics.  An intent-based protocol\n   language is need
    to enable customers to easily describe their diverse\n   intent for network connectivity
    to the network management systems.\n   This document describes the problem Intent-Based
    NEtwork Modeling\n   (IB-Nemo) language is trying to solve, a summary of the use
    cases\n   that demonstrate this problem, and a proposed scope of work.  Part of\n
    \  the scope is the validation of the language as a minimal subset.\n\n   The
    IB-NEMO language is a protocol language for interactions between\n   an application
    and a network manager/controller.  Some would call\n   this boundary between the
    application and the network management\n   system as northbound interface (NBI),
    and any protocol language that\n   crosses this as an NBI.  IB-Nemo focuses on
    creating minimal subset\n   of the total possible Intent-Based desired commands.
    \ By creating a\n   minimal subset (about 20% of the total possible), the IB-Nemo\n
    \  language can be a simple Intent interface for most applications\n   (hopefully
    80%).  Part of validation of this language is to to\n   determine what data models
    should result in the network controller\n   from different use cases.  This way
    as IB-Nemo protocol language is\n   reduced the effort can verify that the critical
    information is\n   stilled passed.\n\n\t "

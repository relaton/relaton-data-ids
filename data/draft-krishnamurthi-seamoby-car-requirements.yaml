  content: "The pre-requisite for IP based seamless mobility protocols is the\nknowledge
    of the access router (AR) to which a mobile node can be\nhanded over to. Further,
    a handoff can be optimized if the capabilities\nof the AR being considered for
    handoff are known. The protocol which\ndiscovers ARs for potential handoff along
    with their capabilities is\ncalled the CAR discovery protocol. In this draft we
    list the\nrequirements which are to be met by CAR discovery protocols.\n\t "

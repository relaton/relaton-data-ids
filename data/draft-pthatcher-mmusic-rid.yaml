  content: "   In this specification, we define a framework for identifying Source\n
    \  RTP Streams with the constraints on its payload format in the Session\n   Description
    Protocol.  This framework uses \"rid\" SDP attribute to: a)\n   effectively identify
    the Source RTP Streams within a RTP Session, b)\n   constrain their payload format
    parameters in a codec-agnostic way\n   beyond what is provided with the regular
    Payload Types and c) enable\n   unambiguous mapping between the Source RTP Streams
    to their media\n   format specification in the SDP.\n\n   Note-1: The name 'rid'
    is not yet finalized.  Please refer to\n   Section 12 for more details on the
    naming.\n\n\t "

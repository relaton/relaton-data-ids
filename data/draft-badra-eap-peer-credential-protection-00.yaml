  content: "   Actual EAP methods provide authentication services based on the use
    \n   of certificates, secret keys or passwords. These methods, excepting \n   the
    tunneling ones, exchange peer identity in clear text. Moreover, \n   some of these
    methods do not enable the ability to exchange channel \n   binding information.
    They do not, however, define a common encoding \n   of the credential protection
    or of the channel binding or of. This \n   document defines AVPs to securely exchange
    data related to the peer \n   identity, when an EAP method deriving keys is deployed.

  content: "This memo documents OSPF-lite. OSPF-lite is a link state routing\nprotocol,
    and a branch version of Internet Standard 54 OSPF [ref1].\nIt is designed to be
    run internal to a single Autonomous System.\nEach OSPF-lite router maintains an
    identical database describing\nthe Autonomous System's topology. From this database,
    a routing table\nis calculated by constructing a shortest-path tree.\n\nOSPF-lite
    has been designed to provide a simpler version of the OSPF \nprotocol. A router
    running ospf-lite requires little configuration.\nAreas are not implemented and
    all designated Router functionality has\nbeen removed from the protocol. OSPF-lite
    will run over non fully\nmeshed clouds with no special OSPF configuration commands
    required.\nMany of the Protocol complexities have been removed, and processor\noverhead
    utilised in a different way. This work is intended to keep\npace with the vast
    increases in processor performance, memory size\nand link capacity since OSPF
    was originally designed in 1989, with\nthe resulting benefits of simpler network
    design, configuration and\nmaintenance.\n\nThe differences between this memo and
    RFC 2328 are highlighted \nthroughout the document, but special attention should
    be placed on\nSections 2, 7, 16, and Appendix A; the latter describes detailed\npacket
    structures. Many of the differences are backward compatible in\nnature, but it
    is not envisioned that OSPF Version 2 will interoperate\nwith OSPF-lite, unless
    multiple instances are running and route\nredistribution is employed.\n\nThe protocol
    has been designed with backward consistency in mind,\nas far has been possible,
    to allow code modules developed for OSPF\nVersion 2 to be re-utilised.\n\nThis
    Internet Draft has been written within the same structure as \nRFC 2328, to enable
    a section-by-section comparison with previous\nversions of the main OSPF protocol.
    It is recommended that the\nsections are directly compared. The authors’ thanks
    in turn go the\ndevelopers of all of the features in RFC 2328, and associated
    RFCs,\nand Standards.\n\n\t "

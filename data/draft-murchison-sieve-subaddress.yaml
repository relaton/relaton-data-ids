  content: "On email systems that allow for \"subaddressing\" or \"detailed addressing\"
    (e.g., \"ken+sieve@example.org\"), it is sometimes desirable to make comparisons
    against these sub-parts of addresses.  This document defines an extension to the
    Sieve mail filtering language that allows users to compare against the user and
    detail parts of an address. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

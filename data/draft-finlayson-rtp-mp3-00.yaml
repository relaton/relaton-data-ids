  script: Latn
  content: "While the RTP payload format defined in RFC 2250 is generally applicable\nto
    all forms of MPEG audio or video, it is less suitable for MPEG 1 or 2,\nlayer
    III audio (commonly known as 'MP3').  The reason for this is that\nan MP3 frame
    is not a true 'Application Data Unit' - it contains a\nback-pointer to data in
    earlier frames, and so cannot be decoded\nindependently of these earlier frames.
    \ Because RFC 2250 defines that packet\nboundaries coincide with frame boundaries,
    it handles packet loss\ninefficiently when carrying MP3 data.  The loss of an
    MP3 frame will render\nsome data in previous (or future) frames useless, even
    if they are received\nwithout loss.\n \nIn this document we define a new RTP payload
    format for MP3 audio.  The new\nformat is essentially the same as that defined
    in RFC 2250, except for a\ndata-preserving rearrangement of the original MPEG
    frames, so that packet\nboundaries now coincide with true MP3 'Application Data
    Units'.  This new\nformat is therefore more data efficient in the face of packet
    loss.\n\t "

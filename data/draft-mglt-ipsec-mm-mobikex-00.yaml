  content: "   This draft provides a description of MOBIKE mobility and multihoming\n
    \  extension (MOBIKE-X).  The extension is elaborated from the MOBIKE\n   [RFC4555]
    protocol as well as mobility and multihoming requirements   described in [I-D.mglt-ipsec-mm-requirements].
    \ Extension concerns\n   the Security Association facilities in a multihoming
    and mobile\n   environment.  More specifically this draft considers the use of\n
    \  multiple interfaces and the transport mode of IPsec.  One of the goal\n   of
    this draft was to make this extension compatible with MOBIKE\n   [RFC4555].  We
    especially point out the differences from MOBIKE\n   [RFC4555], as well as how
    its interacts with MOBIKE.\n\t "

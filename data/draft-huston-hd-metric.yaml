  content: "This memo provides an analysis of the Host Density metric as it is currently
    used to guide registry allocations of IPv6 unicast address blocks.  This document
    contrasts the address efficiency as currently adopted in the allocation of IPv4
    network addresses and that used by the IPv6 protocol.  Note that for large allocations
    there are very significant variations in the target efficiency metric between
    the two approaches.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

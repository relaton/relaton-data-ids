  content: "   This document is a summary of the results of meetings with actual\n
    \  manufacturers of industrial products, companies that establish and\n   run
    social infrastructures (hereafter referred to as \"Things\n   companies\"), and
    ICT enterprises about the challenges they face in\n   realizing IoT. These meetings
    revealed that the Things companies are\n   troubled by such as the vast gap between
    the product lifetimes of\n   their company products and the pace at which generation
    changes occur\n   in ICT technologies, the difference between the actual values
    and\n   catalog values of the wave traveling ranges, and the enormous number\n
    \  of sensors that need to be installed. In order to deploy about IoT,\n   we
    believe that the solutions to these primitive issues must be\n   promoted in tandem
    with a service-oriented approach that places an\n   emphasis on the effects.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes a limited flooding approach to address the \nproblem
    of routing scalability in link state IGPs. The solution is \nbased on decomposition
    \ of a routing area into 'zones' and the \nrestriction of the exchange of routing
    information between zones.  \nThis approach introduces an extra level in the isolation
    of \nknowledge within a routing domain. The advantage of this solution is \nthat
    it considerably decreases the amount of information flooded in \nlink state advertisements
    and reduces the size of the link-state \ndatabase (and traffic engineering entries)
    on network elements \nutilizing link state protocols.   The technique presented
    in this \ndocument has been particularized to OSPF in order to make the \ndiscussion
    practical and concrete. However, the underlying concepts \nare very general and
    similar modifications can be easily applied to \nother IGPs, such as ISIS.  \n

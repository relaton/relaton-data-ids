  content: "   This document introduces a fast rerouting architecture for enhancing\n
    \  network resilience through rapid failure detection and swift traffic\n   rerouting
    within the programmable data plane, leveraging in-band\n   network telemetry and
    source routing.  Unlike traditional methods\n   that rely on the control plane
    and face significant delays in traffic\n   rerouting, the proposed architecture
    utilizes a white-box modeling of\n   the data plane to distinguish and analyze
    packet losses accurately,\n   enabling immediate identification for link failures
    (including black-\n   hole and gray failures).  By utilizing real-time telemetry
    and SR-\n   based rerouting, the proposed solution significantly reduces\n   rerouting
    times to a few milliseconds, offering a substantial\n   improvement over existing
    practices and marking a pivotal advancement\n   in fault tolerance of datacenter
    networks.\n\n\t "

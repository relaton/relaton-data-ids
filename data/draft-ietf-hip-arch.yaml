  content: "This memo describes a snapshot of the reasoning behind a proposed new
    namespace, the Host Identity namespace, and a new protocol layer, the Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP), between the internetworking and transport layers.  Herein are
    presented the basics of the current namespaces, their strengths and weaknesses,
    and how a new namespace will add completeness to them.  The roles of this new
    namespace in the protocols are defined.  The memo describes the thinking of the
    authors as of Fall 2003.  The architecture may have evolved since.  This document
    represents one stable point in that evolution of understanding.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a\n
    \  device, its traffic, its location, and its user in Wi-Fi\n   [IEEE_802.11]
    network, client and client Operating System vendors\n   have started implementing
    MAC address randomization.  When such\n   randomization happens, some in-network
    states may break, which may\n   affect network connectivity and user experience.
    \ At the same time,\n   devices may continue using other stable identifiers, defeating
    the\n   MAC address randomization purposes.\n\n   This document lists various
    network environments and a range of\n   network services that may be affected
    by such randomization.  This\n   document then examines settings where the user
    experience may be\n   affected by in-network state disruption.  Last, this document\n
    \  examines two existing frameworks to maintain user privacy while\n   preserving
    user quality of experience and network operation\n   efficiency.\n\n\t "

  content: "The L2TP document [1] defines the base protocol which describes the\n
    \  method of tunneling PPP [2] data. The L2TP base protocol does not\n   address
    any Differential Services extensions.\n \n   Since the market is reluctant to
    outsource dial access without any\n   Quality of Service assurances, this draft
    addresses this problem by\n   allowing each L2TP Data Session to be assigned an
    appropriate\n   differential services indicator.\n\t "

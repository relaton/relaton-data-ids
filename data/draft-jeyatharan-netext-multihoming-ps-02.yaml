- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Proxy Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (PMIPv6) supports\nmultihoming
    whereby a mobile node (1) gets assigned prefixes by the\nlocal mobility anchor
    which are associated with an interface of a\nmobile node and are managed by the
    PMIPv6 elements as a single IP\nmobility session, and (2) can connect to a Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 domain\nthrough multiple interfaces for simultaneous access and get
    assigned\na different set of prefix(es) per interface, since being each\ninterface
    managed via an independent mobility session.  However,\nPMIPv6 needs multihoming
    enhancements such that it needs the ability\nto instantiate additional IP mobility
    sessions associated with an\nalready active interface or a secondary interface
    of the mobile node\nwhich has an established IP mobility session at a local mobility\nanchor
    (LMA), the ability to selectively share home network\nprefix(es) across access
    technology types, the ability to perform\nflow mobility tied to a subset of prefixes
    associated with an access\ntechnology to another access technology and extended
    support for\nmultiple IP mobility sessions in a scenario where multiple interfaces\nof
    the mobile node are connected to a single mobile access gateway\n(MAG).  This
    memo highlights such required enhancements to PMIPv6\nmultihoming with respect
    to improved operations and extended\napplicability to different deployment scenarios.\n\t "

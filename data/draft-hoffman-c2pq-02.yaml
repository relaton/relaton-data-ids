  content: "   Quantum computing is the study of computers that use quantum features\n
    \  in calculations.  For over 20 years, it has been known that if very\n   large,
    specialized quantum computers could be built, they could have\n   a devastating
    effect on asymmetric classical cryptographic algorithms\n   such as RSA and elliptic
    curve signatures and key exchange, as well\n   as (but in smaller scale) on symmetric
    cryptographic algorithms such\n   as block ciphers, MACs, and hash functions.
    \ There has already been a\n   great deal of study on how to create algorithms
    that will resist\n   large, specialized quantum computers, but so far, the properties
    of\n   those algorithms make them onerous to adopt before they are needed.\n\n
    \  Small quantum computers are being built today, but it is still far\n   from
    clear when large, specialized quantum computers will be built\n   that can recover
    private or secret keys in classical algorithms at\n   the key sizes commonly used
    today.  It is important to be able to\n   predict when large, specialized quantum
    computers usable for\n   cryptanalysis will be possible so that organization can
    change to\n   post-quantum cryptographic algorithms well before they are needed.\n\n
    \  This document describes quantum computing, how it might be used to\n   attack
    classical cryptographic algorithms, and possibly how to\n   predict when large,
    specialized quantum computers will become\n   feasible.\n\n\t "

  content: "The security enhancement is one of the most important enhancements\n      to
    IP multicast. IP multicast requires many security functions that\n      include
    user authentication of IP multicast, encryption of IP\n      multicast datagrams
    and key management protocols for IP multicast.\n      Among them, the user authentication
    function for IP multicast is\n      considered one of the most important security
    functions for IP\n      multicast. This document describes the extension to IGMP,
    version 2\n      (IGMPv2) [1] for the authentication of IP multicast senders and\n
    \     receivers, which prevents an unauthorized user from sending and\n      receiving
    IP multicast datagrams.\n\t "

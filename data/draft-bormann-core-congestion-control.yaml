  content: "   The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does\n
    \  not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses.  Congestion\n   control
    is a complex issue -- the proper rationale for the congestion\n   control mechanisms
    chosen in CoAP is probably more material than the\n   CoAP protocol specification
    itself.  This informational document\n   attempts to pull out the background material
    and more extensive\n   considerations behind the CoAP congestion control mechanisms,
    while\n   leaving the basic MUSTs and MUST NOTs in the main spec.\n\n\t "

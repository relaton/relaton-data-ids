  content: "This memo registers MIME [RFC-MIME] Content-Types for a number of file
    formats common to the Microsoft Windows environment.  The intention is to aid
    interoperability between mail systems, and to enumerate possible conversions at
    gateways.                                                   This document does
    not provide detailed descriptions of individual formats, since published descriptions
    are already available from other sources, notably [SDK4], and are, in some cases,
    quite complex.\n\t "

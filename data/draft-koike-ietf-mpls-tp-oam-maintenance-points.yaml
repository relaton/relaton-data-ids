  content: "MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is designed to enable carrier grade\n
    \  packet transport and complement converged packet network deployments.\n   Among
    the most important features of MPLS-TP are comprehensive OAM\n   functions which
    enable network operators or service providers to\n   provide various kinds of
    service characteristics such as prompt fault\n   location, substantial survivability,
    performance monitoring and\n   preliminary or in-service measurements.\n\n   For
    the realization of those features by the MPLS Transport Profile,\n   the definition
    of the maintenance points at which OAM messages are\n   initiated, terminated
    and processed is very important. Based on the\n   MPLS-TP OAM requirements this
    document elaborates on and gives\n   guidance about maintenance points in MPLS-TP
    networks.\n\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
    Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications\n
    \  Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile
    within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities and
    functionalities of a packet transport network.\n\t "

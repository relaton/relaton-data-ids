  content: "Out goal is describe a simple policy framework (or architecture) which
    is both\npractical to implement, and easy to extend. Our framework is driven by
    the in-\nformation which needs to be exchanged, and the communication system required
    to\nimplement it.\n \n \n \nWe view policies as a specification for network management
    systems, and have\n \nconstructed our framework based on that assumption. We forces
    us to consider a\nmore general architecture, than one based on QoS assumptions
    alone.\n\n\t "

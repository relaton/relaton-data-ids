abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The primary state variables used by all TCP congestion control\n   algorithms,
    cwnd and ssthresh are heavily overloaded, carrying\n   different semantics in
    different states.  This leads to excess\n   implementation complexity and poorly
    defined behaviors under some\n   combinations of events, such as loss recovery
    during cwnd validation.\n   We propose a new framework for TCP congestion control,
    and to recast\n   current standard algorithms to use new state variables.  This
    new\n   framework will not generally change the behavior of any of the\n   primary
    congestion control algorithms when invoked in isolation but\n   will to permit
    new algorithms with better behaviors in many corner\n   cases, such as when two
    distinct primary algorithms are invoked\n   concurrently.  It will also foster
    the creation of new algorithms to\n   address some events that are poorly treated
    by today's standards.\n   For the vast majority of traditional algorithms the
    transformation to\n   the new state variables is completely straightforward.  However,
    the\n   resulting implementation will technically be in violation of all\n   existing
    TCP standards, even if it is fully compliant with their\n   principles and intent.\n\n\t "

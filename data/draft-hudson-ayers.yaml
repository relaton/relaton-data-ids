  content: "   This document discusses guidelines for specifying low-power Internet\n
    \  protocols in order to improve implementation interoperability. These\n   guidelines
    are based around the importance of balancing memory usage\n   and energy efficiency,
    and the importance of not relying on Postel's\n   law when dealing with low resource
    devices. This document applies\n   these guidelines to the IPv6 over low-power
    wireless personal area\n   networks (6LoWPAN) Internet Standard, suggesting changes
    that would\n   make it more likely for implementations to interoperate.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document includes an analysis of multiple interfaces in a host\nand
    a description of scenarios of multiple interfaces with the\nrespect of the relationship
    between layer 2 connection and layer 3\nconnection.  The current TCP/IP mechanism
    and networking methods are\nsuitable for single network interface.  When a host
    has multiple\ninterfaces, the current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methods\ncannot
    directly be used for them.  A network interface establishes\nlayer 2 connection
    to layer 2 entity (e.g., WLAN Access Point) and it\ndoes not mean providing proper
    layer 3 connection.  So every active\nnetwork interfaces do not guarantee successful
    IP layer operations.\nIn this document, we describe some problems for a host which
    has\nmultiple interfaces as an aspect of host's operations and usage\nscenarios
    of multiple interfaces in a host.\n\t "

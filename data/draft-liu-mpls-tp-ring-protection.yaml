  content: "according to RFC 5654 MPLS-TP Requirement, there are two requirements\n:
    requirement 56.B Recovery techniques used for P2P and P2MP should\nbe identical
    to simplify implementation and operation.another\nrequirement as section 2.5.6.1
    describles: within the context of\nrecovery in MPLS-TP networks,the optimization
    criteria considered in\nring topologies are as follows: 1 minimize the number
    of OAM entities\nthat are needed to trigger the recovery operation; 2 Minimize
    the\nnumber of elements of recovery in the ring; 3 Minimize the number of\nlabels
    required for the protection paths across the ring; 4 minimize\nthe amount of control
    and management plane transactions during\nmaintenance operation. this decument
    will describle and provide two\ntypes of ring protection solutions. both solutions
    can satisfy these\nrequirements of recovery in mpls-tp ring network.\n\t "

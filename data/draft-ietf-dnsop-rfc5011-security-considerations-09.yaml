  content: "   This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing\n   advice
    that must be followed by the publisher in order to maintain\n   security.  Specifically,
    this document describes the math behind the\n   minimum time-length that a DNS
    zone publisher must wait before\n   signing exclusively with recently added DNSKEYs.
    \ This document also\n   describes the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher
    must wait\n   after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming that all active\n
    \  RFC5011 resolvers should have seen the revocation-marked key and\n   removed
    it from their list of trust anchors.\n\n   This document contains much math and
    complicated equations, but the\n   summary is that the key rollover / revocation
    time is much longer\n   than intuition would suggest.  If you are not both publishing
    a\n   DNSSEC DNSKEY, and using RFC5011 to advertise this DNSKEY as a new\n   Secure
    Entry Point key for use as a trust anchor, you probably don't\n   need to read
    this document.\n\n\t "

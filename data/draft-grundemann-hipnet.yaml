  content: "   Home networks are becoming more complex.  With the launch of new\n
    \  services such as home security, IP video, Smart Grid, etc., many\n   Service
    Providers are placing additional IPv4/IPv6 routers on the\n   subscriber network.
    \ This document describes a self-configuring home\n   router that is capable of
    operating in such an environment, and that\n   requires no user interaction to
    configure it.  Compliant with draft-\n   ietf-homenet-arch, it uses existing protocols
    in new ways without the\n   need for a routing protocol.\n\n\n\t "

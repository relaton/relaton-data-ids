abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a deadline based deterministic forwarding mechanism
    for IP/MPLS network with the corresponding resource reservation, admission control,
    scheduling and policing processes to provide guaranteed latency bound. It employs
    a latency compensation technique with a stateless core, to replace reshaping,
    making it suitable for the Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture [RFC2475].</p>"

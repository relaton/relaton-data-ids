- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a deadline based deterministic forwarding\n
    \  mechanism for IP/MPLS network with the corresponding resource\n   reservation,
    admission control, scheduling and policing processes to\n   provide guaranteed
    latency bound.  It employs a latency compensation\n   technique with a stateless
    core, to replace reshaping, making it\n   suitable for the Differentiated Services
    (Diffserv) architecture\n   [RFC2475].\n\n\t "

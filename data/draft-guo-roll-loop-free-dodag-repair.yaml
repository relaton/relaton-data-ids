  content: "   IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy\n
    \  Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications,\n   such
    as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing\n   Protocol for
    LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on\n   routing metrics and constraints
    [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed\n   Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional
    routes for\n   LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint,\n
    \  and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from\n   one
    or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is\n   partitioned into one
    or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one\n   DODAG per sink. RPL is widely
    considered as a feasible routing\n   protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops caused
    by local DODAG repair\n   mechanism is an issues to be addressed. This draft introduces
    a loop\n   free local DODAG repair mechanism. This draft also introduces a\n   piggybacked
    data option for transferring delay sensitive data during\n   route repair process.
    The piggybacked data can be included in DODAG\n   Repair Request (DRQ) message
    or DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS)\n   message.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes an approach to updating topologies in typical\n
    \  MANET-like environments, relying on what is termed 'sloppy updates'\n   in
    the remainder of this document.  Key to the approach is that\n   updates are only
    initiated if existing communication relations may be\n   effect by non-synchronized
    topology information, otherwise using the\n   topology information as it exists.
    \ This 'sloppy' nature of the\n   approach reduces the needed updates and the
    associated communication\n   for them, thus increases efficiency as well as performance
    from a\n   user perspective.\n\n\t "

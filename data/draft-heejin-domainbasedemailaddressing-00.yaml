  content: "   This document proposes a new email addressing specification that\n
    \  allows email messages to be sent to all email addresses associated\n   with
    a domain.  The new format can simplify the email addressing\n   process and reduce
    the risk of errors, while maintaining\n   compatibility with existing email protocols
    and standards.  This\n   specification includes requirements, design, and security\n
    \  considerations for the new email addressing format.\n\n\t "

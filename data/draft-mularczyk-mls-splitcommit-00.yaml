  content: "   This document describes an extension to the MLS protocol [RFC940]\n
    \  that improves its efficiency in terms of per-member download size.\n   This
    comes at essentially no cost.  In essence, this document defines\n   a new message
    type called split commit which replaces regular MLS\n   commits.  Unlike regular
    commits, a split commit can be \"split\" by\n   the Delivery Service (DS) into
    much smaller per-member commits, one\n   for each receiving member.  The size
    of a per-member commit is always\n   logarithmic in the group size, while the
    size of a regular MLS commit\n   can be linear.  This extension works in settings
    with a DS that can\n   do the splitting which can be demanding with encrypted
    MLS handshake\n   messages.  This is motivated by academic research [KKP22], [HKPPW22],\n
    \  [AHKM22].\n\n\t "

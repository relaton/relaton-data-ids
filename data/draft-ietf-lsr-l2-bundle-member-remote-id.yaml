  content: "   In networks where Layer 2 (L2) interface bundles (such as a Link\n
    \  Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE802.1AX]) are deployed, a controller\n   may need
    to collect the connectivity relationships between bundle\n   members for traffic
    engineering (TE) purposes. For example, when\n   performing topology management
    and bidirectional path computation\n   for TE, it is essential to know the connectivity
    relationships among\n   bundle members.\n\n   This document describes how OSPF
    and IS-IS would advertise the\n   remote interface identifiers for Layer 2 bundle
    members. The\n   corresponding extension of BGP-LS is also specified.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses a number of the administrative issues that\nmust
    be resolved before effective deployment of ENUM[2,3] services\nin complex environments
    with number portability and multiple\nproviders for using DNS for translation
    of E.164 (telephone)\nnumbers. North America is examined critically because its\nenvironment
    may be more complex than most and because current\nderegulation trends may drive
    other countries/regions in similar\ndirections. In particular the current mechanisms
    for number\nadministration and number portability in North America will require\nestablishment
    of a new administrative function for managing the\ndomain name entries for ported
    numbers.\n\t "

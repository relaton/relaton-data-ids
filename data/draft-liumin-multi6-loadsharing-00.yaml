  content: "   In order to reach the goal of load sharing and traffic engineering
    in\n   multihoming, there must be some mechanism for the local host to\n   make
    a selection of the \"best\" source locator to used. Obviously the\n   selection
    includes the objective to select a currently viable path.\n   What's more, it
    also includes the objective to select a path with\n   larger bandwidth, which
    is more difficult to judge than reachability.\n   In this memo, we propose a simple
    mechanism to determine the\n   availability and bandwidth condition between a
    multihomed host and\n   its ISP. It will help to share the load among multiple
    paths and\n   provide better performance for the host's traffic. This mechanism\n
    \  could be part of traffic engineering functions, which could be used\n   as
    the basis of locator selection before initial session\n   establishment and aslo
    could be used to trigger locator swithes to\n   avoid loss of connectivity, long
    delay or large loss rate.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes new challenges for IoT services issued by the\n
    \  changes of the IoT environment.  In order to address those new\n   challenges,
    the integration of Edge computing and IoT has been\n   emerged as a promising
    solution.  This document provides the concept\n   of IoT integrated with Edge
    computing as well as its use cases to\n   discuss the benefits and challenges
    of Edge computing mainly focused\n   on IoT data.  The direction of Edge computing
    for IoT should be\n   discussed in IETF/IRTF.\n\n\t "

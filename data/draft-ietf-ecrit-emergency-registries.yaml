  content: "   Multiple emergency services standards organizations are developing\n
    \  specifications based on IETF emergency calling and other IETF\n   protocols.
    \ There is a desire among these organizations to use common\n   registries, not
    tied to a particular country or national Standards\n   Development Organization
    (SDO), in the long term pursuit of a single\n   worldwide standard.  This document
    asks IANA to create a set of\n   registries and provides processes for expanding
    the set and\n   populating them.\n\n\t "

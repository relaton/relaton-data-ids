  content: "   OAuth 2.0 deployments currently rely on bearer tokens for securing\n
    \  access to protected resources.  Bearer tokens require Transport Layer\n   Security
    to be used between an OAuth client and the resource server\n   when presenting
    the access token in order to get access.  The\n   security model is based on proof-of-possession
    of the access token:\n   access token storage and transfer has to be done with
    care to prevent\n   leakage.\n\n   There are, however, use cases that require
    a more active involvement\n   of the OAuth client to offer increased security,
    particularly against\n   token leakage.  This document specifies an OAuth security
    framework\n   using ephemeral asymmetric credentials that are bound to the access\n
    \  token.  A client can create these key pairs dynamically and use them,\n   after
    they are bound to an access token by the authorization server,\n   in communication
    interactions with resource servers.\n\n   This document is discussed at\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/oauth.
    \ This initial version of\n   the specification shall serve as a discussion starter.\n\n\t "

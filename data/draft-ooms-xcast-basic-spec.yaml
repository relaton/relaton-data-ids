  content: "While traditional IP multicast schemes (RFC 1112) are scalable for very
    large multicast groups, they have scalability issues with a very large number
    of distinct multicast groups. This document describes Xcast (Explicit Multi-unicast),
    a new multicast scheme with complementary scaling properties: Xcast supports a
    very large number of small multicast sessions. Xcast achieves this by explicitly
    encoding the list of destinations in the data packets, instead of using a multicast
    group address.\n\n This document discusses Xcast concepts and options in several
    areas; it does not provide a complete technical specification. This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an optional extension to Neighbor Discovery \nRouter
    Advertisement messages for communicating default router \npreferences and more-specific
    routes from routers to hosts. This \nimproves the ability of hosts to pick an
    appropriate router, \nespecially when the host is multi-homed and the routers
    are on \ndifferent links. The preference values and specific routes \nadvertised
    to hosts require administrative configuration; they are \nnot automatically derived
    from routing tables.\n\t "

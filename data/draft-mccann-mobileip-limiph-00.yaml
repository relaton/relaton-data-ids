- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There are currently a number of proposals for different mechanisms\nintended
    to reduce the overhead of IP mobility management. Generally\nspeaking, the goal
    of these proposals is twofold: first, to reduce\nthe latency or interruption due
    to handoffs; and second, to reduce\nthe signaling load on the Mobile IP Home Agent
    (and Correspondent\nNodes, for the case of Mobile IPv6).  These techniques are
    meant to\nimprove the performance of real-time applications like voice or\nvideo
    over IP over wireless networks.  By minimizing the period of\ninterruption during
    a handoff from one point of attachment to\nanother, the proposals attempt to minimize
    packet loss when these\nevents occur.  This draft argues that the best solution
    to this\nproblem is a 'transparent' one that requires no changes to the\nMobile
    IP clients in mobile nodes and that gives control over\nrouting functionality
    to the operator of a wireless network.  We\nreview some of the existing proposals
    and describe in detail a new\nproposal that can provide for low interruption handoffs
    in a more\ntransparent manner.\n\n\t "

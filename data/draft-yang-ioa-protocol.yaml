- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft defines a new agent collaboration protocol, named the\n
    \  Internet of Agents Protocol (IoA Protocol), to support distributed,\n   heterogeneous
    agent collaboration in intelligent systems.  The IoA\n   Protocol enables dynamic
    team formation, adaptive task coordination,\n   and structured communication among
    agents with diverse architectures,\n   tools, and knowledge sources.  Through
    a layered architecture and\n   extensible message format, it supports decentralized
    deployment\n   across devices and can interoperate with existing frameworks.  The\n
    \  protocol is particularly suited to emerging 6G application scenarios\n   such
    as intelligent transportation, smart healthcare, and large-scale\n   human–AI
    teaming.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes experiences and lessons learnt organizing\n
    \  remote sessions for working group meetings in Latin America. The main\n   objective
    is to engage people in the IETF through small and informal\n   meetings with people
    that share common interests.\n\n   At the same time, remote participation for
    those already active in\n   the IETF is more attractive and they help with IETF
    outreach sharing\n   their experiences with newcomers.\n\n   The local meetings
    are called remote IETF Working Group Hubs.\n\n\t "

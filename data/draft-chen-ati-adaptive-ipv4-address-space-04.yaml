  content: "   This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion\n
    \  issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of\n   the
    original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy IPv4),
    outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system architecture
    enhancement considerations.\n\n   EzIP may expand an IPv4 address by a factor
    of 256M without affecting\n   the existing IPv4 based Internet, or the current
    private networks. It\n   is in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports
    not only\n   both direct and private network connectivity, but also their\n   interoperability.
    EzIP deployments may coexist with existing Internet\n   traffic and the IoT (Internet
    of Things) operations without\n   perturbing their setups, while offering end-users
    the freedom to\n   indepdently choose this system.\n\n   EzIP may be implemented
    as a software or firmware enhancement to\n   Internet edge routers or private
    network routing gateways, wherever\n   needed, or simply installed as an inline
    adjunct hardware module\n   between the two, enabling a seamless introduction.\n\n
    \  The 256M case detailed here establishes a complete spherical layer of\n   routers
    for interfacing between the Internet fabic (core plus edge\n   routers) and the
    end user premises. Incorporating caching proxy\n   technology in the gateway,
    a fairly large geographical region may\n   enjoy EzIP as address expansion using
    as little as one ordinary IPv4\n   public address utilizing IP packets with degenerated
    EzIP header.\n\n   If IPv4 public pool allocations were reorganized, the assignable
    pool\n   could be multiplied by 512M times or even more.\n\n   EzIP will immediately
    resolve local IPv4 address shortages, while\n   being transparent to the rest
    of the Internet. Under the Dual-Stack\n   environment, these proposed interim
    facilities will relieve the IPv4\n   address shortage issue, while affording IPv6
    more time to reach\n   maturity and to provide the availability levels required
    for\n   delivering a long-term general service.\n\n\t "

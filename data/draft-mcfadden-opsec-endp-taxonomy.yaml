  content: "   A separate document [I-D:draft-mcfadden-opsec-endp-evolve] attempts\n
    \  to establish the capabilities and limitations of endpoint-only\n   security
    solutions and explore potential alternative approaches.\n   That document discusses
    endpoints in general terms. It has been\n   suggested that there are classes of
    endpoints that have different\n   characteristics. Those classes may have completely
    different threat\n   landscapes and the endpoints may have completely different
    security\n   capabilities. As a companion to the endpoint evolution draft, this\n
    \  document provides a taxonomy of endpoints that is intended to\n   provide a
    foundation for further work on endpoint security evolution\n   and research on
    approaches to providing endpoint security\n   alternatives in a diverse group
    of settings.\n\n\t "

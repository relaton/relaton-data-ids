  content: "   This document describes an extension to the CONNECT-IP HTTP method.\n
    \  This extension defines a new Flow Forwarding Mode which supports\n   optimization
    for individual IP flows forwarded to the targeted peer.\n\n   *  IMPORTANT NOTE:
    This draft exists only to demonstrate the\n      feasibility of defining CONNECT-IP
    Flow Forwarding Mode as an\n      extension to CONNECT-IP.  The overwhelming majority
    of the content\n      in this draft was copied from draft-kuehlewind-masque-connect-ip-\n
    \     01.  A list of changes from that design is available in an\n      appendix
    to this document.  All credit for flow forwarding should\n      go to the authors
    of that document.  However, all blame for any\n      errors in this draft should
    be attributed to its editor.  The\n      editor's intent is to step down as editor
    of this draft and have\n      the authors of draft-kuehlewind-masque-connect-ip
    take on that\n      role.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed
    before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Discussion of this document takes place on
    the Multiplexed\n   Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption Working Group mailing
    list\n   (masque@ietf.org), which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/masque/.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides an analysis of certain inter-working problems \n
    \          between IPv6 nodes running Mobile IPv6, at least one of which is \n
    \          connected to a  Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)  \n           specified
    General Packet Radio Service/Universal Mobile Tele- \n           communications
    System (GPRS/UMTS) network. The inter-working problems            are caused by
    some specific packet filtering operations at the edge  \n           of the GPRS/UMTS
    network which are applied to control access to the \n           GPRS/UMTS services
    and network resources. However, we believe that \n           other scenarios may
    exist in which similar packet filtering  \n           operations may be applied
    and that similar problems would arise in \n           these more general scenarios.
    \n         \n           The GPRS Gateway Support Node (GGSN) checks the source
    \ address or  \n           the destination address in the basic IPv6 header of
    incoming or  \n           outgoing IP datagrams against a set of packet filtering
    information \n           established during the GPRS/UMTS session set-up. The
    packet filtering \n           information remains stable during the sessions and
    independent of \n           Mobile IP. When MIPv6 is activated by either end of
    the IPv6 mobile  \n           nodes, the packet filtering  will fail to perform
    properly and  \n           subsequently block the traffic due to the mismatch
    between the packet \n           filters and the current source address or destination
    address in the  \n           basic IPv6 header of the IP datagrams to and from
    the IPv6 mobile  \n           nodes.\n\t "

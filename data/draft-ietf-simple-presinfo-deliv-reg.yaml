  content: "A Presence service implemented using SIMPLE has some constraints for\ndelivering
    presence information to devices with low data processing\ncapabilities, small
    display, and limited battery power. Other\nlimitations can be caused by the interface
    between the terminal and\nthe network, i.e. if presence information is delivered
    over radio\nlinks with high latency and low bandwidth. This memo presents\nrequirements
    for a solution that can aid to reduce the impacts of\nthese constrains and helps
    to increase efficiency.\n\t "

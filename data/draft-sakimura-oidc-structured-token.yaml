  content: "   This specification defines a format of structured access tokens that\n
    \  are issued by the authorization server and received by the resource\n   server.
    By using this format, the authorization server and the\n   resource server can
    be easily separated and the validation of the\n   access token can be performed
    offline.\n\n\t "

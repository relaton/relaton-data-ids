  content: "   This memorandum describes a method whereby one can use GSS-API\n   [RFC2078]
    to supply a secure channel between a user on a client and a\n   server, authenticating
    both the user and server with public key\n   certificates [RFC3280], without the
    need for an external Public Key\n   Infrastructure for certificate verification.
    \ The method leverages\n   the existing Simple Public Key Mechanism Version 3
    (SPKM-3)\n   [RFC2847].  In addition to describing the use of SPKM-3 for mutual\n
    \  authentication, this memorandum updates RFC2847, reflecting\n   implementation
    experience.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes the use of OAuth to obtain and validate\n   ephemeral
    tokens that can be used for TURN authentication.  The usage\n   of ephemeral tokens
    ensure that access to a TURN server can be\n   controlled even if the tokens are
    compromised, as is the case in\n   WebRTC where TURN credentials must be specified
    in Javascript.\n\n\t "

  content: "   A separate document [I-D:draft-taddei-smart-cless-introduction]\n   (CLESS)
    attempts to establish the capabilities and limitations of\n   endpoint-only security
    solutions and explore potential alternative\n   approaches. That document discusses
    endpoints in general terms. It\n   has been suggested that there are classes of
    endpoints that have\n   different characteristics. Those classes may have completely\n
    \  different threat landscapes and the endpoints may have completely\n   different
    security capabilities. In support of the work on CLESS,\n   this document provides
    a taxonomy of endpoints that is intended to\n   provide a foundation for further
    work on CLESS and research on\n   approaches to providing endpoint security alternatives
    in a diverse\n   group of settings.\n\n\t "

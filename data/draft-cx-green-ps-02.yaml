  content: "   Reducing technology's carbon footprint is one of the big challenges\n
    \  of our age.  Networks are an enabler of applications that reduce this\n   footprint,
    but also contribute to this footprint substantially\n   themselves.  Many of the
    biggest opportunities to reduce this\n   footprint may not be management or even
    networking specific, for\n   instance general power efficiency gains in hardware
    or deployment of\n   equipment in more energy-efficient buildings.  However, methods
    to\n   make networking technology itself \"greener\" and in particular to\n   manage
    networks in ways that reduces their carbon footprint without\n   impacting their
    utility also need to be explored.  This document\n   outlines a corresponding
    set of opportunities, along with associated\n   research challenges, for networking
    technology in general and\n   management technology in particular to become \"greener\"
    and reduce\n   network carbon footprint.\n\n\t "

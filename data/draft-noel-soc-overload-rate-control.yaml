  content: "   The prevalent use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] in\n
    \  Next Generation Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide\n   adequate
    control mechanisms to maintain transaction throughput by\n   preventing congestion
    collapse during traffic overloads. Already\n   [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-05]
    proposes a loss-based solution\n   to remedy known vulnerabilities of the [RFC3261]
    SIP 503 (service\n   unavailable) overload control mechanism. This document proposes
    a\n   rate-based control solution to complement the loss-based control\n   defined
    in [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-05].\n\n\t "

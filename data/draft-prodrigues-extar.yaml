  content: "   The shift to multi-cloud environments brought data leakage prevention\n
    \  challenges for organisations.  The current Cross-Tenant Access\n   Restriction
    (XTAR) mechanisms do not cover critical scenarios where\n   users can connect
    to multiple tenants (organisational and personal),\n   facilitating data exfiltration.
    \ The goal, similar to previously\n   proposed, reviewed and accepted protocols
    that have been published as\n   RFC standards and are now widely adopted, is to
    help organisations\n   keep their data under control when using one or more Cloud
    Service\n   Providers (CSPs).  This can be done by incentivising CSPs to adopt\n
    \  the proposed protocol, Extended-Cross-Tenant Access Restriction\n   (E-XTAR),
    consisting of a globally readable header specifying the\n   allowed <CSP, tenantID>
    combinations allowed by the home\n   organisation.  The work gathers scenarios
    contributing to the\n   importance of a cloud-agnostic, universally embraced protocol.\n\n\t "

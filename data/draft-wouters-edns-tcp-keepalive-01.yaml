  script: Latn
  content: "   DNS messages between clients and servers may be received over either\n
    \  UDP or TCP.  UDP transport involves keeping less state on a busy\n   server,
    but can cause truncation and retries over TCP.  Additionally,\n   UDP can be exploited
    for reflection attacks.  Using TCP would reduce\n   retransmits and amplification.
    \ However, clients are currently\n   limited in their use of the TCP transport
    as RFC 5966 suggests\n   closing idle TCP sessions \"in the order of seconds\",
    making use of\n   TCP only suitable for individual queries generated as a fallback\n
    \  protocol for truncated UDP answers.\n\n   This document defines an EDNS0 option
    (\"edns-tcp-keepalive\") that\n   allows DNS clients and servers to signal their
    respective readiness\n   to conduct multiple DNS transactions over individual
    TCP sessions.\n   This signalling facilitates a better balance of UDP and TCP
    transport\n   between individual clients and servers, reducing the impact of\n
    \  problems associated with UDP transport and allowing the state\n   associated
    with TCP transport to be managed effectively with minimal\n   impact on the DNS
    transaction time.\n\n\t "

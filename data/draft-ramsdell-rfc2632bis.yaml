    key is valid. S/MIME agents\nMUST use PKIX certificates to validate public keys
    as described in the\nInternet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) Certificate
    and CRL\nProfile [KEYM]. S/MIME agents MUST meet the certificate processing\nrequirements
    documented in this document in addition to those stated\nin [KEYM].\n\t "

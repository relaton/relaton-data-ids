  content: "   FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides\n
    \  mobility, multihoming and multipath load balancing support by\n   introducing
    the concept of 'upper layer thread ID', which was firstly\n   suggested in [Gao2002].\n\n
    \  It provides additional transport layer features such as ubiquitous\n   message
    authentication with optional encryption, zero round-trip\n   connection cloning,
    transmit transaction and quad-party shared secret\n   installation facility.\n\n\t "

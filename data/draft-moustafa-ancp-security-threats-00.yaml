  content: "The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate QoS-,\n   service-
    and subscriber-related operations between a Network Access\n   Server (NAS) and
    an Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line\n   Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)).
    \ The main goal of this protocol is to\n   configure and manage access equipments
    and allow them to report\n   information to the NAS in order to enable and optimize
    configuration.\n\n   This document investigates security threats that all ANCP
    nodes could\n   encounter, developing a threat model for ANCP security aiming
    to\n   decide which security functions are required at the ANCP level.\n   Based
    on this, security requirements regarding the Access Node\n   Control Protocol
    are defined.\n\t "

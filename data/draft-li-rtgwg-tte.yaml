  content: "   Conventional traffic engineering approaches for resource management\n
    \  used by RSVP-TE and SR-TE often leverage estimates of the ingress\n   traffic
    demands, during path placement.  Unforeseen and/or dynamic\n   events, can skew
    these estimates by significant enough margins to\n   result in unexpected network
    congestion.  Recomputed paths that\n   address the new demands may take a considerable
    amount of time,\n   leaving the network in a sub-optimal state for far too long.\n\n
    \  This document proposes one mechanism that can avert congestion on a\n   real-time
    basis.\n\n\t "

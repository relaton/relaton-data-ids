  content: "   In workload-to-service communication, a common pattern is for a\n   workload
    to present a JSON Web Token (JWT) to a remote endpoint in\n   order to obtain
    a temporary credential for the service it ultimately\n   needs to access.  It
    is a partial adaptation for workloads of\n   existing flows designed for users.
    \ Implementing this pattern\n   combines multiple existing standards from different
    working groups\n   and standards bodies.  Since this pattern is not described
    in a\n   specification, it leads to variability in interoperability.  The\n   purpose
    of this document is to capture this common workload identity\n   practice as an
    RFC in order to obtain consistency and promote\n   interoperability in industry.\n\n\t "

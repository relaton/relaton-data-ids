  content: "The IETF is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based localized\nmobility
    management, which takes basic operation for registration,\ntunnel management and
    de-registration into account in a first\nprotocol release.  This document proposes
    an extension to Proxy\nMobile IPv6 to suit MNs, which have multiple network interfaces\nimplemented
    and hand over from one network interface to another\nnetwork interface while remaining
    anchored at the same Local Mobility\nAnchor.  This extension avoids that the LMA
    will prematurely forward\ndata packets for the mobile node to the mobile node's
    new interface\nbefore the address configuration of this interface has completed.\nWith
    the proposed extension, packet buffering at the new MAG is not\nnecessary and
    packet losses during an inter-technology handover can\nbe avoided.\n\t "

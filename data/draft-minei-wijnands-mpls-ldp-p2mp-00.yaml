  content: "This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol\n
    \  (LDP) for the setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) and multipoint-to-\n   multipoint
    (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multi-Protocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS)
    networks.  The solution relies on LDP without\n   requiring a multicast routing
    protocol in the network.  Protocol\n   elements and procedures for this solution
    are described for building\n   such LSPs in a receiver-initiated manner.  There
    can be various\n   applications for P2MP/MP2MP LSPs, for example IP multicast
    or support\n   for multicast in BGP/MPLS L3VPNs.  Specification of how such\n
    \  applications can use a LDP signaled P2MP/MP2MP LSP is outside the\n   scope
    of this document.\n\t "

  content: "   Traditional Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) typically\n
    \  involves producing a Modified-EU64 format identifier to be employed\n   as
    the Interface-ID of the resulting address.  In the case of\n   Ethernet network
    interface cards, such identifier derived from the\n   corresponding IEEE 802 address.
    \ IEEE 802 addresses are generally\n   expected to be globally unique, thus resulting
    in non-duplicate\n   addresses.  However, in many real-world scenarios, these
    identifiers\n   fail to be unique, thus resulting in duplicate IPv6 addresses.
    \ This\n   document discusses the interoperability problems arising from\n   duplicate
    IEEE 802 addresses with IPv6 Stateless Address Auto-\n   Configuration (SLAAC),
    and how some popular implementations react\n   when the such problems arise.  Finally,
    it discusses possible\n   mitigations for the aforementioned issue.\n\n\t "

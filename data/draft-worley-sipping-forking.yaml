abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "The rules for SIP proxies are organized so that when a UAC sends an\nout-of-dialog
    request, even if the request is forked to a number of\nUASs, (usually) only one
    UAS will accept the request, and only the\nfinal response from that UAS will be
    returned to the UAC.  This\nforking mechanism is optimal for an INVITE intended
    to connect one\nhuman user with another human uses, but is poor for requests that\nhave
    a \"one to many\" nature, especially PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE\nrequests, but also
    including some INVITEs.  This document proposes an\nalternative forking mechanism
    that better supports \"one to many\"\nrequests, and that mechanism be the standardized
    meaning of the\n(existing but weakly specified) \"Request-Disposition: no-cancel,\nparallel\"
    header.\n\t "

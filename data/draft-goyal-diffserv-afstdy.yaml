  content: "One desirable characteristics of any resource allocation (or\ndifferentiation)
    mechanism is that if many aggregates, each with its\nown reservation, are merged
    with other aggregates of the same class,\neach aggregate should get its reserved
    bandwidth and a fair share of\nthe excess bandwidth. In particular, the performance
    of an aggregate\nshould not be adversely affected by other aggregates and their\ncongestion
    sensitivity. TCP flows are congestion sensitive while UDP\nflows are congestion
    insensitive in the sense that TCP flows reduce\ntheir traffic if any packets are
    lost. The goal of this study is to\nsee if TCP flow aggregates will be punished
    for their good behavior\nin the presence of competing UDP flow aggregates in the
    same assured\nforwarding class. We identify several factors that affect the\nperformance
    in the mixed environments and quantify their effects\nusing a full factorial design
    of experiment methodology.\n\t "

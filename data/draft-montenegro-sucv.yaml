  content: "This document addresses the identifier ownership problem.  It\ndoes so
    by using characteristics of Statistic Uniqueness and\nCryptographic Verifiability
    (SUCV) of certain entities which\nthis document calls SUCV Identifiers (SUCV ID's).
    \ This note\nalso proposes using these SUCV characteristics in related\nentities
    called SUCV Addresses in order to severely limit\ncertain classes of denial of
    service attacks and hijacking\nattacks. SUCV addresses are particularly applicable
    to solve the\n'address ownership' problem that severely undermines confidence\nin
    mechanisms like Binding Updates in Mobile IP for IPv6.\n\t "

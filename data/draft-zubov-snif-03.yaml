  content: "   This document proposes a solution, referred as SNIF, that provides\n
    \  the means for any Internet connected device to:\n\n   *  allocate a globally
    unique anonymous hostname;\n\n   *  obtain and maintain a publicly trusted X.509
    certificate issued\n      for the allocated hostname;\n\n   *  accept incoming
    TLS connections on specific TCP ports of the\n      allocated hostname from any
    TLS clients that are capable of\n      sending Server Name Indication.\n\n   The
    private key associated with the X.509 certificate is securely\n   stored on the
    TLS terminating device, and is never exposed to any\n   other party at any step
    of the process.\n\nAbout This Document\n\n   This note is to be removed before
    publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Status information for this document may be found
    at\n   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zubov-snif.\n\n   Information can
    be found at https://snif.host.\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker
    can be found at\n   https://github.com/vesvault/snif-i-d.\n\n\t "

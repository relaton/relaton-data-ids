  content: "   If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations it can\n
    \  be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts\n   (peers).
    \ In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use\n   the services of
    an intermediate node that acts as a communication\n   relay.  This specification
    defines a protocol, called TURN (Traversal\n   Using Relays around NAT), that
    allows the host to control the\n   operation of the relay and to exchange packets
    with its peers using\n   the relay.  TURN differs from some other relay control
    protocols in\n   that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using
    a\n   single relay address.\n\n   The TURN protocol was designed to be used as
    part of the ICE\n   (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) approach to NAT traversal,\n
    \  though it also can be used without ICE.\n\n\t "

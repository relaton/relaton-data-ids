  content: "   There are challenges to request quality of service for an application\n
    \  or network flow that is not part of a mobile network's Evolved Packet\n   Core
    (EPC).  This document addresses this issue by defining a\n   mechanism to signal
    the desired characteristics of a flow to the\n   Mobile Network from a User Equipment
    (UE) using Port Control Protocol\n   (PCP).  The signaled characteristics allow
    the Mobile Network to\n   enforce appropriate policies such as prioritize that
    flow accordingly\n   and trigger dedicated bearer activation or bearer modification\n
    \  procedure.\n\n\t "

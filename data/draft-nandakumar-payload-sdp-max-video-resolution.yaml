  script: Latn
  content: "   With the rise in realtime communication applications supporting\n   video,
    there is a need for receivers of the video to setup\n   appropriate expectations
    on their receive capacity for handling\n   various video image resolutions.  Setting
    up the maximum supported\n   image resolution that could be handled by an Endpoint
    is important to\n   successfully decode and render the received video streams.
    \ This\n   document proposes SDP format specific parameters for specifying the\n
    \  maximum image width and height resolutions along with their behavior\n   under
    the [RFC3264] Offer/Answer SDP usage.\n\n\t "

  content: "     This document describes novel protocols to bind IPv4/IPv6\n     addresses
    and flows to MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). For MPEG-2\n     systems to become
    true subnetworks of the general Internet,\n     methods are required to signal
    IPv4/v6 addresses to the link \n     receivers and transmitters; this is known
    as Address Resolution \n     (AR), or Neighbour Discovery (ND). In MPEG-2 networks,
    an IP\n     address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) and specific\n     transmission
    multiplex. In this documents 2 mechanisms based on \n     standard XML semantics
    and multimedia signalling are introduced\n     to comply to established IP over
    DVB AR established. These \n     protocols are seen to complement the current
    approaches based on\n     SI table with a more IP centric approach.\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes a mechanism to establish end-to-end diverse or \n
    \  disjoint label switched paths (LSPs) across multiple regions, as \n   required
    for inter-area and inter-AS traffic engineering. \n    \n   The mechanism relies
    on the joint computation, in each region, of \n   the LSP segments of the diversely
    routed LSPs, thereby achieving the \n   simplicity of the per-domain approach
    with effectively no changes to \n   the signaling protocols. This is achieved
    by the use of a new RSVP-\n   TE object, called the Associated Route Object or
    ARO, which is \n   defined in this document and used in the signaling messages
    in \n   support of the scheme.\n\t "

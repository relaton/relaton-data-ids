  content: "The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion from
    modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan.  While this process of evolution
    is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems
    useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture.
    \ This is intended for general guidance and general interest, and is in no way
    intended to be a formal or invariant reference model.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.\n\t "

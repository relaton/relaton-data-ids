  content: "This document describes a Directory Server based VPN membership \ninformation
    distribution mechanism for layer-1 VPNs. The mechanism \nenables PEs to discover
    which other PEs have ports attached to CEs \nthat are members of the same VPN,
    and allows PEs to discover \nattributes of currently configured CE-PE links and
    their associations \nwith layer-1 VPNs. This document builds on the Layer One
    VPN \nFramework and provides an auto-discovery mechanism as discussed in \nthe
    Layer One VPN Basic Mode document. This mechanism may be applied \nto the layer-1
    VPN basic mode.\n\t "

  content: "    The establishment of Human Rights as a Service (HRaaS) has\n    significant
    potential benefits. Although the generic expressions of\n    human rights in legal
    instruments largely precludes definitive HRaaS\n    specification, the establishment
    of a measurable objective is\n    compelling in the global marketplace for internet
    capabilities made\n    available to the public, including new virtualised NFV-SDN
    based\n    implementations and protocols. This HRaaS draft provides a\n    structured
    enumeration of human rights found in the principal global\n    legal instruments
    against which standards bodies can evaluate their\n    specifications, vendors
    can differentiate their offerings, and users\n    can compare those offerings
    and make informed decisions.\n\n\n\t "

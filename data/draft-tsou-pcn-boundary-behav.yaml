  content: "   The Pre-Congestion Notification Architecture document defines a PCN\n
    \  domain and the PCN-ingress and PCN-egress nodes that form its\n   boundary.
    \ The present document is an attempt to describe the\n   detailed behaviour of
    the PCN boundary nodes.  It is a contribution\n   toward the PCN WG milestone:
    \"Suggested Flow Admission and\n   Termination Boundary Mechanisms\".  This first
    version is expected to\n   evolve with discussion and further thought toward a
    more precise and\n   prescriptive view of boundary node behaviour.\n\n\t "

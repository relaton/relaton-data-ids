  content: "   The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol provides a\n
    \  uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs\n   [ACDC-ID]
    in a securely attributable manner.  A single protocol is\n   able to work for
    both types of exchanges by recognizing that all\n   exchanges (both issuance and
    presentation) may be modeled as the\n   disclosure of information by a Discloser
    to a Disclosee.  The\n   difference between exchange types is the information
    disclosed not\n   the mechanism for disclosure.  Furthermore, the chaining mechanism
    of\n   ACDCs and support for both targeted and untargeted ACDCs provide\n   sufficient
    variability to accommodate the differences in applications\n   or use cases without
    requiring a difference in the exchange protocol\n   itself.  This greatly simplifies
    the exchange protocol.  This\n   simplification has two primary advantages.  The
    first is enhanced\n   security.  A well-delimited protocol can be designed and
    analyzed to\n   minimize and mitigate attack mechanisms.  The second is convenience.\n
    \  A standard simple protocol is easier to implement, support, update,\n   understand,
    and adopt.  The tooling is more consistent.\n\n   This IPEX [IPEX-ID] protocol
    leverages important features of ACDCs\n   and ancillary protocols such as CESR
    [CESR-ID], SAIDs [SAID-ID], and\n   CESR-Proofs [Proof-ID] as well as Ricardian
    contracts [RC] and\n   graduated disclosure (partial, selective, full) to enable\n
    \  contractually protected disclosure.  Contractually protected\n   disclosure
    includes both chain-link confidential [CLC] and contingent\n   disclosure [ACDC-ID].\n\n\t "

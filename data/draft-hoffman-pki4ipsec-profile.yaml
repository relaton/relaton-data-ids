  content: "The use of certificates for authenticating the creation of IPsec\nsecurity
    associations has long been fraught with difficulty. The\nspecifications in IKE
    version 1 are sometimes ambiguous about important\nissues, and developers of IPsec
    systems are often unprepared to deal\nwith the complexities of PKIX certificates
    and certificate handling.\nThis document is a profile of certificate use in IPsec
    whose primary\ngoal is to greatly increase interoperability while maintaining
    high\nsecurity.\n\n\t "

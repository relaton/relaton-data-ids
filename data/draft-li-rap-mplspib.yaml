  content: "This document specifies a set of policy rule classes (PRC) for \nconfiguring
    MPLS traffic engineering policy at network elements. \nInstances of these classes
    reside in a virtual information store \ncalled the MPLS-TE Policy Information
    Base (PIB). The COPS \nprotocol [3] with extensions for provisioning [4] is used
    to \ntransmit this policy information to network elements. The PRCs \ndefined
    in this document are intended for use by the COPS-PR MPLS \nclient type. These
    PRCs are in addition to any other PIBs that may \nbe defined for the MPLS client
    type, as well as the PRCs defined \nin the Framework PIB [5]. \n\t "

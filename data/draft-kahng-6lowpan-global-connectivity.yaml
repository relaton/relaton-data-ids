  content: "   This document specifies the translation mechanism mapping IPv6\n   address
    with 128 bits to the Adaptation Identifier (AID) with 16 bits.\n   When a device
    in IEEE 802.15.4 domain needs to communicate with other\n   nodes in IPv6 domain,
    it should acquire source AID and destination\n   AID corresponding to source IPv6
    address and destination IPv6 address,\n   respectively from an IPv6 translation-capable
    gateway. The node will\n   send packets using these AIDs to the gateway, and then
    the gateway\n   will translate them to normal IPv6 addresses using the mapping
    table\n   already associated.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Since the Edward Snowden's release of secret information, some in the\n
    \  IETF have taken an approach that the network is such a useful tool\n   that
    it is also an enemy.  With several high visibility attacks that\n   have been
    based on low end systems (Things), it is now clear that not\n   only is the network
    not the enemy, but that it is required to protect\n   the system as a whole.  When
    the network has at least some\n   information about a device, we get a second
    chance to limit attacks\n   against the device and, in some cases, a third chance
    to limit\n   attacks from the device.  This memo discusses ways in which network\n
    \  protection assists in protection of devices, and some caveats around\n   that
    protection, and suggests considerations implementers and\n   protocol developers
    should consider as connectivity continues to\n   expand to new applications.\n\n\t "

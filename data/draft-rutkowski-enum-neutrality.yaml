  content: "The pursuit by major national Administrations of declared\npolicies of
    ENUM technical and administrative neutrality among\nimplementations in the marketplace
    suggest the need for a\nframework for such neutrality and a focus on interworking\namong
    them. [1] [2]  This document draws upon the ENUM Working\nGroup archive of discussions
    as well as public activities in other\nstandards forums and the marketplace to
    construct an ENUM options\nframework for facilitating neutrality.  This framework
    includes not\nonly protocol considerations, but also various critical technical\nand
    administrative support functions such as authentication and\nancillary directory
    services.\n\t "

  content: "Traffic recovery time when a link (or node) fails is typically in the\norder
    of tens of seconds for a link state IGP. The recovery time is\ngoverned by factors
    like the time it takes to detect an adjacency\ndown, the time taken to propagate
    link state database changes\nthroughout the network and the time it takes to run
    the SPF algorithm\nand install the new routes in the FIB. Till this entire process
    is\ncomplete, traffic in the network can be blackholed. This draft\ndescribes
    a technique to reduce the time for which traffic is\nblackholed by routing the
    traffic through a neighbor's shortest path.\n\t "

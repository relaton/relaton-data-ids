  content: "  Since IDN Standards [RFC3490-3492] were published, some of gTLDs and\n
    \ ccTLDs began IDN registration and resolution service.  Furthermore,\n  many
    major Web browsers became IDN aware.  IDNs seem to be popularized\n  soon.\n\n
    \ Meanwhile, IDN introduces huge number of characters which can\n  represent domain
    name, so it increases human misreading of domain name\n  with similar looking
    characters.  This issue was discussed deeply\n  during IDN standardization and
    service development, and as a result,\n  JET Guideline [RFC3743] and ICANN IDN
    Guideline [ICANN-IDN] was\n  published.  Even if TLD registries comply such guidelines,
    bad-faith\n  guys may use IDNs to deceive human eyes with similar looking\n  characters.\n\n
    \ To protect users from such deceiver, implementation guideline for how\n  to
    handle IDNs at the User Interface level is important.  This\n  document is intended
    to be such guideline for application\n  implementers.\n\t "

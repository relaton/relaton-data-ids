  content: "RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols \nas a
    control plane. They combine the link layer ability to allow \nhosts to reattach
    without renumbering with network layer routing \nbenefits. RBridges use existing
    link state routing to provide \nhigher RBridge to RBridge cross-section bandwidth,
    fast \nconvergence on reconfiguration, and more robust under link \ninterruption
    than an equivalent set of conventional bridges \nusing existing spanning tree
    forwarding. They are intended to \napply to similar L2 network sizes as conventional
    bridges and \nare intended to be backward compatible with those bridges as \nboth
    ingress/egress and transit. They also attempt to retain as \nmuch 'plug and play'
    as is already available in existing \nbridges. This document proposes an RBridge
    system as a solution \nto the TRILL problem. It also defines the RBridge architecture,
    \ndefines its terminology, and describes basic components and \ndesired behavior.
    One or more separate documents specify the \nprotocols and mechanisms that satisfy
    the architecture presented \nherein.\n\t "

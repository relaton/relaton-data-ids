  script: Latn
  content: "   More and more real time applications, such as VR gaming, high\n   frequency
    trading, Internet of vehicle, require accurate latency\n   guarantee or bound,
    during service provisioning. Providing End-to-\n   End latency guarantee across
    Internet is increasingly attractive\n   while challenging. The main problem with
    latency guarantee on\n   Internet is that packet scheduling is still best-effort,
    and\n   congestion that further introduces latency uncertainty cannot be\n   avoided.
    This document presents a way of describing latency\n   information that mostly
    rely on the congestion management such as\n   queue scheduling, and a framework
    to use such information to\n   guarantee End-to-End latency.\n\n\t "

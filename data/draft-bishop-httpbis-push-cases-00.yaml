  content: "   HTTP/2 defines the wire mechanics of Server Push.  Though the\n   mechanics
    of how a pushed resource is delivered are well-specified,\n   the use cases that
    describe which resources can be pushed, in what\n   states, and for what purpose
    are not described in HTTP/2.  As a\n   result, support between implementations
    varies widely.\n\n   This document attempts to enumerate interesting scenarios,
    in hopes\n   that a more concrete taxonomy can assist the community in arriving
    at\n   a standard set of supported scenarios.\n\n\t "

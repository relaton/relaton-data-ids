  content: "   The IETF cannot ordain which standards or protocols are to be used
    on\n   network, but the standards developing process in the IETF has a\n   normative
    effect.  Among other things the standardisation work at the\n   IETF has implications
    on what is perceived as technologically\n   possible and useful where networking
    technologies are being deployed,\n   and its standards output reflect was is considered
    by the technical\n   community as feasible and good practice.  Because it mediates
    many\n   aspects of modern life, and therefore contributes to the ordering of\n
    \  societies and communities, the consideration of the politics and\n   (potential)
    impact of protocols should be part of the standardization\n   and development
    process.\n\n\t "

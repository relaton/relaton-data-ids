  content: "Mobile IP[1] has emerged as a preferred solution for the macro mobility\nproblem.
    In this draft, we discuss a possible extension to the existing\nMobile IPv4 for
    multi-mode wireless terminals.  This extension is based\non [2] and has several
    advantages, including lesser packet delay,\nreduced traffic load on the home agent
    and lesser packet loss during\nhandoff. In addition. This also allows the mobile
    node to take full\nadvantage of Layer-2 specific features provided by the network.
    The\nproposal in this draft is in its initial stage and needs to be further\nstudied.\n\n\t "

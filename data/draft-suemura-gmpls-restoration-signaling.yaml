  content: "This document proposes extensions to RSVP-TE for supporting multiple \nprotection/restoration
    types (LSP Protection Types) in end-to-end \nprotection/restoration.  We propose
    the LSP Protection Type field to \nbe defined in the Protection Object.  Another
    aim of this document is \nprevention of an unintended connection for extra traffic
    when traffic \nfrom a failed working LSP is switched over to a backup LSP.  We
    \naddress this issue and propose a 3-way switchover signaling procedure. \n\n\t "

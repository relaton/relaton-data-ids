  content: "Session recording is a critical requirement in many business communications
    environments, such as call centers and financial trading floors. In some of these
    environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.
    In others, calls may be recorded for quality control or business analytics.\n\n
    Recording is typically performed by sending a copy of the session media to the
    recording devices. This document specifies requirements for extensions to SIP
    that will manage delivery of RTP media to a recording device. This is being referred
    to as SIP-based Media Recording. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

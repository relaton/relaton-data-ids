  content: "   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery relies on periodic multicast Router\n   Advertisement
    messages to update timer values and to distribute new\n   information (such as
    new prefixes) to hosts.  On some links the use\n   of periodic multicast messages
    to all host becomes expensive, and in\n   some cases it results in hosts waking
    up frequently.  Many\n   implementations of RFC 4861 also use multicast for solicited
    Router\n   Advertisement messages, even though that behavior is optional.\n\n
    \  This specification provides an optional mechanism for hosts and\n   routers
    where instead of periodic multicast Router Advertisements the\n   hosts are instructed
    (by the routers) to use unicast Router\n   Solicitations to request refreshed
    Router Advertisements.  This\n   mechanism is enabled by configuring the router
    to include a new\n   option in the Router Advertisement in order to allow the
    network\n   administrator to choose host behavior based on whether periodic\n
    \  multicast are more efficient on their link or not.  The routers can\n   also
    tell whether the hosts are capable of the new behavior through a\n   new flag
    in the Router Solicitations.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft proposes a general inter-domain multicast forwarding\n(IDMF)
    mechanism for the PIM-SM multicast routing protocol and its\napplication to the
    MSDP specific forwarding extension (MSDP-FE).\nAlthough there have been various
    inter-domain multicast routing and\nforwarding protocols, they are still limited
    in their capacity to\nhandle policy routing, QoS routing, accounting and security,
    which\nnetwork administrators are willing to use in their network. In order\nto
    overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach to create an\ninter-domain
    multicast forwarding tree (or routing table) among\nmultiple PIM-SM domains with
    logical multicast paths over which\nmulticast packets are forwarded or flooded.
    The logical multicast\npaths are created by either the IP-in-IP tunneling method,
    the IP\nmasquerade-like method, or the MPLS label switched path (LSP) method,\nwhich
    can easily reuse policy routing and QoS routing for unicast\nrouting. These logical
    multicast paths are established among IDMF-\ncapable nodes, which are located
    within each PIM-SM domain, either\nmanually or by a dynamic IDMF tree construction
    protocol. This\ngeneral framework for IDMF can be used as an MSDP based forwarding\nmechanism.
    Furthermore, the IDMF-capable nodes (i.e., MSDP-FE-capable\nnodes) can also function
    as a proxy sender of multicast packets. This\ncan prevent a multicast receiver
    from changing an RP-tree into a\nglobal SP-tree, and also can help to reduce,
    on the surface, the\nnumber of multicast sources for a particular multicast group.
    This\nproperty can be effectively used for accounting, security, and\nscalability
    enhancement required for inter-domain communication.\n\t "

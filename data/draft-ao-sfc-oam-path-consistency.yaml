  content: "   Service Function Chain (SFC) defines an ordered set of service\n   functions
    (SFs) to be applied to packets and/or frames and/or flows\n   selected due to
    classification.  SFC Operation, Administration and\n   Maintenance can monitor
    the continuity of the SFC, i.e., that all SFC\n   elements are reachable to each
    other in the downstream direction.\n   But SFC OAM must support verification that
    the order of traversing\n   these SFs corresponds to the state defined by the
    SFC control plane\n   or orchestrator, the metric referred to in this document
    as the path\n   consistency of the SFC.  This document defines a new SFC active
    OAM\n   method to support SFC consistency check, i.e., verification that all\n
    \  elements of the given SFC are being traversed in the expected order.\n\n\t "

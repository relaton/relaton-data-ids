  content: "The Microsoft Windows 2000 implementation of Kerberos introduces a \nnew
    encryption type based on the RC4 encryption algorithm and using \nan MD5 HMAC
    for checksum. This is offered as an alternative to using \nthe existing DES based
    encryption types. \nThe RC4-HMAC encryption types are used to ease upgrade of
    existing \nWindows NT environments, provide strong crypto (128-bit key \nlengths),
    and provide exportable (meet United States government \nexport restriction requirements)
    encryption. \nThe Microsoft Windows 2000 implementation of Kerberos contains new
    \nencryption and checksum types for two reasons: for export reasons \nearly in
    the development process, 56 bit DES encryption could not be \nexported, and because
    upon upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows \n2000, accounts will not have the
    appropriate DES keying material to \ndo the standard DES encryption. Furthermore,
    3DES is not available \nfor export, and there was a desire to use a single flavor
    of \nencryption in the product for both US and international products. \nAs a
    result, there are two new encryption types and one new checksum \ntype introduced
    in Microsoft Windows 2000. \n\n\t "

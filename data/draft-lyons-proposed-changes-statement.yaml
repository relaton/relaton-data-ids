  content: "This memo outlines the nature of the Internet Engineering Task Force \n(IETF)
    as an unincorporated association, reviews some history of the \nIETF Secretariat
    relevant to the current structure of the organization, \nand proposes steps that
    might be taken to move forward in the interest \nof the Internet community more
    generally. Since the IETF serves as a \nfocal point in the technical evolution
    of the Internet infrastructure, \nit is important that any organizational changes
    take into account the \nwider public interest. Considerations of who provides
    support to the \nIETF hinge on the legal status of the IETF itself. Steps should
    be \ntaken to clarify this matter as a first priority.\n\t "

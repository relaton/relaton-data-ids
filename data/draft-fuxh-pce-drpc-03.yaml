  script: Latn
  content: "   A dual-end recursive PCE-based computation procedure (DRPC) is\n   proposed
    to compute shortest constrained inter-domain traffic\n   engineering label switched
    paths based on BRPC in Multi-protocol\n   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  By\n   recursively performing shortest path algorithm
    and transferring the\n   segmental path computation result from both ends bi-directionally,\n
    \  they meet at one of the Middle PCEs, generating a directional\n   shortest
    path graph into which the two shortest path trees are\n   stitched together.  Therefore,
    the end-to-end constrained inter-\n   domain traffic engineering label switched
    path, even k shortest paths\n   can be gained from the directional shortest path
    graph directly.\n\n\t "

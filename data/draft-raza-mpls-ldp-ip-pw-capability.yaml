  content: "Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like \nIP
    label switching and L2VPN/PW signaling. When an LDP session comes \nup, an LDP
    speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for \nsuch LDP applications
    even when the peer session may be established \nfor some other applications like
    ICCP. This document proposes a \nsolution by which an LDP speaker announces its
    \"incapability\" or \ndisability or non-support for IP label switching or L2VPN/PW
    \napplication, hence disabling corresponding application state exchange \nover
    the established LDP session.\n\t "

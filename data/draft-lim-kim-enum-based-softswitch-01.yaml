  content: "This document describes operational requirement and several \n   considerations
    for ENUM-based softswitch, which can route a call \n   between 2 Korean VoIP carriers
    during the ENUM pre-commercial trial \n   hosted by National Internet Development
    Agency of Korea(NIDA) in 2006. \n   This experience can be one of interim solution
    to maintain stability \n   of on-going commercial softswitch system while initial
    stage of ENUM \n   service that does not have sufficient data.\n\t "

- content: "<p>This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export Information
    Elements to export the context and outcome of Source Address Validation enforcement
    data. These SAV-specific Information Elements provide detailed insight into why
    packets are identified as spoofed by capturing the specific SAV rules that triggered
    validation decisions. This operational visibility is essential for network operators
    to verify SAV effectiveness, audit rule correctness, and analyze source address
    spoofing events.</p>"

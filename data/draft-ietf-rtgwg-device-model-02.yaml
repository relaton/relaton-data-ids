abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models in a
    comprehensive logical structure that may be used to configure and operate network
    devices. The structure is itself represented as an example YANG model, with all
    of the related component models logically organized in a way that is operationally
    intuitive, but this model is not expected to be implemented. The identified component
    modules are expected to be defined and implemented on common network devices.
    This document is derived from work submitted to the IETF by members of the informal
    OpenConfig working group of network operators and is a product of the Routing
    Area YANG Architecture design team.</p>"

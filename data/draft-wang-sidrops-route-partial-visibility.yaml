  script: Latn
  content: "   In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), validating prefix-\n
    \  origin pairs using Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) globally and\n   performing
    Route Origin Validation (ROV) locally at each Autonomous\n   System (AS) with
    validated ROA payloads (VRPs) can lead to\n   inconsistent results due to partial
    route visibility.  This document\n   highlights how partial route visibility can
    turn originally non-loose\n   ROAs into loose VRPs, outlines the causes of partial
    route\n   visibility, and discusses potential solutions to mitigate the issue.\n\n\t "

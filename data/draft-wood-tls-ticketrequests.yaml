  content: "   TLS session tickets enable stateless connection resumption for\n   clients
    without server-side per-client state.  Servers vend session\n   tickets to clients,
    at their discretion, upon connection\n   establishment.  Clients store and use
    tickets when resuming future\n   connections.  Moreover, clients should use tickets
    at most once for\n   session resumption, especially if such keying material protects
    early\n   application data.  Single-use tickets bound the number of parallel\n
    \  connections a client may initiate by the number of tickets received\n   from
    a given server.  To address this limitation, this document\n   describes a mechanism
    by which clients may specify the desired number\n   of tickets needed for future
    connections.\n\n\t "

  content: "IETF-standardized unicast transport protocols have been \ndesigned to
    allow two end points to maintain communications by \nindividually reacting to
    loss or degraded packet arrival times. \nHistorically, those protocols have assumed
    loss is congestive \nand have reacted by decreasing the packet transmission rate
    to \nease congestion. There are a number of cases, however, where \nthese assumptions
    are incorrect, and one or more path segments \npresent losses due to intermittent
    connectivity, a high \nuncorrected error rate, or the need for access path changes
    \n('hand-off's). Previous work [PILC] has addressed these \nconditions using end-to-end
    mechanisms. This draft examines the \nuse of an on-path signaling mechanisms capable
    of providing \nadvisory notifications for use in modifying the behavior of the
    \ntransport in order to better respond to actual network \nconditions.  This draft
    serves to create discussion in this area\nas there are many ways to skin the cat.
    We are interested in \nhearing about them through open discussion.\n\n\t "

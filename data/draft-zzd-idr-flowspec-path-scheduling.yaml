  content: "   Path scheduling is required in many network scenarios.  For example,\n
    \  some links or nodes will be shut down in the tidal network when the\n   traffic
    decreases, which may lead to the expiration of some routing\n   paths.\n\n   This
    document defines a new type of component for BGP Flow\n   Specification to identify
    the packets arrived at different time slot.\n   Based on that, the headend can
    steer packets into different paths at\n   different time.\n\n\t "

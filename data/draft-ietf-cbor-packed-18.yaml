  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949 == STD 94)\n
    \  is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of\n   extremely
    small code size, fairly small message size, and\n   extensibility without the
    need for version negotiation.\n\n   CBOR does not provide any forms of data compression.
    \ CBOR data\n   items, in particular when generated from legacy data models, often\n
    \  allow considerable gains in compactness when applying data\n   compression.
    \ While traditional data compression techniques such as\n   DEFLATE (RFC 1951)
    can work well for CBOR encoded data items, their\n   disadvantage is that the
    recipient needs to decompress the compressed\n   form before it can make use of
    the data.\n\n   This specification describes Packed CBOR, a set of CBOR tags and\n
    \  simple values that enable a simple transformation of an original CBOR\n   data
    item into a Packed CBOR data item that is almost as easy to\n   consume as the
    original CBOR data item.  A separate decompression\n   step is therefore often
    not required at the recipient.\n\n\n   // (This cref will be removed by the RFC
    editor:) The present\n   // revision -18 is a work-in-progress release in preparation
    for\n   // another cbor-packed side meeting.  The wording of the present\n   //
    revision continues to make use of the tunables A/B/C to be set to\n   // specific
    numbers before completing the Packed CBOR specification;\n   // not all the examples
    may fully align yet.  Specifically, the new\n   // text about using the reference
    data item allocations for other\n   // mechanisms than the cbor-packed one defined
    here should enable us\n   // to revert to A=16.\n\n\t "

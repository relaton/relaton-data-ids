  content: "The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution is a\nmethod
    based on RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) that enables an\nRTP receiver to
    rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP multicast\ndata.  Upon a request from
    the RTP receiver, an auxiliary unicast RTP\nretransmission session is set up between
    a retransmission server and\nthe RTP receiver, over which the reference information
    about the new\nmulticast stream the RTP receiver is about to join is transmitted
    at\nan accelerated rate.  This often precedes, but may also accompany,\nthe multicast
    stream itself.  When there is only one multicast stream\nto be acquired, the RAMS
    solution works in a straightforward manner.\nHowever, when there are two or more
    multicast streams to be acquired\nfrom the same or different multicast RTP sessions,
    care should be\ntaken to configure each RAMS session appropriately.  This document\nprovides
    example scenarios and offers guidelines.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a TCP Simple Authentication Option (TCP-SA)
    \n   which is intended to replace the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC-2385 \n
    \  (TCP/MD5). TCP-SA specifies the use of stronger HMAC-based hashes and \n   provides
    more details on the association of security associations \n   with TCP connections.
    TCP-SA assumes an external, out-of-band \n\n   mechanism (manual or via a separate
    protocol) for session key \n   establishment, parameter negotiation, and rekeying,
    replicating the \n   separation of key management and key use as in the IPsec
    suite. The \n   result is intended to be a simple modification to support current
    \n   infrastructure uses of TCP/MD5, such as to protect BGP and LDP, to \n   support
    a larger set of hashes with minimal other system and \n   operational changes.
    TCP-SA requires no new option identifier, though \n   it is intended to be mutually
    exclusive with TCP/MD5 on a given TCP \n   connection. It can be used in the presence
    of NATs/NAPTs, and \n   supports IPv6, and is fully compatible with requirements
    under \n   development for an update to TCP/MD5. \n\n\t "

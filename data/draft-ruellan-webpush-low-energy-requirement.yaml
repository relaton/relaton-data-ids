  content: "   Many devices are now connected to the Internet.  Receiving\n   instantaneous
    notifications from the Web is an appealing but possibly\n   power-hungry feature.
    \ This can be a substantial problem for light\n   devices with limited battery
    capacities.  WebPush alleviates this\n   problem by enabling a server to push
    notifications to the device\n   instead of having the device regularly poll the
    server.  This is a\n   first step towards more energy efficient devices, but is
    still not\n   sufficient for enabling batteries to last weeks or months without\n
    \  recharging.\n\n\t "

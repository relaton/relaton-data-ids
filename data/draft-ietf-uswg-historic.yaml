  content: "    Traditionally, the User Services Area of the IETF has been\n    responsible
    for keeping FYI documents updated.  However, as the\n    Internet has progressed
    and developed, it has become clear that not\n    all FYIs are worth updating.
    \ Some of the information is simply\n    obsolete.  This memo documents which
    FYIs are considered obsolete,\n    and lets users know not to trust the information
    they contain.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Tombstone notice:\n\n   This draft is no longer being pursued at the
    IETF.  A variant of this\n   proposal was adopted in [itu-t-x509-2019], which
    allows two keys to\n   be placed in a certificate but only one used at a time.
    \ The major\n   downside of this proposal is that it requires the large PQC key
    to be\n   sent even to legacy clients which will not use it.  Additionally,\n
    \  this proposal does not present a generic encoding for the multiple\n   signatures
    produced by the multiple keys contained in a hybrid\n   certificate, leaving the
    responsibility to dependent protocols and\n   applications for how to carry multiple
    signatures and how to signal\n   that multiple signatures should have been present
    in order to detect\n   stripping attacks.  As such, this document represents only
    a partial\n   solution to the dual-signature problem.  How, and whether, to\n
    \  implement dual-signatures is an active and ongoing discussion topic\n   at
    the IETF and work continues in this area across several working\n   groups.  The
    PQUIP WG serves as a central location for all PQC-\n   related discussion.\n\n
    \  Original abstract:\n\n   This document describes a method of embedding alternative
    sets of\n   cryptographic materials into X.509v3 digital certificates, X.509v2\n
    \  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and PKCS #10 Certificate Signing\n   Requests
    (CSRs).  The embedded alternative cryptographic materials\n   allow a Public Key
    Infrastructure (PKI) to use multiple cryptographic\n   algorithms in a single
    object, and allow it to transition to the new\n   cryptographic algorithms while
    maintaining backwards compatibility\n   with systems using the existing algorithms.
    \ Three X.509 extensions\n   and three PKCS #10 attributes are defined, and the
    signing and\n   verification procedures for the alternative cryptographic material\n
    \  contained in the extensions and attributes are detailed.\n\n\t "

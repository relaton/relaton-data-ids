  content: "This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n
    \  in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as a Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n   authenticated
    encryption operation.  GCM provides both\n   confidentiality and data origin authentication,
    can be efficiently\n   implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second
    and\n   above, and is also well-suited to software implementations.  This\n   memo
    defines TLS ciphersuites that use AES-GCM with RSA.\n\t "

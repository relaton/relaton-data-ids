  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network based mobility management \nprotocol
    which provides IP mobility service to a host in a way which \nis transparent to
    the host itself. This document analyses the \nscenario in which the mobile node
    equipped with multiple network \ninterfaces roams in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
    consisting of multiple \naccess networks. If the mobile node wants to preserve
    IP session \ncontinuity across different network interfaces as it moves from one
    \naccess network to another it needs to be enhanced with a new, PMIPv6-\nspecific
    functionality. \n\n \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
    \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument are to be interpreted
    as described in [RFC2119].\n\t "

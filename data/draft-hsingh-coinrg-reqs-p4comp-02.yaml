  content: "   The P4 research community has published a paper to show how to split\n
    \  a P4 program into sub-programs which run on heterogeneous network\n   nodes
    in a network.  Examples of nodes are a network switch, a\n   smartNIC, or a host
    machine.  The paper has developed artifacts to\n   split program based on latency,
    data rate, cost, etc.  However, the\n   paper does not mention any requirements.
    \ To provide guidance, this\n   document covers requirements for splitting P4
    programs for\n   heterogeneous network nodes.\n\n\t "

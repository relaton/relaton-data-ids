  content: "   This document documents some issues with the current definition of\n
    \  the backup subflows in [RFC6824].  The solution proposed in [RFC6824]\n   works
    well when a subflow completely fails.  However, if a subflow\n   suffers from
    huge packet losses, but still remains up, then the delay\n   to switch to the
    backup subflow may be very long.  We propose to\n   measure the evolution of the
    retransmission timer (RTO) to detect the\n   bad performance of subflows.\n\n\t "

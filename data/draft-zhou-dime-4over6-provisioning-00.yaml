  content: "   During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may have\n
    \  to support one of the various transition methods that have been or\n   are
    currently being defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6.\n   Work is currently
    in progress to enumerate the information that needs\n   to be provisioned on a
    customer edge router to support a list of\n   transition techniques based on tunneling
    IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to\n   defining reusable components for a reasonable
    transition path between\n   these techniques.  To the extent that the provisioning
    is done\n   dynamically, AAA support is needed to provide the information to the\n
    \  network server responsible for passing the information to the\n   customer
    equipment.  This document specifies Diameter attribute-value\n   pairs to be used
    for that purpose.\n\n\t "

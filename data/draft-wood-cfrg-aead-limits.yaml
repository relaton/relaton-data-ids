  content: "   An Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm\n
    \  provides confidentiality and integrity.  Excessive use of the same\n   key
    can give an attacker advantages in breaking these properties.\n   This document
    provides simple guidance for users of common AEAD\n   functions about how to limit
    the use of keys in order to bound the\n   advantage given to an attacker.\n\n\t "

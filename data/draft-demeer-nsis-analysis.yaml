  content: "This memo provides a brief analysis of existing IP quality of service\n(QoS)
    solutions and the implied signalling issues. This analysis is\nintended to point
    out open issues in QoS signalling.  Moreover, this\nanalysis is done in order
    to understand whether the strict QoS\nrequirements imposed by future fixed and
    mobile applications are\nsatisfied by the existing IP QoS solutions.  The existing
    IP QoS\nsolutions can be categorized as follows:\n* End-to-end per-flow resource
    reservation protocols\n* Integrated Services over Differentiated Services\n* Statically
    assigned trunk reservations based on\nDifferentiated Services\n* Dynamic trunk
    reservations with Aggregated RSVP\n\t "

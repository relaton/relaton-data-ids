  content: "   With the advent of the digital era, there are more and more scenarios\n
    \  such as data off-site AI training, data off-site cloud, and the\n   demand
    for big data transmission in the WAN is increasing.  WAN data\n   transmission
    involves throughput, delay, packet loss, security and\n   other performance indicators,
    as well as cost investment.  Users have\n   been exploring how to achieve the
    best performance of data\n   transmission at the lowest cost.  This paper implements
    high quality\n   WAN data transmission based on IBNS.\n\n\t "

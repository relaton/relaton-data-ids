abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   During the period of IPv6 transition, both ISPs and ICPs (Internet\n
    \  Content Providers) care about user's experience in dual-stack\n   networks.
    \ They hesitate to provide IPv6 to their users due to the\n   fear of poor IPv6
    performance.  Network-based Happy Eyeballs (NHE) is\n   proposed in this memo
    as an approach to facilitate ISPs to identify\n   IPv6 connectivity issues and
    provide better connectivity to end\n   users.  NHE does accurate measurements
    and comparison on IPv6/IPv4\n   performance on the network side compared with
    client-side as in Happy\n   Eyeballs v2 (HEv2) [RFC8305].  It works independently
    with client's\n   adoption of HEv2 and both coexist without conflicting.\n\n   REMOVE
    BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source of the document with test\n   script is currently
    placed at GitHub [NHE-GitHub].  Comments and pull\n   request are welcome.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document discusses how to build the large-scale Mobile IP \nnetwork
    through the MPLS network. One small-scale Mobile IP network \ncould be connected
    to other networks through the MPLS backbone \nnetwork. \nIt proposes the MPLS
    network architecture to provide the large-scale \nMobile IP network. Specifically,
    it proposes that the label \ndistribution protocol (LDP) can be applied to set
    up the Label \nswitched path (LSP) tunnels between the mobile agents (that is,
    \nForeign Agents and Home Agents)[3]. It means that the IP-in-IP \ntunnels can
    be replaced by one or multiple Label Switched Paths \n(LSPs) on the MPLS network.\n\t "

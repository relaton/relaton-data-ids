  content: "This draft proposes to engineer traffic such that we can speak of an\nOrchestrally
    Conducted Traffic (OCT): Any traffic stream (given by\nits source and destination
    nodes and by a priority class) may use\nseveral differently routed LSPs.  Each,
    traffic stream ingress\nreports, periodically, the currently measured traffic
    load (in\nbitrate) to a common TE Conductor (TEC) who evaluates them as to\nforecast
    what traffic load change might occur in the immediate time\nahead. Accordingly
    the TEC  computes well synchronized likelihood\nvalues by which to take which
    route/LSP. These values will be such\nthat any traffic stream will be served as
    good as possible, as often\nas possible, while equally ranked traffic streams
    are treated fair,\nhigher ranked streams are prioritized  and  the network thruput
    is\nmaximized. The TEC sends the likelihood values to the respective\ningress
    node, who will  distribute the received packets of the\ntraffic stream to the
    pertaining LSPs accordingly.\n\t "

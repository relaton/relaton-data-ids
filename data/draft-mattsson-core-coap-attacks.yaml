  content: "   Being able to securely read information from sensors, to securely\n
    \  control actuators, and to not enable distributed denial-of-service\n   attacks
    are essential in a world of connected and networking things\n   interacting with
    the physical world.  This document summarizes a\n   number of known attacks on
    CoAP and show that just using CoAP with a\n   security protocol like DTLS, TLS,
    or OSCORE is not enough for secure\n   operation.  Several of the discussed attacks
    can be mitigated with\n   the solutions in draft-ietf-core-echo-request-tag.\n\n\t "

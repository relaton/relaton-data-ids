  content: "   CoRE defines a mechanism for resource discovery based on Web linking\n
    \  with discovery, registration,modification, and other procedures. But\n   energy
    efficiency is very important for resource constrained devices.\n   This specification
    shows an efficient method for CoAP proxy finding\n   the resource from end-points
    by reducing multicast messages.\n\n   The current version -00 of this document
    is just an initial draft\n   that is intended to spark discussion.\n\n\t "

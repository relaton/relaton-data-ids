  content: "An authenticated encryption algorithm combines encryption and integrity
    into a single operation; such algorithms may also be referred to as combined modes
    of an encryption cipher or as combined mode algorithms. This document describes
    the use of authenticated encryption algorithms with the Encrypted Payload of the
    Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.\n\n The use of two specific
    authenticated encryption algorithms with the IKEv2 Encrypted Payload is also described;
    these two algorithms are the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter
    Mode (AES GCM) and AES in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (AES CCM). Additional documents
    may describe the use of other authenticated encryption algorithms with the IKEv2
    Encrypted Payload. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

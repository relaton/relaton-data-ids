  content: "The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file\ntransfer
    protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a\nremote host.\n \nThis
    document describes a new TFTP option. This new option will allow\nthe multiple
    client to receive the same file concurrently through the\nuse of Multicast packets.
    The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is\ndescribed in [2].\n \nOften when similar
    computers are booting remotely they will each\ndownload the same image file. By
    adding multicast into the TFTP option\nset, two or more computers can download
    a file concurrently, thus\nincreasing network efficiency.\n \nThis document assumes
    that the reader is familiar with the terminology\nand notation of both [1] and
    [2].\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "The IPv6 128-bit address space was designed as a solution for the\n   32-bit
    limitation of IPv4, but the proliferation of IPv4 in the\n   global Internet continues
    via private addressing domains behind\n   Network Address Translators (NATs).
    For these reasons, deployment of\n   IPv6 at the end nodes with minimal perturbation
    of IPv4 networks\n   presents a natural long-term transition and coexistence alternative.\n
    \  This document proposes a coexistence scenario with IPv6 for end to\n   end
    addressing and IPv4 for network traversal.\n\t "

  content: "   RFC 5586 defines a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) mechanism for\n
    \  MPLS paths that enables multiplexing of auxiliary traffic over such\n   paths
    along with the user traffic they carry.  Such auxiliary traffic\n   is commonly
    used for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n   protocols that enable
    monitoring and management of the path.  This\n   document describes the applicability
    of the G-ACh mechanism to\n   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels.\n\n\t "

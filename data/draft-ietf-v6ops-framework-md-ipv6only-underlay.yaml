abstract:
- content: "<p>For the IPv6 transition, dual-stack deployments require both IPv4 and
    IPv6 forwarding capabilities to be deployed in parallel. IPv6-only is considered
    as the ultimate stage where only IPv6 forwarding capabilities are used while ensuring
    global reachability for both IPv6 and IPv4 service(usually known as IPv4aaS).
    This document specifies requirements and proposes a framework for deploying IPv6-only
    as the underlay in multi-domain networks, discusses the requirements of service
    traffic, major components and interfaces, IPv6 mapping prefix allocation, typical
    procedures for service delivery. The document also discusses related considerations
    about security.</p>"

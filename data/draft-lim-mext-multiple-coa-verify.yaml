  content: "Using multiple care-of address registration, there is a possibility\nthat
    a malicious mobile node could create multiple care-of address\nbindings that does
    not belong to the mobile node at its home agent.\nThe home agent would accept
    these bindings without verifying them due\nto the trust relationship it has with
    the mobile node.  With these\nbindings, the mobile node can launch attacks by
    asking the home agent\nto flood the victims of these care-of addresses with useless
    packets.\nTo mitigate such a problem, this memo introduces a few possible\nverification
    mechanisms that the home agent would use in order to\nverify the care-of addresses
    for the mobile node before using them\nfor packet routing.\n\t "

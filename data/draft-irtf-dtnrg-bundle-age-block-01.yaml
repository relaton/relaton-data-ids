abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "As originally specified, [RFC5050] presumes that any DTN node will\n   have
    access to accurate real world time.  Experience has shown that\n   there are devices
    and networks where accurate real world time is\n   difficult or impossible to
    consistently obtain.\n\n   This draft proposes an extension block that contains
    the current age\n   of a bundle in order to support bundle expiration for nodes
    and\n   networks that have faulty, intermittent, or no notion of the real\n   world
    time.  Bundle age may be used to expire bundles by a Bundle\n   Protocol Agent
    which does not have access to accurate real world\n   time.  The bundle age must
    be updated at each hop in order to\n   maintain accuracy.\n\t "

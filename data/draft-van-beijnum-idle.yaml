  content: "This document discusses the architecture of a successor to BGP4. The\nproblems
    surrounding inter-domain routing and the BGP protocol have been studied within
    the IETF, the IRTF and elsewhere, but what's required to actually solve some of
    these issues hasn't been explored much. That's what this document tries to accomplish.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses use cases, survey, and problem statement on\n
    \  IP-based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of\n   Intelligent
    Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main topics of\n   vehicular networking are
    vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-\n   infrastructure (V2I), and infrastructure-to-vehicle
    (I2V) networking.\n   First, this document surveys use cases using V2V and V2I
    networking.\n   Second, this document deals with some critical aspects in vehicular\n
    \  networking, such as vehicular network architectures, standardization\n   activities,
    IP address autoconfiguration, routing, mobility\n   management, DNS naming service,
    service discovery, and security and\n   privacy.  For each aspect, this document
    discusses problem statement\n   to analyze the gap between the state-of-the-art
    techniques and\n   requirements in IP-based vehicular networking.  Finally, this\n
    \  document articulates discussions including the summary and analysis\n   of
    vehicular networking aspects and raises deployment issues.\n\n\t "

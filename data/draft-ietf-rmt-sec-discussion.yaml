  content: "   This document describes general security considerations for Reliable\n
    \  Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks and protocols.  An emphasis\n   is
    placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport\n   protocol
    design.  However, relevant security issues related to IP\n   Multicast control-plane
    and other concerns not strictly within the\n   scope of reliable transport protocol
    design are also discussed.  The\n   document also begins an exploration of approaches
    that could be\n   embraced to mitigate these risks.  The purpose of this document
    is to\n   provide a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for\n
    \  further discussions and potential resolution of any significant\n   security
    issues that may exist in the current set of RMT standards.\n\n\t "

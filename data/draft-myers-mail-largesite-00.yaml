  content: "Domains which recieve a large number of incoming mail messages have a
    need to distribute incoming requests over a large number of SMTP servers.  The
    most obvious method for advertising DNS records these SMTP servers leads to undesirable
    behavior when certain network failures occur.  For example, on XXXX, 1996 [XXXREF]
    a single routing failure at a large site led to the catastrophic failure of a
    large portion of mail systems on the Internet.  This document gives recommendations
    for how large sites should advertise DNS records for their SMTP servers to avoid
    these problems and for how SMTP client implementations should insulate themselves
    against large sites which do not follow these recommendations.\n\t "

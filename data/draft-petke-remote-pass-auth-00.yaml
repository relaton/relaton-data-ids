  content: "Remote Passphrase Authentication provides a way to authenticate a user
    to a service by using a pass phrase over an insecure network, without revealing
    the pass phrase to eavesdroppers. In addition, the service need not know and does
    not learn the user's pass phrase, making this scheme useful in distributed environments
    where it would be difficult or inappropriate to trust a service with a pass phrase
    database or to allow the server to learn enough to masquerade as the user in a
    future authentication attempt.                                                    This
    scheme was inspired by Dave Raggett's Mediated Digest Authentication, draft-ietf-http-mda-00.txt.
    \                                               This specification is divided
    into five parts. Part Zero contains an extended introduction to the problem and
    potential solutions. Part One explains the mechanism. Part Two explains how to
    incorporate the mechanism into HTTP. Part Three explains the protocol between
    the service and deity. Part Four explains the GSS-API token formats. Feel free
    to start with Part One; Part Zero provides background information and is not a
    prerequisite for Part One.\n\t "

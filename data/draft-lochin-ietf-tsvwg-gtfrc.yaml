  content: "   This memo introduces gTFRC, a TCP-Friendly Rate Control providing\n
    \  throughput guarantee over the DiffServ/AF class. gTFRC is largely\n   based
    on TFRC [2].  It provides a mean to take into account the\n   quality of service
    negotiated with the network.  As a result, the\n   mechanism is able to reach
    a minimum throughput guarantee whatever\n   the flow's RTT and target rate.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes an optional extension to the Constrained\n   Application
    Protocol (CoAP, [RFC7252] and [RFC7959]) that allows\n   matching of request blocks.
    \ This primarily serves to transfer the\n   security properties that Object Security
    of CoAP (OSCOAP,\n   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security]) provides for single requests
    to\n   blockwise transfers.  The security of blockwise transfer in OSCOAP is\n
    \  reflected on in a dedicated section.\n\n\t "

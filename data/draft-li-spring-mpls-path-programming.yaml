  content: "   Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture for unicast\n
    \  traffic has been proposed to cope with the use cases in traffic\n   engineering,
    fast re-reroute, service chain, etc.  It can leverage\n   existing MPLS dataplane
    without any modification.  In fact, the label\n   stack capability in MPLS would
    have been utilized well to implement\n   flexible path programming to satisfy
    all kinds of requirements of\n   service bearing.  But in the distributed environment,
    the flexible\n   programming capability is difficult to implement and always confined\n
    \  to reachability.  As the introducing of central control in the\n   network,
    the flexible MPLS programming capability becomes possible\n   owing to two factors:
    1.  It becomes easier to allocate label for\n   more purposes than reachability;
    2.  It is easy to calculate the MPLS\n   path in a global network view.  Moreover,
    the MPLS path programming\n   capability can be utilized to satisfy more requirements
    of service\n   bearing in the service layer which is defined as service-oriented\n
    \  MPLS path programming.  This document defines the concept of MPLS\n   path
    programming, then proposes use cases, architecture and protocol\n   extension
    requirements in the service layer for the architecture of\n   Source Packet Routing
    in Networking (SPRING).\n\n\n\t "

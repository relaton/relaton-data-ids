  content: "   IPv6 Flow Label field in IPv6 packet header is designed to\n   differentiate
    the various traffic flow session within network. The\n   current definition of
    IPv6 Flow Label focuses mainly on how the\n   packet source forms the value of
    this field and how the forwarder\n   in-path treats it. There is no analysis on
    the relation between the\n   flow label from source nodes and its corresponding
    value in return\n   packet. This draft analyzes the requirements for flow label\n
    \  reflection between the upstream session and the corresponding\n   downstream
    session. Based on the analysis, the flow label reflection\n   mechanism is proposed
    in this document.\n\n\t "

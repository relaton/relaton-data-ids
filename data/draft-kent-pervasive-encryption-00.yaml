  content: "   This document was prepared as part of the IETF response to concerns\n
    \  about \"pervasive monitoring\" as articulated in [I-D.farrell-perpass-\n   attack].
    \ It begins by exploring terminology that has been used in\n   IETF standards
    (and in academic publications) to describe encryption\n   and key management techniques,
    with a focus on authentication vs.\n   anonymity.  Based on this analysis, it
    propose a new term, \"pervasive\n   encryption\" (PE) to describe a goal for IETF
    security protocols, one\n   countermeasure to pervasive monitoring.\n\n\t "

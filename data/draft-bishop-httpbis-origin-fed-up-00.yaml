- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The definition of the HTTP/2 ORIGIN frame \"relaxes\" the requirement\n
    \  to check DNS for various reasons.  However, experience has shown that\n   such
    relaxation leads to security risks and is inadvisable.  This\n   document restores
    the original requirements.\n\n\t "

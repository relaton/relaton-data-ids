  content: "A Path Computation Element (PCE) performing dependent path \n    computations,
    for instance calculating a diverse working and \n    protected path do not share
    common network points, would need to \n    synchronize the computations in order
    to increase the probability \n    of meeting the working and protected path disjoint
    objective and \n    network resource optimization objective. When a PCE computes
    \n    multiple sets of dependent path computation requests concurrently, \n    it
    is required to use Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) list for \n    association among
    the sets of dependent path computation requests. \n    This document describes
    the usage of multiple SVECs in the SVEC \n    list and its processing guideline,
    for the synchronized computation \n    of dependent paths. \n\n\t "

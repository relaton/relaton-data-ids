  content: "MPLS fast reroute [3] is considered as a possible solution to protect\ntraffic
    against link and node failures by re-directing the traffic\nlocally to a backup
    LSP. A backup LSP can be either a detour LSP or a\nbypass tunnel. This document
    describes two methods to optimize the\nrouting of detour LSPs such that they merge
    faster, a distributed\nmethod and a centralized method. The distributed method
    uses the\nBackup Record Route Object (BRRO) and the centralized method uses the\nBackup
    Explicit Route Object (BERO). The latter can also be used for\nbypass tunnels.\n\t "

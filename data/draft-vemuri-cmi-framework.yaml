  content: "In this paper we study the problem of call model integration.  \nSeveral
    call models are in common use. Most are customized for \nefficiency of operation
    and ease of access to features within  \nspecific domains. Access to features
    external to a given domain may \nbe facilitated by overlaying the call model representation
    intrinsic \nto said external domain atop the base call model integral to the pre-\nspecified
    base domain.\n\t "

  content: "In interdomain routing environment, it is often observed Multiple Origin
    \nASes and it causes instability in interdomain routing. To work around\nits problem,
    this draft describes the mechanism of automatically \nintegrity check about origin
    AS. In this approach, BGP router compares\nwith the origin AS in BGP UPDATE and
    origin AS in IRR database. \nAlso this draft defines messages between BGP router
    and IRR-DB to \ntransmit query and reply packet. And by introducing the cache
    mechanism \nin BGP router, it can apply route flapping environment.\n\n\t "

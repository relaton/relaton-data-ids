  content: "This draft describes the problem statement and specifies the \nsolution
    requirements for MIPv4 traversal across VPN or 'NAT \nand VPN' gateways.  The
    'NAT and VPN' case refers to a network \ntopology in which the MIPv4 traffic has
    to traverse one or more \nNAT gateway(s) followed by a VPN gateway in the path
    to its \nfinal destination.  Requirements and problems associated with \nMIPv4
    traversal through NAT gateways NOT involving VPNs is \noutside the scope of this
    draft.  \n\n\t "

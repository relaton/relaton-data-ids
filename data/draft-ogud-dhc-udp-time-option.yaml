  content: "   Many small inexpensive computing devices like home routers, Rasberry\n
    \  Pi etc. do not have a battery to allow clock chip to keep track of\n   time,
    thus the systems have no idea what the current time is upon\n   boot.  Number
    of modern services take Time Synchronization for\n   granted, but operating systems
    do not allow the start of these\n   services to be deferred until after accurate
    clock has been\n   confirmed.\n\n   NTP provides accurate fine grain clock synchronization
    but in order\n   for NTP to succeed DNS needs to work.  DNSSEC resolvers will
    fail if\n   system clock is off by more than little bit.  This draft proposes
    a\n   mechanism to offer \"reasonable\" current time to devices upon boot via\n
    \  DHCP, DHCPv6 and ND.\n\n\t "

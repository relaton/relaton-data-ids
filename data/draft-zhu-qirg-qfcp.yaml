abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Quantum Four-Wave Mixing Control Protocol
    (QFCP), a lightweight transport protocol designed to operate over UDP in IP optical
    environments. QFCP enables the transmission of control- plane parameters required
    for quantum four-wave mixing (FWM) processes and associated optical configurations,
    including polarization stabilization, timestamp alignment, ROADM port selection,
    and spectral parameters. The protocol uses a Type-Length- Value (TLV) structure
    to support versioning and extensibility. This work is motivated by recent demonstrations
    of a classical-decisive quantum internet using integrated photonics.</p>"

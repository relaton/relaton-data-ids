  content: "   This document specifies the Quantum Four-Wave Mixing Control Protocol\n
    \  (QFCP), a lightweight transport protocol designed to operate over UDP\n   in
    IP optical environments.  QFCP enables the transmission of\n   control- plane
    parameters required for quantum four-wave mixing (FWM)\n   processes and associated
    optical configurations, including\n   polarization stabilization, timestamp alignment,
    ROADM port\n   selection, and spectral parameters.  The protocol uses a Type-Length-\n
    \  Value (TLV) structure to support versioning and extensibility.  This\n   work
    is motivated by recent demonstrations of a classical-decisive\n   quantum internet
    using integrated photonics.\n\n\t "

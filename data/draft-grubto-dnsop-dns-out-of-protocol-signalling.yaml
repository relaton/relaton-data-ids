  content: "   This document seeks to specify a method for DNS servers to signal\n
    \  programs outside of the server software, and which are not\n   necessarily
    involved with the DNS protocol, about conditions that can\n   arise within the
    server.  These signals can be used to invoke actions\n   in areas that help provide
    the DNS service, such as routing.\n\n   Currently this document serves as a requirements
    document to come to\n   a signalling mechanism that will suit the use cases best.
    \ Part of\n   that effort is to assemble a list of conditions with potential\n
    \  associated out of DNS protocol actions, as well as inventory and\n   assess
    existing signalling mechanisms for suitability.\n\n\t "

  content: "Other Internet Drafts from the CONNEG working group describe a\n   syntax[SYNTAX]
    and vocabulary[FEATURES] for negotiating media feature\n   sets which can be used
    for transmission of a message. For example, a\n   feature set may specify that
    full color output up to 800x600 pixels\n   is supported, or that output can have
    up to 300 dots per inch. These\n   feature sets can be arbitrarily complex, and
    typical feature set\n   expressions may be hundreds of bytes in length. It would
    be\n   relatively costly to transmit such long feature set expressions, and\n
    \  this cost could be a significant obstacle to the use of the CONNEG\n   standard
    to negotiate capabilities for Internet transactions. The\n   problem is likely
    to particularly severe for low-bandwidth wireless\n   connections to the Internet.\n
    \n   This document describes an extension to the CONNEG syntax[SYNTAX]\n   which
    allows a feature set expression to be represented as an\n   absolute URL, which
    can then be looked up over another channel, which\n   is not necessarily the channel
    between the negotiating parties. By\n   using this extension, content negotiation
    between two parties can\n   proceed with a relatively small exchange of data over
    the channel\n   between them. Of course, the contents of the URL must still be
    found\n   through some channel. However, the channel used to find the contents\n
    \  of the URL may have greater bandwidth than the channel between the\n   negotiating
    parties, and may further benefit from HTTP or other\n   caching mechanisms.\n
    \n   This extended syntax is only applicable when the receiver of the\n   feature
    set has the capability to fetch the contents of absolute\n   URLs.  In contrast,
    the base, unextended syntax[SYNTAX] is applicable\n   to any transmission channel,
    without requiring any external resources\n   for the feature set transmitter or
    the feature set receiver.\n\t "

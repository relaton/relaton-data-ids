  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies Operations and Management (OAM) requirements\n
    \  that improve on the traditional OAM tools like Ping and  Traceroute.\n   These
    requirements have arisen from the fact that more details than\n   given by Ping
    and Traceroute are required while troubleshooting or\n   doing performance and
    network planning. These requirements have been\n   gathered from network operators
    especially from data centers where\n   the networks have slightly different characteristics
    compared to\n   regular campus/carrier networks.\n\n\t "

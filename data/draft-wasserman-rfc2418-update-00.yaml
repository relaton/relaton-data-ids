  content: "This document contains several updates to RFC 2418 designed to give\nmore
    responsibility and authority to IETF Working Group Chairs.  In\nparticular, Working
    Group Chairs are given the responsibility of\nensuring the technical quality,
    completeness and suitability of work\nproduced by their Working Groups, and the
    authority to refuse to\nadvance any work that does not meet the acceptance criteria
    for its\nproposed publication level.  The importance of meeting minutes is\nemphasized,
    and Working Group chairs are also given more\nresponsibility and authority for
    the management of working group\nmailing list discussions.\n\t "

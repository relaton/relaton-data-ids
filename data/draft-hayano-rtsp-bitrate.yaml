  content: "Typically, there is no use for providing bandwidth information from\nan
    RTSP 2.0 server to RTSP 2.0 clients.  The bandwidth of the medias\nplayed out
    by the server is different from the available bandwidth in\nthe network (which
    is also changing) and there is anyhow the need to\nperform congestion control
    during media playout.  This is true for\nInternet deployments, or similar, but
    conveying information about\nbandwidth of the medias can be required in other
    deployments of RTSP\n2.0.  It might necessarily for RTSP 2.0 clients to obtain
    information\nabout the by medias used bandwidth in networks that rely on bandwidth\nreservation
    initiated by the end host.  An example is the Next\nGeneration Network (NGN) standardized
    by ETSI TISPAN, where RTSP 2.0\nclients must indicate the required bandwidth to
    the network.  This\nmemo discusses how to provide bandwidth information from RTSP
    2.0\nservers to clients and how to introduce it in RTSP 2.0.\n\t "

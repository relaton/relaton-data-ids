  content: "   This document describes an protocol used to negotiate media between\n
    \  browsers or other compatible devices.  This protocol provides the\n   state
    machinery needed to implement the offer/answer model (RFC\n   3264), and defines
    the semantics and necessary attributes of messages\n   that must be exchanged.
    \ The protocol uses an abstract transport in\n   that it does not actually define
    how these messages are exchanged.\n   Rather, such exchanges are handled through
    web-based transports like\n   HTTP or WebSockets.  The protocol focuses solely
    on media negotiation\n   and does not handle call control, call processing, or
    other\n   functions.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>HMTFTP ([RFC1350]) is a lightweight UDP file transfer protocol that
    preserves TFTP-style simplicity (block-and-ACK) while adding an optional authenticated
    encryption mode using AEAD AES-256-GCM with pre-shared keys derived via HKDF-SHA-256.
    The protocol targets managed environments (e.g., CPEs, OpenWrt, embedded devices)
    where provisioning and configuration have constrained requirements. This document
    specifies v0.1, including message formats, negotiation, cryptographic processing,
    timers, and security considerations.</p>"

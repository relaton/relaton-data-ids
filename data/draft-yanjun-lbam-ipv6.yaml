  content: "Load balancing is a method, by which IP packet can be distributed \nacross
    a pool of servers, instead of directing to a single server. \nThere are many applications
    needing load balancing such as Web \nservice, FTP service and NAT gateway. However,
    current load \nbalancing software and implementations have problems such as poor
    \nscalability, inability to balance session flow, long latency time \nand topological
    constraint on server pool.  \nThis document describes a method using pseudo-anycast
    and pseudo-\nmobility based on Mobile IPv6 to implement load balancing in \nsession
    level in Ipv6 network, by which those problems above can be \nsolved. Futhermore,
    this method only need little modification to \nMobile IPv6 in the servers' and
    agent's side; as for the general \nusers, it need not any modification. \n\n\t "

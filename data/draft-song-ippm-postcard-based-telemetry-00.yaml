  content: "   This document describes a proposal which allows network OAM\n   applications
    to collect telemetry data about any user packet.  Unlike\n   similar techniques
    such as INT and in-situ OAM, the Postcard-Based\n   Telemetry (PBT) does not require
    inserting telemetry data into user\n   packets, but directly exports the telemetry
    data to a collector\n   through separated OAM packets called postcards.  Two variations
    of\n   PBT are described in this document: one requires inserting an\n   instruction
    header to user packets to guide the data collection and\n   the other only marks
    the user packets to invoke the data collection.\n   Each has its own pros and
    cons.  Either way, the postcards for a\n   single user packet are from multiple
    devices and need to be\n   correlated at the collector, which is a unique issue
    pertaining to\n   PBT.  Whereas, PBT provides an alternative to INT and address
    several\n   implementation and deployment challenges of the INT-based solutions.\n\n\t "

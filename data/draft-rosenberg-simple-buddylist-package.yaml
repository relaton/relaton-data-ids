  content: "This document presents a SIP event package for subscribing to a buddy\nlist.
    A buddy list is a collection of presentities that a subscriber\nis interested
    in learning presence state for. Instead of the\nsubscriber sending a SUBSCRIBE
    to each buddy individually, the\nsubscriber can subscribe to their buddy list
    as a whole, and then\nreceive notifications when the state of any of their buddies
    changes.\n\n\n\t "

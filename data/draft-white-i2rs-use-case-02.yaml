  content: "   Programmatic interfaces to provide control over individual forwarding\n
    \  devices in a network promise to reduce operational costs while\n   improving
    scaling, control, and visibility into the operation of\n   large scale networks.
    \ To this end, several programmatic interfaces\n   have been proposed.  OpenFlow,
    for instance, provides a mechanism to\n   replace the dynamic control plane processes
    on individual forwarding\n   devices throughout a network with off box processes
    that interact\n   with the forwarding tables on each device.  Another example
    is\n   NETCONF, which provides a fast and flexible mechanism to interact\n   with
    device configuration and policy.\n\n   There is, however, no proposal which provides
    an interface to all\n   aspects of the routing system as a system.  Such a system
    would not\n   interact with the forwarding system on individual devices, but rather\n
    \  with the control plane processes already used to discover the best\n   path
    to any given destination through the network, as well as\n   interact with the
    routing information base (RIB), which feeds the\n   forwarding table the information
    needed to actually switch traffic at\n   a local level.\n\n   This document describes
    a set of use cases such a system could\n   fulfill.  It is designed to provide
    underlying support for the\n   framework, policy, and other drafts describing
    the Interface to the\n   Routing System (I2RS).\n\n\t "

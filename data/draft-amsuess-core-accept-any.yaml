  content: "   This memoy defines the Accept-Any option, which provides a more\n   flexible
    content negotiation than the one originally specified for\n   the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) in [RFC7252].  As this is\n   particularly useful
    with but ruled out in CoAP observation\n   ([RFC7641]), that is updated to allow
    it.\n\n\t "

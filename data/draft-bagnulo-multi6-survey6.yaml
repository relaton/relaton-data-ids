  content: "This document presents proposed solutions and tools related to IPv6\nmulti-homing.
    \ All presented proposals respect actual IPv6 routing\narchitecture and current
    ISP address aggregation scheme, in\nparticular, avoiding route injection to the
    DFZ.  Besides, only\nnetwork and transport level solutions are introduced, meaning
    that\napplication level solutions are intentionally excluded.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL SUBMISSION PROPOSING A CHANGE TO draft-ietf-\nsip-refer.
    \ IT IS FOR DISCUSSION ONLY.\nThis document defines the REFER method.  This SIP
    extension requests\nthat the recipient REFER to a resource provided in the request.
    \ It\nprovides a mechanism allowing the party sending the REFER to be\nnotified
    of the outcome of the referenced request.  This can be used\nto enable many applications,
    including call transfer.\nIn addition to the REFER method, this document defines
    the referevent\noption tag, the refer event package, and the Refer-To request
    header.\n\t "

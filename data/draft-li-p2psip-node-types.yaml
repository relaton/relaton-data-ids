  content: "\n   This document is an attempt to classify different types of node in\n
    \  peer-to-peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP).  Four possible\n   types
    of nodes in P2PSIP are discussed based on two characters:\n   whether it offers
    overlay-routing services and whether it offers\n   storage functions.  The behaviors
    of each type of nodes and their\n   possible necessities are analyzed.  This document
    is dedicated to be\n   a reference for clarifying some controversial terms in
    P2PSIP working\n   group, such as \"client\", \"low-function peer\", etc.\n\n\t "

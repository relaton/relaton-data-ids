  content: "   The Observe Option allows a CoAP client to observe changes in the\n
    \  state of resources and obtain a current representation of the last\n   resource
    state.  To be an observer of an origin server's rescourses,\n   the client is
    required to register its interest with the server.  A\n   successful registration
    will make the client added into the server's\n   observation list, while a failed
    one may drive the client to re-\n   register.\n\n   However, even repeated and
    frequent re-registrations cannot guarantee\n   the client to eventually become
    an observer of the target server.  In\n   the case that the server is unable or
    unwilling to accept an\n   observer, the time-intensive re-registrations will
    just bring\n   redundant messages in the constrained network and considerable
    energy\n   consumption on both the client and the server.\n\n   This memo defines
    a new CoAP option, State, for providing stateful\n   observation on the resources
    of CoAP servers.  By observing the state\n   of the server in terms of the Observe
    Option, a client can explicitly\n   judge when the server will not actively reject
    an observation\n   registration, and wisely performs the re-registration.  This
    avoids\n   the potential registration flooding that causes considerable network\n
    \  overhead and energy consumption on the constrained nodes.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research\nGroup
    and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its\npublication as an
    RFC were raised.\n\nThis document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol
    using\nHistory of Encounters and Transitivity.  PRoPHET is a variant of the\nepidemic
    routing protocol for intermittently connected networks that\noperates by pruning
    the epidemic distribution tree to minimize\nresource usage while still attempting
    to achieve the best case\nrouting capabilities of epidemic routing.  It is intended
    for use in\nsparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that a fully\nconnected
    path between source and destination exists at any time,\nrendering traditional
    routing protocols unable to deliver messages\nbetween hosts.  These networks are
    examples of networks where there\nis a disparity between the latency requirements
    of applications and\nthe capabilities of the underlying network (networks often
    referred\nto as Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant).  The document presents an\narchitectural
    overview followed by the protocol specification.\n\t "

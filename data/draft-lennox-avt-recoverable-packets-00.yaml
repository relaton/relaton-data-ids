  content: "In some circumstances, it is useful and desirable for the sender of\nan
    RTP stream to be able to deliver a subset of its RTP packets\nreliably.  One example
    of this is a video codec which can encode a\nvideo stream such that decoder state
    can be maintained using just a\nsubset of the packets encoded.  However, existing
    RTP reliability\nmechanisms only define mechanisms which retransmit all the packets
    of\nan RTP stream.\n\nThis document describes a mechanism by which the sender
    of an RTP\nstream can mark a subset of the packets of an RTP stream as high-\npriority
    recoverable packets, and by which the receiver of the stream\ncan request retransmission
    of the high-priority packets.\n\t "

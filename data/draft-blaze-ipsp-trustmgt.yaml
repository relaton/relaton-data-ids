- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft describes an architecture for security policy management\nfor
    IPSEC based on the principle of ``compliance checking.''  We\ndescribe a two-level
    policy hierarchy, in which security\nassociation policy is managed by a highly
    flexible policy language,\nwhich in turn provides input to packet policies that
    are managed by\na fast packet filtering language.  We provide a sample SA policy\nlanguage,
    based on KeyNote, and describe interoperability issues\nfor this architecture.\n\t "

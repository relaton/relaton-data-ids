  content: "This document outlines the issues facing nomadic communications in\nan
    IP-based environment. While cellular systems epitomise current\nconcepts of mobility,
    there is an industry need to support similar\nfunctions in non-cellular environments
    as well. Unfortunately,\nsolutions defined to-date by the cellular industry tend
    to be\nclosely tied to the technology employed over the radio link (e.g.\nGSM,
    cdma2000, UMTS, EDGE).\nTo facilitate discussion, this document begins with a
    high-level\ndescription of functional entities comprising an Open IP Network\nInfrastructure.
    It then defines an abstract model of the access link\nused to connect a mobile
    host to the network. Using these entities\nand model, we then go on to discuss
    the issues facing nomadic\ncomputing that could be usefully addressed by an IETF
    working group\nlike CRAPS.\n\n\n\t "

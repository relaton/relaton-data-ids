  content: "   Shared mesh protection allows a set of diversely routed paths with\n
    \  diverse endpoints to collectively oversubcribe protection resources.\n   Under
    normal conditions no single failure will result in the capacity\n   of the associated
    protection resources to be exhausted.\n\n   When multiple failures occur such
    that more than one path in the set\n   of paths utilizing shared protection resources
    is affected, the\n   necessity arises of pre-empting traffic on the basis of business\n
    \  priority rather than application priority.\n\n   This memo describes the use
    of SPMEs and TC marking as a means of\n   indicating business priority for shared
    mesh protection.\n\n\n\t "

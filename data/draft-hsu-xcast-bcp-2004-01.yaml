  content: "In 2000, XCAST (Explicit Multi-Unicast) was first proposed as a\n   protocol
    intended for small group multicasting. It combined three\n   similar datagram
    simulcasting protocols that were submitted as\n   earlier Internet Drafts by a
    number of different research groups.\n   After that, researchers in those groups
    worked together to further\n   develop, experiment and conduct standardization
    in IETF as well as in\n   the open source community. This resulted in several
    implementations\n   of protocol stacks, systems of multi-party video conference
    and group\n   management, and mechanisms for harmonizing XCAST with ASM and SSM.
    In\n   addition, an XCAST backbone for various experiments has been launched\n
    \  to operate inter-continentally.\n\n   One of the main purposes of this document
    is to summarize the efforts\n   undertaken by XCAST community as \"best current
    practices\" that would\n   then be formally introduced to the IETF/IRTF community.
    In addition,\n   we raise an issue concerning IANA resource allocation, which
    prevents\n   us from widely expanding our experimental networks as well as\n   distributing
    our software. Finally, we request IESG and other experts\n   to check the validity
    of our proposed protocol and make any\n   suggestions about how IANA can assign
    appropriate resources\n   accordingly.\n\t "

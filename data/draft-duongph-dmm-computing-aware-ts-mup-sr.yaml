  content: "   5G support new emerging high reliability and low-latency services by\n
    \  Mobile Edge Computing.  Multiple instances of the same service can be\n   deployed
    over different edge sites to enable high availability,\n   scalability and better
    response time.  However, due to different\n   computing loads and network resources
    overtime, a specific edge site\n   might not always guarantee service quality.
    \ Routing user traffic to\n   an overloaded edge site can significantly affect
    user service\n   experiences.  Current 5G mobile network does not have a method
    to\n   dynamically steer traffic to an optimal service instance based on\n   network
    status and edge sites' computing resources availability.\n\n   This document describes
    solutions to provide computing-aware traffic\n   steering methods for the 5G mobile
    user plane using Segment Routing.\n   The solution explains how to use Segment
    Routing to deliver mobile\n   user traffic dynamically to the best edge site destination
    based on\n   both computing and networking resource information in the mobile
    user\n   plane.\n\n\t "

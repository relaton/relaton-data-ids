  content: "   DHCP Relay Agents eliminate the necessity of having a DHCP server on\n
    \  each physical network.  In certain network configurations, a DHCP\n   server
    may be multiple subnets away from the DHCP client and multiple\n   Relay Agents
    may be configured to relay DHCP messages to and from\n   DHCP client.  Such configuration
    can be supported only when each\n   Relay Agent adds certain Information to DHCP
    messages before relaying\n   them.  This additional information helps in relaying
    the DHCP reply\n   back to the DHCP client through the same path.  This mechanism
    is\n   referred as Relay Chaining.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document proposes and describes a new IP multicast routing\nprotocol,
    called 'Hierarchical Level-based IP Multicast' (HLIM). It\nis designed for a hierarchical
    IP network and leverages the\nhierarchical structure to provide efficient IP multicasting.
    It is\noriginally designed for tactical networks in battlefields but some of\nits
    functions could be applied to commercial networks as well.\nBesides the basic
    support for multicast in static environments, HLIM\nsupports host mobility (movements
    of IP multicast hosts) and network\nmobility (movements of IP multicast routers
    with/without hosts).\nSince HLIM is designed for harsh environments, reliability
    and\nsurvivability functions are also built into HLIM.\n\t "

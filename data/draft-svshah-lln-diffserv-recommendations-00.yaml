  content: "   Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in\n   traditional
    networks.  There exist well defined recommendations for\n   the use of appropriate
    differentiated service classes for different\n   types of traffic (eg. audio,
    video) in these networks.  Per-Hop\n   Behaviors are typically defined based on
    this recommendations.  With\n   emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs),
    traffic originated in a\n   LLN, such as metering, command and control, may transit
    over a\n   converged campus IP network, or even a Wide Area Network, and will\n
    \  share resources with traditional classes of traffic such as voice,\n   video
    and data.  It is important to have defined differentiated\n   services recommendations
    for LLN traffic to co-exist with traditional\n   class of traffic.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses careful resumption of congestion control parameters
    in QUIC with a cautious method that enables faster startup of new connections.
    The method uses a set of computed congestion control parameters that are based
    on the previously observed path characteristics, such as the bottleneck bandwidth,
    available capacity, or the RTT. These parameters are stored and can then used
    to modify the congestion control behaviour of a subsequent connection. The draft
    discusses assumptions around how a server ought to utilise these parameters to
    provide opportunities for a new connection to more quickly get up to speed (i.e.
    utilise available capacity). It discusses how these changes impact the capacity
    at a shared network bottleneck and the response that is needed after any indication
    that the new rate is inappropriate.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security, but filtered
    DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the reason for the
    filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide detail to end users cause harm especially
    if the blocked DNS response is to an HTTPS website. This document updates RFC
    8914 by structuring the EXTRA-TEXT field of the Extended DNS Error to provide
    details on the DNS filtering. Such details can be parsed by the client and displayed,
    logged, or used for other purposes. Other than that, this document does not change
    any thing written in RFC 8914.</p>"

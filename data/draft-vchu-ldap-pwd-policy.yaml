  content: "This  document  describes  the  implementation  of  password  policy  in\nNetscape
    \ LDAP  directories,  and  introduces  two  new  object classes,\ntwenty-three
    new attribute types, and two new  controls  in  support  of\npassword policy.\n
    \nPassword policy is a set of rules that control how passwords are used in\nLDAP
    \ directories.  In order to improve the security of LDAP directories\nand make
    it difficult for  password  cracking  programs  to  break  into\ndirectories,
    \ it  is  desirable  to  enforce  a set of rules on password\nusage. These rules
    are made to ensure that the users change their  pass-\nwords  periodically,  the
    \ new password meets construction requirements,\nthe re-use of the old password
    is restricted, and  lock  out  the  users\nafter a certain number of bad password
    attempts.\n\t "

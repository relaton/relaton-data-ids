  content: "   NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range\n
    \  of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a\n   storage
    networking fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and\n   InfiniBand.  For Ethernet-based
    networks, RDMA or TCP technology can\n   be used to transport NVMe, but the network
    management mechanism is\n   simple, and fault detection is weak.\n\n   This document
    defines the architecture of the Ethernet-based NVMe\n   control optimization technology,
    including service processes between\n   hosts, storage devices and network switches,
    and fast fault-aware\n   switchover.\n\n\n\t "

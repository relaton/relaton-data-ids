  content: "This document describes a mechanism for standby status signaling of \nredundant
    PWs between their termination points. A set of redundant \nPWs is configured between
    PE nodes in SS-PW applications, or between \nT-PE nodes in MS-PW applications.
    \ \n\nIn order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW path to \nforward
    to one another, a new status bit is needed to indicate a \npreferential forwarding
    status of active or standby for each PW in \nthe redundancy set.  \n\nIn addition,
    a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE/T-PE \nnodes to coordinate a switchover
    operation of the PW/MS-PW path. \n\n \n\nConventions used in this document \n\nThe
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n\"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \ndocument
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].\n\t "

  content: "Current resource reservation architectures for multimedia networks\n   don't
    scale well for a large number of flows. We propose a new\n   architecture that
    aggregates flows on each link in the network.\n   Therefore, the network has no
    knowledge of individual flows, and\n   resource management functions traditionally
    implemented in the\n   network (such as flow acceptance control) are delegated
    to hosts.\n\t "

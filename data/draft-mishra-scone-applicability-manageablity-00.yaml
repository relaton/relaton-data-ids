  content: "   This document identifies applicability of SCONE signal in a mobile\n
    \  network and outlines operational considerations, or manageability of\n   SCONE
    signal in the operator network.  Importantly, this document\n   also describes
    3GPP network elements that are capable of rate-\n   limiting a UDP 4-tuple to
    communicate an upper bound on achievable\n   bitrate termed \"throughput advice\"
    to implement SCONE protocol.\n\n\t "

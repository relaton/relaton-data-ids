  content: "   The Generalized PWid FEC permits a procedure know as single-sided\n
    \  signaling as documented.  In this procedure, one end of the\n   pseudowire
    always initiates the pseudowire setup and the target of\n   that label mapping
    message only signals in response.  For certain\n   applications of pseudowires
    it is advantages to configure the\n   pseudowire type (PW type) at the target
    of the initial label mapping\n   message.  This document specifies a means of
    doing this.\n\t "

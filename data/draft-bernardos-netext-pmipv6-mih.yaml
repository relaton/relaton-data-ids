  content: "The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6\nenables
    mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across\ngateways without
    changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides\nlimited multi-homing support to
    multi-mode mobile devices.\n\nWhile the basic scenario addressed by PMIPv6 considers
    MNs with just\none interface, PMIPv6 also allows an MN to connect to the same
    PMIPv6\ndomain through different interfaces.  This limited support of multi-\ninterfaced
    MNs is not fully specified, since the MAG needs to obtain/\nguess additional information
    from the MN, in order to decide whether\nto treat an MN's interface attachment
    as a handover or as new\ninterface attachment (i.e. meaning the creation of a
    new mobility\nsession and, therefore, the allocation of new home network prefixes\nto
    the MN).  The use of the Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services\nas defined
    in the IEEE 802.21-2008 specification [IEEE80221] may help\nin obtaining this
    additional information.  This I-D describes how\nPMIPv6 would work in an 802.21-enabled
    scenario, and in particular,\nanalyzes how MIH primitives can be used to help
    the MAG deal with\nmulti-technology scenarios.  The main objective of the IEEE
    802.21-\n2008 standard is to provide link layer intelligence to upper layers.\nHence,
    a more intelligent decision making capability leading to more\nreliable and efficient
    handovers between heterogeneous networks can\nbe enabled.\n\t "

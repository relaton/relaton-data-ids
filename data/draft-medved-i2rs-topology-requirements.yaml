  content: "   This document describes requirements for collecting topology data\n
    \  from network elements and other sources, creating a coherent view of\n   the
    network topology from the collected data, and presenting the\n   topology view
    to various applications that need to: a) understand the\n   topology; and, b)
    leverage topology information in order to improve\n   application specific mechanisms
    such as path selection, resources\n   reservation, etc.\n\n\n\t "

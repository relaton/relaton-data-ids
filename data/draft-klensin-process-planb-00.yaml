- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "One basic model for IETF operations is that the IESG is given general\nguidance
    in specific procedural documents but sufficient discretion\nand flexibility to
    adapt the rules and make new ones in order to make\nthe IETF work smoothly.  This
    model underlies a number of reform\nproposals, including recent ones from this
    author.  However, there\nhas been an undercurrent of suspicion from some members
    of the\ncommunity -- suspicion that the IESG is abusive of that discretion\nand
    cannot be trusted.  Those suspicions have, to some extent, been\nreinforced by
    questions about IESG-adopted procedures that seem to\ncontradict procedures approved
    by the community and documented in\nBCPs.  The community cannot move forward with
    models based on both\ntrust and distrust in the IESG's ability, and level of\nresponsibility,
    to do its job.  In an attempt to focus this part of\nthe debate, this document
    proposes to dramatically narrow IESG's\nscope of authority and discretion.\n\nIn
    particular, it proposes to move the IESG, procedurally, onto an 'anything not
    explicitly required is forbidden' model, and, indeed, a\nvery narrow and punitive
    member of that family.  While the author\nbelieves this would be a terrible idea,
    it appears to be time that\nthe community either focuses on it and moves in this
    direction or\nstops wasting time hinting about it.\n\t "

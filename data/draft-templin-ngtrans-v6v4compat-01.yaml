  content: "This document specifies an IPv6-IPv4 compatibility aggregatable\nglobal
    unicast address format and its application for incremental\nIPv6 deployment for
    hosts and routers within predominantly IPv4-based\nIntranets. This document assumes
    that, during the IPv4 to IPv6 co-\nexistence and transition phase, many sites
    will deploy IPv6\nincrementally (not all at once) on hosts and routers within
    their\npre-existing IPv4 interior routing domains; especially those sites\nwhich
    have large and complex pre-existing IPv4 infrastructures. In\nsuch cases, the
    address format and methods described in this document\nwill enable IPv6 deployment
    for hosts and routers which do not share\na common multiple access datalink with
    their default IPv6 gateways.\n\t "

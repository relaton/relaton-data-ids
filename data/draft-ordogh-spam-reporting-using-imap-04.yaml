  content: "   This document defines an IMAP extension which allows a client to\n
    \  report spam by reference and allows an IMAP server to perform any\n   action
    on the reported messages, including leaving the action at the\n   client's discretion.\n\n
    \  In addition, this document discusses how an IMAP server can tap into\n   spam
    aggregator services, ultimately allowing the IMAP server to\n   improve its decision-making
    process.\n\nConventions Used In This Document\n\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\"
    indicate lines sent by the client or the\n   server, respectively.\n\t "

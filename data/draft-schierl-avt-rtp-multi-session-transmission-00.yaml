  content: "In this draft, we discuss problems related to multi-session and\nmulti-source
    transmission using the Real-Time Transport Protocol\n(RTP).  Most of the input
    to this draft is taken from email\ndiscussion.  Multi-session and multi-source
    transmission is motivated\nby media data which allows for different transport
    layer treatment of\nparts of the media.  This is typically the case for layered
    media.\nMulti-session transmission is when media data from a single media\nsource
    is split over multiple RTP sessions.  Single-session multi-\nsource transmission
    (from now on just called \"multi-source\ntransmission\") is when data from a single
    media source is sent as\nseveral RTP streams in the same RTP session.  The main
    problems\ndiscussed are the mechanisms used for data alignment and source\ncorrelation.
    \ This draft gives further an overview of payload formats\nusing multi-sessions/multi-source
    transmission and highlights other\ntransport related issues.  The draft concludes
    with recommendations\nfor the discussed problems.\n\t "

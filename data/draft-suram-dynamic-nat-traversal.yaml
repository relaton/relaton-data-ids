  content: "   NAT can be enabled on a Security Gateway by administrator at any\n
    \  point of time.  This can be called as Dynamic NAT.  The existing\n   IKEv2
    RFC does not address the scenario of NAT being enabled on a\n   security gateway
    after IKEv2 negotiation.  In such a scenario,\n   traffic sent over the IPsec
    SA will either be dropped or does not\n   reach the peer security gateway.  This
    document defines a method to\n   ensure that IPsec traffic flow seamlessly in
    such a scenario.\n\n\n\t "

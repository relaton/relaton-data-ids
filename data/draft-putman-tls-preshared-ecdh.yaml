  content: "   This document defines a new mutual authentication method for the\n
    \  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2.  The\n   authentication
    method requires that the client and server are each\n   pre-provisioned with a
    unique asymmetric Elliptic Curve Diffie-\n   Hellman (ECDH) keypair and with the
    public ECDH key of the peer.  The\n   handshake provides ephemeral ECDH keys,
    and a premaster key is agreed\n   using Double- or Triple-ECDH; confirmation of
    possession of this key\n   provides mutual authentication.  Multiple new cipher
    suites which use\n   this authentication method are specified.\n\n\t "

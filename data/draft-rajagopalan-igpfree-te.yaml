- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "        This draft proposes that routing mechanisms in support of\n        traffic
    engineering be developed independent of specific IGPs.\n        A modular constraint-based
    routing overlay approach is suggested\n        and its components are briefly
    described.\n\n\t "

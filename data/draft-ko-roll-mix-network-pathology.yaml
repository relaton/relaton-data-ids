  content: RPL Routing Pathology In a Network With a Mix of Nodes Operating in Storing
    and Non-Storing Modes

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The RPL specification allows nodes running with storing or non-\n   storing
    modes to operate in the same network.  We describe how such a\n   mix can result
    in network partitioning even when there are plenty of\n   physical links available
    in the network.  The partitioning affects\n   both upwards (nodes to root) and
    downwards (root to leaf) traffic.\n   This routing pathology stems from a recommendation
    made in the RPL\n   specification forcing nodes with different modes of operation
    to join\n   the RPL network as leaf nodes only.  We propose a solution that\n
    \  modifies RPL by mandating that all the nodes parse and interpret\n   source
    routing headers and storing mode nodes to sometimes act like a\n   non-storing
    mode root by attaching source routing headers.\n\n\t "

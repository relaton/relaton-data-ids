  content: "   This memo describes the Control Protocol used between a Network\n   Access
    Server (NAS) and a Signaling Gateway (SG). The requirements of\n   this protocol
    are Call Control, Circuit Maintenance and Resource\n   Management.  This protocol
    must be reliable in nature and support\n   redundant links between the NAS and
    SG. It's important to note that\n   the NAS could be handling either packetized
    voice or data for access\n   to the Internet.\n\n\t "

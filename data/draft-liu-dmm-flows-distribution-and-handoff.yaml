  content: "   This document has a normative description of the service flow\n   management
    technology based on mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). It makes the\n   upgrade of management
    model in MIPv6 from the entire node granularity\n   to the single service flow
    granularity. It proposes a distributed\n   mobility management solution, DMIPv6,
    which is compatible with MIPv6\n   and takes different mobility management strategies
    according to the\n   Correspondent Node's position, network conditions and service\n
    \  requirements of different service flows so as to achieve the service\n   flow
    handoff and transmission path control. The standard also\n   provides route optimization
    mechanism between the Mobile Node and the\n   ordinary Correspondent Node that
    doesn't support mobile IPv6.\n\n\t "

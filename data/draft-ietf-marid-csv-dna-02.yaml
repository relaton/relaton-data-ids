  content: "Increased diversity and abuse of access, across the open Internet,\n   mandates
    additional accountability for sending SMTP clients, in the\n   absence of prior,
    direct arrangement with receiving SMTP servers.\n   One means for enabling this
    is by registration with third-party\n   services that vouch for the policies and
    accountability of SMTP\n   clients accessing SMTP servers.  This specification
    defines a means\n   for an SMTP client to list third-party services that are prepared
    to\n   vouch for it, and a means for an SMTP server, or its intermediary, to\n
    \  query vouching services.\n\t "

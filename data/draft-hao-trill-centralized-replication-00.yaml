  content: "   In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue may\n
    \  occur when pseduonode nickname mechanism in [TRILLPN] is used. This\n   draft
    is to solve RPF check failure issue through centralized\n   replication for BUM
    traffic solution. The basic idea is that all\n   ingress RBs send BUM traffic
    to a centralized node through unicast\n   TRILL encapsulation, the centralized
    node decapsulates the unicast\n   TRILL packet. Then the centralized node searches
    its multicast\n   forwarding table to replicates a copy of the BUM traffic to\n
    \  destination RBs through TRILL unicast encapsulation. Through\n   centralized
    replication solution, only unicast forwarding behavior is\n   required between
    edge RB and centralized RB, so no RPF check function\n   is required on any device
    in TRILL campus through centralized\n   replication solution and no RPF check
    failure issue occurs.\n\n\t "

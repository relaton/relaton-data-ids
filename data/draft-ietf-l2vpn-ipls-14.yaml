  script: Latn
  content: "   A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is used to interconnect\n   systems
    across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it\n   appear that they
    are on a private LAN.  The systems which are\n   interconnected may themselves
    be LAN switches.  If, however, they\n   are IP hosts or IP routers, certain simplifications
    to the operation\n   of the VPLS are possible.  We call this simplified type of
    VPLS an\n   \"IP-only LAN Service\" (IPLS).  In an IPLS, as in a VPLS, LAN\n   interfaces
    are run in promiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded\n   based on their destination
    MAC addresses.  However, the maintenance\n   of the MAC forwarding tables is done
    via signaling, rather than via\n   the MAC address learning procedures specified
    in [IEEE 802.1D].\n   This draft specifies the protocol extensions and procedures
    for\n   support of the IPLS service.\n\n   The original intent was to provide
    an alternate solution to VPLS\n   for those PE routers that were not capable of
    learning MAC address\n   through data plane. This became non-issue with newer
    hardware.\n   The concepts put forth by this draft are still valuable and are\n
    \  adopted in one form or other by newer work such as Ethernet VPN\n   in L2VPN
    Working Group and possible data center applications. At\n   this point, no further
    action is planned to update this document\n   and is published simply as a historic
    record of the ideas.\n\n\t "

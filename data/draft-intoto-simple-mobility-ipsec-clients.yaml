  content: "One very popular use of VPNs is to provide telecommuter access to \nthe
    corporate Intranet. Remote clients that are behind NAT boxes \ncan also access
    the corporate intranet with the help of the\nstandard NAT Traversal feature.\n\nBut
    this access may be disturbed in scenarios where a mobile user\nroams across different
    points of attachment and there by getting\nassigned with different IP Addresses.
    The access also fails in \ncases where the client roams across environments with
    NAT\nto environments without NAT and vice versa. In both the cases \nthe tunnel
    may get re-established but it induces jitter in voice\nsessions.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents an approach to tunnelling SRT live streams\n
    \  over QUIC datagrams.\n\n   QUIC [RFC9000] is a UDP-based transport protocol
    providing TLS\n   encryption, stream multiplexing, and connection migration.  It
    was\n   designed to become a faster alternative to the TCP protocol\n   [RFC7323].\n\n
    \  An Unreliable Datagram Extension to QUIC [QUIC-DATAGRAM] adds support\n   for
    sending and receiving unreliable datagrams over a QUIC\n   connection, but transfers
    the responsibility for multiplexing\n   different kinds of datagrams, or flows
    of datagrams, to an\n   application protocol.\n\n   SRT [SRTRFC] is a UDP-based
    transport protocol.  Essentially, it can\n   operate over any unreliable datagram
    transport.  SRT provides loss\n   recovery and stream multiplexing mechanisms.
    \ In its live streaming\n   configuration SRT provides an end-to-end latency-aware
    mechanism for\n   packet loss recovery.  If SRT fails to recover a packet loss
    within a\n   specified latency, then the packet is dropped to avoid blocking\n
    \  playback of further packets.\n\n   The Datagram Extension to QUIC could be
    used as an underlying\n   transport instead of UDP.  This way QUIC would provide
    TLS-level\n   security, connection migration, and potentially multi-path support.\n
    \  It would be easier for existing network facilities to process, route,\n   and
    load balance the unified QUIC traffic.  SRT on its side would\n   provide end-to-end
    latency tracking and latency-aware loss recovery.\n\n\t "

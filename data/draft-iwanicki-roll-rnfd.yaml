- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   By and large, a correct operation of a RPL network requires border\n
    \  routers to be up.  In many applications, it is beneficial for the\n   nodes
    to detect a crash of a border router as soon as possible to\n   trigger fallback
    actions.  This document describes RNFD, an extension\n   to RPL that expedites
    border router failure detection, even by an\n   order of magnitude, by having
    nodes collaboratively monitor the\n   status of a given border router.  The extension
    introduces an\n   additional state at each node, a new type of RPL Control Message\n
    \  Options for synchronizing this state among different nodes, and the\n   coordination
    algorithm itself.\n\n\t "

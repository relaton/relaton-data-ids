  script: Latn
  content: "A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks, e.g., Wi-Fi,
    LTE, 5G, and DSL.  It is desirable to seamlessly combine the connectivity over
    these networks below the transport layer (L4) to improve the quality of experience
    for applications that do not have built-in multi-path capabilities.  Such optimization
    requires additional control information, e.g., a sequence number, in each packet.
    \ This document presents a new lightweight and flexible encapsulation protocol
    for this need.  The solution has been developed by the authors based on their
    experiences in multiple standards bodies including the IETF and 3GPP.  However,
    this document is not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus
    opinion of the IETF.  This document will enable other developers to build interoperable
    implementations in order to experiment with the protocol.\n\t "

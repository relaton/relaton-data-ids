  content: "This document describes the usage of Service Codes by the Datagram \n
    \  Congestion Control Protocol, RFC 4340. Service Codes provide a method \n   to
    identify the intended service/application to process a DCCP \n   Connection Request.
    This provides improved flexibility in the use and \n   assignment of port numbers
    for connection multiplexing. The DCCP \n   Service Code can also enable more explicit
    coordination of services \n   behind NATs and firewalls. This document motivates
    the setting of \n   Service Codes by applications, rather than assigning a default
    \n   Service Code value of zero.\n\t "

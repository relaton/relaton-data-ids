  content: "This document specifies a new address family to be used for sockets\nthat
    are bound to more than one IP address, as motivated by the\nMultipath TCP work
    in the IETF.  The goal is to use the same set of\nfunction calls as traditionally,
    but by new address family make it\npossible for them to express multiple addresses
    to connect or bind\nto.  The document gives a high-level definition of the behavior
    of\nthe traditional function calls, but a detailed specification of the\nAPI syntax
    is not in the scope of this document.\n\t "

  content: "Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) maps service identifiers and location
    information to service contact URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover available
    services for a particular location, it will perform a <listServicesByLocation>
    query to the LoST server.  However, the LoST server, in its response, does not
    provide context information; that is, it does not provide any additional information
    about the geographical region within which the returned list of services is considered
    valid.  Therefore, this document defines a Service List Boundary that returns
    a local context along with the list of services returned, in order to assist the
    client in not missing a change in available services when moving.  This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

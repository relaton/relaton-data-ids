  content: "   This document provides general overarching guidelines for control and\n
    \  management of packet over optical converged networks and focuses on\n   operators'
    use cases with requirements and network topologies.  It\n   provides a set of
    use cases and requirements which are needed to\n   achieve full automation for
    control and management of the packet over\n   optical networks which comprise
    devices with mixes of packet and\n   optical functions where the optical functions
    may be provided on\n   coherent pluggables.\n\n   It is intended that other IETF
    drafts in this area reference this\n   draft and abide by the use cases and requirements
    in this draft.\n\n   The realization of these use cases is out of scope of this
    draft and\n   shall be covered in other IETF drafts.\n\n\t "

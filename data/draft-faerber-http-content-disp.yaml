  content: "   [RFC2183] introduces a Content-Disposition header field for Internet\n
    \  Mail Messages to transmit presentation information as well as a\n   suggested
    file name for saving the content to disk and the file's\n   date information.\n
    \n   All of this information is missing from HTTP entities [RFC2068].\n   However,
    there is nothing that would prevent the use of the Content-\n   Disposition header
    with this HTTP.\n \n   Without being standard, the Content-Disposition header
    has already\n   been introduced by some software products. [HTTP1.1-REV] documents\n
    \  this practice, based on [RFC1806].\n \n   This memo also extends the specification
    to cover [RFC2183] and\n   corrects the common abuse of the Content-Type header
    to cover\n   presentation information.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document is a submission to the SNMPv2 Working Group of the IETF.
    \ It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects such that an SNMPv2
    entity can be configured via SNMP operations to control what access rights are
    granted to a particular entity, given the identity of that entity as determined
    by a security protocol.                               The MIB described in this
    document provides objects which can be used to configure access rights for multiple
    types of management operations, including configuration of proxy operations.                                                                                                          This
    updated version of the document is the output of the SNMPv2* meeting held in Dallas
    on Friday, December 8th, 1995.  This updated version contains change bars to highlight
    the differences.\n\t "

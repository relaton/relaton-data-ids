  content: "This document lays out general definitions of and mechanisms for establishing
    Uniform Resource Names (URN) \"namespaces\".  The URN WG has defined a syntax
    for URNs in RFC 2141, as well as some proposed mechanisms for their resolution
    and use in Internet applications in RFC 3401 and RFC 3405.  The whole rests on
    the concept of individual \"namespaces\" within the URN structure.  Apart from
    proof-of-concept namespaces, the use of existing identifiers in URNs has been
    discussed in RFC 2288.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

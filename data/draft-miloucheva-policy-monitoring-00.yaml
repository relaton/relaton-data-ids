  content: "In order to enhance the policy provisioning and QoS guarantees, \n   policy
    \ monitoring and context learning facilities are used.\n   This document is focussed
    on facilities for monitoring and learning\n   of context integrated in autonomous
    policy management system for \n   enhanced user-centric Quality of Service (QoS)
    guarantees in\n   heterogeneous Internet environment.     \n   The autonomous
    policy management includes components aimed \n   at automation of QoS policy specification,
    provisioning and \n   adaptation based on common policy repository.\n   Integration
    of monitoring and context learning facilities allows\n   to consider measurement
    and context data for more efficient \n   policy provisioning and adaptation.\n
    \  The goal is to collect measurement and context information, in order\n   to
    support automated policy decision and adaptation of actor's policies,\n   when
    specific events (patterns) are detected in a given network context.\n\n\t "

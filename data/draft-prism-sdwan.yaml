- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies PRISM, an application-aware traffic steering\n
    \  protocol for Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN).  PRISM\n   provides
    deep application identification, per-flow tracking, Service\n   Level Agreement
    (SLA) enforcement, and policy-based path selection\n   integration with Segment
    Routing over IPv6 (SRv6).\n\n   PRISM is designed as a companion protocol to CONDUIT
    (Cryptographic\n   Orchestration of Network Distributed Underlay for IPsec Transport),\n
    \  together providing a complete open-standard SD-WAN solution.  CONDUIT\n   manages
    the encrypted tunnel fabric while PRISM provides the\n   application intelligence
    and policy enforcement.\n\n   The protocol is fully programmable via gRPC, supports
    distributed and\n   centralized deployment models, and mandates compliance with\n
    \  Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 (CNSA 2.0)\n   cryptographic
    requirements.\n\n\t "

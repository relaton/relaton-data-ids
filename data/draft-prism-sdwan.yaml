abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies PRISM, an application-aware traffic steering
    protocol for Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN). PRISM provides deep
    application identification, per-flow tracking, Service Level Agreement (SLA) enforcement,
    and policy-based path selection integration with Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6).
    PRISM is designed as a companion protocol to CONDUIT (Cryptographic Orchestration
    of Network Distributed Underlay for IPsec Transport), together providing a complete
    open-standard SD-WAN solution. CONDUIT manages the encrypted tunnel fabric while
    PRISM provides the application intelligence and policy enforcement. The protocol
    is fully programmable via gRPC, supports distributed and centralized deployment
    models, and mandates compliance with Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite
    2.0 (CNSA 2.0) cryptographic requirements.</p>"

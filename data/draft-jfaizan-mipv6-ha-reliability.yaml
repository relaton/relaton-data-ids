  content: "In Mobile-IPv6, Mobile Node is dependent on a single Home Agent for \nthe
    seamless roaming over the Internet. Mobile-IPv6 also allows  \ndeployment of multiple
    Home Agents on the subnet for providing \ncontinuous service to Mobile Node in
    case of serving Home Agent \nfailure. But switching of service from the failed
    Home Agent to \nanother functional Home Agent on the Home Subnet is problematic
    and \nthe base Mobile-IPv6 specifications does not currently have\nwell-described
    solutions. This document aims to describe and \nillustrate these problems, and
    propose some guidelines for possible \nsolutions.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes many features of the proposals for the successor\nto
    IKEv1. The purpose of the document is to help the IPsec Working Group\ndecide
    which features they want for the next protocol. The document\nfocuses on how those
    features are instantiated in two proposals, IKEv2\nand JFK, but other ideas for
    features and options are also included.\nMost of the material in this document
    comes from many of the authors of\nthe JFK and IKEv2 proposals.\nThis document
    is meant to help the Working Group choose which features\nit finds important for
    the successor to IKE. It should be short-lived\nand is not expected to become
    an RFC.\n\n\n\nThis document is meant to help the Working Group choose which features\nit

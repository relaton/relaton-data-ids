  content: "   This position paper introduces an architecture of opening the\n   operator's
    security capability to third party smart object\n   applications.  With this architecture,
    the authentication, integrity\n   and encryption capabilities can be wrapped up
    as Application\n   Programming Interfaces and provided to third party application\n
    \  developers.  So the third party applications do not have to spare\n   energy
    on these basic security functionalities.  As a consequence,\n   the barrier for
    new applications is lowered, and it avoids the need\n   of providing security
    by multiple applications and hence saves the\n   computing and communication resources
    on constrained nodes.\n\n   Note: This document is submitted for the IAB Workshop
    on Smart Object\n   Security on March 23, 2012, Paris.\n\n\t "

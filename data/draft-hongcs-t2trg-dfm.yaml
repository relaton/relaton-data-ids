  content: "Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have increased\nthe use of
    sensing technologies for IoT applications. However,\nmonitoring sensor nodes is
    still a challenging issue in\ndistributed remote environments, especially wireless
    environments.\nDifferent from conventional centralized mechanism, Fog Computing\nbecomes
    an essential role in a scalable IoT system. Fog Node can\ncontrol and monitor
    its subdomain's devices and perform aggregation\ntasks to support the central
    server at the cloud. Since node\nfault detection can strongly affect the performance
    and accuracy\nin most IoT analysis applications, fault detection mechanism\nshould
    be integrated into IoT Networks. Accordingly, these\nfault nodes could be detected
    and replaced by others available\nnodes in the same domain for the analysis by
    a distributed\nfault detection and node replacement mechanism based on their\nsensory
    values in a considered domain.\n\n\t "

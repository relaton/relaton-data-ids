  script: Latn
  content: "   BGP[RFC4271], was originally designed to provide reachability between\n
    \  domains and between the edges of a domain.  As such, BGP assumes the\n   next
    hop towards any reachable destination may not reside on the\n   advertising speaker,
    but rather may either be through a router\n   connected to the same subnet as
    the speaker, or through a router only\n   reachable by traversing multiple hops
    through the network.  Because\n   of this, as per [RFC4291] - BGP does not recognize
    IPv6 link-local\n   addresses, as a valid next hop for the forwarding purposes.\n\n
    \  However, in many current deplyments, BGP peering is often deployed on\n   point-to-point
    links in networks where multihop reachability of any\n   kind is not assumed or
    desired (all next hops are assumed to be the\n   speaker reachable through a directly
    connected point-to-point link).\n   This is common, for instance, in data center
    fabrics[RFC7938].  In\n   these situations, a global IPv6 address is not required
    for the\n   advertisement of reachability information; in fact, providing global\n
    \  IPv6 addresses in these kinds of networks can be detrimental to Zero\n   Touch
    Provisioning (ZTP).\n\n   This draft standardizes the operation of BGP over a
    point-to-point\n   link using link-local IPv6 addressing only.\n\n   Since link-local
    IPv6 addresses are not required to be globally\n   unique, implementations must
    ensure that they are strictly associated\n   with a specific interface.\n\n\t "

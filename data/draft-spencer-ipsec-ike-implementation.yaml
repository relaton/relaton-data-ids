  content: "The current IPsec specifications for key exchange and connection\nmanagement,
    RFCs 2408 [ISAKMP] and 2409 [IKE], leave many aspects of\nconnection management
    unspecified, most prominently rekeying\npractices.  Pending clarifications in
    future revisions of the\nspecifications, this document sets down some successful
    experiences,\nto minimize the extent to which new implementors have to rely on\nunwritten
    folklore.\n\t "

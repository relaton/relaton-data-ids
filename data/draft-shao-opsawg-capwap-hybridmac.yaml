- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local\n
    \  MAC (medium access control), which has been described in\n   [RFC5415].There
    are many functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that\n   have not yet been clearly
    defined whether they belong to either the\n   AP (Access Point) or the AC (Access
    Controller)in the Split and Local\n   modes.  Because different vendors have their
    own definition of these\n   two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC layer
    functions\n   continue to be mapped differently to either the AP or AC.  If there\n
    \  is no clear definition of split MAC and local MAC, then operators\n   will
    not only need to perform vendor specific configurations in their\n   network but
    will continue to experience difficulty in interoperating\n   APs and ACs from
    different vendors.\n\n\t "

  content: "\n   The PMIPv6 protocol provides local mobility to a mobile node without\n
    \  its involvement in mobility management.  To provide session\n   continuity
    without involvement of the mobile node, MAG and LMA\n   maintain forwarding information
    for the mobile node's HNP.  If the\n   mobile node is a mobile router and the
    PMIPv6 domain is a home\n   network of it, the MAG and LMA should also have forwarding
    state for\n   MNP.  This memo describes several NEMO related issues including
    this.\n\n\t "

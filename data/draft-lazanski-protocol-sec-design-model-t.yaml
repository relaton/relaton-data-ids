  content: "   This document is a non-exhaustive set of considerations for protocol\n
    \  designers and implementers with regards to attack defence. This\n   document
    follows on from the way forward outlined in draft-lazanski-\n   users-threat-model-t-04.
    These considerations both supplement and\n   support the work on threat models.
    They can be used as an aid to\n   analyse protocol design choice and in turn to
    help combat threats\n   and defend users of these protocols and systems against
    malicious\n   attacks.\n\n   First, we list well-known classes of attacks that
    pose threats, with\n   relevant case studies and descriptions. Next, we give a
    list of\n   defence measures against these attacks to be considered when\n   designing
    and deploying protocols. Naturally, deployments of\n   protocols vary greatly
    between use cases; therefore, some attacks\n   and defensive measures outlined
    may require more consideration than\n   others, dependent on use case.\n\n   This
    RFC can be used by protocol designers to write the Security\n   Considerations
    section in an RFC. The impact on attack defence of a\n   protocol should be considered
    in multiple use cases across the\n   multiple layers of the internet. Defence
    against malicious attacks\n   can be improved and it can be weakened by design
    features of\n   protocols. Designers should acknowledge the role of protocols
    in\n   attack prevention, detection and mitigation; this document aims to\n   be
    a useful guide in doing so.\n\n\t "

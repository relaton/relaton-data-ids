  script: Latn
  content: "[1] describes how to encode an MPLS label stack as a ''shim'' between\n
    \  the data link and network layer headers of a labeled frame, but [1]\n   does
    not require that this encoding be used to encode the top of the\n   label stack
    on LAN media.  This document examines the alternative\n   encapsulations that
    have been proposed for LANs.  One alternative is\n   to use the shim as the MPLS
    encapsulation on LAN interfaces [2].\n   Another alternative is to encode the
    top label in the MAC header,\n   rather than in the shim [3].  We describe the
    implications of each\n   approach.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP packets\n
    \  for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable\n   throughput
    (L4S).  It is similar to the original (or 'Classic')\n   Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN).  'Classic' ECN marking was\n   required to be equivalent to a drop, both
    when applied in the network\n   and when responded to by a transport.  Unlike
    'Classic' ECN marking,\n   the network applies the L4S identifier more immediately
    and more\n   aggressively than drop, and the transport response to each mark is\n
    \  reduced and smoothed relative to that for drop.  The two changes\n   counterbalance
    each other so that the bit-rate of an L4S flow will be\n   roughly the same as
    a 'Classic' flow under the same conditions.\n   However, the much more frequent
    control signals and the finer\n   responses to them result in ultra-low queuing
    delay without\n   compromising link utilization, even during high load.  Examples
    of\n   new active queue management (AQM) marking algorithms and examples of\n
    \  new transports (whether TCP-like or real-time) are specified\n   separately.
    \ The new L4S identifier is the key piece that enables\n   them to interwork and
    distinguishes them from 'Classic' traffic.  It\n   gives an incremental migration
    path so that existing 'Classic' TCP\n   traffic will be no worse off, but it can
    be prevented from degrading\n   the ultra-low delay and loss of the new scalable
    transports.\n\n\t "

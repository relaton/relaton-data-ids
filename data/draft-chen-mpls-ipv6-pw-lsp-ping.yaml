  content: "   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping\n
    \  and Traceroute mechanisms are commonly used to detect and isolate\n   data
    plane failures in all MPLS LSPs including Pseudowire (PW) LSPs.\n   The PW LSP
    Ping and Traceroute elements, however, are not specified\n   for IPv6 address
    usage.\n\n   This document extends the PW LSP Ping and Traceroute mechanisms so\n
    \  they can be used with IPv6 PWs, and updates RFC 4379.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes Connectivity Verification (CV) Types using Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection (BFD) with Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV).
    \ VCCV provides a control channel that is associated with a pseudowire (PW), as
    well as the corresponding operations and management functions such as connectivity
    verification to be used over that control channel. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

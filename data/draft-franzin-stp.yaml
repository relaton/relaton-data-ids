abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The Symbol Transport Protocol (STP) proposes a novel data\n   representation
    and transport method that replaces raw byte\n   sequences with symbol-based pattern
    acceleration. By identifying\n   and transmitting recurring data structures as
    symbols instead of\n   explicit bytes, STP seeks to reduce bandwidth, improve
    latency,\n   and enhance efficiency across structured and semi-structured data\n
    \  domains.\n\n\t "

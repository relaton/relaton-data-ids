abstract:
- content: "<p>The Symbol Transport Protocol (STP) proposes a novel data representation
    and transport method that replaces raw byte sequences with symbol-based pattern
    acceleration. By identifying and transmitting recurring data structures as symbols
    instead of explicit bytes, STP seeks to reduce bandwidth, improve latency, and
    enhance efficiency across structured and semi-structured data domains.</p>"

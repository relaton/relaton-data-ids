  content: "This document defines mechanisms for providing all IP address \nresource
    records (specifically including any A and AAAA resource \nrecords) in DNS response
    messages. Specifically, this document \ndefines an 'ADDR' query-type which allows
    a system to issue a \nsingle lookup for all of the addressing resource records
    \nassociated with a domain name (explicitly including any IPv4 and \nIPv6 resource
    records), and also defines an algorithm for DNS \nservers to use when returning
    supplemental address data in the \nadditional-data section of a response message.

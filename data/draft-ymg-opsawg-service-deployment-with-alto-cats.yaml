  content: "   The deployment of service instances across distributed interconnected\n
    \  edge-cloud environments can be optimized in terms of performance\n   expectations
    and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) satisfaction when\n   performed taken into
    account both network and compute metrics.  In\n   order to do so, this document
    primarily concentrates on existing\n   standardized mechanisms, namely ALTO and
    CATS, to facilitate such\n   integration of metrics.  The ALTO protocol can be
    extended to expose\n   compute metrics from a cloud manager to a network orchestrator
    or as\n   part of the network and cost maps, enabling improved deployment of\n
    \  compute service instances based on joint awareness of both network\n   and
    computing information.  This document proposes protocol\n   extensions, workflows,
    and operational considerations for ALTO\n   enhancements using CATS metrics.\n\n\t "

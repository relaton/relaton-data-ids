abstract:
- content: "<p>The deployment of service instances across distributed interconnected
    edge-cloud environments can be optimized in terms of performance expectations
    and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) satisfaction when performed taken into account
    both network and compute metrics. In order to do so, this document primarily concentrates
    on existing standardized mechanisms, namely ALTO and CATS, to facilitate such
    integration of metrics. The ALTO protocol can be extended to expose compute metrics
    from a cloud manager to a network orchestrator or as part of the network and cost
    maps, enabling improved deployment of compute service instances based on joint
    awareness of both network and computing information. This document proposes protocol
    extensions, workflows, and operational considerations for ALTO enhancements using
    CATS metrics.</p>"

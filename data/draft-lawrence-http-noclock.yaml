  content: "This memo describes a problem with the current Proposed Standard for HTTP/1.1
    found as a result of implementation experience.  A web server may be implemented
    in an embedded system as a network user interface.  Often the embedded system
    is one which has no other use for a real-time clock, and/or the web interface
    is being added to an existing device which has no clock.  Without a clock, no
    accurate HTTP Date header can be generated.    This memo examines the implications
    of this situation for the operation of HTTP/1.1 origin servers, proxies, and clients,
    and proposes changes to the HTTP/1.1 specification to permit compliant operation
    in such systems.\n\t "

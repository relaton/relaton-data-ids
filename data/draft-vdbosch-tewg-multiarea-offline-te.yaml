- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes an approach to engineer a hierarchical \nnetwork
    by means of offline traffic engineering. This approach can \nbe used as a stand-alone
    solution, as was recently described as an \nexample of a best current practice,
    or it may be combined with \nonline traffic engineering. The offline approach
    presented here uses \nglobal information about network topology and traffic matrix
    to \noptimize explicit routes in the network. The optimization is based \non the
    definition of global network performance parameters. \n\n\t "

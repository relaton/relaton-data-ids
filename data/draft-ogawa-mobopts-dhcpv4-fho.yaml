  content: "   When a standard IPv4 node (mobile node: MN) changes its wireless \n
    \  network attachment point (performs a handover), it gets new IP layer \n   configuration
    information (e.g., its new IP address and the addresses \n   of new routers) from
    a DHCP server and changes its IP layer \n   configuration. During such a handover
    process, it cannot send or \n   receive IP packets to/from its corresponding node
    (CN), so a service \n   disruption is caused. In this document, we introduce new
    DHCPv4 \n   extensions and an option (Fast Handover Option) for fast handovers.
    \n   This protocol is ported from \"DHCPv6 options for Fast Handovers\" [6]. \n
    \  It enables DHCP servers to send new configuration information to MNs \n   before
    a handover to be used after the handover, so MNs can have \n   shorter handover
    processing times. It is noted that DHCP servers and \n   MNs implementing this
    protocol can achieve fast handovers with \n   standard IPv4 routers without any
    other micro-mobility management \n   protocols. \n\t "

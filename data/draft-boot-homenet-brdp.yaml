  content: "   This document describes the Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP)\n
    \  and all of its related components.  BRDP enables multi-homing for\n   small
    to medium sites, including Homenets, using Provider\n   Aggregatable IPv6 addresses.
    \ It describes a mechanism for automated\n   IP address configuration and renumbering,
    a mechanism for optimized\n   source address selection and a new paradigm for
    packet forwarding,\n   for support of multi-homed sites.  BRDP prevents ingress
    filtering\n   problems with multi-homed sites and supports load-balancing for\n
    \  multi-path transport protocols.  This work also prevents routing\n   scalability
    problems in the provider network and Internet Default\n   Free Zone because small
    to medium multi-homed size sites would not\n   need to request Provider Independent
    address blocks.\n\n\t "

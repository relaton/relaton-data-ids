  content: "   This document specifies a TCP Option called EchoCookie.  It provides\n
    \  a single field that a TCP server can use to store opaque cookie data\n   'in
    flight' rather than in memory.  As new TCP options are defined,\n   they can require
    that implementations support the EchoCookie option.\n   Then if a server's SYN
    queue is under pressure from a SYN flooding\n   attack, it can ask clients to
    echo its connection state in their\n   acknowledgement.  This facility is similar
    to the classic SYN Cookie,\n   but it provides enough space for connection state
    associated with TCP\n   options.  In contrast, the classic location for a SYN
    Cookie only\n   provides enough space for a degraded encoding of the Maximum Segment\n
    \  Size (MSS) TCP option and no others.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export Information\n
    \  Elements to export the context and outcome of Source Address\n   Validation
    enforcement data.  These SAV-specific Information Elements\n   provide detailed
    insight into why packets are identified as spoofed\n   by capturing the specific
    SAV rules that triggered validation\n   decisions.  This operational visibility
    is essential for network\n   operators to verify SAV effectiveness, audit rule
    correctness, and\n   analyze source address spoofing events.\n\n\t "

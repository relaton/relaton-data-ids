  content: "This memo describes the security framework for the Instant\nMessaging
    and Presence Protocols.  It identifies the entities that\nuse IMPP protocol elements,
    the trust relationships between them,\nsecurity threats that are against which
    defence is to be provided,\nand the consequent security responsibilities of the
    active\nentities.  Specific cryptographic and other security mechanisms are\nNOT
    defined here.\nNOTE:  The security framework for IMPP is inherently bound up with\nthe
    IMPP protocol design, and this memo is expected to evolve as\ndecisions are made
    about the protocol design.  In its current form,\nthis memo makes some assumptions
    about the IMPP structure that must\nbe reviewed as design proceeds.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the ChaMeLeon (CML) routing protocol\ndesigned
    for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) supporting emergency\ncommunications. CML
    is a hybrid and adaptive routing protocol\noperating within a defined disaster
    area denoted as the Critical\nArea (CA). The main concept behind CML is the adaptability
    of its\nrouting mechanisms towards changes in the physical and logical state\nof
    a MANET. For autonomous emergency communications, there is a\nlikelihood that
    the network size will vary whenever more rescuers\njoin or leave the network.
    In addition, battery exhaustion of\nlightweight mobile communication devices used
    by rescuers could\nstipulate another reason for changes in the network size. Hence,\nthis
    version of CML adapts its routing behavior according to changes\nin the network
    size within a pre-defined CA. For small networks, CML\nroutes data proactively
    using the Optimized Link State Routing\n(OLSR) protocol whereas for larger networks
    it utilizes the reactive\nAd hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol
    so that\noverall routing performance is improved. These transitions occur via\nthe
    CML oscillation phase. This document focuses on the description\nof the processes
    involved in the CML Cognitive and Adaptive Module\n(CAM), CML Oscillation phase
    and transition between phases.\n\t "

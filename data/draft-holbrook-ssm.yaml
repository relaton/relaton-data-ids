  content: "IP addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) range are\ndesignated
    as source-specific multicast (SSM) destination addresses and\nare reserved for
    use by source-specific applications and protocols\n[IANA-ALLOCATION].  This document
    defines the semantics of source-\nspecific multicast addresses and specifies the
    policies governing their\nuse.  It defines an extension to the Internet network
    service that\napplies to datagrams sent to SSM addresses and defines the host\nextensions
    to support this service.\n\nAppendix I of this document describes changes to the
    Internet Group\nManagement Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) [IGMPv3] to support source-\nspecific
    multicast.\n\t "

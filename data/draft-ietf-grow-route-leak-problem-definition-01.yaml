  content: "   A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing\n   system,
    known as 'route leaks', has received significant attention in\n   recent years.
    \ Frequent incidents that result in significant\n   disruptions to Internet routing
    are labeled \"route leaks\", but to\n   date we have lacked a common definition
    of the term.  In this\n   document, we provide a working definition of route leaks,
    keeping in\n   mind the real occurrences that have received significant attention.\n
    \  Further, we attempt to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different\n   types
    of route leaks based on observed events on the Internet.  We\n   aim to provide
    a taxonomy that covers several forms of route leaks\n   that have been observed
    and are of concern to Internet user community\n   as well as the network operator
    community.\n\n\t "

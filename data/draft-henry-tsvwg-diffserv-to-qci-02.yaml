  content: "   As communication devices become more hybrid, smart devices include\n
    \  more media-rich communication applications, and the boundaries\n   between
    telecommunication and other applications becomes less clear.\n   Simultaneously,
    as the end-devices become more mobile, application\n   traffic transits more often
    between enterprise networks, the\n   Internet, and cellular telecommunication
    networks, sometimes using\n   simultaneously more than one path and network type.
    \ In this context,\n   it is crucial that quality of service be aligned between
    these\n   different environments.  However, this is not always the case by\n   default,
    and cellular communication networks use a different QoS\n   nomenclature from
    the Internet and enterprise networks.  This\n   document specifies a set of 3rd
    Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\n   Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifiers
    (QCI) to Differentiated\n   Services Code Point (DSCP) mappings, to reconcile
    the marking\n   recommendations offered by the 3GPP with the recommendations offered\n
    \  by the IETF, so as to maintain a consistent QoS treatment between\n   cellular
    networks and the Internet.  This mapping can be used by\n   enterprises or implementers
    expecting traffic to flow through both\n   types of network, and wishing to align
    the QoS treatment applied to\n   one network under their control with the QoS
    treatment applied to the\n   other network.\n\n\t "

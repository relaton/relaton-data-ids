  content: "   This memo outlines RTP payload formats for the Video-based Dynamic\n
    \  Mesh Coding (V-DMC), which comprises several types of components,\n   such
    as a basemesh, AC-based displacements, 2D representations of\n   attributes, and
    an atlas.  This document focuses on describing the\n   basemesh and displacement,
    while the RTP payload formats for the\n   atlas and attributes are addressed in
    other documents.  The RTP\n   payload header formats enable the packetization
    of a basemesh or\n   displacement Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit in an RTP
    packet\n   payload as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP\n
    \  packets.\n\n\t "

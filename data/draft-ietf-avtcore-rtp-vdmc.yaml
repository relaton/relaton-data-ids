abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines RTP payload formats for the Video-based Dynamic
    Mesh Coding (V-DMC), which comprises several types of components, such as a basemesh,
    AC-based displacements, 2D representations of attributes, and an atlas. This document
    focuses on describing the basemesh and displacement, while the RTP payload formats
    for the atlas and attributes are addressed in other documents. The RTP payload
    header formats enable the packetization of a basemesh or displacement Network
    Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit in an RTP packet payload as well as fragmentation
    of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.</p>"

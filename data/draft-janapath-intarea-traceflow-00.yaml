- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a new OAM protocol - TraceFlow that captures\n
    \  information pertaining to a traffic flow along the path that the flow\n   takes
    through the network. TraceFlow is ECMP and link-aggregation\n   aware and captures
    the information about constituent members through\n   which the traffic flow passes.
    TraceFlow gathers information that is\n   relevant to the flow such as outgoing
    interface Layer 3 address,\n   Next-hop to which the packet of the flow is forwarded,
    effect of\n   network policies such as access control lists on the flow. This
    draft\n   requires the Traceflow protocol to be processed by Layer 3 devices\n
    \  only. Devices such as Layer 2 devices, MPLS LERs/LSRs along the way\n   are
    passed through without any processing as if in a pass-through\n   mode. IP tunnels
    such as IP-in-IP, IP-in-GRE mechanisms are expected\n   to pass the Traceflow
    packets through them using the pass through\n   mode.  For achieving its purpose
    Traceflow advocates the use of a\n   specific UDP destination port to be assigned
    from IANA.\n\n\n\t "

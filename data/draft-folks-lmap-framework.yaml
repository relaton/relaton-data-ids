  content: "   Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation\n
    \  of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols\n   that
    coordinate interactions between the components.  The document\n   presents an
    overall framework for large-scale measurements.  It also\n   defines terminology
    for LMAP (large-scale measurement platforms).\n   The document is a contribution
    towards the LMAP working group's\n   milestone.\n\n\t "

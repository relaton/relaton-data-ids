abstract:
- content: "<p>ChainSync is a lightweight application-layer protocol that runs over
    reliable TCP connections to synchronize a fixed linear chain of distributed processes
    (labeled A, B, C,..., N) such that they execute their local tasks in strict sequential
    order (A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt;... -&gt; N) *and only after every process in the
    chain has confirmed it is ready*. The protocol uses three distinct phases:</p>"

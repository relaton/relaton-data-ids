  content: "This document defines and formalizes the concept of channel bindings\nto
    secure layers and defines the channel bindings for several types\nof secure channels.\n\nThe
    concept of channel bindings allows applications to prove that the\nend-points
    of two secure channels at different network layers are the\nsame by binding authentication
    at one channel to the session\nprotection at the other channel.  The use of channel
    bindings allows\napplications to delegate session protection to lower layers,
    which\nmay significantly improve performance for some applications.\n\t "

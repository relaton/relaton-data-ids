  content: "   This document suggests a light-weight and semantics-free way to\n   signal,
    in the DNS itself, that a domain name is actually an alias of\n   another one
    (and therefore that they are member of the same bundle).\n\n   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION:
    this document should be discussed in the\n   dnsbundled maiing list <https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/\n
    \  bundled-domain-names>.  The source of the document, as well as a list\n   of
    open issues, is currently kept at Github [1].\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the Internet Security Label (ISL).  ISL provides
    a mechanism for encoding security (sensitivity) parameters.  The ISL is intended
    to be a layer-independent security mechanism.  It can be used with all current
    versions of the Internet Protocol (IP), including IPv4 and IPv6 as well as the
    IP Security Protocols (IPSEC), the encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the
    Authentication Header (AH). Other protocols which use a security label can also
    use the ISL encoding standard including IPX.\n\t "

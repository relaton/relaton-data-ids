  content: "   One of the key features of IP that has helped IP Routing to scale is\n
    \  aggregation of IP prefixes.  This is made possible with longest-match\n   lookup
    in IP forwarding.  Contrary to this, MPLS forwarding works on\n   exact match
    on MPLS labels.  This poses a challenge in aggregation of\n   IP prefixes when
    the forwarding is based on the MPLS labels\n   associated with those IP prefixes.\n\n
    \  This document introduces an Aggregation Segment for Segment Routing\n   with
    MPLS data plane which can be used to aggregate IP prefixes along\n   with their
    SR Prefix Segments.  Aggregation Segments enable\n   aggregation of IP prefixes
    to be performed at border routers to\n   improve scalability of MPLS networks.\n\n\t "

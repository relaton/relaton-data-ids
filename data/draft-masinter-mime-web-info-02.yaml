  content: "This document describes some of the ways in which parts of the MIME\nsystem,
    originally designed for electronic mail, have been used in\nthe Web, and some
    of the ways in which those uses have resulted in\ndifficulties.  Given this background
    and justification, this document\nthen goes on to outline requirements for changes
    to MIME registries\nand practices for their use within W3C and IETF, in order
    to address\nthose difficulties.  Within IETF, it is expected that a companion\nBest
    Current Practice document will make specific changes to the\nInternet Media Types
    and Charset registries, among others.\n\t "

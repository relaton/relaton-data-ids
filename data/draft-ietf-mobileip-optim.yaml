  content: "Using the base Mobile IP protocol, all datagrams destined to a mobile\nnode
    are routed through that mobile node's home agent, which then\ntunnels each datagram
    to the mobile node's current location.  This\ndocument defines Route Optimization
    messages and extensions to the\nbase protocol to optimize datagram routing to
    a mobile node.  Using\nthese protocol extensions, correspondent nodes may cache
    the binding\nof a mobile node, and then tunnel their datagrams for the mobile
    node\ndirectly to the care-of address, bypassing the mobile node's home\nagent.
    \ Extensions are also provided to allow datagrams in flight\nwhen a mobile node
    moves, and datagrams sent based on an out-of-date\ncached binding, to be forwarded
    directly to the mobile node's new\nbinding.\n\t "

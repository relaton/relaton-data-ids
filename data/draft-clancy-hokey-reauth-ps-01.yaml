  content: "This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) problem\n   statement.
    \ The current EAP keying framework is not designed to\n   support re-authentication
    and handovers.  This often cause\n   unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless
    environments.  HOKEY\n   plans to address these HOKEY plans to address these problems
    by\n   implementing a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material\n
    \  for hand-off.\n\t "

  content: "   COSE (STD 96, RFC 9052 and RFC 9338) defines a number of registries\n
    \  that allow registrants to exercise the numerous extension points\n   defined
    in COSE.  Section 11.6 of RFC 9052 gives the Designated\n   Experts for these
    registries considerable leeway in deciding about\n   registration requests.\n\n
    \  The present document is intended to collect information that has been\n   the
    basis for initial population of and further registration in these\n   registries.
    \ It is intended to be shaped by the Designated Experts\n   and serve them as
    a collective memorandum and a checklist.  As a\n   secondary function, it is also
    intended to help registrants create\n   registrations that are acceptable to the
    Designated Experts.\n\n\n   // Revision -00 of this draft is an early skeleton
    that should allow\n   // us to decide whether such a collection of information
    is useful\n   // and whether we want to flesh out this document.\n\n\t "

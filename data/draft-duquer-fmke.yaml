  content: "   This document presents a new group key management protocol called \n
    \  FMKE (Flat Multicast Key Exchange), derived from the Group Domain of\n   Interpretation
    (GDOI) [RFC3547]. Like the GDOI, its objective is to \n   Manage securely group
    Security Associations (SA), i.e. establish and\n   update SAs in Group members.
    These security associations protect one\n   or more key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting
    keys, or data shared\n   by group members. This protocol is based on a centralized
    management,\n   achieved by the GCKS (Group Controller and Key Server). It is
    \n   destined to be used by Data Security protocols such as the IPSEC ESP \n   protocol.
    The FMKE protocol is destined to provide an optimized \n   solution for very large
    groups with direct connections such as in \n   satellite systems, or wireless
    systems such as WIFI. It can be \n   considered as a GDOI use case adapted for
    satellite networks. \n\t "

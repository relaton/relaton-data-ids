  content: "Nested MIP [NestMIP] provides a means to support both localization and
    \naggregation of MIP signalling. It achieves this by providing two distinct layers
    of MIP signalling and forwarding; a local access layer that provides local mobility
    management and local access services, and a remote access layer that provides
    remote access back to a home subnet. The local access layer provides a regional
    address from a Regional Mobility Agent (a regional HA) that is then used as a
    CCoA for the remote access layer. Inter-FA  movement and MIP signalling at the
    local access layer then automatically produces the hand-off of potentially multiple
    parallel remote access sessions. The consequences of this model are however reductions
    in bandwidth efficiency due to the additional layers of temporary and permanent
    encapsulation.\nThis draft describes a complementary model for MIP forwarding,
    called \nConcatenated MIP that re-uses, and extends the localised and aggregated
    MIP signalling model from [NestMIP]. The enhanced forwarding model is intended
    to co-exist both with [NestMIP] and [RegTunMods] so that the appropriate trade-offs
    can be made on a per session basis between bandwidth efficiency and other features.
    Inter-RMA hand-offs between Nesting and Concatenating Regional Mobility Agents
    is also supported.\n\n\t "

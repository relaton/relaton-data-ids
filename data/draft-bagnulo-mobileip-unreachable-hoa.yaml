  content: "This note proposes a modification to the MIPv6 specification in order\nto
    allow the preservation of established communications when the path\nbetween the
    MN and the CN through the HoA becomes unavailable.  The\nproposed modification
    essentially consists on allowing the extension\nof BCE lifetime upon the reception
    of ICMP Destination Unreachable\nmessage as reply to a Binding Refresh Request
    (BRR) message.\n\t "

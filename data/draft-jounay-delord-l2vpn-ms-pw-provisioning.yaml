  content: "   Service Providers (SPs) have described the requirements to allow them
    \n   to extend the Pseudowires (PWs) across multiple domains via the use \n   of
    multi-segment Pseudowires (MS-PWs). Several tools relating to \n   provisioning,
    auto-discovery and signaling have been developed to \n   allow the dynamic setup
    of MS-PWs. \n   However there is no end to end view that describes how these tools
    \n   can be used in carrier networks. This document aims at providing this \n
    \  view by describing the different stages required for an end to end \n   L2VPN
    service setup relying on MS-PWs. These stages are VPN \n   provisioning, auto-discovery
    (network and service), signaling and \n   monitoring. \n\t "

  content: "Mobility is rapidly becoming a rule rather than an exception in\ncommunication
    services and SIP is gaining widespread acceptance as\nthe signaling protocol for
    multimedia applications on the Internet.\nThus, it is essential to develop a mobility
    management scheme that\nutilizes salient features and capabilities of SIP as well
    as other\nprotocols (e.g., mobile IP) to support mobile services efficiently.\n\t "

  content: "This document addresses a vulnerability in publicly accessible SIP\nservers
    (servers includes both UASes and proxies) that enables them\nto be used as an
    amplifier in an untracable reflected denial of\nservice attack.  The amplification
    ratio is between 1:10 to over\n1:350 in both packets and bytes.\n\nAs a proposed
    solution, a mechanism for stateless cookie exchange\nbetween a SIP server and
    client to ensure that a public SIP server\nthat wishes to accept SIP requests
    from hosts over datagram can not\nbe used as an amplifier for a denial of service
    attack.  This brings\nSIP over datagram transports (such as UDP) in line with
    TCP in terms\nof routability to the source IP address.\n\t "

  content: "The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) describes an XML-\nbased
    protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial or\ncivic location information
    to service contact Uniform Resource\nLocators (URLs).  LoST servers can be located
    anywhere but a\nplacement closer to the end host, e.g., in the access network,
    is\ndesireable.  Such a LoST server placement provides benefits in\ndisaster situations
    with intermittent network connectivity regarding\nthe resiliency of emergency
    service communication.\n\nThis document describes how a LoST client can discover
    a LoST server\nusing the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\n\t "

  content: "   Many People know that reverse DNS lookup of IN-ADDR.ARAP zone is\n
    \  slow.  People supposed to be the case is issue of LAME delegation.\n   But
    this is not correct.  There are two reasons.  One is glulessness\n   and the other
    is BIND 8 on caching nameserver.  Most of nameservers\n   in ARPA zone are out-of-bailiwick
    names and this causes gluelessness\n\n   This document explains the problem with
    gluelessness, the problem\n   with old BIND implementations and suggests recommended
    way to\n   configure nameservers in .ARPA.\n\t "

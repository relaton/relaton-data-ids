  content: "   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for\n   multiple
    authentication methods.  EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-\n   TLS) provides
    means for key derivation and strong mutual\n   authentication with certificates.
    \ However, certificates can often be\n   relatively large in size.  The certificate
    chain to the root-of-trust\n   can also be long when multiple intermediate Certification
    Authorities\n   (CAs) are involved.  This implies that EAP-TLS authentication
    needs\n   to be fragmented into many smaller packets for transportation over\n
    \  the lower-layer.  Such fragmentation can not only negatively affect\n   the
    latency, but also results in implementation challenges.  For\n   example, many
    authenticator (access point) implementations will drop\n   an EAP session if it
    hasn't finished after 40-50 packets.  This can\n   result in failed authentication
    even when the two communicating\n   parties have the correct credentials for mutual
    authentication.\n   Moreover, there are no mechanisms available to easily recover
    from\n   such situations.  This memo looks at the problem in detail and\n   discusses
    the solutions available to overcome these deployment\n   challenges.\n\n\t "

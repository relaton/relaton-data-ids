  content: "The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a single
    best path for each prefix. As defined and widely deployed today, BGP has no mechanisms
    to distribute alternate paths that are not considered best path between its speakers.
    This behavior results in a number of disadvantages for new applications and services.\n\n
    The main objective of this document is to observe that by simply adding a new
    session between a route reflector and its client, the Nth best path can be distributed.
    This document also compares existing solutions and proposed ideas that enable
    distribution of more paths than just the best path.\n\n This proposal does not
    specify any changes to the BGP protocol definition. It does not require a software
    upgrade of provider edge (PE) routers acting as route reflector clients. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.\n\t "

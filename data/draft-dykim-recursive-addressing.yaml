  content: "This document describes network architecture based on recursive\naddressing.
    \ The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous\nsites, each being a collection
    of nodes.  Each site is named by a\nsite address drawn from a global number space
    while each node is\nnamed by a node address drawn from a number space local to
    each site.\nRouting among sites depends solely on site addresses while that\nwithin
    each site on node addresses.  Flat routing to render inherent\nmobility as well
    as mapped routing to additionally cope with table\nsize are proposed.  The model
    can recursively repeat itself both\noutwards and inwards in the network, enabling
    its applicability, for\nexample, to inter-planetary as well as body area networks.\n\t "

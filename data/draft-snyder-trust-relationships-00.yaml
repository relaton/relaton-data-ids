  content: "   This document reviews common Internet protocols and discusses how\n
    \  each protocol establishes, maintains, and tears down trust\n   relationships
    within the protocol.  This document includes discussion\n   of \"meta\" trust
    issues, including extra-protocol trust creation,\n   management, and destruction.
    \ In cases where specific issues related\n   to establishment of trust have been
    documented, these are discussed\n   as well.  By examining both similarities and
    differences between\n   different protocols, this document can help protocol designers
    and\n   maintainers in IETF working groups learn from successful (and un-\n   successful)
    Internet protocols.\n\n\t "

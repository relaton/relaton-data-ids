  content: "This document defines two controls that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP] search\noperation
    to provide a simple mechanism by which an LDAP client can\nreceive notification
    of changes that occur in an LDAP server.  The\nmechanism is designed to be very
    flexible yet easy for clients and\nservers to implement.  Since the IETF is likely
    to pursue a different,\nmore comprehensive solution in this area, this document
    will eventually\nbe published with Informational status in order to document an
    existing\npractice.\n\t "

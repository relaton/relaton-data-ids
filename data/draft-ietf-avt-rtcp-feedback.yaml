  content: "Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against
    packet losses.  Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport
    Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a
    sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term.  This is the sole means
    for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms).
    \ This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables
    receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and
    thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms
    to be implemented.  This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth
    constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

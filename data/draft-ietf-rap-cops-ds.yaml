  content: "        There is a clear need for relatively simple and coarse methods
    of\n        providing differentiated classes of service for Internet traffic,
    to\n        support various types of services, and specific business\n        requirements.
    The IETF has chartered the Differentiated Service WG to\n        define the differentiated
    services architecture and a common language\n        for differentiated services.\n\n
    \       In parallel, the IETF RSVP Admission Policy (RAP) WG has defined the\n
    \       COPS (Common Open Policy Service) protocol [COPS].\n \n        This document
    describes enhancements to the Common Open Policy\n        Service (COPS) protocol
    to support policy services in a\n        Differentiated Services (DiffServ) environment.
    Further modifications\n        to COPS for DiffServ may be proposed in the future,
    but what is\n        presented here is thought to be the minimum necessary additions.\n\n\t "

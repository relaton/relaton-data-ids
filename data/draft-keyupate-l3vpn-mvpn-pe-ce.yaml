  content: "   When a Service Provider offers BGP/MPLS IP VPN service to its\n   customers,
    RFCs 6513 and 6514 describe protocols and procedures that\n   the Service Provider
    can use in order to carry the customer's IP\n   multicast traffic from one customer
    site to others.  BGP can be used\n   to carry customer multicast routing information
    from one Provider\n   Edge (PE) router to another, but it is assumed that PIM
    is running on\n   the interface between a Customer Edge (CE) router and a PE router.\n
    \  This document specifies protocols and procedures that, under certain\n   conditions,
    allow customer multicast routing information to carried\n   between PE and CE
    via BGP.  This can eliminate the need to run PIM on\n   the PE-CE interfaces,
    potentially eliminating the need to run PIM on\n   the PE routers at all.\n\n\t "

  content: "     This draft is aimed to provide an applicability of Abstraction and\n
    \    Control of Traffic Engineered (TE) Networks (ACTN) for an end-to-\n     end
    service assurance mechanism for 5G transport network. ACTN is\n     an IETF standard
    architecture enabling virtual network operations\n     to control and manage large-scale
    multi-domain, multi-layer and\n     multi-vendor TE networks, so as to facilitate
    network\n     programmability, automation, efficient resource sharing. 3GPP 5G\n
    \    requirements calls for Network Slicing support for various use\n     cases
    such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-\n     type communications
    (mMTC) and ultra-reliable and low latency\n     communications (URLLC). In order
    to support these new requirements\n     over multiple transport networks for 5G
    transport, the current\n     3GPP 5G architecture needs to support dynamic instantiation
    of\n     end-to-end paths that assure service assurance and performance\n     guarantee
    for traffic classes characterized by network slicing.\n\n\t "

  content: "   iCAN (instant Congestion Assessment Network) is a set of mechanisms\n
    \  running directly on network nodes:\n\n   o  To adjust the flows paths based
    on real-time measurement of the\n      candidate paths.\n\n   o  The measurement
    is to reflect the congestion situation of each\n      path, so that the ingress
    nodes could decide which flows need to\n      be switched from a path to another.\n\n
    \  This is something that current SDN and TE technologies can hardly\n   achieve:\n\n
    \  o  SDN Controller is slow and far from the data plane, it is neither\n      able
    to assess the real-time congestion situation of each path,\n      nor able to
    assure the data plane always go as expected\n      (especially in SRv6 scenarios).
    \ However, iCAN can work with SDN\n      perfectly: controller planning multi-path
    transmission, and iCAN\n      does the flow optimization automatically.\n\n   o
    \ Traditional TE is not able to adjust the flow paths in real-time.\n\n\t "

  content: "   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is widely deployed at TLD and other\n
    \  important domain names currently.  DNSSEC is an effective method to\n   provide
    security protection for end users in the network.  DNSSEC\n   needs a lot of operations
    to maintain the chain of trust, like DNSKEY\n   rollover operations periodically.
    \ But the chain of trust could be\n   broken if the operator of domain replaces
    the old key immediately in\n   a emergency rollover operation when the key is
    compromised.  The\n   break will make the domain and his sub-domains invisible
    in a short\n   time if the data in the cache of resolver is right, on the contrary,\n
    \  the fake RR in the cache of resolver may be \"valid\" if the resolver\n   is
    under the attack from hackers.  This document introduces the\n   compromised-key
    digest signature (CKDS) resource record to mitigate\n   the impact of invalidation
    which is due to emergency rollover from\n   the authoritative name server.\n\n\t "

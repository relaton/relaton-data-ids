  content: "   This Internet Draft introduces an extension to the Extensible\n   Provisioning
    Protocol (EPP) for top-level domain (TLD) registries,\n   enabling registrars
    to submit pre-registration information for domain\n   names.  The extension facilitates
    quality verification by the\n   registry, employing advanced Artificial Intelligence
    and Machine\n   Learning (AI/ML) techniques.  Pre-registrations are assigned a\n
    \  quality score based on the analysis of the submitted data, ranging\n   from
    0 for non-abusive registrations to 100 for potentially abusive\n   ones.  This
    extension addresses the critical need to proactively\n   identify and mitigate
    abusive domain registrations within TLDs,\n   contributing to a safer and more
    reliable internet environment.  The\n   document outlines the EPP command definitions,
    XML schemas, data\n   flow, and security considerations necessary to implement
    this\n   innovative quality assurance mechanism, thereby enhancing the\n   integrity
    and trustworthiness of TLD registrations.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an enhancement to the Stateless Cookie\n   mechanism
    described in RFC 5996.  Whereas the original mechanism\n   prevents denial-of-service
    (DoS) attacks that use multiple spoofed\n   source addresses, the mechanism here
    is effective against a\n   distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), where
    the attackers use\n   their own source address.  This is accomplished by requiring
    proof of\n   work by the Initiator before allocating resources at the Responder.\n\n\t "

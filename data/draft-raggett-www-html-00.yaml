  content: "This draft presents a proposal for a light weight delivery format for
    browsing and querying information in a web of globally distributed hypertext,
    accessible over the Internet. HTML+ embodies a pageless model making it suitable
    for efficient rendering on a wide range of display types, for example, VT100 terminals,
    X11 Workstations, Windows 3.x and the Macintosh. HTML+ is based upon SGML, and
    represents document elements at a logical level, e.g. headers, paragraphs, lists,
    tables, and figures. Authors can choose to create HTML+ documents directly, or
    to use filters to convert from other formats such as LaTeX, Framemaker, and Word
    for Windows.   HTML+  has grown out of several years experience with the HTML
    document format in the World Wide Web community. Browser writers are experimenting
    with extensions to HTML and it is now appropriate to draw these ideas together
    into a revised document format. The new format is designed to allow a gradual
    roll over from HTML, adding features like tables, captioned figures and fill-out
    forms for querying remote databases or mailing questionnaires.\n\t "

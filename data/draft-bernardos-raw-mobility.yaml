  content: "   There are several use cases where reliability and availability are\n
    \  key requirements for wireless heterogeneous networks in which\n   connected
    devices might be mobile, such as eXtended Reality (XR).\n   This document discusses
    and specifies control plane solutions to cope\n   with mobility, by proactively
    preparing the network for the change of\n   point of attachment of a connected
    mobile node.  It also defines\n   Mobile IPv6 extensions implementing these control
    plane solutions.\n\n\t "

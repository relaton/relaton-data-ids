- language: en

  content: "This draft describes a Kademlia-based protocol for Resource Lookup in\nP2PSIP.
    \ The proposed protocol is based on dSIP, a SIP-based protocol\nproposed by other
    authors as generic framework for a distributed SIP\nLocation Service.  Although
    the dSIP authors have obsoleted the draft\nby a newer approach based on a binary
    protocol named RELOAD, we are\nstill considering this SIP-based approach, due
    to implementation\nsimplicity, possibility of reuse of already available SIP stack\nimplementations,
    easy integration into existing UAs, minimization of\nthe number of required protocols
    for a P2P UA, and widespread support\nfor (and relative maturity of) the SIP standard.\n\t "

  content: "This draft considers the optical network service model referred\nto as
    the 'domain services' model [1]. Under this model, the optical\nnetwork provides
    a set of well-defined services to clients (IP and\nothers). The signaling and
    routing interface between the client and\noptical networks is referred to as the
    User-Network Interface (UNI).\nThis draft describes the services provided over
    the UNI, and the\nrequirements on any signaling protocol used to invoke the services.\nThis
    draft reflects ongoing work at the Optical Interworking Forum\n(OIF) and the Optical
    Domain Service Interconnect (ODSI) coalition\non the optical UNI [2]. The relevance
    of this draft to the IETF is\ntwo-fold.  First, for the signaling portion of the
    optical UNI,\nextensions of two MPLS signaling protocols are presently under\nconsideration
    in the OIF: RSVP with TE extensions and LDP. The\nobjective of this draft is to
    guide the adaptation of these\nprotocols for UNI signaling. Second, to harmonize
    the signaling of\nUNI originated lightpath requests and peer model lightpath\nestablishment
    mechanisms [1], alignment between OIF, ODSI and IETF\nlightpath parameters and
    signaling functionality is desirable. This\ndraft aims to serve this purpose.
    The content of this draft is\nexpected to evolve as work progresses on the optical
    UNI.\n\t "

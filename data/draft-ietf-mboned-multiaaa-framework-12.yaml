abstract:
- content: <p>IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting or videoconferencing
    raise the issue of making sure that potential customers are fully entitled to
    access the corresponding contents. There is indeed a need for service and content
    providers to identify users (if not authenticate, especially within the context
    of enforcing electronic payment schemes) and to retrieve statistical information
    for accounting purposes, as far as content and network usage are concerned. This
    memo describes the framework for specifying the Authorization, Authentication
    and Accounting (AAA) capabilities that could be activated within the context of
    the deployment and the operation of IP multicast-based services. This framework
    addresses the requirements presented in "Requirements for Accounting, Authentication
    and Authorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting Services" [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req].
    The memo provides a basic AAA enabled model as well as an extended fully enabled
    model with resource and admission control coordination.</p>

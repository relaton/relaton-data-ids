abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting or\nvideoconferencing
    raise the issue of making sure that potential\ncustomers are fully entitled to
    access the corresponding contents.\nThere is indeed a need for service and content
    providers to identify\nusers (if not authenticate, especially within the context
    of\nenforcing electronic payment schemes) and to retrieve statistical\ninformation
    for accounting purposes, as far as content and network\nusage are concerned.  This
    memo describes the framework for\nspecifying the Authorization, Authentication
    and Accounting (AAA)\ncapabilities that could be activated within the context
    of the\ndeployment and the operation of IP multicast-based services.  This\nframework
    addresses the requirements presented in \"Requirements for\nAccounting, Authentication
    and Authorization in Well Managed IP\nMulticasting Services\" [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req].
    \ The memo\nprovides a basic AAA enabled model as well as an extended fully\nenabled
    model with resource and admission control coordination.\n\t "

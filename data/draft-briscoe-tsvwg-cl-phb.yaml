- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) builds on the concepts of RFC 3168,
    \n   \"The addition of Explicit Congestion Notification to IP\". However, \n   Pre-Congestion
    Notification aims at providing notification before any \n   congestion actually
    occurs. Pre-Congestion Notification is applied to \n   real-time flows (such as
    voice, video and multimedia streaming) in \n   DiffServ networks. As described
    in [CL-DEPLOY], it enables \"pre\" \n   congestion control through two procedures,
    flow admission control and \n   flow pre-emption. The draft proposes algorithms
    that determine when a \n   PCN-enabled router writes Admission Marking and Pre-emption
    Marking \n   in a packet header, depending on the traffic level. The draft also
    \n   proposes how to encode these markings. We present simulation results \n   with
    PCN working in an edge-to-edge scenario using the marking \n   algorithms described.
    Other marking algorithms will be investigated \n   in the future. \n\n\t "

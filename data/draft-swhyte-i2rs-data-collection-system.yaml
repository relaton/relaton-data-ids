  content: "   Collecting large amounts of data from network infrastructure devices\n
    \  has never been very easy.  Existing methods generate CPU and memory\n   loads
    that may be unacceptable, the output varies across\n   implementations and can
    be difficult to parse, and these methods are\n   often difficult to scale.  I2RS
    programmatic interfacing with the\n   routing system may exacerbate this problem:
    state needs to be\n   collected from nodes and fed to consumers participating
    in the\n   control plane that may not be physically close to the nodes.  This\n
    \  state includes not only control plane information, but elements of\n   the
    data plane that have a direct impact on control plane behavior,\n   like traffic
    engineering.\n\n   This document outlines a set of use cases requiring a flexible\n
    \  framework to collect routing system data, and the features and\n   functionality
    needed to make such a framework useful for these use\n   cases.\n\n\n\t "

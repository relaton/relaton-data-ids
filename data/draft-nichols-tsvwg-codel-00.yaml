  content: "   The \"persistently full buffer\" problem has been discussed in the
    IETF\n   community since the early 80's [RFC896]. The IRTF's End-to-End\n   Working
    Group called for the deployment of active queue management to\n   solve the problem
    in 1998 [RFC2309]. Despite the awareness and\n   recommendations, the \"full buffer\"
    problem has not gone away, but on\n   the contrary has become worse as buffers
    have grown in size and\n   proliferated and today's networks proved intractable
    for available\n   AQM approaches. The overall problem is presently known as\n
    \  \"bufferbloat\" [TSVBB2011, BB2011] and has become increasingly\n   important,
    particularly at the consumer edge.\n\n   This document describes a recently developed
    AQM, Controlled Delay\n   (CoDel) algorithm, which was designed to work in modern
    networking\n   environments and can be deployed as a major part of the solution
    to\n   bufferbloat [CODEL2012].\n\n\t "

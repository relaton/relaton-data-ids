abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Phi-Ns, a new asymmetric cryptographic primitive
    based on the structured decomposition of the quadratic gap between two primes.
    Phi-Ns defines a public key q and a private key p such that the difference q^2
    - p^2 is expressed as a composite value T. The value T is then factored into small
    controlled components noted a, b, and R, and the final secret structure abR is
    encoded through a randomized serialization process. The security of Phi-Ns does
    not rely on integer factorization, the discrete logarithm problem, or elliptic
    curves. Instead, it depends on the difficulty of recovering p from q when the
    attacker has no oracle, no structural anchor, and no method to determine whether
    a candidate p is correct. Because T can be recursively decomposed and reassembled
    into multiple unpredictable forms, the resulting search space grows combinatorially.
    Phi-Ns further supports recursive expansion of the internal abR structure, allowing
    the construction of high-entropy secret states even when p and q have relatively
    small bit lengths. This enables compact public keys, efficient computation, and
    strong post-quantum resistance based on a non-factorization hardness assumption.
    This document specifies the algorithmic model of Phi-Ns, its parameter choices,
    and the serialization rules used to encode the abR structure. It also outlines
    two public-key variants, PK-p and PK-q, which expose either p or q as the public
    value depending on deployment constraints.</p>"

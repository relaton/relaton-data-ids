  content: "   This document proposes the UDP-based Lightweight GeneRic Autonomic\n
    \  Signaling Protocol (LW-GRASP), which is designed to be a lightweight\n   version
    of the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol(GRASP, or the\n   standard GRASP),
    with shortened messages and a built-in reliability\n   mechanism.  LW-GRASP can
    work reliably over UDP, making it suitable\n   for IoT, where lightweight and
    resource-constrained devices dominate.\n   Given the established ecosystem of
    CoAP and aiming to promote LW-\n   GRASP adoption in IoT, this document also focuses
    on the LW-GRASP\n   transition from UDP to a CoAP-based framework, i.e., LW-GRASP
    over\n   CoAP.  Furthermore, this document also discusses the potential way to\n
    \  adapt the LW-GRASP to work on the network without IP connectivity.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a new ICMPv6 message type, ICMPv6-SEC,\n   designed
    to convey cryptographically verifiable information using\n   COSE objects and
    CBOR-encoded certificates.  The purpose is to signal\n   segment-specific network
    characteristics, including high RTT,\n   congestion, policy constraints, and traffic
    treatment expectations.\n   These messages can describe either the segment beyond
    the current hop\n   (forward segment) or the local segment on which the source
    resides.\n   Certificates may be embedded or referenced via DNS using\n   cryptographic
    hashes.  The mechanism is optimized for high-speed\n   environments by allowing
    the use of static, signed descriptors for\n   destination prefixes.\n\n\t "

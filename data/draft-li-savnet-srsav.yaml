- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft proposes a novel mechanism for Source Address Validation\n
    \  (SAV) message propagation based on Segment Routing policies (SR-\n   policy).
    \ Traditional SAV mechanisms often rely on routing tables\n   (RIB) and Policy-Based
    Routing (PBR), but these methods lack the\n   flexibility and granularity needed
    for some network environments.  By\n   leveraging the flexibility and control
    capabilities of SR-policy, the\n   proposed mechanism ensures that SAV messages
    are propagated along\n   well-defined paths, ensuring efficient, secure, and accurate
    source\n   address validation.\n\n\t "

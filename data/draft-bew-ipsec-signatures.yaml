  content: "This memo describes the use of the RSA Signature algorithm [RSA] as \nan
    authentication algorithm within the revised IPSEC Encapsulating \nSecurity Payload
    [ESP] and the revised IPSEC Authentication Header \n[AH]. The use of a digital
    signature algorithm such as RSA provides \norigin authentication, even when ESP
    and AH are used to secure group \ndata flows. \nFurther information on the other
    components necessary for ESP and AH \nimplementations is provided by [ROADMAP].\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an IPsec AH and ESP sequence number\n   validation
    scheme, which is complementary to the existing ICV\n   mechanism and anti-replay
    mechanism of AH and ESP in defense against\n   DOS attack.  It is an optional
    feature negotiable through IKE, for\n   this feature to be negotiated, both sender
    and receiver must\n   implement it.  If any party doesn't support it, then this
    feature\n   should be excluded from negotiation.  The rationale for such a scheme\n
    \  is discussed first; then requirements and guidelines for design of\n   the
    scheme are laid out.  There can be various ways to implement the\n   scheme, some
    reference designs are discussed to set the base for\n   effort of identifying
    best practice and eventually establishing a\n   standard on the subject.\n\n\t "

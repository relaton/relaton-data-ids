  content: "   Per RFC6513 and RFC6514, seven MCAST-VPN NLRIs and relevant\n   procedures
    are defined to build multicast forwarding tree over the\n   service provider backbone.
    \ RFC8556 introduces that MVPN can use BIER\n   as PMSI tunnel to perform optimal
    multicast forwarding.  However, the\n   complicated NLRI exchange and the switching
    from I-PMSI to S-PMSI\n   tunnel is not necessary for BIER and IR tunnel.  The
    architectural\n   advantages of BIER and IR cannot be fully utilized.  Therefore,
    a new\n   simplified MVPN for BIER and IR is proposed to substitute current\n
    \  NLRIs exchange and procedures.  This document would like to discuss\n   the
    value of the MVPN simplification and provide suggestive solution.\n\n\n\t "

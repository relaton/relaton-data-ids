- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes the use-cases of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise\n
    \  Control, and Platooning, as defined by several Standards Development\n   Organizations
    such as ETSI, IEEE P1609, SAE, 3GPP, ISO and FirstNet.\n\n   C-ACC and Platooning
    involve concepts of direct vehicle-to-vehicle,\n   and device-to-device communications,
    which are developed by 3GPP\n   following on work done within the METIS EU project.
    \ They are\n   illustrated very clearly in emergency settings such as FirstNet.\n\n
    \  IP packets - instead of link-layer frames - are pertinent for C-ACC\n   and
    Platooning use-cases because applications for road safety such as\n   WAZE, iRezQ
    and Coyote (currently involving infrastructure) make use\n   of IP messages, and
    have proved successful in deployments.\n   Applications such as Sentinel operate
    directly between vehicles, but\n   currently use messages not carried over IP.\n\n\t "

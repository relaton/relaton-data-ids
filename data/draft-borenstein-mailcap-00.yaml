  content: "This memo suggests a file format to be used to inform multiple mail reading
    user agent programs about the locally-installed facilities for handling mail in
    various formats.  The mechanism is explicitly designed to work with mail systems
    based Internet mail as defined by RFC's 821, 822, 934, 1049, 1113, and the Multipurpose
    Internet Mail Extensions, known as MIME.  However, with some extensions it could
    probably be made to work for X.400-based mail systems as well.  The format and
    mechanism are proposed in a manner that is generally operating-system independent.
    \ However, certain implementation details will inevitably reflect operating system
    differences, some of which will have to be handled in a uniform manner for each
    operating system.  This memo makes such situations explicit, and, in an appendix,
    suggests a standard behavior under the UNIX operating system. This is a minor
    update to RFC 1524.  Differences are detailed in Appendix E.\n\t "

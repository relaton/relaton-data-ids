  content: "   This draft introduces the Unified Network and Cloud Orchestration\n
    \  Framework (UNCO), which is designed to enable real-time and joint\n   orchestration
    of network and computing resources in 5G and future-\n   generation networks.
    \ UNCO framework addresses inefficiencies in\n   current resource scheduling mechanisms,
    resolves objective conflicts\n   across domains, and provides unified policy and
    security management.\n   It is applicable in emerging scenarios such as ultra-reliable
    low-\n   latency communications (URLLC), mobile edge computing (MEC), and\n   network
    slicing, where service quality and operational efficiency are\n   paramount.\n\n\t "

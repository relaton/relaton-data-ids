  content: "   A server that hosts applications that can be run with or without TLS\n
    \  may want to communicate with clients whether the server is hosting an\n   application
    only using TLS or also hosting the application without\n   TLS.  Many clients
    have a policy to try to set up a TLS session but\n   fall back to insecure if
    the TLS session cannot be set up.  If the\n   server can securely communicate
    whether or not it can fall back to\n   insecure tells such a client whether or
    not they should even try to\n   set up an insecure session with the server.  This
    document describes\n   the use cases for this type of communication and a secure
    method for\n   communicating that information.\n\n\t "

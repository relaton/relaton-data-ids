  content: "   This document discusses the requirements and technology gaps related\n
    \  to security in the virtualized data center services (VDCS).  The\n   objective
    is to ensure end-to-end security for various types of\n   carrier services built
    on virtualized infrastructure.  The issues\n   covered in this draft are focused
    on confidentiality and integrity of\n   the services in the virtualized environment;
    including but not\n   limited to infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application\n
    \  (SaaS) services.  This draft also takes into account transient nature\n   of
    identity, resources and connectivity in the virtualized\n   environment.\n\n\t "

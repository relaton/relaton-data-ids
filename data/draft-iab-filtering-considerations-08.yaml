  content: "   The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This\n
    \  openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but\n   it
    can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by\n   certain
    parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms\n   to limit the
    extent and impact of abusive or objectionable\n   communications.  Recently, there
    has been an increasing emphasis on\n   \"blocking\" and \"filtering,\" the active
    prevention of such\n   communications.  This document examines several technical
    approaches\n   to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment
    with\n   the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the\n
    \  approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the\n   Internet
    architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially\n   undesirable services,
    so that the communicants can avoid engaging in\n   abusive or objectionable communications.
    \ We observe that certain\n   filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended
    consequences\n   to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various\n
    \  approaches.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Internet protocols work well in a variety of environments, including\n
    \  Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.  While there are some\n   optimization
    possibilities to reduce code size, bandwidth\n   utilization, and to improve battery
    lifetime, in general most\n   Internet protocols are also applicable to constrained
    environments.\n   TLS and DTLS are two such security protocols that can be used
    by many\n   IoT devices since DTLS/TLS provide lot of flexiblity in terms\n   credential
    choice, ciphersuite usage, etc.  The DICE working group\n   has developed a specification
    that profiles the use of TLS and DTLS\n   for IoT environments, without changing
    the TLS/DTLS specifications.\n\n   This memo goes a step further and proposes
    changes to the DTLS/TLS\n   protocol to introduce further optimizations.  Since
    the ongoing work\n   on TLS/DTLS 1.3 already offers several improvements (compared
    to\n   previous versions) this document focuses on the use of version 1.3\n   and
    suggests further optimizations.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Backend Serial Zone Version Opion is a way to get information
    about the version of a DNS zone in the backend. For example when a DNSSEC signer
    for a zone generates a new SOA serial, because it has created new RRSIG records,
    the original data has not changed, but this is not visible to anyone looking at
    the zone via DNS. This document will make it possible to show the zone information
    which is the source of the presented data.</p>"

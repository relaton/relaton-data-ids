abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
    accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related
    metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks using probe messages. This document
    reviews how these mechanisms can be used for Delay and Loss Performance Measurements
    (PM) in Segment Routing (SR) networks with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both
    SR links and end-to-end SR Policies. The performance measurements for SR links
    are used to compute extended Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics for delay and loss
    and are advertised in the network using routing protocol extensions.</p>"

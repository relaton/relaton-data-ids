  content: "   When using the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] to\n
    \  bootstrap neighbour discovery for routing protocols there is no\n   indication
    in the core DLEP protocol of the services of the router\n   announced at a destination.
    \ This forces an implementation to either\n   rely on a priori configuration or
    use heuristic probing of well-known\n   ports to discover potential routing peers.\n\n
    \  This document defines an extension to DLEP to enable a router to\n   advertise
    its active services to its peer modem, allowing a connected\n   remote modem to
    announce the services of a router in a DLEP\n   destination message to its peer,
    removing the need for service\n   discovery between routing peers.  The mechanism
    is designed to be\n   sufficiently generic to allow the advertisement of network
    services\n   beyond routing protocols, enabling the fast bootstrapping of other\n
    \  protocols such as messaging protocols or header compression.\n\n\t "

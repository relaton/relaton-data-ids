  content: "   The optimization offered by reactive routing relies on the\n   observation
    that under normal activity a host makes a low rate\n   of outgoing sessions to
    new or different hosts, and connections\n   are locally correlated. This contrasts
    the fundamental behavior\n   of address scanning worms that search for new hosts
    to infect at\n   high speeds. Consequently, each infected node will frequently\n
    \  flood the network with route request messages targeted at\n   possibly non-existing
    addresses.\n\t "

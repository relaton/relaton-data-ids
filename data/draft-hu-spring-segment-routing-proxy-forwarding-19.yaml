  content: "   Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) supports explicit paths\n
    \  using segment lists containing adjacency-SIDs, node-SIDs and binding-\n   SIDs.
    \ The current SR FRR such as TI-LFA provides fast re-route\n   protection for
    the failure of a node along a SR-TE path by the direct\n   neighbor or say point
    of local repair (PLR) to the failure.  However,\n   once the IGP converges, the
    SR FRR is no longer sufficient to forward\n   traffic of the path around the failure,
    since the non-neighbors of\n   the failure will no longer have a route to the
    failed node.  This\n   document describes a mechanism for the restoration of the
    routes to\n   the failure of a SR-MPLS TE path after the IGP converges.  It\n
    \  provides the restoration of the routes to an adjacency segment, a\n   node
    segment and a binding segment of the path.  With the restoration\n   of the routes
    to the failure, the traffic is continuously sent to the\n   neighbor of the failure
    after the IGP converges.  The neighbor as a\n   PLR fast re-routes the traffic
    around the failure.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web\n
    \  resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes\n   of
    such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links\n   can be exchanged
    in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).\n\n   This specification defines a common format
    for representing Web links\n   in CBOR format (RFC7049).\n\nNote\n\n   Discussion
    and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should\n   be sent to core@ietf.org.\n\n\t "

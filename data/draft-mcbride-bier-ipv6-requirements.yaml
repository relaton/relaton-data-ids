  content: "   The BIER WG has a charter item to work on mechanisms which use BIER\n
    \  natively in IPv6.  This document is intended to help the WG with this\n   effort
    by specifying requirements for transporting packets, with Bit\n   Index Explicit
    Replication (BIER) headers, in an IPv6 environment.\n   There will be a need to
    send IPv6 payloads, to multiple IPv6\n   destinations, using BIER.  There have
    been several proposed solutions\n   in this area.  But there hasn't been a document
    which describes the\n   problem and lists the requirements.  The goal of this
    document is to\n   describe the BIER IPv6 requirements and summarize the pro's
    and con's\n   of the proposed solutions.\n\n\t "

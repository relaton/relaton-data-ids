  content: "There are 3 major functions that must be performed to achieve\nmulticast
    Label Switching. 1) Label Allocation, which requires each\nmulticast Label Switching
    Router (LSR) to have a label value range\nthat it uses. 2) Label Binding, using
    the labels allocated, a LSR\nmust assign them to multicast routes. 3) Label Binding
    Distribution,\nafter binding label values to routes, they must be distributed
    to\nother LSRs so they all forward on a common and consistent\ndistribution tree.\nIn
    this document we present how labels are allocated uniquely across multicast capable
    LSRs on a LAN and point-to-point IP subnets.\n\t "

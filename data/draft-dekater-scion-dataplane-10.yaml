  content: "   This document describes the data plane of the path-aware, inter-\n
    \  domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and\n   Isolation
    On Next-generation networks).  A fundamental characteristic\n   of SCION is that
    it gives path control to SCION-capable endpoints.\n\n   The SCION Control Plane
    is responsible for discovering these paths\n   and making them available as path
    segments to the endpoints.  The\n   role of the SCION Data Plane is to combine
    these path segments into\n   end-to-end paths, and forward data between endpoints
    according to the\n   specified path.  It fundamentally differs from an IP-based
    data plane\n   in that it is _path-aware_ and interdomain forwarding directives
    are\n   embedded in the packet header.\n\n   This document provides a detailed
    specification of the SCION data\n   packet format as well as the structure of
    the SCION header, including\n   extension headers.  It also describes the life
    of a SCION packet\n   while traversing a SCION network, followed by a specification
    of the\n   SCION path authorization mechanisms and the packet processing at\n
    \  routers.\n\n   This document contains new approaches to secure path aware\n
    \  networking.  It is not an Internet Standard, has not received any\n   formal
    review of the IETF, nor was the work developed through the\n   rough consensus
    process.  The approaches offered in this work are\n   offered to the community
    for its consideration in the further\n   evolution of the Internet.\n\n\t "

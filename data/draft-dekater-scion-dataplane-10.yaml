abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the data plane of the path-aware, inter- domain
    network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation
    networks). A fundamental characteristic of SCION is that it gives path control
    to SCION-capable endpoints. The SCION Control Plane is responsible for discovering
    these paths and making them available as path segments to the endpoints. The role
    of the SCION Data Plane is to combine these path segments into end-to-end paths,
    and forward data between endpoints according to the specified path. It fundamentally
    differs from an IP-based data plane in that it is _path-aware_ and interdomain
    forwarding directives are embedded in the packet header. This document provides
    a detailed specification of the SCION data packet format as well as the structure
    of the SCION header, including extension headers. It also describes the life of
    a SCION packet while traversing a SCION network, followed by a specification of
    the SCION path authorization mechanisms and the packet processing at routers.
    This document contains new approaches to secure path aware networking. It is not
    an Internet Standard, has not received any formal review of the IETF, nor was
    the work developed through the rough consensus process. The approaches offered
    in this work are offered to the community for its consideration in the further
    evolution of the Internet.</p>"

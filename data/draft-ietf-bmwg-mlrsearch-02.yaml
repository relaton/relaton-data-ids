  content: "   TODO: Update after all sections are ready.\n\n   This document proposes
    changes to [RFC2544], specifically to packet\n   throughput search methodology,
    by defining a new search algorithm\n   referred to as Multiple Loss Ratio search
    (MLRsearch for short).\n   Instead of relying on binary search with pre-set starting
    offered\n   load, it proposes a novel approach discovering the starting point
    in\n   the initial phase, and then searching for packet throughput based on\n
    \  defined packet loss ratio (PLR) input criteria and defined final\n   trial
    duration time.  One of the key design principles behind\n   MLRsearch is minimizing
    the total test duration and searching for\n   multiple packet throughput rates
    (each with a corresponding PLR)\n   concurrently, instead of doing it sequentially.\n\n
    \  The main motivation behind MLRsearch is the new set of challenges and\n   requirements
    posed by NFV (Network Function Virtualization),\n   specifically software based
    implementations of NFV data planes.\n   Using [RFC2544] in the experience of the
    authors yields often not\n   repetitive and not replicable end results due to
    a large number of\n   factors that are out of scope for this draft.  MLRsearch
    aims to\n   address this challenge in a simple way of getting the same result\n
    \  sooner, so more repetitions can be done to describe the\n   replicability.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes techniques for allowing sites running the\n   Locator/ID
    Separation Protocol (LISP [LISP]) to interoperate with\n   Internet sites not
    running LISP.  A fundamental property of LISP-\n   speaking sites is that they
    use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather\n   than traditional IP addresses, in
    the source and destination fields\n   of all traffic they emit or receive.  While
    EIDs are syntactically\n   identical to IP addresses, routes for them are not
    carried in the\n   global routing system so an interoperability mechanism is needed
    for\n   non-LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with LISP-speaking sites.\n
    \  This document introduces two such mechanisms: the first uses a new\n   network
    element, the LISP Proxy Tunnel Router (PTR) (Section 5) to\n   act as a intermediate
    LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP-\n   speaking hosts while the second
    adds Network Address Translation\n   (NAT) functionality to LISP Ingress and LISP
    Egress Tunnel Routers\n   (xTRs) to substitute routable IP addresses for non-routable
    EIDs.\n\t "

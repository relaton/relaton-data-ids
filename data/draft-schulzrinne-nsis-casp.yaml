  content: "CASP is a modular potocol for establishing network control state along
    a\ndata path between two nodes communicating on the Internet.\nThe signalling
    problem addressed by CASP is the same as the overall\nproblem being addressed
    by the NSIS activities.\nThe CASP framework is defined as a modular protocol,
    which includes a\ngeneral purpose messaging layer (M-layer), which supports a
    number of\nclient layers for particular signalling applications (e.g. QoS, MIDCOM).\nIn
    addition there is distinct, special purpose client component for\nnext-peer discovery.\n\t "

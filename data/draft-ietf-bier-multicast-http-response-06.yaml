  content: "   HTTP Level Multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case in the\n
    \  BIER Use Cases document.  HTTP Level Multicast is used in today's\n   video
    streaming and delivery services such as HTTP Live Streaming\n   (HLS), Augmented
    Reality and Virtual Reality(AR/VR), generally\n   realized over IP Multicast as
    well as other use cases such as\n   software update delivery.  A realization of
    \"HTTP Multicast\" over \"IP\n   Multicast\" is described for the video delivery
    use case.  IP\n   Multicast is commonly used for IPTV services.  Digital Video\n
    \  Broadcasting (DVB) and Broadband Forum (BBF) also develope a\n   reference
    architecture for IP Multicast service.  A few problems with\n   IP Multicast,
    such as waste of transmission bandwidth, increase in\n   signaling when there
    are few users are described.  Realization over\n   BIER, through a BIER Multicast
    Overlay Layer, is described as an\n   alternative.  How BIER Multicast Overlay
    operation improves over IP\n   Multicast, such as reduction in signaling, dynamic
    creation of\n   multicast groups to reduce signaling and bandwidth wastage is\n
    \  described.  We conclude with a few next steps.\n\n\t "

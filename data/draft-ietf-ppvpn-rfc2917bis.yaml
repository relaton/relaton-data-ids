  content: "This memo presents an approach for building core Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) services in a service provider's MPLS backbone.\nThis approach uses Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) running in\nthe backbone to provide premium services in
    addition to best effort\nservices. The central vision is for the service provider
    to provide a\nvirtual router service to their customers. The keystones of this\narchitecture
    are ease of configuration, user security, network\nsecurity, dynamic neighbor
    discovery, scaling and the use of existing\nrouting protocols as they exist today
    without any modifications.\n\n\t "

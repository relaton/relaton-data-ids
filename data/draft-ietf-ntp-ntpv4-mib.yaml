  content: "The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types and sizes
    for time synchronization of servers, workstations, and other networked equipment.
    \ As time synchronization is more and more a mission-critical service, standardized
    means for monitoring and management of this subsystem of a networked host are
    required to allow operators of such a service to set up a monitoring system that
    is platform- and vendor-independent.  This document provides a standardized collection
    of data objects for monitoring the NTP entity of such a network participant and
    it is part of the NTP version 4 standardization effort. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

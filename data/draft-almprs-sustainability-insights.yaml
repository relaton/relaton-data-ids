  content: "   Internet and the ICT industry is consuming a sizable portion of the\n
    \  electricity available in the world today, and the fraction has been\n   growing
    significantly over time.  Data shows that the power draw of\n   internet is relatively
    constant over the day and week, even though\n   the “load” and delivered services
    vary greatly over this time span.\n   This seems to suggest that there is room
    for optimizations.\n\n   This document provides some definitions, some proposed
    principles for\n   a solution, and then paints a picture of what a solution based
    on\n   existing standards and some current internet drafts might look like.\n\n
    \  The first step of an optimization loop is to measure.  This document\n   proposes
    a mechanism to collect energy related telemetry data from\n   the extremely diverse
    set of devices found in networks today, without\n   necessarily updating the network
    elements.  Once the collection is\n   done, it’s also very relevant to be able
    to control the devices, and\n   turn them into low power modes when the service
    demand is lower.\n\n\t "

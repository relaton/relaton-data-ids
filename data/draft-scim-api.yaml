  content: "   The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\n
    \  is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based\n   applications
    and services easier.  The specification suite seeks to\n   build upon experience
    with existing schemas and deployments, placing\n   specific emphasis on simplicity
    of development and integration, while\n   applying existing authentication, authorization,
    and privacy models.\n   It's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user
    management\n   operations by providing a common user schema and extension model,
    as\n   well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this\n   schema
    using standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap,\n   and easy to move
    users in to, out of, and around the cloud.\n\n\t "

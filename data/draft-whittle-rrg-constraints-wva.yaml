  content: "This ID will contain a version of my attempt to list the constraints\nthe
    RRG faces in choosing a scalable routing solution due to the need\nfor widespread
    voluntary adoption.  This ID is to support and\ndocument the IRTF Routing Research
    Group discussions concerning\nscalable routing, in early 2010.  It is not a formal
    product of the\nRRG.  To what extent its contents are supported by RRG consensus
    can\nonly be determined by the co-chairs.\n\t "

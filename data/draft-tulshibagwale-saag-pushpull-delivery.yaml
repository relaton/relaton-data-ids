  content: "   This specification defines how multiple Security Event Tokens (SETs)\n
    \  can be delivered and received to and by an intended recipeint using\n   HTTP
    POST over TLS or WebSocket binding.\n\n   This specification enabled following
    two use cases -\n\n   *  In situations where a transmitter of Security Event Tokens
    (SETs)\n      to a network peer is also a receiver of SETs from the same peer,\n
    \     it is helpful to have an efficient way of sending and receiving\n      SETs
    in one HTTP transaction.  In many cases, such as when using\n      the OpenID
    Shared Signals Framework (SSF), the situation where\n      each entity is both
    a transmitter and receiver is getting\n      increasingly common.\n\n   *  In
    situations where a transmitter of Security Event Tokens (SETs)\n      wants to
    transmit multiple SETs to the reciever in a single HTTP\n      call.\n\n   Using
    current mechanisms such as \"Push-Based Delivery of Security\n   Event Tokens
    (SETs) Using HTTP\" or \"Poll-Based Delivery of Security\n   Event Tokens (SETs)
    Using HTTP\" both require two or more HTTP\n   connections to exchange SETs between
    peers.  This is inefficient due\n   to the latency of setting up each communication.
    \ This specification\n   enables mutiple events to be transmitted in bi-directional\n
    \  transmission and reception of multiple SETs in one HTTP connection,\n   and
    enables them to do so over a single HTTP or WebSocket binding.\n\nAbout This Document\n\n

  content: "A critical factor in achieving good performance for IP mobility \nprotocols
    is the design of L2 handover. Handover occurs when a \nMobile Node moves from
    one radio Access Point to another. If the new \nradio Access Point is associated
    with a new subnet, a change in \nrouting reachability may occur and require L3
    protocol action on the \npart of the Mobile Node or Access Routers. If no change
    in subnet \noccurs, the Access Point may still need to take some action to \ninform
    the Access Router about a change in on-link reachability. In \neither case, prompt
    and timely information from L2 to the parties \ninvolved about the sequencing
    of handover can help optimize handover \nat the IP level. This draft discusses
    requirements for an L2 \nhandover protocol or API to support optimized handover.\n\t "

  content: "In wireless networks, there is a need to discover what types of \nnetworks
    are around a particular node. This need arises both when a \nnode connects initially
    to a network and when a node needs to perform \nhandover. Characteristics such
    as type of wireless technology, service \nprovider, bandwidth availability, etc.
    may all be of interest in making \na network connection or handover decision.
    In addition, a mobile node \nmay require a mapping between the Layer 2 access
    point identifier and \nIP link information such as the Mobile IPv4 foreign agent
    address, or \nIPv6 access router address and subnet prefixes, so that the node
    can \nconfigure itself for the new IP link prior to moving. This document \ndescribes
    the Neighborhood information Elements Discovery (NED) \nprotocol, for representing
    information elements that contain \nneighborhood information. The packet format
    presented in this document \nis independent of transport so that multiple mobility
    protocols can \nmake use of it.  \n\t "

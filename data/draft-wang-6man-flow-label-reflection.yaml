- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The current definition of the IPv6 Flow Label focuses mainly on how\n
    \  the packet source forms the value of this field and how the forwarder\n   in-path
    treats it.  In network operations, there are needs to\n   correlate an upstream
    session and the corresponding downstream\n   session together.  This document
    propose a flow label reflection\n   mechanism that network devices copy the flow
    label value from\n   received packets to the corresponding flow label field in
    return\n   packets.  This mechanism could simplify the network traffic\n   recognition
    process in network operations and make the policy for\n   both directions of traffic
    of one session consistent.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n
    \  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n   In
    particular, it describes managed objects for information related\n   to a Fibre
    Channel Zone Server.  At present, this memo is being\n   proposed to T11.5 (http://www.t11.org).
    \ The plan is that it will\n   later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working
    group.\n\t "

  content: "   Digital Crededentials on the Internet often JSON Web Token (JWT) and\n
    \  CBOR Web Token (CWT), which depends on third parties to certify the\n   keys
    used.  This document improves on that situation by enabling the\n   administrators
    of domain names to specify the keys used in that\n   domain's digital credentials.
    \ This is accomplished by describing how\n   to discover thumbprints for proof-of-possession
    keys, as described in\n   RFC 7800 and RFC 8747, using TLSA Records as described
    in RFC 6698.\n   This approach can be leveraged to develop revocation and assurance\n
    \  capabilities for digital credentials.\n\n\t "

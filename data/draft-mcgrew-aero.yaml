  content: "   This document describes Authenticated Encryption with Replay\n   prOtection
    (AERO), a cryptographic technique that provides all of the\n   essential security
    services needed for communication security.  AERO\n   offers several advantages
    over other methods: it has more compact\n   messages, provides stronger misuse
    resistance, avoids the need to\n   manage implicit state, and is simpler to use.
    \ This document defines\n   a particular AERO algorithm as well as a registry
    for such\n   algorithms.\n\n\t "

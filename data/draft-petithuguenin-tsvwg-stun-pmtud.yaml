  content: "   The datagram exchanged between two Internet endpoints have to go\n
    \  through a series of physical and virtual links that may have\n   different
    limits on the upper size of the datagram they can transmit\n   without fragmentation.
    \ Because fragmentation is considered harmful,\n   most transports and protocols
    are designed with a mechanism that\n   permits dynamic measurement of the maximum
    size of a datagram.  This\n   mechanism is called Packetization Layer Path MTU
    Discovery (PLPMTUD).\n   But the UDP transport and some of the protocols that
    use UDP were\n   designed without that feature.  The Session Traversal Utilities
    for\n   NAT (STUN) Usage described in this document permits retrofitting an\n
    \  existing UDP-based protocol with such a feature.  Similarly, a new\n   UDP-based
    protocol could simply reuse the mechanism described in this\n   document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Generalized MPLS[RFC 3031] suite of protocols has been defined
    to\n   control different switching technologies, such as TDM, Optical\n   Circuit
    Switching, and even Optical Fibre Switching. However, Optical\n   Burst Switching(OBS)[Qiao]
    is a promising optical switching\n   technology, which is expected to be deployed
    in optical network in\n   the very near future. Therefore, this document focuses
    mainly on how \n   to extend the architecture of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)[RFC
    3945] to\n   support Optical Burst Switching. Herein, the extensions consist in\n
    \  the following issues, i.e., signaling, routing and link management.\n   What
    more, the extended GMPLS architecture will be much more scalable\n   than before.
    Note that the extensions are not limited a certain OBS\n   signaling type, such
    as Just-In-Time or Just-Enough-Time, Wavelength-\n   Routed OBS or traditional
    OBS.\n\t "

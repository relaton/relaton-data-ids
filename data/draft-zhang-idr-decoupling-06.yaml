abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a novel mitigation scheme to protect the inter-
    domain data delivery during false routing announcements. A new path attribute
    is defined to Decouple propagation of a path and adoption of a path for data forwarding
    in BGP (DBGP). DBGP does not use suspicious paths for data forwarding, but still
    propagates them in the routing system to facilitate attack detection. It can extensively
    protect data delivery from routing announcements of false sub- prefixes, false
    origins, false nodes and false links, and works well with ongoing attack detection
    and prevention systems.</p>"

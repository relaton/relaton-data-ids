  content: "   DKIM associates a domain name with a message stream, using\n   cryptographic
    methods, to permit reliable and accurate reputation-\n   oriented analysis of
    the stream.  It is possible for an authorized\n   user to conspire for additional
    distribution of a message, leveraging\n   the domain name reputation for promoting
    spam.  This is called DKIM\n   Replay.  DKOR defines a means of limiting that
    ability, by\n   associating original addressing information with the message's
    DKIM\n   signature, to detect distribution beyond the intended recipient.\n   DKOR
    uses existing DKIM services and only requires implementation of\n   the additional
    DKOR features by the signer and any receiving site\n   wishing to participate
    in DKOR services.  Other DKIM receivers can\n   successfully process the same
    DKIM signature without knowledge of\n   DKOR.\n\n\t "

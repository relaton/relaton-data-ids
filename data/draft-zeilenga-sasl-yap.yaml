  content: "This document describes a password authentication mechanism, called  YAP-SHA-256-TLS-UNIQ,
    for use in protocols which support Simple\n  Authentication and Security Layer
    (SASL) framework.  The mechanism\n  relies on security services provided by a
    lower layer, such as\n  Transport Layer Security (TLS), to protect the authentication\n
    \ exchange, and subsequent application data exchange, from common\n  attacks.
    \ The YAP-SHA-256-TLS-UNIQ mechanism can be viewed as an\n  alternative to other
    password-based SASL mechanism, such as PLAIN,\n  CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an Enhanced Media Delivery Index (eMDI) that
    can be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring a network
    intended to deliver streaming media over TCP transport. It aims to address the
    problems that RFC4445 has when measuring in environments where TCP traffic is
    dominated as a transport for streaming media.</p>"

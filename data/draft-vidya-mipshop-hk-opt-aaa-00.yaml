  content: "AAA-HK [1] provides a method for a MN and an AR to establish a shared\nkey
    using a AAA server.  To ensure that the round trip to the AAA\nserver does not
    delay handoff, the handover key must be derived\nindependent of and well ahead
    of the actual handoff, preferably\nimmediately after moving to a new access router.
    \ This document\ndescribes one such method of optimizing the handover key derivation\nby
    using an AR as an authenticating server, once the MN and AR have\nestablished
    a security association.\n\n\t "

  content: "   HTTP Level multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case in BIER\n
    \  Use cases document.  HTTP Level Multicast is used in today's video\n   streaming
    and delivery services such as HLS, AR/VR etc., generally\n   realized over IP
    Multicast.  A realization of \"HTTP Multicast\" over\n   \"IP Multicast\" is described.
    \ IP multicast is commonly used for IPTV\n   services.  DVB and BBF is also developing
    a reference architecture\n   for IP Multicast service.  Few problems with IPMC,
    such as waste of\n   transmission bandwidth, increase in signaling when there
    are few\n   users are described.  Realization over BIER, through a BIER Multicast\n
    \  Overlay Layer, is described.  How BIER Multicast Overlay operation\n   improves
    over IP Multicast, such as reduction in signaling, dynamic\n   creation of multicast
    groups to reduce signaling and bandwidth\n   wastage is described.  We conclude
    with few next steps.\n\n\t "

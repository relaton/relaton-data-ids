  content: "   This document proposes a practical scheme to run the care-of address\n
    \  test (part of the Return Routability test for Mobile IPv6 route\n   optimization)
    in a proactive way in the context of the Fast Handovers\n   for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6)
    protocol, so that the latency caused by the\n   care-of address test after movements
    can be removed or reduced.\n   Proactive care-of address test can make the Return
    Rroutability\n   protocol more suitable for delay sensitive applications especially\n
    \  when it is applied in conjunction with other Return Routability\n   optimization
    schemes.\n\t "

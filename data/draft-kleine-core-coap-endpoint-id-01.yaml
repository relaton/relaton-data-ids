  content: "   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) (see [RFC7252]), is an\n
    \  application layer protocol for constrained devices (e.g.low power,\n   few
    memory) and networks (e.g. lossy, low bandwidth) which relies on\n   UDP on the
    transport layer.  With CoAP it is often the case, that\n   message exchanges need
    to extend the common request/response pattern,\n   e.g.  for seperate responses.
    \ This holds, e.g. for CON requests that\n   are confirmed by the server with
    an empty ACK and answered later with\n   a seperate response.  According to the
    CoAP specification the\n   request/response matching is realized using a unique
    pair of the\n   servers IP address and a token defined by the client.\n\n   Due
    to the mobile nature of some devices. e.g. smartphones, they are\n   often assigned
    new IP addresses because of a network change.  Thus,\n   the IP address of a CoAP
    server might change during an ongoing\n   conversation.  This draft proposes a
    method to assign each\n   communication partner with an identifier (endpoint ID)
    which replaces\n   the IP address as (partial) key to relate requests and responses.\n\n
    \  Besides the common seperate responses, the proposed method is also\n   useful
    to handle IP address changes, e.g.  during an ongoing\n   observation ([observe])
    or a blockwise transfer ([block]).\n\n\n\t "

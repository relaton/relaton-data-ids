  content: "The deployment and provisioning of multicast services must satisfy\ncertain
    network design constraints in the last mile. It is common\nfor a network design
    to have a small set of intelligent layer 3\ndevices (controllers) and a larger
    set of simpler layer 2 devices\n(aggregators). The controllers handle routing,
    user authentication\nand access control etc. They are connected via a network
    to the\naggregators closer to the clients. Special design is needed to\nsupport
    multicast over this network.\n\nThis draft proposes a Remote Multicast Replication
    (RMR) protocol,\nthat reduces or removes duplicate multicast traffic in between
    the\ncontrollers and the aggregators. The RMR protocol is independent\nof layer
    2 technology and topology being used.\n\t "

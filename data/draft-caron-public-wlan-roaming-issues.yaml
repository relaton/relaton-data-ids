  content: "Public wireless Internet access zones based on IEEE 802.11 [1] \nwireless
    LAN technology are becoming common. However, many issues \nare impeding further
    adoption of the technology by end-users, in \nparticular the inability or difficulty
    to roam between the networks \nof different providers. This document aims to document
    these issues, \nshow how they are different from roaming in other contexts such
    as \ndialup access to the Internet or GSM roaming, and how current \nsolutions
    do not fully address these issues. Future documents will \ntry to address these
    issues with practical solutions.\n\t "

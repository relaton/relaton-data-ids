  content: "The Internet protocol for internationalized domain names (IDNs) is\ndocumented
    in RFC 3490 and associated documents and commonly known as\nIDNA.  While that
    protocol was being developed (and more recently),\nthere were a number of alternate
    proposals and suggestions for\ndifferent ways to do IDNs.  IDNA was favored over
    those alternatives,\nbut variations on them seem to keep reappearing with the
    suggestion\nthat they are novel ideas.  This memo describes some of those\nsuggested
    alternatives and summarizes the reasons why they were not\nfavored over IDNA.\n\t "

  content: "   This document lists security threats related to IPv6 multihoming.\n
    \  Multihoming can introduce new opportunities to redirect packets to\n   different,
    unintended IP addresses.\n\n   The intent is to look at how IPv6 multihoming solutions
    might make\n   the Internet less secure than the current Internet, without studying\n
    \  any proposed solution but instead looking at threats that are\n   inherent
    in the problem itself.  The threats in this document build\n   upon the threats
    discovered and discussed as part of the Mobile IPv6\n   work.\n\t "

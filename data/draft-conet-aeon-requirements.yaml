  content: "   Identification and treatment of application flows are important to\n
    \  many application providers and network operators.  Historically, this\n   functionality
    has been implemented to the extent possible using\n   heuristics, which inspect
    and infer flow characteristics.  But many\n   application flows in current usages
    are dynamic, adaptive, time-\n   bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer, asymmetric, used
    on multipurpose\n   devices, and have different priorities depending on direction
    of\n   flow, user preferences, and other factors.  Any combination of these\n
    \  properties renders heuristic based techniques less effective and may\n   result
    in compromises to application security or user privacy.  The\n   document states
    requirements for a solution that enables\n   identification and treatment of application
    flows without suffering\n   the limitations that plague existing solutions.\n\n\t "

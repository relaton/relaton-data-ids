  content: "   The [RFC2581] provides a mechanism to indicate the congestion\n   information
    of the network to the source.  In this draft, time \n   shifting of the signal
    before usage is suggested. The time \n   shifting operation effectively counters
    the impact of the self \n   similarity of the traffic that originates in a DiffServe
    network \n   model as a result of the aggregation. \n\n\t "

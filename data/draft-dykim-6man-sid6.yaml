- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Deprecation of the subnet ID in IPv6 networking is proposed; the\n
    \  subnet ID is set to zero so that all nodes in a site carry the same\n   prefix.
    \ While the procedures for neighbor discovery and duplicate\n   address detection
    have to be changed, possible simplification gains\n   in IPv6 networking including
    that of intra-site host- and subnet-\n   mobility might be worth the modification.
    \ Site-external behaviors\n   don't change through this modification, enabling
    incremental\n   deployment of the proposal.  Sites of manageable sizes for which\n
    \  scalability is not much a critical issue might consider the mode of\n   operation
    proposed in this document.\n\n\t "

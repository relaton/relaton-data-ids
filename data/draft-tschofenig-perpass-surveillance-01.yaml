  content: "   Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's\n
    \  communications or activities.  Surveillance is one of several privacy\n   /security
    threats engineers try to take into account in their\n   designs.  The reports
    about pervasive monitoring of Internet traffic\n   have, however, surprised many
    since the scale was not envisaged\n   during the design of many Internet protocols
    even though the ambition\n   to offer end-to-end security on the Internet dates
    back even to the\n   70ies.  The approach to get access to meta-data as well as
    to\n   communication content has taken forms that are largely\n   indistinguishable
    from ordinary attacks.\n\n   This document explains the attacks in context of
    the larger Internet\n   eco-system.\n\n\t "

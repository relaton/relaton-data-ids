  content: "This document discusses problems arising out of the use of Mobile IP in
    a security conscious Internet and presents a list of solution requirements deemed
    important. These problems may need to be resolved in several stages. A priority
    order in which these problems should be solved is also proposed.                                                                  All
    firewalls are assumed to implement standard mechanisms [RFCs 1825,1826,1827] for
    authentication and encryption proposed by the IPSec working group of the IETF.\n\t "

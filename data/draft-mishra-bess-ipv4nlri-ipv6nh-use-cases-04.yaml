  script: Latn
  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or\n
    \  green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport such as MPLS LDPv6, SR-\n   MPLSv6
    or SRv6, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role\n   in the transition
    of the core from IPv4 to IPv6 being able to\n   continue to support legacy IPv4,
    VPN-IPv4, and Multicast VPN IPv4\n   customers.\n\n   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)
    specifies that the set of usable next-hop\n   address families is determined by
    the Address Family Identifier (AFI)\n   and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI).  Historically\n   the AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family
    only have\n   provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the\n
    \  IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 or VPN-IPv4 Network Layer\n   Reachability
    Information (NLRI).  [RFC5549] specifies the extensions\n   necessary to allow
    advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next\n   Hop address that belongs
    to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an\n   extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions
    to allow the address of the\n   Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also
    belong to the IPv6\n   Protocol.  [RFC5549] defines the encoding of the Next Hop
    to\n   determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and\n
    \  a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover\n   whether
    they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6\n   Next Hop.\n\n   With
    this new MP-BGP capability exchange allows the BGP peering\n   session to act
    as a pure transport to allow the session to carry\n   Address Family Identifier
    (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family\n   Identifier (SAFI) for both IPv4 and
    IPv6.\n\n   This document describes the critical use case and OPEX savings of\n
    \  being able to leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange usage as a pure\n   transport
    allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over the same BGP\n   TCP session.  By
    doing so, allows for the elimination of Dual\n   Stacking on the PE-CE connections
    making the peering IPv6-ONLY to now\n   carry both IPv4 and IPv6 Network Layer
    Reachability Information\n   (NLRI).  This document also provides a possible solution
    for IXPs\n   (Internet Exchange points) that are facing IPv4 address depletion
    at\n   these peering points to use BGP-MP capability exchange defined in\n   [RFC5549]
    to carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI\n   in an IPv6 next
    hop using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.\n\n\t "

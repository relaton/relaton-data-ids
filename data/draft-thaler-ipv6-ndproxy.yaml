  content: "Bridging multiple links into a single entity has several\noperational
    advantages.  A single subnet prefix is sufficient to\nsupport multiple physical
    links.  There is no need to allocate\nsubnet numbers to the different networks,
    simplifying management.\nBridging some types of media requires network-layer support,\nhowever.
    \ This document describes these cases and specifies the\nIP-layer support that
    enables bridging under these circumstances.\n\t "

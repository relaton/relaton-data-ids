  content: "   This document introduces AI Network Traffic Optimization Agents as
    a\n   dynamic alternative to traditional static network optimization\n   methods.
    \ These AI entities analyze real-time network status (e.g.,\n   latency, node
    load) and adjust resources flexibly—deployed centrally\n   or on devices—to enhance
    efficiency, ensure service quality, and cut\n   operational costs.  It defines
    network traffic optimization\n   (maximizing resource use, meeting QoS) and AI
    agents (autonomous,\n   learning entities that reduce manual work), then details
    three key\n   application scenarios: tunnel adjustment (adaptive routing,\n   predictive
    bandwidth, fault recovery), traffic steering\n   (classification, application-aware
    policies, pre-emptive load\n   balancing), and network slice adjustment (lifecycle
    automation, SLA\n   compliance, slice-specific fault fixes).  The document emphasizes
    the\n   agents’ role in enabling SLA-compliant, autonomous optimization for\n
    \  complex networks.\n\n\t "

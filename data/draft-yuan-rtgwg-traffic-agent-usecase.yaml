abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces AI Network Traffic Optimization Agents as
    a dynamic alternative to traditional static network optimization methods. These
    AI entities analyze real-time network status (e.g., latency, node load) and adjust
    resources flexibly—deployed centrally or on devices—to enhance efficiency, ensure
    service quality, and cut operational costs. It defines network traffic optimization
    (maximizing resource use, meeting QoS) and AI agents (autonomous, learning entities
    that reduce manual work), then details three key application scenarios: tunnel
    adjustment (adaptive routing, predictive bandwidth, fault recovery), traffic steering
    (classification, application-aware policies, pre-emptive load balancing), and
    network slice adjustment (lifecycle automation, SLA compliance, slice-specific
    fault fixes). The document emphasizes the agents’ role in enabling SLA-compliant,
    autonomous optimization for complex networks.</p>"

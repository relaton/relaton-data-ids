  content: "The set up of a full mesh of MPLS TE LSPs among a set of Label Switch
    \nRouter (LSR) is common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic \nEngineering either
    for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees \nor fast rerouting with MPLS
    Fast Reroute. Such deployment requires \nthe configuration of potentially a large
    number of TE LSPs (on the \norder of the square of the number LSRs). This document
    specifies IGP \n(OSPF and IS-IS) traffic engineering extensions so as to provide
    an \nautomatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh, leading to \nan
    automatic mechanism to set up TE LSP mesh(es) (also referred to as \na mesh-group
    in this document).  \n\t "

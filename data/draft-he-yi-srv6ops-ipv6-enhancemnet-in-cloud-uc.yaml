  content: "   This document outlines the use cases for implementing IPv6\n   enhancement
    techniques in cloud, motivated by the increasing demand\n   for collabration between
    cloud and network.  The capabilities of IPv6\n   and IPv6 enhancement in most
    cloud service are not ready, such as\n   Service Function Chain based on SRv6,
    Performance measurement based\n   on IPv6.If we want to realize these capabilities
    of IPv6 enhancement\n   end-to-end, we can use a Virtual Incloud Router as anagent
    which\n   support IPv6 and IPv6 enhancement.\n\n\t "

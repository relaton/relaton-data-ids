- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document proposes how PCN marks can be encoded into the IP\nheader.
    \ The presented encoding reuses the ECN field of the Voice-\nAdmit DSCP in a single
    PCN domain.  The encoding of unmarked PCN\npackets indicates whether they are
    subject to either excess- or\nexhaustive-marking.  This is useful, e.g., when
    data and probe\npackets require different marking mechanisms.\n\nStatus\n\nThis
    memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually\nbe published
    as an experimental RFC.\n\t "

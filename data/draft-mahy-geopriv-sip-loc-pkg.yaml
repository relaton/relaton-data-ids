  content: "\n   This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event\n
    \  package to dereference raw location data about named SIP resources\n   (as
    opposed to presence data with embedded filtered location) as a\n   GEOPRIV Using
    Protocol.  The resulting location information is\n   conveyed in existing location
    formats wrapped in GEOPRIV privacy\n   extensions to the Presence Information
    Document Format (PIDF-LO).  In\n   the envisioned usage, location disclosure is
    limited to voluntary\n   disclosure to the target of its own location or to a
    trusted service\n\n   (such as a presence server) which enforces the target's
    privacy rules\n   on the target's behalf.\n\n\t "

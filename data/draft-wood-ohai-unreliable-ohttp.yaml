  content: "   This document describes an extension to Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) that\n
    \  supports unreliable application data transfer from Client to Target.\n   Beyond
    enabling application uses that do not require explicit\n   responses from the
    Target, such as privacy-preserving data\n   collection, this extension allows
    the Oblivious Relay Resource to\n   buffer, batch, and shuffle requests to Oblivious
    Gateway Resources as\n   a way of amplifying end-to-end client privacy protections.\n\n\t "

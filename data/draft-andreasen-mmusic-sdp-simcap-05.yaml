  content: "This document defines a set of Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes
    that enables SDP to provide a minimal and backwards compatible capability declaration
    mechanism.  Such capability declarations can be used as input to a subsequent
    session negotiation, which is done by means outside the scope of this document.
    \ This provides a simple and limited solution to the general capability negotiation
    problem being addressed by the next generation of SDP, also known as SDPng. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

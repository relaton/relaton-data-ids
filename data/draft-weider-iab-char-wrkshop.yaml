  content: "This report details the conclusions of an IAB-sponsored invitational workshop
    held 29 February - 1 March, 1996, to discuss the use of character sets on the
    Internet.  It motivates the need to have character set handling in Internet protocols
    which transmit text, provides a conceptual framework for specifying character
    sets, recommends the use of MIME tagging for transmitted text, recommends a default
    character set *without* stating that there is no need for other character sets,
    and makes a series of recommendations to the IAB, IANA, and the IESG for furthering
    the integration of the character set framework into text transmission protocols.
    \ This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not
    specify an Internet standard of any kind.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a Generic stream Unidirectional Lightweight
    \n   Encapsulation (GULE) mechanism for the transport of IPv4 and IPv6 \n   Datagrams
    and other network protocol packets directly over the DVB \n   S2 Generic Stream.
    This specifies a base encapsulation format and \n   supports an extension format
    that allows it to carry additional \n   header information to assist in network/Receiver
    processing. \n    \n   Internet-Drafts can be and are used to describe technical
    issues and \n   protocols that are of interest to the Internet community but that
    \n   are not finally standardised within the IETF. This is such a \n   document.
    It is intended for open discussion, but there is no \n   current plan to publish
    this as an Internet RFC. \n\t "

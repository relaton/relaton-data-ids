  content: "  This document describes a mechanism that provides Mobile IP nodes\n
    \ and agents with the necessary keys and information\n  needed to establish mobility
    security associations within a\n  foreign network. This mechanism aims at reducing
    the latency and\n  computational burden introduced by public-key based key management\n
    \ protocols in network topologies where visiting mobile nodes register\n  with
    their respective home agents several times through different\n  foreign agents
    requiring Mobile-Foreign Authentication. This\n  mechanism employs a key distribution
    center capable of generating\n  the security contexts needed to authenticate Mobile
    IP control\n  messages. This mechanism, designed as an extension to the Mobile
    IP\n  protocol, preservs backward compatibility and interoperability with\n  RFC2002
    compliant implementations of Mobile IP.\n\n\t "

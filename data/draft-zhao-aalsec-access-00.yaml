  content: "     Due to the seriously resource-constrained and easily attacked character\n
    \    of Low Power and Lossy Networks-LNs, security becomes even harder to be\n
    \    deployed. Here we present an AAL security scheme to protect devices in\n
    \    AAL layer to help protect to communicate with each other safely including\n
    \    a special key management, encryption, authentication and other security\n
    \    measures.\n\n     \n\t "

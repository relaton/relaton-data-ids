  content: "IPsec suite has been designed to secure communication between two\nnodes.
    \ Security is performed at the network layer, and there are\nalmost no interactions
    between applications and the IPsec layer.  The\nmain motivation of this API is
    to enable any applications to interact\nwith the IPsec layer and to take advantage
    of the security deployed\nin IPsec suite.  This draft lists applications requirements
    with\nregard to the IPsec suite, and we tried not to limit the requirements\nto
    today's application requirements, but also to consider future\napplications' requirements.
    \ Applications are associated to different\nprivileges, and IPsec layer MUST be
    protected from nasty IPsec\nmanipulations.  This draft is not considering applications
    privileges\nmanagement.  This draft lists any possible requirements on the IPsec\nlayer
    an application might require.\n\t "

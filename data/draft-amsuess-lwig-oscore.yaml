  content: "   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) is a\n
    \  means of end-to-end protection of short request/response exchanges\n   for
    tiny devices, typically transported using the Constrained\n   Application Protocol
    (CoAP).  This document aims to assist\n   implementers in leveraging the optimizations
    catered for by the\n   combination of CoAP and OSCORE, and by generally providing
    experience\n   from earlier implementations.\n\n\t "

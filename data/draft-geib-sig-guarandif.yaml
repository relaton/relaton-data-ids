  content: "On demand Internet services with guaranteed throughput are the major\ndriver
    behind QoS signaling architectures. Guaranteeing throughput\nbetween two defined
    points of a DiffServ network requires a\ncombination of flow information and Per
    Hop Behaviour. Handling\naggregates instead of flows as specified by the DiffServ\narchitecture
    is the most reasonable attempt to do so. This document\ndescribes an architecture
    using DiffServ mechanisms to provide\non demand throughput guarantees between
    two points of a DiffServ\nnetwork.\n\t "

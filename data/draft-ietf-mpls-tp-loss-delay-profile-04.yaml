  content: "Procedures and protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and accurate measurement
    of packet loss, delay, and throughput in MPLS networks are defined in RFC 6374.\n\n
    The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable
    to the construction and operation of packet- switched transport networks.\n\n
    This document describes a profile of the general MPLS loss, delay, and throughput
    measurement techniques that suffices to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-TP.\n\n
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) /
    International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector
    (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire
    Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

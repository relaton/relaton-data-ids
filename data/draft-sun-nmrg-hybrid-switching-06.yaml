  script: Latn
  content: "   The fast increase in traffic volumn within and outside Datacenters
    is\n   placing an unprecendented challenge on the underline network, in both\n
    \  the capacity it can provide, and the way it delivers traffic.  When a\n   large
    portion of network traffic is contributed by large flows,\n   providing high capacity
    and slow to change optical circuit switching\n   along side fine-granular packet
    services may potentially improve\n   network utility and reduce both CAPEX and
    OpEX.  This gives rise to\n   the concept of hybrid switching - a paradigm that
    seeks to make the\n   best of packet and circuit switching.\n\n   However, the
    full potential of hybrid switching networks (HSNs) can\n   only be realized when
    such a network is optimally designed and\n   operated, in the sense that \"an
    appropriate amount of resource is\n   used to handle an appropriate amount of
    traffic in both switching\n   planes.\"  The resource allocation problem in HSNs
    is in fact complex\n   ineractions between three components: resource allocation
    between the\n   two switching planes, traffic partitioning between the two switching\n
    \  planes, and the overall cost or performance constraints.\n\n   In this memo,
    we explore the challenges of planning and operating\n   hybrid switching networks,
    with a particular focus on the resource\n   allocation problem, and provide a
    high-level model that may guide\n   resource allocation in future hybrid switching
    networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   With the rapid development of large language models, many emerging
    AI\n   scenarios require tunnel-based lossless transmission of RDMA packets\n
    \  in WAN.  To fulfill this requirement, WAN should support the real-\n   time
    notification of network conditions to ensure high throughput,\n   low latency,
    and zero packet loss data transmission.  The current\n   reactive notification
    solution is limited by responsiveness,\n   coverage, and operational overhead.
    \ Therefore, we need to establish\n   a faster and proactive notification mechanism
    to implement more\n   responsive Traffic Engineering and Load Balancing.\n\n   This
    draft first describes typical scenarios for tunnel-based RDMA\n   lossless transmission
    in WAN, then specifies the fast notification\n   framework for implementing key
    TE areas (congestion control,\n   protection, and load balance), and finally analyses
    the protocol\n   implementation for fast notification.\n\n\t "

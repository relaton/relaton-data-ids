  content: "RTP retransmission is an effective packet loss recovery technique for
    real-time applications with relaxed delay bounds.  This document describes an
    RTP payload format for performing retransmissions.  Retransmitted RTP packets
    are sent in a separate stream from the original RTP stream.  It is assumed that
    feedback from receivers to senders is available.  In particular, it is assumed
    that Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback as defined in the extended
    RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback (denoted RTP/AVPF) is available in this memo.

  script: Latn
  content: "The service location protocol provides a framework for the discovery and
    selection of network services.  It relies on multicast support at the network
    layer of the protocol stack it is using.  It does not specifically rely upon the
    TCP/IP protocol stack but makes use of concepts that are found in most TCP/IP
    protocol implementations.       Traditionally, users find services using the name
    of a network host (a human readable text string) which is an alias for a network
    address. The service location protocol eliminates the need for a user to know
    the name of a network host supporting a service.  Rather, the user supplies a
    set of attributes which describe the service.  The service location protocol allows
    the user to bind this description to the network address of the service.\n\t "

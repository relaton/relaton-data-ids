  content: "   This document describes a proactive mechanism to provide fast-\n   handover
    involving PMIPv6.  In particular, it describes how one can\n   achieve fast handoff
    for PMIPv6 using Media-independent Pre-\n   Authentication (MPA) technique.  It
    discusses the need for a fast-\n   handoff for PMIPv6 environment.  It then describes
    how MPA techniques\n   could be used during different steps involving both intra-domain
    and\n   inter-domain handoff for PMIPv6.  MPA-based fast-handover takes\n   advantage
    of the pre-authentication mechanism so that the mobile can\n   perform the access
    authentication while in the previous local\n   mobility (PMA) domain and thus
    would be able to complete many of the\n   handoff related operations while still
    in the previous network.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document explains how to use the Parallel Network File System\n
    \  (pNFS) SCSI NVMe Layout Types with transports using the\n   NVMe over Fabrics
    protocols. This draft picks the previous SCSI\n   over NVMe draft of C. Hellwig
    and extended it to support all the\n   types of transport protocols supported
    by NVMe transport over fabrics\n   additional to the SCSI transport protocol introduced
    in pNFS SCSI\n   Layout. The proposed transport protocols include support for\n
    \  several transports and fabrics and support the RDMA transports.\n\n\t "

  content: "The computation of one or a series of Traffic Engineering Label \n   Switched
    Paths (TE LSP) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and \n   Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS) networks, is subject to a set of one or more \n   specific optimization
    criteria(s), referred to as an objective \n   function (e.g. minimum cost path,
    widest path, etc.). A Path \n   Computation Element (PCE) may support one or multiple
    objective \n   functions, and it is desired for a Path Computation Client (PCC)
    to \n   automatically discover the set of objective functions supported by a \n
    \  PCE. Furthermore, it may be useful for a PCC to specify in a path \n   computation
    request the required objective function used by the PCE \n   to compute a TE LSP
    or a set of TE LSPs. Thus the aim of this \n   document is to define extensions
    to the PCE Discovery (PCED) TLV \n   carried within the IS-IS Router Capability
    TLV and the OSPF Router \n   Information LSA so as to allow a PCC to discover
    the set of objective \n   functions supported by a PCE. Extensions to the PCE
    communication \n   Protocol (PCEP) are also specified allowing a PCC to indicate
    in a \n   path computation request the required objective function and a PCE to
    \n   indicate in a path computation reply the objective function actually \n   applied.\n\t "

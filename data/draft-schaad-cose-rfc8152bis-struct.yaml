  content: "   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed\n
    \  for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for the\n   ability
    to have basic security services defined for this data format.\n   This document
    defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)\n   protocol.  This specification
    describes how to create and process\n   signatures, message authentication codes,
    and encryption using CBOR\n   for serialization.  This specification additionally
    describes how to\n   represent cryptographic keys using CBOR.\n\n   This document
    along with [I-D.schaad-cose-rfc8152bis-algs] obsoletes\n   RFC8152.\n\n\t "

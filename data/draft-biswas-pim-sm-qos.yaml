  content: "This document describes a framework for QoS-aware multicast routing\nbased
    on enhancements to PIM-SM. This framework has two components:\nthe development
    of multicast tree computation schemes that account\nfor heterogeneous receiver
    QoS requirements, and the incorporation\nof QoS capabilities into PIM-SM for establishing
    computed paths.\nThe choice of PIM-SM is based on its ability to support\nreceiver-initiated
    join, both shared and source-specific trees. Two\ndecentralized tree computation
    schemes, TIQM and NUQM, are\nconsidered in this document, both requiring support
    from the\nunderlying unicast routing scheme to acquire link and nodal resource\navailability
    information. Additionally, TIQM requires complete\ninformation at each router
    about the resource allocation in the\nnetwork for the existing multicast tree.
    After a brief analysis of\nthese two schemes, the incorporation of QoS awareness
    in PIM-SM with\nNUQM as its underlying route computation mechanism is presented.
    It\nis shown that with few extensions to its existing control syntaxes,\nPIM-SM
    can be successfully used for QoS integration. Finally, a Tree\nState Update (TSU)
    mechanism, which can be used for efficient and\nscalable dissemination of multicast
    tree state information, is\nproposed. It is shown that by using the proposed TSU
    protocol it is\npossible to partially alleviate the control overhead of TIQM.\n\n\n\n\t "

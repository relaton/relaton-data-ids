  content: "This document shows that short TCP sessions are prone to timeout. In\nparticular,
    one single segment loss will provoke TCP to timeout if the\ndocument size is below
    certain threshold. This document analyzes the\nbenefit of TCP modifications such
    as Limited Transmit Algorithm\n[RFC3042] and Increasing Initial Window [RFC2414]
    in the context of\nshort-lived TCP transfers. However TCP remains vulnerable to
    the losses\nat the very end of the transmission. Therefore we suggest complementary\nmodifications
    to Limited Transmit Algorithm to recover effectively from\nlosses at the end of
    the TCP transfer.\n\n\t "

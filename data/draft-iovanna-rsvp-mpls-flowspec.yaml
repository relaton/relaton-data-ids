  content: "The support of QoS Differentiation in MPLS is based on the definition
    of \n\ntwo types of LSP, respectively E-LSP and L-LSP (see [11]). Both E-LSP \n\nand
    L-LSP can be established with bandwidth reservation. In this case \n\nbandwidth
    requirements for the LSP must be signaled at LSP establishment \n\ntime, in order
    to perform admission control in the LSRs in the path. If \n\nRSVP-TE is used as
    setup protocol, it has to support the signaling of \n\nbandwidth requirements
    for the LSPs. In this document we extend the \n\nRSVP-TE capability by defining
    a new type of Sender_Tspec (and \n\nFlowSpec), explicitly designed to allow signaling
    of bandwidth \n\nrequirements for E-LSP and L-LSP set up. This new type, called
    MPLS \n\nSender_Tspec (MPLS FlowSpec), can include bandwidth requirements for
    \n\ndifferent classes inside the LSP.  \n\n\n\t "

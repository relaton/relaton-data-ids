  script: Latn
  content: "   For future vehicular networks, some advanced features might be needed\n
    \  to facilitate use cases as platooning, proximity service awareness,\n   autonomous
    driving and so forth. Thus, this draft intends to present\n   two functions, known
    as vehicular grouping and socialization, for\n   enabling some future-oriented
    use cases. These two functions could be\n   built upon cross-layer identifiers,
    such as MAC, IP, and ID, which\n   also have potential to formulate more value-added
    services for future\n   vehicular networks.\n\n\n\t "

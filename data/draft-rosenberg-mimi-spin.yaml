  content: "   This document introduces a framework and a protocol for facilitating\n
    \  voice, video and messaging interoperability between application\n   providers.
    \ This work is motivated by the recent passage of\n   regulation in the European
    Union - the Digital Markets Act (DMA) -\n   which, amongst many other provisions,
    requires that vendors of\n   applications with a large number of users enable
    interoperability\n   with applications made by other vendors.  While such interoperability\n
    \  is broadly present within the public switched telephone network, it\n   is
    not yet commonplace between over-the-top applications, such as\n   Facetime, WhatsApp,
    and Facebook Messenger.  This document\n   specifically defines the Simple Protocol
    for Inviting Numbers (SPIN)\n   which is used to deliver invitations to mobile
    phone numbers that can\n   bootstrap subsequent communications over the Internet.\n\n\t "

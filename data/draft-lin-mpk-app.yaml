  content: "A traditional X.509 v3 certificate format contains\nonly one public key.
    Nowadays, many Internet\napplications like SET, S/MIME and IPSEC etc. need\nmore
    than one public key. This document describes a\nMultiple-Public-Key (MPK) certificate
    format to\ninclude multiple public keys in a digital\ncertificate. The MPK certificate
    format is not only\ncompatible with X.509 v3 certificate format; but also\ncan
    reduce the length of multiple certificates and\nspeed up the verification time
    needed for multiple\npublic keys.\n\t "

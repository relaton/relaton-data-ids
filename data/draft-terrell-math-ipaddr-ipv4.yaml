  content: "This paper was necessitated by an overwhelming desire. An attempt to\nend
    the disparity in the dissemination of information which is absent\nof the logical
    and thoroughness in rendering an explanation of the IP\nAddressing Scheme. To
    render a more pointed fact, I needed to pass a\nCISCO Certification Examination.
    However, this can never be\naccomplished, if the information that is needed and
    used in the\npreparation thereof, lacks continuity and propagates errors pertaining\nto
    foundational information. That is,as a direct result of this\nundertaking, I corrected
    \ the underlining errors, derived a possible\nalternative approach to the IPv4
    Addressing Scheme, and expanded its\nClass system ( that is no longer in use ).
    In other words, I was\nindeed successful in the elimination of the problems associated
    with\nIP Address Flooding inherent in IPv4 and the complexities of IPv6.\nIn short,
    small business and single family dwellings can now have the\noption of having
    their own private IP Addressing Scheme, without the\ndisparity resulting from
    the steep learning curve presented in IPv6.\nWhile the Internet Community at large,
    will not suffer a shortage of\nthe availability IP Addresses for assigned distribution.
    Especially\nsince, while the number available IP Addresses do not exceed the\namount
    reported to be provided, if IPv6 is implemented. It does\nindeed, provide enough
    IP Addresses to cover their continued issuance\nfor at least another 100 years
    or so. Which is dependent upon the\nadoption of an adequate scheme for its allocation
    and distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

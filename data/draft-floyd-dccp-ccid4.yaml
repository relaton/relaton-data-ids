  content: "This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier\n
    \  4, the Small-Packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in\n   the
    Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  CCID 4 is for\n   experimental use,
    and uses TFRC-SP [RFC4828], a variant of TFRC\n   designed for applications that
    send small packets.  The goal for\n   TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth
    in bits per second\n   (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but\n
    \  experiencing the same level of congestion.  CCID 4 is for\n   experimental
    use for senders that send small packets and would like a\n   TCP-friendly sending
    rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion\n   Notification (ECN), while minimizing
    abrupt rate changes.\n\t "

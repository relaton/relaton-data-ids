  content: "   The Domain Name System (DNS) relies on caching to function\n   efficiently.
    \ However, DNS cache poisoning remains a significant\n   threat.  The \"bailiwick\"
    rule is a fundamental security mechanism\n   intended to prevent resolvers from
    caching out-of-bailiwick data sent\n   by malicious or misconfigured authoritative
    servers.  Current DNS\n   standards provide high-level guidance on bailiwick checking
    but lack\n   specific algorithmic definitions, leading to inconsistent\n   implementations
    across different DNS software.  These inconsistencies\n   can be exploited, particularly
    in DNS servers that operate in\n   multiple modes, such as Conditional DNS Servers
    (CDNS), which may act\n   as both recursive resolvers and forwarders and often
    share a common\n   cache.\n\n   This document specifies enhanced and more precise
    rules for bailiwick\n   checking in DNS resolvers, including those operating as
    forwarders or\n   CDNS.  The goal is to provide clearer guidelines for implementers,\n
    \  reduce the attack surface for cache poisoning, and improve the\n   overall
    security and robustness of the DNS infrastructure.  The\n   recommendations herein
    are informed by recent research highlighting\n   vulnerabilities in existing bailiwick
    implementations.\n\n\t "

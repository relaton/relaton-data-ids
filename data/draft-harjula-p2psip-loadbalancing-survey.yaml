  content: "   Load balancing in structured (DHT-based) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems\n
    \  has been thoroughly studied during the past years.  This draft\n   provides
    a review of the existing and proposed load balancing\n   mechanisms for structured
    P2P systems, categorizes them to four\n   fundamental load balancing models, and
    introduces their main\n   characteristics.\n\t "

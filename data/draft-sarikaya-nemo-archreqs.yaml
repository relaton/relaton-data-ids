  content: "While traditional mobility support deals with providing continuous \nInternet
    connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support), \nnetwork mobility support
    means dealing with situations where an \nentire network changes its point of attachment
    to the Internet. Such \na network is called a mobile network. This document identifies
    \narchitectural entities of network mobility and nested network \nmobility. \n\t "

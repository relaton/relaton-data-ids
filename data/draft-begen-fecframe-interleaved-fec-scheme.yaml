  content: "This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction\n(FEC)
    Scheme for the one-dimensional (1-D) interleaved parity code\nand its application
    to reliable delivery of media streams in the\ncontext of FEC Framework.  The 1-D
    interleaved parity code is a\nsystematic code, where a number of repair symbols
    are generated from\na set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows
    in\naddition to the source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s)\nwithin a
    source flow.  The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good\nprotection against
    bursty packet losses at a cost of decent\ncomplexity.  This document extends the
    FEC header defined in RFC 2733\nand registers a new RTP payload format for the
    FEC that is generated\nby the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media
    encapsulated\nin RTP.  This new payload format is compatible with and used as
    a\npart of the DVB Application-layer FEC Specification.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) \nauthentication,
    as described in RFC3315, makes use of a model \ndescribed in RFC3118. The DHCP
    threat model is described in RFC3118. \nHowever, RFC3118 does not discuss the
    distribution of keys to the \nserver and the client. It assumes that the keys
    are transferred to \nthe server and client using out of band mechanisms. \n\nThis
    draft proposes to make use of the security association that the \nclient shares
    with its home Authentication, Authorization and \nAccounting (AAA) servers. The
    security association between the client \nand server are established during DHCPv6
    messaging. This document \nspecifies options to DHCPv6 messages that can be used
    to create \nDHCPv6 Security Associations between the client and server. \n\n\t "

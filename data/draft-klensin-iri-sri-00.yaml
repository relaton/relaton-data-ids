abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   While the URI specification has been widely deployed, it has long\n
    \  been recognized that many valid URIs, especially those that contain\n   extensive
    information in the \"tail\" are unsuitable for user\n   presentation, especially
    for internationalized environments.  IRIs\n   have been proposed as a solution
    for that problem but inherit (and\n   are constrained by) the complex and sometimes
    method-dependent syntax\n   model of URIs as well as positional and ordering assumptions
    that\n   make them more difficult to localize than is desirable.\n\n   This specification
    illustrates a way to define an \"above URI\" model\n   for a localization-friendly
    simple reference identifier (SRI) that\n   explicitly identifies fields and is
    more appropriate than IRIs to\n   support localization.  The current version is
    intended simply to\n   initiate a discussion.  In particular, while it is written
    to use an\n   XML element syntax model, variations using JSON or some other system\n
    \  with explicitly-labeled data fields might be as, or more,\n   appropriate.\n\n\t "

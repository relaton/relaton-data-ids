  content: "   This document discusses the motivation and requirements for\n   supporting
    interactive network queries and data collection through a\n   mechanism called
    Dynamic Network Probes (DNP).  Network applications\n   and OAM have various data
    requirements from the data plane.  The\n   unpredictable and interactive nature
    of the query for network data\n   analytics asks for dynamic and on-demand data
    collection\n   capabilities.  As user programmable and configurable data plane
    is\n   becoming a reality, it can be extended to support interactive query\n   through
    DNPs.  DNP supports node, path, and flow-based data\n   preprocessing and collection.
    \ For example, in-situ OAM (iOAM) with\n   user-defined flow-based data collection
    can be programmed and\n   configured through DNP.  DNPs serve as a building block
    of an\n   integrated network data telemetry and analytics platform which\n   involves
    the network data plane as an active component for user-\n   defined data collection
    and preparation.\n\n\t "

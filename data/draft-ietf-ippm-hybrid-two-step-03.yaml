  content: "   The development and advancements in network operation automation have\n
    \  brought new measurement methodology requirements.  mong them is the\n   ability
    to collect instant network state as the packet being\n   processed by the networking
    elements along its path through the\n   domain.  That task can be solved using
    on-path telemetry, also called\n   hybrid measurement.  An on-path telemetry method
    allows the\n   collection of essential information that reflects the operational\n
    \  state and network performance experienced by the packet.  This\n   document
    introduces a method complementary to on-path telemetry that\n   causes the generation
    of telemetry information.  This method,\n   referred to as Hybrid Two-Step (HTS),
    separates the act of measuring\n   and/or calculating the performance metric from
    collecting and\n   transporting network state.  The HTS packet traverses the same
    set of\n   nodes and links as the trigger packet, thus simplifying the\n   correlation
    of informational elements originating on nodes traversed\n   by the trigger packet.\n\n\t "

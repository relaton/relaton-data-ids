abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The use of large-scale IP address sharing technologies (commonly\n
    \  known as \"Carrier-Grade NAT\" and \"A+P\") presents a challenge for law\n
    \  enforcement agencies due to the fact that incoming source port\n   information
    is not routinely logged by Internet-facing servers.  The\n   absence of this information
    means that it is becoming increasingly\n   difficult for law enforcement agencies
    to identify suspects in\n   criminal activity online.  This document considers
    the reasons why\n   source port information is not routinely logged by Internet-facing\n
    \  servers and makes recommendations to help improve the situation.  A\n   deployment
    maturity model has been developed and a study of the\n   support for logging incoming
    source port information in common server\n   software is also presented.\n\n\t "

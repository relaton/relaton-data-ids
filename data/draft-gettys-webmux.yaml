  content: "This document defines the experimental multiplexing protocol referred
    to as\n'WebMUX'. WebMUX is a session management protocol separating the underlying\ntransport
    from the upper level application protocols. It provides a lightweight\ncommunication
    channel to the application layer by multiplexing data streams on\ntop of a reliable
    stream oriented transport. By supporting coexistence of\nmultiple application
    level protocols (e.g. HTTP and HTTP/NG), WebMUX should ease\ntransitions to future
    Web protocols, and communications of client applets using\nprivate protocols with
    servers over the same TCP connection as the HTTP\nconversation.\n \nWebMUX is
    intended for, but by no means restricted to, transport of Web related\nprotocols;
    the name has been chosen to reduce confusion with other existing\nmultiplexing
    protocols.\n \nThis document is part of a suite of documents describing the HTTP-NG
    design and\nprototype implementation:\n    * HTTP-NG Short- and Longterm Goals,
    ID\n    * HTTP-NG Architectural Model, ID\n    * HTTP-NG Wire Protocol, ID\n    *
    The Classic Web Interfaces in HTTP-NG, ID\n    * Description of the HTTP-NG Testbed,

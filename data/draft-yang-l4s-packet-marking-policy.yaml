  content: "   Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S)[RFC9330] is a\n
    \  technology designed to mitigate queueing delays while maintaining\n   high
    throughput for IP traffic.  In real-time communication (RTC)\n   applications
    over 5G networks, rapidly fluctuating wireless link\n   conditions impose strict
    requirements on congestion control\n   algorithms, which must simultaneously ensure
    low latency and high\n   bandwidth utilization.  This document proposes a packet
    marking\n   policy for L4S in 5G networks, where intermediate base station\n   devices
    compute a link load factor and use it as a probabilistic\n   signal to mark packets
    in L4S flows.\n\n\t "

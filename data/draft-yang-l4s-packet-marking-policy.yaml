abstract:
- content: "<p>Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S)[RFC9330] is a
    technology designed to mitigate queueing delays while maintaining high throughput
    for IP traffic. In real-time communication (RTC) applications over 5G networks,
    rapidly fluctuating wireless link conditions impose strict requirements on congestion
    control algorithms, which must simultaneously ensure low latency and high bandwidth
    utilization. This document proposes a packet marking policy for L4S in 5G networks,
    where intermediate base station devices compute a link load factor and use it
    as a probabilistic signal to mark packets in L4S flows.</p>"

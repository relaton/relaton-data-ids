  content: "   This draft describes the solution of vanilla inter-as option-B\n   connection
    between NVO3 network and MPLS/IP VPN network through\n   centralized NVE-NVA architecture.
    The ASBR located in NVO3 network\n   is called ASBR-d, NVO3 tunnel and MPLS tunnel
    stitching should be\n   performed on the ASBR-d. No distributed BGP VPN protocol
    (RFC4364)\n   is running between NVEs and ASBR-d in NVO3 network, NVEs and ASBR-d\n
    \  are controlled by centralized NVA.\n\n\t "

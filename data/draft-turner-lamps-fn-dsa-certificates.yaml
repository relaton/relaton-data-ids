- content: "<p>Digital signatures are used within X.509 certificates and Certificate
    Revocation Lists (CRLs), and to sign messages. This document specifies the conventions
    for using, the forthcoming, FIPS 206, the Fast-Fourier Transform over NTRU-Lattice-Based
    Digital Signature Algorithm (FN-DSA), in Internet X.509 certificates and CRLs.
    The conventions for the associated signatures, subject public keys, and private
    key are also described.</p>"

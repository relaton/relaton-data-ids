  content: "This document specifies an extension to the specifications in RFC 5101,
    IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX), when using the Partial Reliability extension
    of SCTP (PR-SCTP, Partial Reliability Stream Control Transmission Protocol).\n\n
    When implemented at both the Exporting Process and Collecting Process, this method
    offers several advantages, such as the ability to calculate Data Record losses
    for PR-SCTP per Template, immediate export of Template Withdrawal Messages, immediate
    reuse of Template IDs within an SCTP stream, reduced likelihood of Data Record
    loss, and reduced demands on the Collecting Process. When implemented in only
    the Collecting Process or Exporting Process, then normal IPFIX behavior will be
    seen without all of the additional benefits. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>In current communication protocol designs, the prevalent practice is
    to define a strict Application Programming Interface (API) for different types
    of interactions among software entities. There is an explosion of APIs which makes
    interoperability hard, and the standards for interoperability fragile. Specifically
    for agent to agent communications, defining strict APIs for interactions such
    as registration, discovery, telemetry and debugging creates significant operational
    challenges. In this draft, we argue that a flexible design option -- where generative
    AI is used to create a flexible communication protocol for APIs, can lead to a
    common and flexible way for a single uniform API to be used between agents, and
    enables a better communication paradigm.</p>"

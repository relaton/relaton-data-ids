  content: "   There is currently a lack of a standard network identification or\n
    \  numbering for digital asset networks.  This deficiency makes it\n   difficult
    for the transfer of digital assets from one network to\n   another, due among
    others, to the possibility in the collision in the\n   numbering of the remote
    networks.  This document proposes a globally\n   unique 32-byte identifier for
    each asset network based on some unique\n   inherent characteristics of each network.\n\n\t "

  content: "During migration scenarios it may be desirable to transfer the \n   ownership
    of a Label Switched Path (LSP) from the Management Plane \n   (MP) to the Control
    Plane (CP), or vice versa. If the LSP is carrying \n   traffic this change needs
    to be made \"in service,\" that is, without \n   affecting traffic. \n   This
    memo provides minor extensions to the Generalized Multi Protocol \n   Label Switching
    (GMPLS) signaling protocol, GRSVP_TE (Generalized \n   Resource Reservation Protocol
    with Traffic Engineering Extensions), \n   to enable such transfer of ownership
    and describes the proposed \n   procedures.\n\t "

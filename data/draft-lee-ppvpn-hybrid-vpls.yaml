  content: "This draft describes a solution to enable an emulated LAN Service or\nVirtual
    Private LAN Service (VPLS) by decoupling the bridging and\ntunneling of Ethernet
    traffic into Customer Located Equipment (CLE)\nor Customer Edge (CE) and Provider
    Edge (PE), respectively.  This\ndecoupling of functions allows an operator to
    provision point-to-\npoint transport of Ethernet services for customer on PEs,
    while\nleveraging bridging functions at CLEs to forward traffic towards the\nappropriate
    point-to-point Ethernet service leading to the\ndestination node. This decoupling
    of functions also allow providers\nto leverage existing network infrastructures
    to enable VPLS while\neasing migration to new network infrastructures. This approach
    scales\nas the number of customers and sites increases, and as customers'\nemulated
    LAN sites span over a large wide area network.  It is also\nthe intention to show
    that an interface like Ethernet can be offered\nto customers and emulated LAN
    services can be enabled, but it is not\nmandatory to introduce VLAN like technologies
    (or PE-based type of\nVPLS) in the provider's network. In addition, existing and\nheterogeneous
    access technologies can be supported in a common\nnetwork infrastructure.\n\t "

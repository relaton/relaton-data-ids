  content: "   Packet forwarding on Internet typically takes no place with\n   inspection
    of the source address.  Thus malicious attacks or abnormal\n   behavior have been
    launched with the spoofed source addresses.  This\n   document describes an inter-domain
    source address validation with\n   RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) and
    IPsec (IP Security),\n   including the motivation, tech framework, main interactive
    process,\n   and optional extensions.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol [1] to\nallow
    mobility management for the interface between a radio network\nand a packet data
    network in the third generation cdma2000 network.\nMobile IP requires link layer
    connectivity between the Mobile Node\nand the Foreign Agent. This draft proposes
    a protocol for achieving\nthis when the physical layer terminating at a point
    distant from the\nFA. In particular, this protocol applies to cdma2000 networks
    where\nthe physical layer terminates at a Radio Network Node (RNN) and the\nFA
    resides inside a separate Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). The\nPDSN is responsible
    for establishing, maintaining, and terminating\nthe link layer to the Mobile Node.
    A RNN is responsible for relaying\nthe link layer protocol between a Mobile Node
    and its corresponding\nPDSN.\nThe interface between the RNN and the PDSN is called
    the RP\ninterface. This interface requires mobility management for handling\nhandoff
    from one RNN to another without interrupting end to end\ncommunication. It also
    requires the support of the link layer\nprotocol encapsulation.\n\t "

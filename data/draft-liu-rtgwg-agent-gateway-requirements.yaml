- content: "<p>This document discusses the requirements for introducing Agent Gateways
    into Agent-to-Agent communications for better scalability, communication efficiency,
    and security etc. This document also discusses the gaps of current hardware/software
    gateways that could not fulfil the task, so that a new kind of entity, e.g. Agent
    Gateway, is needed.</p>"

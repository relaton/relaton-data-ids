  content: "Early Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) deployments feature a \"fat\"
    Access Point (AP), which serves as a \\%stand-alone interface between the wired
    and wireless network segments.  However, this model raises scaling, mobility,
    and manageability issues, and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
    Points (CAPWAP) protocol is meant to address these issues.  CAPWAP effectively
    splits the fat AP functionality into two network elements, and the communication
    channel between these components may traverse potentially hostile hops.  This
    document analyzes the security exposure resulting from the introduction of CAPWAP
    and summarizes the associated security considerations for IEEE 802.11-based CAPWAP
    implementations and deployments.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

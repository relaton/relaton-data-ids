  content: "   This document describes a solution called AUTO-BFD, that\n   automatically
    initiates BFD sessions for BGP next-hops.  This makes\n   it possible to avoid
    blackholing scenarios when a BGP peer is not the\n   BGP next-hop, especially
    on Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) when BGP\n   Route-Servers are deployed.  When
    they are configured with this\n   mechanism, routers can automatically try to
    establish a new adjacency\n   for every new BGP next-hop.  BGP routes are then
    checked against the\n   state of the BFD session for the corresponding next-hop.\n\nForeword\n\n
    \  A placeholder to list general observations about this document.\n\n\n\t "

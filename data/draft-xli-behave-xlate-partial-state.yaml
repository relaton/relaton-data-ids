  content: "This document presents concepts and implementations of stateless/\npartial-state
    1:N network address and protocol translation between\nIPv4 and IPv6 nodes.\n\nStateless
    1:N translation keeps the features of stateless, end-to-end\naddress transparency
    and bidirectional-initiated communications of\nthe original stateless translation
    (1:1 IVI), in addition it can\nutilize the IPv4 addresses more effectively.  However,
    it requires\nthe modification of the IPv6 end systems or deploying home gateways.\nBy
    introducing \"partial state\" in the translator, this requirement is\nnot necessary.\n\t "

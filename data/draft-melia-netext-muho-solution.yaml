  content: "This document provides extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 in order to\nsupport
    multihomed mobile nodes (MN).  These extensions are intended\nto permit such mobile
    nodes to send and receive IP packets on\nmultiple interfaces in a simultaneous
    and possibly discriminated\nmanner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain.  A typical
    usage of these\nextensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination through\nmultiple
    interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MN\ninterface to VOIP traffic
    and another MN interface to HTTP traffic).\n\nThe proposed extensions to PMIPv6
    attempt to increment in a backward\ncompatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification.
    \ In addition\nthese extensions use, when possible, existing specifications related\nto
    multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statement\nof Netext Working
    Group.\n\t "

  content: "   Carrier Wi-Fi Calling is a solution that allows mobile operators to\n
    \  seamlessly offload mobile voice signaling and bearer traffic onto Wi-\n   Fi
    access networks, which may or may not be managed by the mobile\n   operators.
    \ Mobile data offload onto Wi-Fi access networks has\n   already become very common,
    as Wi-Fi access has become more\n   ubiquitous.  However, the offload of mobile
    voice traffic onto Wi-Fi\n   networks has become prevalent only in recent years.
    \ This was\n   primarily driven by the native Wi-Fi Calling client support\n   introduced
    by device vendors.  The objective of this document is to\n   provide a high level
    deployment reference to Mobile Operators and Wi-\n   Fi Operators on Carrier Wi-Fi
    Calling.\n\n\t "

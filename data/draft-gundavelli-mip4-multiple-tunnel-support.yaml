  content: "This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol for\nallowing
    a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of\naddress for each
    of its network interfaces and to simultaneously\nestablish multiple Mobile IP
    tunnels with its home agent.  This\nessentially allows the mobile node to utilize
    all the available\nnetwork interfaces and build an higher aggregated data pipe
    with the\nhome agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these\nextensions
    also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate\nflow policies for
    binding individual traffic flows with the\nregistered care-of addresses.\n\t "

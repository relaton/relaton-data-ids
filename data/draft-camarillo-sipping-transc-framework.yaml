  content: "This document defines a framework for transcoding with SIP. This\nframework
    includes how to discover the need of transcoding services\nin a session and how
    to invoke those transcoding services. Two models\nfor transcoding services invocation
    are discussed; the conference\nbridge model and the third party call control model.
    Both models meet\nthe requirements for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation
    to\nsupport deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "When IPSec tunneling is used for VPN connections, transporting routing\nprotocols
    across the encrypted tunnels becomes challenging. This\ndocument outlines the
    use of GRE encapsulation in conjunction with\nIPSec transport mode to support
    transport of dynamic routing protocols\nacross an IPSec encrypted tunnel. Some
    usage scenarios are also\naddressed in this document.\n\n\t "

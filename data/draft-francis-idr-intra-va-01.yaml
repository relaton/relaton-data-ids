  content: "The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)\nstresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the\nmost costly stresses
    is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router\nhardware simply because the FIB has
    run out of space, and router\nvendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.
    \ FIB suppression\nis an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading
    selected\nRIB entries into the FIB.  This document specifies two styles of FIB\nsuppression.
    \ Edge suppression (ES) allows ISPs that deploy a core-\nedge topology to shrink
    the FIBs of their edge routers, including\nthose that interface to other ISPs
    and exchange the full DFRT.\nVirtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the
    FIBs of any and\nall routers.  Both styles may be deployed autonomously by an
    ISP\n(cooperation between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with\nlegacy
    routers in the ISP.\n\t "

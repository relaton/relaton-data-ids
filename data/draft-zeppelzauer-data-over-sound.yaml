  content: "   This document defines a new protocol for communication via sound (and\n
    \  in particular via near-ultrasound) that is simple enough to be\n   implemented
    on devices with limited computational resources, such as\n   Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) devices.  The near-ultrasonic frequency band\n   in the range of 18-22kHz
    represents a novel and so far hardly used\n   channel for the communication of
    different devices, such as mobile\n   phones, computers, TVs, personal assistants,
    and potentially a wide\n   range of IoT devices.  Moreover, data-over-sound enables
    to connect\n   low-end hardware devices to the Internet by near field communication\n
    \  with other Internet-connected devices.  Data-over-sound requires only\n   a
    standard loudspeaker and a microphone for communication, and thus\n   has very
    low hardware requirements compared to other communication\n   standards such as
    Bluetooth, WLAN and NFC.  \"SoniTalk\" is designed as\n   an open and transparent
    near-ultrasonic data transmission protocol\n   for data-over-sound.  This document
    provides a specification of the\n   protocol at the lowest layer (physical layer)
    in the sense of the OSI\n   model.\n\n\t "

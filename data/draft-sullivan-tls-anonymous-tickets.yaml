  content: "   This document describes a mechanism that enables unlinkable session\n
    \  resumption for TLS 1.3 without server-side state.  In contrast to\n   existing
    ticket-based resumption in TLS 1.3, wherein servers\n   construct and issue tickets
    to clients, this document specifies a\n   mechanism by which clients request \"anonymous
    tickets\" from servers.\n   When a session is resumed using an anonymous ticket,
    a server only\n   learns that it previously engaged in a session with some client,\n
    \  rather than linking it to a specific client.  Anonymous tickets are\n   only
    useful for clients with idempotent early data to send.\n\n\t "

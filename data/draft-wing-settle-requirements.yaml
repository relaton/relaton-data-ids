  content: "   When connecting to servers on their local network, users are\n   surprised
    to encounter user interfaces that display errors, show\n   insecure connections,
    and block some HTTP features when missing a\n   secure context.  However, obtaining
    PKIX certificates for those\n   servers is difficult for a variety of reasons.\n\n
    \  This document explores requirements for authenticating local servers.\n\n\t "

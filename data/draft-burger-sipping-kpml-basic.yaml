  content: "This document describes a profile of the SIP Event Package \"kpml\"\nthat
    enables simple monitoring of DTMF signals and uses XML documents\nreferred to
    as Key Press Markup Language (KPML).  This profile\nassumes devices of lesser
    capability that may have trouble parsing\nsubscription requests or producing generic
    XML documents.  This is a\nprofile of RFC 4730, KPML.Conventions used in this
    document\n\nRFC2119 [1] provides the interpretations for the key words \"MUST\",\n\"MUST
    NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",\n\"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" found in this document.\n\nThe Application Interaction
    Framework document [9] provides the\ninterpretations for the terms \"User Device\",
    \"SIP Application\", and\n\"User Input\".  This document uses the term \"Application\"
    and\n\"Requesting Application\" interchangeably with \"SIP Application\".\n\nAdditionally,
    the Application Interaction Framework document\ndiscusses User Device Proxies.
    \ A common instantiation of a User\nDevice Proxy is a Public Switched Telephone
    Network (PSTN) gateway.\nBecause the normative behavior of a presentation free
    User Interface\nis identical for a presentation free SIP User Agent and a\npresentation
    free User Device Proxy, this document uses \"User Device\"\nfor both cases.\n\t "

  content: "   A conferencing system is defined by \"A framework and Data Model for\n
    \  Centralized Conferencing\" and represents a container for\n   administering
    and managing all conference related information.  The\n   conference user concept
    is introduced in the framework to identify\n   the entity participating in a conference
    and manipulating\n   conferencing system related properties.  This document defines
    a\n   Conference User Identifier and provides some guidelines for\n   identifying
    a specific conference user within a conferencing system.\n   The document also
    provides some examples of the logical mapping of\n   this conference user identifier
    to protocol and signaling interface\n   specific user identifiers.\n\n\t "

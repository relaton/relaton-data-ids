  content: "Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a new technique\nfor
    inter-domain federation of SIP calls.  ViPR makes use of the PSTN\nas an introduction
    mechanism to verify the correctness of mappings\nfrom phone numbers to domains.
    \ The PSTN introduction mechanism can\nalso be used as a technique for blocking
    spam - a SIP caller is only\nauthorized when its calling domain has previously
    called that same\nnumber over the PSTN.  This document describes an extension
    to SIP\nwhich enables authorization of SIP calls based on a prior PSTN\nintroduction.\n\nLegal\n\nThis

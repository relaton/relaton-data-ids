  content: "   VPN4DC provides VPN oriented datacenter service to customer through\n
    \  L3VPN which is consisted of (private) L3VPN in datacenter and network\n   provider's
    L3VPN over wide geographical area.  If we considering the\n   two L3VPN in two
    different AS, [RFC4364] providers three options to\n   achieve L3VPN inter-AS
    connection.  Both option A and B could be used\n   to connect L3VPN in VPN4DC.
    \ This draft discusses a novel method for\n   implementing option A, to automatically
    configure the VRF interface\n   in order to interconnect the two segments of the
    end-to-end L3VPN.\n   This L3VPN interconnection automation mechanism is expected
    to\n   significantly reduce the VPN oriented inter-connection/service\n   provisioning
    time.\n\n\t "

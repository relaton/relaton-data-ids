  content: "   At present, the collaboration of documents in a single cloud-office\n
    \  Website works wonderfully.  However, the one among different cloud-\n   office
    websites is a little clumsy.  This document analyzes the\n   status quo of the
    collaboration of documents among those existing\n   different cloud-office websites
    and provides a solution how to\n   realize IDCOA (the interconnection and interoperability
    of different\n   cloud-office applications) with the html file format.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss,\n
    \  delay and delay variation (jitter) is a critical measure for traffic\n   engineering.
    \ This data provides operators the characteristics of\n   their networks for performance
    evaluation that is required to ensure\n   the Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
    \ Performance measurement\n   mechanisms can be employed to measure these metrics
    for TE LSPs in\n   real-time.  This document describes PCEP extensions for reporting\n
    \  such performance measurements to an Active Stateful PCE.\n\n\t "

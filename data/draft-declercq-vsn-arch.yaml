  content: "This document introduces Virtual Service-aware Networks (VSNs) as a\nsolution
    for inter-domain resource reservation with Quality-of-\nService (QoS) on an Internet-wide
    scale. A VSN is a single-domain\noverlay network that consists of guaranteed QoS
    pipes. VSNs of\nneighboring domains that offer the same level of QoS establish\npeering
    relationships. As such, they form a network of QoS-enabled\nnetworks with a specific
    (QoS) routing context. In this network,\nadmission control for traffic flows is
    performed in two phases. The\ntwo-phase approach allows for the use of an off-path
    signaling\nprotocol, which enables the gradual introduction of this\narchitecture
    without changing the existing routers.\n\t "

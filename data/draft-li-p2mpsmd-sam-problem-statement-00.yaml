    are especially important for\n   point to multipoint streaming media delivery
    for the edge network.\n   However, most of the existing technologies or protocols,
    such as IP\n   multicast, do not provide the network aware and policy-based control\n
    \  mechanisms.  This document presents the problem statements in point\n   to
    multipoint streaming media delivery for edge network, explains why\n   network
    awareness and policy-based control should be urgently\n   addressed for the point

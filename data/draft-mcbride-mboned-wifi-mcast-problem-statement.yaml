  content: "   There have been known issues with multicast, in an 802.11\n   environment,
    which have prevented the deployment of multicast in\n   these wifi environments.
    \ IETF multicast experts have been meeting\n   together to discuss these issues
    and provide IEEE updates.  The\n   mboned working group is chartered to receive
    regular reports on the\n   current state of the deployment of multicast technology,
    create\n   \"practice and experience\" documents that capture the experience of\n
    \  those who have deployed and are deploying various multicast\n   technologies,
    and provide feedback to other relevant working groups.\n   As such, this document
    will gather the problems of wifi multicast\n   into one problem statement document
    so as to offer the community\n   guidance on current limitations.\n\n\t "

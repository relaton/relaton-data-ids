  content: "Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to) information
    about a resource.  There is fairly complex state associated with these subscriptions.
    \ The union of the state for all subscriptions to a particular resource is called
    the watcher information for that resource.  This state is dynamic, changing as
    subscribers come and go.  As a result, it is possible, and indeed useful, to subscribe
    to the watcher information for a particular resource.  In order to enable this,
    a format is needed to describe the state of watchers on a resource.  This specification
    describes an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document format for such state.

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding\n
    \  paradigm which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol and\n   doesn't
    require intermediate routers to maintain any multicast state.\n   A BFR cannot
    send a BIER packet to a given nexthop router unless that\n   nexthop router has
    indicated that it can support the BIER forwarding\n   procedure.  This document
    defines a mechanism to signal that\n   capability using OSPF.  This mechanism
    is useful when the unicast\n   route distribution is also done via OSPF.\n\n\t "

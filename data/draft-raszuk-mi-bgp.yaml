  content: "   As the number of operational use cases of BGP grows there is demand\n
    \  to increase the level of separation and processing independence\n   between
    various address families carried by BGP today.  This document\n   augments base
    BGP specification in allowing local configuration of\n   BGP port number by the
    operator to run parallel fully disjoined BGP\n   instances allowing full processing
    separation between them.\n\n   While local BGP implementation may already assure
    BGP process or\n   thread robustnes the general aim here is to allow similar level
    of\n   groups of BGP address families independence when running BGP code on\n
    \  general purpose hardware as well as x86 based route reflectors.\n\n\t "

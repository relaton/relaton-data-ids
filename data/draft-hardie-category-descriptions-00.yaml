  content: "Over time, the document series associated with the IETF has grown\nand
    changed.  One such change is the increase in the use of\nsecondary markers to
    identify when documents fit specific\ncategories and, especially, when they are
    or are not the product\nof specific IETF processes.  The author believes that
    these\nsecondary markers have largely failed but that the distinctions\nthey were
    meant to draw remain valuable.  A new set of category\nlabels is proposed to re-emphasize
    these distinctions.  The formal\ncategories proposed are Internet Note, Candidate
    Specification,\nProposed IETF Standard, Confirmed IETF Standard, and External\nInternet
    Engineering Document.  These may be informally understood\nas ideas which are
    unbaked, baking, baked, eaten, and boiled.\n\n\n\t "

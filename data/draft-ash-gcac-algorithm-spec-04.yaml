  content: "This document presents a generic connection admission control (GCAC) reference
    model and algorithm for IP-/MPLS-based networks.  Service provider (SP) IP/MPLS
    networks need an MPLS GCAC mechanism, as one motivational example, to reject Voice
    over IP (VoIP) calls when additional calls would adversely affect calls already
    in progress.  Without MPLS GCAC, connections on congested links will suffer degraded
    quality.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm can be optionally implemented in vendor equipment
    and deployed by service providers.  MPLS GCAC interoperates between vendor equipment
    and across multiple service provider domains.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm uses available
    standard mechanisms for MPLS-based networks, such as RSVP, Diffserv-aware MPLS
    Traffic Engineering (DS-TE), Path Computation Element (PCE), Next Steps in Signaling
    (NSIS), Diffserv, and OSPF.  The MPLS GCAC algorithm does not include aspects
    of CAC that might be considered vendor proprietary implementations, such as detailed
    path selection mechanisms.  MPLS GCAC functions are implemented in a distributed
    manner to deliver the objective Quality of Service (QoS) for specified QoS constraints.
    \ The objective is that the source is able to compute a source route with high
    likelihood that via-elements along the selected path will in fact admit the request.
    \ In some cases (e.g., multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes)), this objective cannot
    always be met, but this document summarizes methods that partially meet this objective.
    \ MPLS GCAC is applicable to any service or flow that must meet an objective QoS
    (delay, jitter, packet loss rate) for a specified quantity of traffic.  This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

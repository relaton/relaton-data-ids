  content: "With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers using
    BGP4 has grown significantly.  RFC1930 outlines a set of guidelines for when one
    needs and should use an AS.  However, the customer and service provider (ISP)
    are left with a problem as a result of this in that while there is no need for
    an allocated AS under the guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4
    a very pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect a customer homed to a single
    ISP.  This paper proposes a solution to this problem in line with recommendations
    set forth in RFC1930.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    \ It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.\n\t "

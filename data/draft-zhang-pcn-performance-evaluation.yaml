  content: "   Pre-Congestion Notification [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture]\n   approach
    proposes Admission Control to limit the amount of real-time\n   PCN traffic to
    a configured level during the normal operating\n   conditions, and Flow Termination
    used to tear-down some of the flows\n\n   to bring the PCN traffic level down
    to a desirable amount during\n   unexpected events such as network failures, with
    the goal of\n   maintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining flows.  Preliminary\n
    \  performance evaluation results on example admission and termination\n   mechanisms
    were presented in [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb] and in\n   earlier versions of this
    draft.  This draft presents the results of a\n   follow-up simulation study.\n\n\n\t "

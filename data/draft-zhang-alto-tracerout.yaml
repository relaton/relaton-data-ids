  script: Latn
  content: "Most P2P system performance suffers from the mismatch between the \nrandomly
    constructed overlays topology and the underlying physical \nnetwork topology,
    causing a large burden in the ISP and a long RTT \ntime. This document describes
    how DHT overlay peers can interact with \nthe routers by traceroute to get the
    path information, and execute 2-\nMeans Classification, thereafter peers leverage
    the DHT itself to \n\n \n \n build efficient \"closer\" cluster. This scheme only
    requires the \ninfrastructure to enable traceroute queries.\n\t "

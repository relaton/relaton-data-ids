  content: "   Pluggable Transports (PTs) are a mechanism enabling the rapid\n   development
    and deployment of network traffic obfuscation techniques\n   used to circumvent
    surveillance and censorship.  This specification\n   does not define or limit
    the techniques themselves, but rather\n   focuses on the startup, shutdown, and
    inter-process communication\n   mechanisms required to make these technologies
    interoperable with\n   applications.\n\n   This document is based heavily on [PT2.1].\n\n\t "

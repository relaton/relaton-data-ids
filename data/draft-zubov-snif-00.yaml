  content: "   This document proposes a solution, referred as SNIF, that provides\n
    \  the means for any Internet connected device to:\n\n   *  allocate a globally
    unique anonymous hostname\n\n   *  obtain and maintain a publicly trusted X.509
    certificate [RFC5280]\n      issued for the allocated hostname\n\n   *  accept
    incoming TLS connections on specific TCP ports of the\n      allocated hostname
    from any TLS clients that are capable of\n      sending Server Name Indication
    [RFC6066]\n\n   The private key associated with the X.509 certificate is securely\n
    \  stored on the TLS terminating device, and is never exposed to any\n   other
    party at any step of the process.\n\nAbout This Document\n\n   This note is to
    be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Status information for this document
    may be found at\n   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zubov-snif-00 .\n\n

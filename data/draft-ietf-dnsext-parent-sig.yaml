  content: "When dealing with large amounts of keys the procedures to update a\nzone
    and to sign a zone need to be clearly defined and practically\npossible.  The
    current idea is to have the KEY RR and the parent's\nSIG to reside in the child's
    zone and perhaps also in the parent's\nzone. We feel that this would lead to very
    complicated procedures for\nlarge TLDs. We propose an alternative scheme in which
    the parent zone\nstores the parent's signature over the child's key and also a
    copy of\nthe child's key itself.\n\t "

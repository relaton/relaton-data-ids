  content: "The BGP TTL Security Hack (BTSH) is designed to protect the BGP\n[RFC1771]
    infrastructure from CPU-utilization based attacks. While\nBTSH is most effective
    in protecting directly connected BGP peers, it\ncan also provide a lower level
    of protection to multi-hop sessions.\n\t "

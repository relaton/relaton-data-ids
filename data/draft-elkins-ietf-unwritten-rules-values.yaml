  content: "   The intent of this document is to speed up the process by which\n   someone
    new to the IETF,  can understand the objectives, fathom the\n   environment, comprehend
    the culture, learn to navigate the problems,\n   overcome the obstacles, and become
    a more productive IETF\n   participant, in a shorter amount of time. Further,
    this document is\n   intended to pass along the learning and experiences of people
    who\n   have absorbed these values,  perhaps in a much longer amount of time\n
    \  and with much greater effort and even hardship.\n\n\t "

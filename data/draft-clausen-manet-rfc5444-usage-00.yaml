abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates the generalized MANET packet/message format,
    specified in RFC5444, by providing prescriptive guidelines for how protocols can
    use that packet/message format. In particular, these mandatory guidelines prohibit
    a number of uses of RFC5444 that have been suggested in various proposals, and
    which would have lead to interoperability problems, to impediment of protocol
    extension development, and to inability to use generic RFC5444 parsers.</p>"

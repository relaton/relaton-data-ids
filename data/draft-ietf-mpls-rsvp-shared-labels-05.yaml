  content: "   As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, so the number of\n
    \  Label Switched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements\n   has
    increased.  Various implementation recommendations have been\n   proposed to manage
    the resulting increase in control plane state.\n\n   However, those changes have
    had no effect on the number of labels\n   that a transit Label Switching Router
    (LSR) has to support in the\n   forwarding plane.  That number is governed by
    the number of LSPs\n   transiting or terminated at the LSR and is directly related
    to the\n   total LSP state in the control plane.\n\n   This document defines a
    mechanism to prevent the maximum size of the\n   label space limit on an LSR from
    being a constraint to control plane\n   scaling on that node.  It introduces the
    notion of pre-installed 'per\n   Traffic Engineering (TE) link labels' that can
    be shared by MPLS\n   RSVP-TE LSPs that traverse these TE links.  This approach\n
    \  significantly reduces the forwarding plane state required to support\n   a
    large number of LSPs.  This couples the feature benefits of the\n   RSVP-TE control
    plane with the simplicity of the Segment Routing MPLS\n   forwarding plane.\n\n\n\t "

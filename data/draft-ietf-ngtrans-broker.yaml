  content: "The motivation for the development of the tunnel broker model is to help
    early IPv6 adopters to hook up to an existing IPv6 network (e.g., the 6bone) and
    to get stable, permanent IPv6 addresses and DNS names.  The concept of the tunnel
    broker was first presented at Orlando's IETF in December 1998.  Two implementations
    were demonstrated during the Grenoble IPng & NGtrans interim meeting in February
    1999.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

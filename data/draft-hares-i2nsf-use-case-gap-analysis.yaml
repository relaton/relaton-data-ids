  content: "   This document provides a summary of the I2NSF use cases plus a\n   summary
    of the stat of the art in industries and IETF work which is\n   relevant to the
    Interface to Network Security Function (I2NSF).  The\n   I2NSF focus is to define
    data models and interfaces in order to\n   control and monitor the physical and
    virtual aspects of network\n   security functions.  The use cases are organized
    in two basic\n   scenarios.  In the access network scenario, mobile and residential\n
    \  users access NSF capabilities using their network service provider\n   infrastructure.
    \ In the data center scenario customers manage NSFs\n   hosted in the data center
    infrastructure.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find the\n
    \  addresses of nameservers that live within the delegated zone.  Glue\n   records
    are expected to be returned as part of a referral and if they\n   cannot be fitted
    into the UDP response, TC=1 MUST be set to inform\n   the client that the response
    is incomplete and that TCP SHOULD be\n   used to retrieve the full response.\n\n\t "

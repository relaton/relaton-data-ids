  content: "RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7 \n
    \  MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the \n   services
    of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. \n\n   M3UA is designed for SEP-(TDM)-SG-(IP)-IPSEP
    and IPSEP-(IP)-IPSEP \n   applications, so the network level management function
    isn't required. \n   SSNM(SS7 Signalling Network Management) messages defined
    in M3UA are \n   only used for interworking with SS7. RFC 4666 doesn't define
    IPSEP-\n   IPSTP-IPSEP application of M3UA. The signalling network management
    \n   function for this application needs to be extended. \n\n   Some parts of
    the specification are unclear,which  may lead to \n   misinterpretations and may
    weaken interoperability. \n\n   This document provides extensions and clarifications
    to RFC 4666. \n\n\t "

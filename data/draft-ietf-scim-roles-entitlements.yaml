  content: "   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol\n   schema,
    defined in RFC [RFC7643] defines the complex core schema\n   attributes \"roles\"
    and \"entitlements\".  For both of these concepts,\n   frequently only a predetermined
    set of values are accepted by a SCIM\n   service provider.  The values that are
    accepted may vary per customer\n   or tenant based on customizable configuration
    in the service\n   provider's application or based on other criteria such as what\n
    \  services have been purchased or resources associated with\n   entitlements.
    \ This document defines an extension to the SCIM 2.0\n   standard to allow SCIM
    service providers to represent available data\n   pertaining to SCIM resources,
    roles and entitlements so that SCIM\n   clients can consume this information and
    provide easier management of\n   SCIM resources, role and entitlement assignments.\n\n\t "

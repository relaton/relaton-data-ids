  content: "Since digital multichannel TV broadcasting services have been started
    in many areas, low cost digital data receivers are available. They can be used
    for not only TV broadcasting service but also any kind of data communication services.
    \                                                   A low cost receiver can receive
    high bandwidth traffic from a feed, while no bandwidth from the receiver to the
    feed is provided.  Therefore the connection between the feed and the receiver
    is unidirectional. Current routing protocols stand on a fact that any links are
    bidirectional even if the bandwidth in each direction may be different. They can
    not handle unidirectional links.                                                      This
    document defines an idea to use unidirectional links (UDLs) routing without any
    modifications of current routing protocols.\n\t "

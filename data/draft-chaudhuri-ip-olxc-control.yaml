  content: "This  document  details  requirements  and  mechanisms  for  optical\nbandwidth
    management and restoration in a dynamically reconfigurable\noptical network.  A
    management approach is described where IP\nalgorithms and mechanisms are used
    to control optical resources,\npaving  the  way  for  the  optical  Internet.
    \   The  proposal  is\nspecifically  intended  for  optical  internetworking  in
    \ which  IP\nrouters are connected by the reconfigurable optical layer using\nlightpaths.
    \ However, it is assumed that the same methodology will\nbe used for non-IP traffic
    as well.\n\n\n\t "

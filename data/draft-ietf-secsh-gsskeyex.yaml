  content: "The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login
    and other secure network services over an insecure network.\n\n The Generic Security
    Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) provides security services to
    callers in a mechanism-independent fashion.\n\n This memo describes methods for
    using the GSS-API for authentication and key exchange in SSH. It defines an SSH
    user authentication method that uses a specified GSS-API mechanism to authenticate
    a user, and a family of SSH key exchange methods that use GSS-API to authenticate
    a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\n This memo also defines a new host public key
    algorithm that can be used when no operations are needed using a host's public
    key, and a new user authentication method that allows an authorization name to
    be used in conjunction with any authentication that has already occurred as a
    side-effect of GSS-API-based key exchange. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

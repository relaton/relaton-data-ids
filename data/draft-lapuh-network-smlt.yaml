  content: "This document describes Split Multi-link Trunking (SMLT) for bridged\nand
    routed networks. SMLT enables topologies with upstream node\nredundancy for increased
    reliability of Layer 2 link aggregationsubnetworks based on [IEEE 802.3ad] and
    router redundancy based on\nVRRP [RFC3768].\n\nSMLT is an improvement over Multi-Link
    Trunking (MLT), a method of\nlink aggregation that allows multiple Ethernet links
    to be aggregated\ntogether, and handled as a single logical trunk. MLT can be
    realized\nvia many different link aggregation mechanisms. Several methods of\nMLT
    are in use today; one example is [IEEE 802.3ad].\n\nSMLT is MLT with links of
    a link-aggregation group connected to ports\non two different devices (e.g. SMLT
    client and aggregation device).\nUnlike MLT, at least one end of a link-aggregated
    group is dual-homed\nto two different SMLT aggregation devices. In many cases
    those\ndevices act as bridges (switches) as well as L3 routers (Routing\nSwitches).
    These two redundant SMLT aggregation devices can share one\nor more VRRP routing
    instances; for that SMLT-VRRP extends the VRRP\nfunctionality to an active-active
    router concept, where both SMLT\naggregation device route traffic for a common
    VRRP-ID, thus load\nbalancing traffic not only for L2 but also for L3.\n\n\nConventions
    used in this document\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\t "

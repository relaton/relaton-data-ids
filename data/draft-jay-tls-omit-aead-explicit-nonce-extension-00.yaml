  content: "   With emergence of Internet of Things(IoT), DTLS is being widely\n   considered
    as a protocol of choice for communication security in IoT\n   applications. Further,
    AES_CCM has emerged as the cipher of choice in\n   constrained environments. Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP),\n   which is the application layer protocol for resource
    constrained\n   environments, mandates DTLS as underlying security protocol and\n
    \  proposes AES_CCM based ciphers to be used with different key exchange\n   methods.
    AEAD ciphers requires an explicit nonce of 8 bytes must be\n   carried in each
    transmitted record.This document defines a TLS (and\n   DTLS) extension, which
    will allow clients and servers to omit the\n   explicit nonce sent in TLS/DTLS
    records.  This document can be\n   considered as an extended version of \"Transport
    Layer Security (TLS)\n   Extensions : Extension Definitions\". The extension defined
    in this\n   document apply equally to both DTLS and TLS protocols.\n\n\t "

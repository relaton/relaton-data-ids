  content: "   This document specifies how Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE \n   signaling
    may be used and extended to satisfy the requirements of the \n   Automatically
    Switched Optical Network (ASON) architecture specified \n   by the ITU-T. The
    requirements are in a companion document \n   \"Requirements for Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS) Usage and Extensions for \n   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).\"
    \n\n   In particular, this document details the mechanisms for setting up \n   Soft
    Permanent Connections (SPC), the necessary extensions in \n   delivering full
    and logical call/connection separation support, the \n   extended restart capabilities
    during control plane failures, extended \n   label usage and crankback signalling
    capability. \n    \n   The mechanisms proposed in this document are applicable
    to any \n   environment (including multi-area) and for any type of interface:
    \n   packet, layer-2, time-division multiplexed, lambda or fiber \n   switching.

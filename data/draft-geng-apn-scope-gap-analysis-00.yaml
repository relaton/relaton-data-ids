  content: "   The APN work in IETF is focused on developing a framework and set of\n
    \  mechanisms to derive, convey and use an attribute allowing the\n   implementation
    of fine-grain user group-level and application group-\n   level requirements in
    the network layer.  APN aims to apply various\n   policies in different nodes
    along a network path onto a traffic flow\n   altogether, for example, at the headend
    to steer into corresponding\n   path, at the midpoint to collect corresponding
    performance\n   measurement data, and at the service function to execute particular\n
    \  policies.  Currently there is still no way to efficiently realize\n   this
    composite network service provisioning along the path.  This\n   document further
    clarifies the scope of the APN work and describes\n   the solution gap analysis.\n\n\t "

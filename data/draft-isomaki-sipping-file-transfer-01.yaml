  content: "This document describes use cases and defines requirements for how\ndifferent
    types of file transfer services could be integrated into\nthe general Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) based communication\nframework.  It also explores some
    of the possible solutions to meet\nthose requirements, either based on existing
    protocol mechanisms or\ndefining minor extensions to them.  The purpose of the
    document is to\nstart the discussion on whether some new standardization work
    is\nneeded in this area.\n\n\t "

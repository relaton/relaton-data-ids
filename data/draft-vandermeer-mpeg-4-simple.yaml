  content: "The MPEG Committee (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29 WG11) is a working group in ISO
    \nthat recently produced the MPEG-4 [1] standard. MPEG defines tools to \ncompress
    content such as audio-visual information into elementary \nstreams. In [6] a generic
    RTP payload format is defined for transport \nof any non-multiplexed MPEG-4 elementary
    stream. To achieve the generic \nMPEG-4 functionality, [6] addresses detailed
    issues related to the \nMPEG-4 SL layer. However, many initial applications will
    not use the SL \nLayer. To facilitate usage of [6] by such applications, this
    document \ndescribes how to use [6] when no SL layer is used.\n\t "

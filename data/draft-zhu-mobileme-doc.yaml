  content: "This document describes the implementation of Apple Inc.'s Back to My
    Mac (BTMM) service.  BTMM provides network connectivity between devices so that
    a user can perform file sharing and screen sharing among multiple computers at
    home, at work, or on the road.  The implementation of BTMM addresses the issues
    of single sign-on authentication, secure data communication, service discovery,
    and end-to-end connectivity in the face of Network Address Translators (NATs)
    and mobility of devices.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

  content: "This document defines an information model for\n      networking policy
    conditions as part of the general\n      information model for representing networking
    policy\n      defined in draft-ietf-policy-core-schema-02.txt.  The\n      information
    model described in this document is focussed\n      on the structural class networkingPolicyCondition\n
    \     that extends the class policyCondition described\n      draft-ietf-policy-core-schema-02.txt.
    \ Five auxiliary\n      classes are defined to describe conditions that refer
    to\n      (1) the communicating hosts, (2) the communicating users\n      (3)
    application data (4) routing information at the device\n      enforcing the policy
    and (5) layer 2 or data link layer\n      information of the device.  This document
    is based on the\n      QoS and IPSec schema first described in [3] and [4].\n\t "

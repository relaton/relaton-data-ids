  content: "A third party authorization label (TPA-Label) is a DNS-based\nextension
    for DKIM ADSP records that allows domains in the From\nheader field to authorize
    acceptable third-party signatures.  This\napproach allows autonomous and unilateral
    authorizations for third-\nparty domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions.
    \ The\nextended scope of DKIM signing practice assertions introduced here\nsupplants
    transparent authorization schemes that are more difficult\nto administer.  Alternatives
    for facilitating third-party\nauthorizations currently necessitate coordination
    between two or more\ndomains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records,
    DNS zone\ndelegations, and/or a regular exchange of public/private keys.\n\nChecking
    TPA-Label Resource Records for signing practices might occur\ninfrequently when
    a message is not compliant with restrictive ADSP\npractices, where an Author Domain
    Signature is either missing or\ninvalid.  When a third-party signature is found,
    TPA-Label Resource\nRecord transactions offer an efficient means for Author Domains
    to\nauthorize specific third-party signing domains.  Recipients are\nafforded
    a method to determine whether authorization exists in\nsituations where other
    modes of authorization are impractical.  TPA-\nLabel Resource Records permit Author
    Domains a means to influence\nmessage handling selectively, for messages otherwise
    lacking valid\nAuthor Domain signatures.\n\t "

  content: "The IS-IS routing protocol (RFC 1142 [2], ISO/IEC 10589 [3]) is a \nlink
    state intra-domain routing protocol. Normally, when an IS-IS \nrouter is re-started,
    the neighboring routers detect the restart \nevent and cycle their adjacencies
    with the restarting router through \nthe down state. This is necessary in order
    to invoke the protocol \nmechanisms to ensure correct re-synchronization of the
    LSP database. \nHowever, the cycling of the adjacency state causes the neighbors
    to \nregenerate their LSPs describing the adjacency concerned. This in \nturn
    causes temporary disruption of routes passing through the \nrestarting router.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes an idea for a header \"option\" for the\n   Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP).\n\n   The extension is used by dual-stack nodes to force
    the use of the\n   IPv6 protocol instead of the IPv4 protocol when exchanging
    data over\n   TCP.\n\n   Especially if one of the two nodes is a NAT64 or NAT46
    router it\n   makes sense not to use IPv4 but IPv6 if both nodes are dual-stack\n
    \  nodes.\n\n   This document also suggests to declare the usage of such a method\n
    \  mandatory for all nodes that use IPv4 addresses that will be assigned\n   by
    RIRs in the future.\n\n   Doing so will make it impossible to (mis-) use IPv4
    addresses\n   assigned by RIRs to ISPs for IPv4-only nodes that do not support\n
    \  IPv6.\n\n\t "

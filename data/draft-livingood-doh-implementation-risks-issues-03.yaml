  content: "   The DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol is specified in RFC8484.  This\n
    \  document considers Centralized DoH deployment, which seems one likely\n   way
    that DoH may be implemented, based on recent industry discussions\n   and testing.
    \ This describes that implementation model, as well the\n   potential associated
    risks and issues.  The document also makes\n   recommendations pertaining to the
    implementation of DoH, as well as\n   recommendations for further study prior
    to widespread adoption.\n\n\t "

  content: "The goal of Internet Unified Messaging is to provide, over the Internet,
    \na single infrastructure, mailbox, and set of interfaces for a user to \nget,
    respond to, and manipulate all of his or her messages from a \ncollection of clients
    with varying capabilities, no matter what the media or source is. Towards this
    goal, this document considers what is required of Internet messaging protocols
    to enable the support of Unified Messaging on two new classes of limited capability
    messaging clients: those limited to having a telephone user interface (TUI) and
    those that can be supported by small hand-held wireless devices with simple displays
    such as cell phones with data features and wireless-enabled PDAs (WUI). \nIncluded
    in the discussion is also a list of general principles to guide \nthe design of
    Unified Messaging protocols. \nDiscussion of this and related drafts are on the
    UM list.  To subscribe, \nsend the message 'subscribe um' to majordomo@snowshore.com.
    \ The public \narchive is at http://flyingfox.snowshore.com/um_archive/maillist.html.\n\t "

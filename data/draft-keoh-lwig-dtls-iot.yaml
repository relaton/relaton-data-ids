  script: Latn
  content: "   The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the pervasive\n   interaction
    of smart devices and people enabling new applications by\n   means of IP protocols.
    Traditional IP protocols will be further\n   complemented by 6LoWPAN and CoAP
    to make the IoT feasible on small\n   devices. Security and privacy are a must
    for such an environment. Due\n   to mobility, limited bandwidth, resource constraints,
    and new\n   communication topologies, existing security solutions need to be\n
    \  adapted. We propose a security architecture for the IoT in order to\n   provide
    network access control to smart devices, the management of\n   keys and securing
    unicast/multicast communication. Devices are\n   authenticated and granted network
    access by means of a pre-shared key\n   (PSK) based security handshake protocol.
    The solution is based on\n   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). Through
    the established\n   secure channels, keying materials, operational and security\n
    \  parameters are distributed, enabling devices to derive session keys\n   and
    group keys. The solution relies on the DTLS Record Layer for the\n   protection
    of unicast and multicast data flows. We have prototyped\n   and evaluated the
    security architecture. The DTLS architecture allows\n   for easier interaction
    and interoperability with the Internet due to\n   the extensive use of TLS. However,
    it exhibits performance issues\n   constraining its deployment in some network
    topologies and hence\n   would require further optimizations.\n\n\t "

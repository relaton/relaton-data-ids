  content: "   In the early days of the internet, many different link types with\n
    \  many different maximum packet sizes were in use.  For point-to-point\n   or
    point-to-multipoint links, there are still some other link types\n   (PPP, ATM,
    Packet over SONET), but multipoint subnets are now almost\n   exclusively implemented
    as Ethernets.  Even though the relevant\n   standards mandate a 1500 byte maximum
    packet size for Ethernet, more\n   and more Ethernet equipment is capable of handling
    packets bigger\n   than 1500 bytes.  However, since this capability isn't standardized,\n
    \  it is seldom used today, despite the potential performance benefits\n   of
    using larger packets.  This document specifies mechanisms to\n   negotiate per-neighbor
    maximum packet sizes so that nodes on a\n   multipoint subnet may use the maximum
    mutually supported packet size\n   between them without being limited by nodes
    with smaller maximum\n   sizes on the same subnet.\n\n\t "

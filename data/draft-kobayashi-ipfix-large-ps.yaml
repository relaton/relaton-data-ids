  content: " Flow measurement techniques have been developed in order to cope with\n
    \  increasing bandwiths.  Flow measurement is currently being used as a\n   popular
    method for monitoring large networks, e.g. at Internet\n   Service Providers or
    multinational corporations, for accounting,\n   management, and security purposes.
    \ To construct the measurement\n   system for such networks, the biggest challenge
    is scalability.\n   Whereas packet sampling functions in current flow measurement\n
    \  solutions such as NetFlow/sFlow/IPFIX help to approach this issue,\n   some
    problems still remain.  This document describes such open\n   issues, which a
    flow-based measurement system might encounter in\n   large-scale networks.  The
    results are intended to be used to define\n   and to develop an IPFIX Mediator
    device.\n\t "

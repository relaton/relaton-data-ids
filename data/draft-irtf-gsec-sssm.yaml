  content: "The SSM model is appeared in order to overcome the problems of \ndeployment
    of IP multicast. However, a real commercial deployment \nof SSM have to offer
    some security services. Our work proposes an\narchitecture, called S-SSM, for
    securing the SSM model. S-SSM\ndefines two mechanisms for access control and content
    protection.\nThe first one is carried out through subscriber authentication and\naccess
    permission. As for the second, it is realized through the\nmanagement of a unique
    key, called the channel key, k_ch, shared\namong the sender and subscribers.\n\t "

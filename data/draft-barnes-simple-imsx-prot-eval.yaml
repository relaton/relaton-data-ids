  content: "This document is submitted to the SIMPLE WG as part of the ongoing \ndiscussion
    on the selection of the protocol for support of Session \nBased Instant Messaging.
    \ It evaluates the suitability of the IMSX \nprotocol as a transport for Session
    Based IM.  IMSX defines a BEEP \nprofile for exchanging CPIM messages after SIP
    has performed its \nsession setup signaling. This document evaluates IMSX against
    the \nIMPP requirements and its ability to interoperate with other IM \nsystems
    based upon the CPIM profile.\n\t "

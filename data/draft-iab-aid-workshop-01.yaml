  content: "The \"Show me the numbers: Workshop on Analyzing IETF Data (AID)\" workshop
    was convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from November 29 to December
    2, 2021 and hosted by the IN-SIGHT.it project at the University of Amsterdam;
    however, it was converted to an online-only event. The workshop was organized
    into two discussion parts with a hackathon activity in between. This report summarizes
    the workshop's discussion and identifies topics that warrant future work and consideration.\n\n
    Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views
    and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants
    and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.\n\t "

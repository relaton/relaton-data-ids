  content: "The current RSVP-TE specification, 'RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for\nLSP
    Tunnels' (RFC 3209) and GMPLS extensions to RSVP-TE, 'Generalized\nMulti-Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation\nProtocol-Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) Extensions' (RFC 3473) allow\nabstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
    included in a path\nsetup, but not to be explicitly excluded.\nIn some systems
    where precise explicit paths are not computed at the\nhead end it may be useful
    to specify and signal abstract nodes and\nresources that are to be explicitly
    excluded from routes.  These\nexclusions may apply to the whole of a path, or
    to parts of a path\nbetween two abstract nodes specified in an explicit route.\nShared
    Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) allow the definition of resources or\ngroups of resources
    that share the same risk of failure.  The\nknowledge of SRLGs may be used to compute
    diverse paths that can be\nused for protection.  In systems where it is useful
    to signal\nexclusions, it may be useful to signal SRLGs to indicate groups of\nresources
    that should be excluded on the whole of a path or between\ntwo abstract nodes
    specified in an explicit path.\nThis document specifies ways to communicate route
    exclusions during\npath setup using RSVP-TE.\n\n\t "

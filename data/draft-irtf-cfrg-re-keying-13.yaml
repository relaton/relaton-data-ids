  content: "   A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when\n   encryption
    is performed under a single key.  This amount is called\n   \"key lifetime\".
    \ This specification describes a variety of methods to\n   increase the lifetime
    of symmetric keys.  It provides two types of\n   re-keying mechanisms based on
    hash functions and on block ciphers,\n   that can be used with modes of operations
    such as CTR, GCM, CBC, CFB\n   and OMAC.\n\n   This document is a product of the
    Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)\n   in the IRTF.\n\n\t "

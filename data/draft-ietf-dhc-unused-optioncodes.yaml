  script: Latn
  content: "Prior to the publication of RFC 2489 (which was updated by RFC 2939),
    several option codes were assigned to proposed Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) options that were subsequently never used.  This document lists those unused
    option codes and directs IANA to make these option codes available for assignment
    to other DHCP options in the future.  The document also lists several option codes
    that are not currently documented in an RFC but should not be made available for
    reassignment to future DHCP options.\n\t "

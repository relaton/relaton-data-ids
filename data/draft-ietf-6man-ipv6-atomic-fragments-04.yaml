  content: "The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment Header without
    the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces (we refer to these packets
    as \"atomic fragments\").  Such packets are typically sent by hosts that have
    received an ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" error message that advertises a Next-Hop
    MTU smaller than 1280 bytes, and are currently processed by some implementations
    as normal \"fragmented traffic\" (i.e., they are \"reassembled\" with any other
    queued fragments that supposedly correspond to the same original packet).  Thus,
    an attacker can cause hosts to employ atomic fragments by forging ICMPv6 \"Packet
    Too Big\" error messages, and then launch any fragmentation-based attacks against
    such traffic.  This document discusses the generation of the aforementioned atomic
    fragments and the corresponding security implications.  Additionally, this document
    formally updates RFC 2460 and RFC 5722, such that IPv6 atomic fragments are processed
    independently of any other fragments, thus completely eliminating the aforementioned
    attack vector.\n\t "

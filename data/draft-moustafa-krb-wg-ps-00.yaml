  content: "This document presents the problem of authentication and\nauthorization
    in distributed environments constituted by several\nusers communicating with application
    servers and communicating with\neach others.  Each user in this environment can
    also play the role of\nan application provider.\n\nImagine a large music event
    where the provided network infrastructure\nis enhanced with network storage equipment
    to allow visitors to\naccess content relating to the bands playing at the events,
    such as\nrecorded video of previous performances, supplementary audio and\nvideo
    material relevant to the bands playing, etc.  Certain content\nis, however, not
    necessarily available to everyone under the same\nconditions.  Instead access
    control is applied before the full range\nof audio, and video material can be
    accessed.  Other content, such as\npreviews, might be offered for free.  How can
    such authentication,\nand authorization infrastructure be made available with
    minimal\nconfiguration complexity for a temporary event like a music festival?\nThis
    document describes a problem statement based on the attempt to\nuse Kerberos and
    lists a couple of requirements for potentially\nneeded Kerberos extensions.\n\t "

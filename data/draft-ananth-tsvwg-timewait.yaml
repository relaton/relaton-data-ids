  script: Latn
  content: "Source port randomization has been suggested to provide improved\nsecurity
    and obfuscation which helps in adding robustness towards\nblind attacks.  With
    TCP in practice, simply producing a random port\nas the source port for a new
    connection can lead to problems when a\nTCP client establishes connections to
    a TCP server at a high rate.\nIf the same source port value is chosen twice, the
    client TCP\nconnection can fail due to the server having the Transmission Control\nBlock
    (TCB) for this tuple lingering in TIME-WAIT state.\n\nThis memo discusses the
    ramifications of such source port reuse\nscenarios and suggests some mitigations
    to avoid the same.\n\t "

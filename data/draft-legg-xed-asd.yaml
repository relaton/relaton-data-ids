  script: Latn
  content: "Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) is a semantically equivalent Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) representation for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
    specifications.  ASN.X completely avoids the numerous ambiguities inherent in
    the ASN.1 language; therefore, specifications written in ASN.X are much easier
    to parse and manage than original ASN.1 specifications.  ASN.X, together with
    the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER), constitutes a schema language for XML documents
    that offers, through other ASN.1 encoding rules, alternative compact binary encodings
    for XML instance documents.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

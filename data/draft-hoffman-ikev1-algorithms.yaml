  content: "The required and suggested algorithms in the original Internet Key Exchange
    version 1 (IKEv1) specification do not reflect the current reality of the IPsec
    market requirements.  The original specification allows weak security and suggests
    algorithms that are thinly implemented.  This document updates RFC 2409, the original
    specification, and is intended for all IKEv1 implementations deployed today. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

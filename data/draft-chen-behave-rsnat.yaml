  content: "For the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address pool against the slow\ndevelopment
    of IPv6, IPv4/IPv6 co-existence/transition would be a\nlong period.  In the IPv4/IPv6
    transition process, there are many\nNAT- like technologies active in the internet.
    \ However, the NAT\nboxes such as IPv4 NAT, IPv4/IPv6 NAT are so poor in their\nreliability
    and scalability, which put a severe threat on the\ndevelopment of IPv4/IPv6 transition.
    \ This document defines a\nreliable and scalable NAT (RS- NAT) mechanism to solve
    the problem.\n\t "

  content: "   The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is\n   charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich\n   communication
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web-\n   browsers.  For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working\n   group has in particular defined
    the concept of bi-directional data\n   channels over SCTP, where each data channel
    might be used to\n   transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.  This document\n
    \  specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can be\n   instantiated
    as a WebRTC data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP\n   offer/exchange to negotiate
    out-of-band the sub-protocol specific\n   parameters.  Two network configurations
    are documented: a WebRTC end-\n   to-end configuration (connecting two MSRP over
    data channel\n   endpoints), and a gateway configuration (connecting an MSRP over
    data\n   channel endpoint with an MSRP over TCP endpoint).\n\n\t "

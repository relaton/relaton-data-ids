abstract:
- content: "<p>The evolution of network management towards autonomic operation requires
    the deployment of AI agents at various hierarchical layers, including directly
    on network elements. This transformation shifts network devices from passively
    managed resources to autonomous entities capable of local decision-making and
    collaborative problem- solving. This document discusses the applicability of the
    Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol to the network management plane, specifically for
    communication between Controller Agents (CAs) and Device Agents (DAs). This indicates
    that the inherent characteristics of Device Agents necessitate the adoption of
    the agent-to-agent communication paradigm. The document further explores generic
    workflows, deployment scenarios, and the relationship of A2A with existing network
    management protocols like NETCONF, RESTCONF, gNMI,and the Model Context Protocol
    (MCP).</p>"

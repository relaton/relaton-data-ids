  content: "This document presents home control and automation application \n   specific
    requirements for ROuting in Low power and Lossy networks \n   (ROLL). In a modern
    home, a high number of wireless devices are used \n   for a wide set of purposes.
    Examples include lighting control, \n   heating control, sensors, leak detectors,
    healthcare systems and \n   advanced remote controls. Because such devices only
    cover a limited radio range, multi-hop routing is often required. The aim of this
    \n   document is to specify the routing requirements for networks \n   comprising
    such constrained devices in a home network environment.\n\t "

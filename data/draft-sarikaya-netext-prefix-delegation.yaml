  content: "In Proxy Mobile IPv6, prefixes can only be assigned to one interface\nof
    a mobile node by the local mobility anchor (LMA) and different\nmobile nodes can
    not share these home network prefixes.  Managing\nper-MN's interface home network
    prefixes is likely to increase the\nprocessing load at the LMA.  Based on the
    idea that Dynamic Host\nConfiguration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers can manage
    prefixes,\nwe propose a new technique in which LMA offloads delegation and\nrelease
    tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6 server.  LMA requests\nprefixes for an incoming
    mobile node to the DHCPv6 server.  Based on\nthese prefixes, the mobile node can
    create home addresses for its\ninterface.  When the mobile node leaves the network,
    the prefixes are\nreturned to the DHCPv6 server.  Authentication, Authorization
    and\nAccounting (AAA) servers can also play a role in prefix\nauthorization.\n\t "

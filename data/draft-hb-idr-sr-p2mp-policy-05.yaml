  content: "   SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture for\n
    \  P2MP service delivery.\n\n   A P2MP policy consists of candidate paths that
    connects the Root of\n   the Tree to a set of Leaves.  The P2MP policy is composed
    of\n   replication segments.  A replication segment is a forwarding\n   instruction
    for a candidate path which is downloaded to the Root,\n   transit nodes and the
    leaves.\n\n   This document specifies a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI in order
    to\n   advertise P2MP policy from a controller to a set of nodes.\n\n   This document
    introduces three new route types within this NLRI, one\n   for P2MP policy and
    its candidate paths that need to be programmed on\n   the Root node, one for the
    replication segment incoming SID which\n   uniquely will identify the cross connect
    and another for each\n   outgoing interface that the packets get replicated to.
    \ The last two\n   route types are forwarding instructions that needs to be programmed\n
    \  on the Root, and optionally on Transit and Leaf nodes.\n\n   It should be noted
    that this document does not specify how the Root\n   and the Leaves are discovered
    on the controller, it only describes\n   how the P2MP Policy and Replication Segments
    are programmed from the\n   controller to the nodes.\n\n\t "

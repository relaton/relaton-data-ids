  content: "   This memo introduces a compact data-structure representation of\n   multicast
    trees called \"Recursive Bitstring Structure\" (RBS) and its\n   use for (stateless)
    forwarding of packets that include this structure\n   in their header.  It is
    intended as an alternative to \"flat\"\n   bitstring addresses as used in BIER
    and BIER-TE or possible\n   forwarding plane variations such as MSR6.  RBS aims
    to improve\n   performance and scalability over flat bitstrings and simplify\n
    \  operations.\n\n   Operations is simplified because RBS does not require the
    use,\n   management and optimization of network-wide configured address spaces\n
    \  BIFT-ID and SI and because one common RBS mechanism can replace flat\n   bitstring
    addresses for both shortest-path forwarding and tree\n   engineered forwarding.
    \ It intends to improve performance by allowing\n   multicast to sparse set of
    receivers in larger networks with fewer\n   packets and it intends to improve
    scalability by requiring less BIFT\n   state on routers.\n\n\t "

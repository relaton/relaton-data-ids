  content: "The routing problem of multi-domain optical network includes \nintra-domain
    routing and inter-domain routing.Although the \nintra-domain routing algorithm
    has been well studied, the \ninter-domain routing computation in distributed multi-domain
    optical \nnetwork still presents many problems and needs further research.\nCompared
    to single domain, the routing computation in multi-domain \nnetwork needs topology
    abstraction.In this paper, we first have \nfull-mesh topology abstraction improved,
    and then present a novel \nalgorithm to calculate the inter-domain routing. By
    computing the \nshortest path based on the available wavelengths, the proposed
    \nalgorithm improves the performance of routing provision. Simulation \nresults
    show that the new algorithm achieves the satisfactory\nblocking performance.\n\t "

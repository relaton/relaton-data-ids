  content: "   Segment Routing allows a node to steer a packet through an ordered\n
    \  list of instructions, called segments.  The ingress node prepends a\n   SR
    header to a packet containing a set of \"segments\".  A segment can\n   represent
    any instruction topological or service-based.\n\n   The Segment Routing architecture
    can be implemented using MPLS with\n   no change to the forwarding plane.  A segment
    is encoded as an MPLS\n   label.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as a
    stack of labels,\n   but it has implications on label stack depth.\n\n   This
    document describes how to decrease the depth of the label stack\n   in order to
    do effective Segment Routing operation.\n\n\t "

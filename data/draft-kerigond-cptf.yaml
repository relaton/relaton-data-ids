abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol extension for connectionless packet
    transmission, enabling forwarding devices such as routers and switches to insert
    per-hop arrival timestamps directly into packets during transit. The extension
    allows receivers and monitoring systems to reconstruct the precise timing and
    location of delays throughout a packet's network path, improving performance diagnostics
    for protocols such as UDP, ICMP, multicast, and broadcast.</p>"

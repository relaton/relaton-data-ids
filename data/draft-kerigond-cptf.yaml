- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a protocol extension for connectionless\n   packet
    transmission, enabling forwarding devices such as routers and\n   switches to
    insert per-hop arrival timestamps directly into packets\n   during transit.  The
    extension allows receivers and monitoring\n   systems to reconstruct the precise
    timing and location of delays\n   throughout a packet's network path, improving
    performance diagnostics\n   for protocols such as UDP, ICMP, multicast, and broadcast.\n\n\t "

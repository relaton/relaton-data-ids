abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   When RFC 6724 was published it defined an address selection algorithm\n
    \  along with a default policy table, and noted a number of examples\n   where
    that policy table might benefit from adjustment for specific\n   scenarios.  It
    also noted that it is important for implementations to\n   provide a way to change
    the default policies as more experience is\n   gained.  This update draws on several
    years of such operational\n   experience to refine RFC 6724, with emphasis on
    preference for the\n   use of ULA addresses over IPv4 addresses and the clarification
    of\n   mandatory support for Rule 5.5.  It also defines the concept of\n   \"known-local\"
    ULA prefixes and the means by which nodes can identify\n   them and insert them
    into their policy table such that ULA-to-ULA\n   communications within fd00::/8
    become preferred over GUA-to-GUA for\n   local use.  The update also demotes the
    preference for 6to4\n   addresses.  These changes to default behavior improve
    supportability\n   of common use cases, including automatic / unmanaged scenarios.
    \ It\n   is recognized that some less common deployment scenarios may require\n
    \  explicit configuration or custom changes to achieve desired\n   operational
    parameters.\n\n\t "

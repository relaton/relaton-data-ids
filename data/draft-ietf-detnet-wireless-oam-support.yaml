  content: "   Some critical applications may use a wireless infrastructure.\n   However,
    wireless networks exhibit a bandwidth of several orders of\n   magnitude lower
    than wired networks.  Besides, wireless transmissions\n   are lossy by nature;
    the probability that a packet cannot be decoded\n   correctly by the receiver
    may be quite high.  In these conditions,\n   providing high reliability and a
    low delay is challenging.  This\n   document lists the requirements of the Operation,
    Administration, and\n   Maintenance (OAM) features are recommended to provide
    availability\n   and reliability on top of a collection of wireless segments.
    \ This\n   document describes the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for using\n
    \  OAM in wireless networks to achieve Service Level Objectives (SLO).\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document identifies various threats to networks employing\n   segment
    routing over an IPv6 transport.  Segment Routing inherits\n   potential security
    vulnerabilities from source routing in general,\n   and from label-switching approaches
    such as MPLS.  The document\n   discusses how common security vulnerabilities
    may be present in SRv6\n   networks, depending on the security policies that are
    imposed.\n\n\t "

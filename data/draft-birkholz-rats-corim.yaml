  content: "   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess\n
    \  the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide\n   whether
    to engage in secure interactions with it.  Evidence about\n   trustworthiness
    can be rather complex and it is deemed unrealistic\n   that every Relying Party
    is capable of the appraisal of Evidence.\n   Therefore that burden is typically
    offloaded to a Verifier.  In order\n   to conduct Evidence appraisal, a Verifier
    requires not only fresh\n   Evidence from an Attester, but also trusted Endorsements
    and\n   Reference Values from Endorsers and Reference Value Providers, such\n
    \  as manufacturers, distributors, or device owners.  This document\n   specifies
    Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIM) that\n   represent Endorsements
    and Reference Values in CBOR format.\n   Composite devices or systems are represented
    by a collection of\n   Concise Module Identifiers (CoMID) and Concise Software
    Identifiers\n   (CoSWID) bundled in a CoRIM document.\n\n\t "

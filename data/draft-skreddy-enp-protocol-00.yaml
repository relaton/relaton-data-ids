  content: "As  the  complexity  of  distributed  applications   increases,   an\nincreasing
    amount of processing is done using distributed processes,\nwhich typically execute
    without the direct  supervision  of  an  end\nuser.  The  user  must poll these
    processes periodically to check if\nthey are completed successfully or  not.  This
    \ polling  results  in\nunnecessary  wastage  of  network  bandwidth  as  well
    \ as computing\nresources. The user generally cannot  see  intermediate  results
    \ or\nprogress reports for long running processes, they must wait till the\nprocess
    is completely finished before viewing the results.\nThus the problem of monitoring
    \ events  is  central  in  distributed\napplications  and protocols. A repeated
    need in such applications is\nreceive notifications when a  resource  property
    \ value  changes  or\nevent  state  changes.  Current database systems provides
    mechanisms\nlike  constraints,  triggers  and  active  database   rules.   These\nfacilities
    \ provides  an  automated  means  to  ensure  the database\nintegrity or perform
    specific action when  data  changes.  Need  for\nsuch kind of requirement is fundamental
    is network applications\n\n\t "

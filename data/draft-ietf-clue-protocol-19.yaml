abstract:
- content: <p>The Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence (CLUE) protocol is
    an application protocol conceived for the description and negotiation of a telepresence
    session. The design of the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements and
    the framework defined within the IETF CLUE Working Group. A companion document,
    RFC 8848, delves into CLUE signaling details as well as the SIP / Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) session establishment phase. CLUE messages flow over the CLUE data
    channel, based on reliable and ordered SCTP-over-DTLS transport. ("SCTP" stands
    for "Stream Control Transmission Protocol".) Message details, together with the
    behavior of CLUE Participants acting as Media Providers and/or Media Consumers,
    are herein discussed.</p>

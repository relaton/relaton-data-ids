  content: "   Context replication increases header compression gains by reducing
    \n   the redundancy between flows via efficient replicate (IR-CR) packets. \n
    \  The optimum design of IR-CR packet formats requires elaborate    \n   understanding
    of the inter-flow redundancy. As context replication is \n   most well-suited
    for TCP, this document presents a statistical \n   analysis of TCP/IP inter-flow
    field behaviour. Based on the analysis, \n   recommendations on ROHC-TCP packet
    format specifications for context \n   replication are made. It is also shown
    that inter-flow field \n   behaviour is inherently and significantly asymmetrical,
    and various \n   ways of handling it are considered. Finally, based on the inter-flow
    \n   behaviour of TCP Window field, it is noted that current encoding \n   methods
    do not compress it efficiently.\n\t "

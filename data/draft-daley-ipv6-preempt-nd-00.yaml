  content: "   In certain circumstances, a host knows that it will be receiving data\n
    \  at an IP address for which its neighbours have no neighbour cache\n   entry.\n\n
    \  Where the expected packets are required to be received promptly, or\n   there
    is significant chance of packet loss in a neighbour discovery\n   exchange from
    the peer to the host, it may be advantageous to install\n   a neighbour cache
    entry on the peer before it is required.  This\n   document proposes a mechanism
    whereby hosts can choose to\n   preemptively populate their peer's neighbour cache
    to forestall later\n   neighbour discovery exchanges.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   As IP and LDP Fast-Reroute are increasingly deployed, the coverage\n
    \  limitations of Loop-Free Alternates are seen as a problem that\n   requires
    a straightforward and consistent solution for IP and LDP,\n   for unicast and
    multicast.  This draft describes an architecture\n   based on redundant backup
    trees where a single failure can cut a\n   point-of-local-repair from the destination
    only on one of the pair of\n   redundant trees.\n\n   One innovative algorithm
    to compute such topologies is maximally\n   disjoint backup trees.  Each router
    can compute its next-hops for\n   each pair of maximally disjoint trees rooted
    at each node in the IGP\n   area with computational complexity similar to that
    required by\n   Dijkstra.\n\n   The additional state, address and computation
    requirements are\n   believed to be significantly less than the Not-Via architecture\n
    \  requires.\n\n\t "

  content: "The mailing list command specification header fields are a set of structured
    fields to be added to email messages sent by email distribution lists.  By including
    these header fields, list servers can make it possible for mail clients to provide
    automated tools for users to perform list functions.  This could take the form
    of a menu item, push button, or other user interface element.  The intent is to
    simplify the user experience, providing a common interface to the often cryptic
    and varied mailing list manager commands. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

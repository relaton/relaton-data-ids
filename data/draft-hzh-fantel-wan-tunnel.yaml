abstract:
- content: "<p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), many emerging
    AI services require lossless transmission of RDMA packets over tunnels in Wide
    Area Network(WAN). To meet the stringent performance demands of these services,
    WAN should support the real- time network state notification to ensure high throughput,
    low latency, and zero packet loss. The current reactive notification mechanisms
    are limited by responsiveness, coverage, and operational efficiency. Therefore,
    a faster and proactive notification mechanism is needed to enable more responsive
    Traffic Engineering (TE) and Load Balancing (LB). This draft describes typical
    scenarios for transmitting RDMA packets over WAN tunnels, specifies the fast notification
    framework to support key TE areas (e.g., congestion control, protection, and load
    balance), and defines the packet format for fast notification.</p>"

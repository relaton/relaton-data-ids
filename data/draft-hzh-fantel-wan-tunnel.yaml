  content: "   With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), many\n
    \  emerging AI services require lossless transmission of RDMA packets\n   over
    tunnels in Wide Area Network(WAN).  To meet the stringent\n   performance demands
    of these services, WAN should support the real-\n   time network state notification
    to ensure high throughput, low\n   latency, and zero packet loss.  The current
    reactive notification\n   mechanisms are limited by responsiveness, coverage,
    and operational\n   efficiency.  Therefore, a faster and proactive notification
    mechanism\n   is needed to enable more responsive Traffic Engineering (TE) and
    Load\n   Balancing (LB).\n\n   This draft describes typical scenarios for transmitting
    RDMA packets\n   over WAN tunnels, specifies the fast notification framework to\n
    \  support key TE areas (e.g., congestion control, protection, and load\n   balance),
    and defines the packet format for fast notification.\n\n\t "

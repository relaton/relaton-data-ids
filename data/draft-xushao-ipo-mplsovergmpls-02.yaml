  content: "MPLS over GMPLS-based optical networks (MPLS over GMPLS) is a subset \nof
    IP over optical networks. To be more specific, in this draft it \nrefers to the
    technology of interconnection between MPLS networks and \nGMPLS-based optical
    networks with an overlay model or an interdomain \nmodel. It is an important milestone
    in the evolutionary roadmap from \nIP over static WDM to a peer model of network
    interconnections. The \nmost significant feature of the requirements for MPLS
    over GMPLS is a \nmuch more dynamic interface between the two layers. The draft
    \ndiscusses the evolutionary roadmap of IP over optical networks and \nthen highlights
    the significance of the concept of MPLS over GMPLS. \nSome new requirements will
    be identified, including multi-lightpath \nconnections, MPLS network topology
    dynamic changes and dynamic \ntraffic grooming and so on. It is these requirements
    that bring some \nchallenges to the present routing, signaling and UNI protocols.\n\t "

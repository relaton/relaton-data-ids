  content: "RADIUS servers [2] require foreknowledge of the IP address of the\n   RADIUS
    clients, as the shared secret is bound to the address.  This\n   has been a manageable
    situation when the RADIUS Clients were just\n   NASs (Network Access Servers).
    \ With the advent of IEEE 802.1x [3],\n   there is a significant increase in RADIUS
    clients in organizations\n   not prepared to have the RADIUS Clients use fixed
    IP addresses and\n   manage the shared secret.  To address the concerns of the
    IEEE 802.1\n   and 802.11 Task Groups a level of indirection is added; a Master\n
    \  secret bound to the name of the RADIUS client.  This Master secret\n   is created
    by the Shared Secret Provisioning Protocol [4].  For\n   RADIUS Client Kickstart,
    SSPP is run over SNMP [5].  The Master\n   Secret is used in an initial RADIUS
    exchange to create a session\nsecret that is used as the normal RADIUS client
    shared secret.  SSPP\n   can be used to change the Master Secret whenever required.\n\n\t "

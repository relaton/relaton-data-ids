  content: "   Different routing protocols exist and each employs its own mechanism\n
    \  for securing the protocol packets on the wire.  While most already\n   have
    some method for accomplishing cryptographic message\n   authentication, in many
    cases the existing methods are dated,\n   vulnerable to attack, and employ cryptographic
    algorithms that have\n   been deprecated.  The \"Keying and Authentication for
    Routing\n   Protocols\" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul and improve these\n   mechanisms.\n\n
    \  This document does not contain protocol specifications.  Instead, it\n   defines
    the areas where protocol specification work is needed and a\n   set of requirements
    for KARP design teams to follow.  RFC 6518,\n   \"Keying and Authentication for
    Routing Protocols (KARP) Design\n   Guidelines\" is a companion to this document;
    KARP design teams will\n   use them together to review and overhaul routing protocols.
    \ These\n   two documents reflect the input of both the IETF's Security Area and\n
    \  Routing Area in order to form a mutually agreeable work plan.\n\n   This document
    has three main parts.  The first part provides an\n   overview of the KARP effort.
    \ The second part lists the threats from\n   RFC 4593, Generic Threats To Routing
    Protocols, that are in scope for\n   attacks against routing protocols' transport
    systems, including any\n   mechanisms built into the routing protocols themselves,
    which\n   accomplish packet authentication.  The third part enumerates the\n   requirements
    that routing protocol specifications must meet when\n   addressing those threats
    for RFC 6518's \"Work Phase 1\", the update to\n   a routing protocol's existing
    transport security.\n\n\t "

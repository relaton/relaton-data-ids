  content: "   As spam continues to grow throughout the Internet, various\n   countermeasures
    have been developed.  Among these is the \"DNS\n   blacklist\", a DNS server configured
    to return a \"good\" or \"bad\"\n   response to a query on a given IP address;
    mail servers can be\n   configured to automatically query such a server and reject
    messages\n   which are flagged \"bad\".  If the blacklist is accurate, this allows\n
    \  mail servers to reject spam without wasting the time of the human\n   recipient
    or the resources of the server.  However, between delays\n   in responding to
    environmental changes and arbitrary operational\n   decisions by blacklist operators,
    such blocking of mail in fact\n   causes significant harm to innocent third parties.
    \ This memo\n   describes the issues concerning these blacklists and suggests
    ways\n   to resolve the attendant problems.\n\t "

  content: "This specification defines the format of UUIDs (Universally Unique\n  IDentifier),
    also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID\n  is 128 bits long,
    and if generated according to the one of the\n  mechanisms in this document, is
    either guaranteed to be different\n  from all other UUIDs/GUIDs generated until
    3400 A.D. or extremely\n  likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).
    UUIDs\n  were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) [1] and\n
    \ later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing\n  Environment
    [2].\n \n  This specification is derived from the latter specification with the\n
    \ kind permission of the OSF.\n\t "

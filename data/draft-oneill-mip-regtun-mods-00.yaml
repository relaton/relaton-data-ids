  content: "Regional Registration modifies the normal MIP Registration signalling
    \  back to the HA so that the signalling can traverse an intermediate \nGateway
    Foreign Agent (GFA). The registered binding is between the Home \nAddress (HoA)
    and the GFA Care-of Address (GFA-CoA) in the Home Agent \n(HA), and between the
    GFA-CoA and the Foreign Agent (FA-CoA) in the GFA. \nTwo extensions are defined
    to support this new Registration processing \nthese being the Hierarchical Foreign
    Agent extension (HFAext) and the GFA IP address extension (GFAIPext). The former
    is used to carry the FA CoA to the GFA and the latter is used by the FA to allocate
    a GFA to the MN, and by the FA, GFA, HA to securely return the GFA IP address
    to the MN.\nThe present processing rules for the HA registration enable the FA
    to \nadvertise the GFA to the MN in a Foreign Agent Advertisement (FAA) and \nfor
    the MN to include that GFA address into the CoA field of the MIP me \nRegistration.
    This however assumes a number of things about the GFA \naddress in the FAA and
    the addressing realms between the FA-GFA and GFA-\nHA.. Specifically, the GFA
    CoA and the GFA IP address must potentially be from two different addressing plans
    and hence cannot be in the same FAA. This draft describes the issues and suggests
    a solution that requires slight modifications to the required extensions, that
    generalises the Home Registration signalling for arbitrary intermediate MIP nodes,
    and only slightly modifies the processing rules for the MIP Home Registration.
    This draft also describes a way to support dynamic HA \nallocation along-side
    Regional Registrations.\n\t "

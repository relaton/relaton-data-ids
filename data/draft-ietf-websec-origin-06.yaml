  content: "This document defines the concept of an \"origin\", which is often used
    as the scope of authority or privilege by user agents.  Typically, user agents
    isolate content retrieved from different origins to prevent malicious web site
    operators from interfering with the operation of benign web sites.  In addition
    to outlining the principles that underlie the concept of origin, this document
    details how to determine the origin of a URI and how to serialize an origin into
    a string.  It also defines an HTTP header field, named \"Origin\", that indicates
    which origins are associated with an HTTP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

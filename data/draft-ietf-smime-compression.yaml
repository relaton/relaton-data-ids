  content: "This document defines a format for using compressed data as a Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) content type.  Compressing data before transmission provides
    a number of advantages, including the elimination of data redundancy which could
    help an attacker, speeding up processing by reducing the amount of data to be
    processed by later steps (such as signing or encryption), and reducing overall
    message size.  Although there have been proposals for adding compression at other
    levels (for example at the MIME or SSL level), these don't address the problem
    of compression of CMS content unless the compression is supplied by an external
    means (for example by intermixing MIME and CMS). [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

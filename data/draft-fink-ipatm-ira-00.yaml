  content: "This Internet Draft proposes a new model for the use of IP over ATM networks,
    to be known as the Integrated Routing & Addressing (IRA) model.  The basic idea
    is simple, namely to use IPv6/IPv4 addresses for IP/ATM nodes by embedding them
    in an ATM NSAP address, and then using the same hierarchical prefix routing for
    both the ATM and IP layers, thus providing a seamless integration of the two technologies.
    \ The basic purpose of the IRA model is to recognize the commonality of requirements
    between the existing Internet and a new global ATM infrastructure, avoid unnecessary
    duplication of effort, and allow each technology to take maximal advantage of
    the strengths of the other.     This model is briefly compared with other models
    such as the 'Classical IP and ARP over ATM' model and the 'NBMA Next Hop Resolution
    Protocol (NHRP)' model.     The method by which IP hosts and routers would utilize
    the IRA model is presented, including a protocol called Prefix Route Exchange
    (PRE), which would be used to exchange prefix routes between an IP router or host
    and its directly attached ATM switch.\n\t "

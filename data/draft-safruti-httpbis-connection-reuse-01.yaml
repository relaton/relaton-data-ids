  content: "   This document describes a suggested enhancement to HTTP, in which a\n
    \  user-agent and a server can use a single connection to exchange\n   requests/responses
    for multiple requested hostnames for which the\n   server is authorized to serve.
    \ This enhancement suggests that user-\n   agents will prefer to re-use an existing
    connection if it can be used\n   to other hosts, and presents methods for a server
    to announce hosts\n   that are served by it, as well as a mechanism for the user-agent
    to\n   validate that the server is indeed trusted to serve this hosts.\n\n   This
    is highly relevant when the server is actually a surrogate (like\n   in a case
    of a CDN server), or in multi-hosts hosting environments,\n   where the same server
    serves multiple hostnames/domains and can\n   improve performance by the reuse
    of established and already optimized\n   connections.\n\n\t "

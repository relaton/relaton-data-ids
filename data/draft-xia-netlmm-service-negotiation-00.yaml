  content: "   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is network based mobility protocol which\n
    \  provides IP session continuity for a mobile node without its\n   involvement
    in mobility management.  PMIPv6 also can be viewed as a\n   service and authorization
    provided by networks.  A mobile node can\n   decide if it wants to use the service
    or not.  This proposal\n   describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP)
    based mechanism\n   for the service negotiation between a mobile node and an AAA
    server.\n\n\t "

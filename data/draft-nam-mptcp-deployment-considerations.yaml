  content: "   Network-Assisted MPTCP deployment models are designed to facilitate\n
    \  the adoption of MPTCP for the establishment of multi-path\n   communications
    without making any assumption about the support of\n   MPTCP by the communicating
    peers.  MPTCP Conversion Points (MCPs)\n   located in the network are responsible
    for establishing multi-path\n   communications on behalf of endpoints, thereby
    taking advantage of\n   MPTCP capabilities to achieve different goals that include
    (but are\n   not limited to) optimization of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth\n
    \  aggregation), of resiliency (e.g., primary/backup communication\n   paths),
    and traffic offload management.\n\n   This document describes Network-Assisted
    MPTCP uses cases, deployment\n   scenarios, and operational considerations.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document is one of a set of documents which together describe all
    aspects of a new Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP is an application level
    protocol that can be used for distributed printing using Internet tools and technology.
    The protocol is heavily influenced by the printing model introduced in the Document
    Printing Application (ISO/IEC 10175 DPA) standard.  Although DPA specifies both
    end user and administrative features, IPP version 1.0 is focused on end user functionality.
    \ Although DPA specifies both end user and administrative features, IPP version
    1.0 is focused only on end user functionality.\n\t "

  content: "The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for\nadvancing
    a routing protocol from Draft Standard to full Standard\nhave been satisfied by
    Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4).\nThis report satisfies the requirement
    for 'the second report', as\ndescribed in Section 6.0 of RFC 1264.  In order to
    fulfill the\nrequirement, this report augments RFC 1773 and describes additional\nknowledge
    and understanding gained in the time between when the\nprotocol was made a Draft
    Standard and when it was submitted for\nStandard.\n\t "

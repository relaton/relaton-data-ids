abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Some clients on the Internet make inferences about the administrative\n
    \  relationships among servers on the Internet based on the domain names\n   of
    those servers.  Examples include decisions about acceptance of\n   cookies and
    about cross-document information sharing in ECMAScript\n   DOM.  Perhaps unfortunately,
    real administrative boundaries in the\n   DNS are not possible to detect, and
    therefore these inferences can go\n   wrong in several ways.  Mitigation strategies
    deployed so far will\n   not scale.  The solution to this is to provide a way
    to make an\n   explicit assertion about the relationships between different domain\n
    \  names.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies several usecases related to the different\n
    \  ways IoT devices are exploited by malicious adversaries to\n   instantiate
    Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks. The\n   attacks are generted from
    IoT devices that have no proper protection\n   against generating unsolicited
    communication messages targeting a\n   certain network and creating large amounts
    of network traffic. The\n   attackers take advantage of breaches in the configuration
    data in\n   unprotected IoT devices exploited for DDoS attacks. The attackers\n
    \  take advantage of the IoT devices that can send network packets\n   that were
    generated by malicious code that interacts with an OS\n   implementation that
    runs on the IoT devices. The prupose of this\n   draft is to present possible
    IoT DDoS usecases that need to be\n   prevented by TEE. The major enabler of such
    attacks is related to\n   IoT devices that have no OS or unprotected EE OS and
    run\n   code that is downloaded to them from the TA and modified by\n   man-in-the-middle
    that inserts malicious code in the OS. This draft\n   adds list of MUD files for
    most IoT devices.\n\n\t "

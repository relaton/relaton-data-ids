- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes how the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) can
    be used to provide a multicast heartbeat. Given the current state of the art in
    multicast diagnostics, use of a heartbeat may prove a useful diagnostic tool for
    operators as well as for applications developers.   Operators may use the heartbeat
    to alert themselves to losses of multicast connectivity in portions of the network.
    \ Applications developers may use the heartbeat to determine whether to enable
    multicast features or to default to unicast operation.  While it is likely that
    better diagnostic methods will become available in the long term,  given the current
    state of the art, SNTP may be usefully employed as a multicast hearbeat.\n\t "

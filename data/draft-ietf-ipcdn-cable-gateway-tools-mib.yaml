  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) \nfor
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community. \nIn particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-\nbased management of CableHome
    compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home \nrouters.  Specifically, this MIB defines
    managed objects for both a \nconnection speed tool and an ICMP 'ping' tool between
    the Gateway and \ndevices on the LAN. \nThis memo specifies a MIB module in a
    manner that is compliant to the \nSNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects is
    consistent with the SNMP \nframework and existing SNMP standards.  \n    \n\n

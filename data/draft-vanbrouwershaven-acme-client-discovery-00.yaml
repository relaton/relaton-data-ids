abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   A significant challenge in the widespread adoption of the Automated\n
    \  Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555] is the trust\n   establishment
    between ACME servers and clients.  While ACME clients\n   can automatically discover
    the URL of the ACME server through ACME\n   Auto Discovery [I-D.vanbrouwershaven-acme-auto-discovery],
    they face\n   difficulty in identifying authorized clients.  This draft proposes
    a\n   solution to this problem by allowing Certification Authority (CA)\n   customers
    to specify which ACME keys are authorized to request\n   certificates on their
    behalf by simply providing the domain name of\n   the service provider.\n\n   Specifically,
    this document registers the URI \"/.well-known/acme-\n   keys\" at which all compliant
    service providers can publish their ACME\n   client public keys.  This mechanism
    allows the ACME server to\n   identify the specific service provider, enhancing
    the trust\n   relationship.  Furthermore, it provides flexibility to service\n
    \  providers as they can use multiple keys and rotate them as often as\n   they
    like, thereby improving security and control over their ACME\n   client configurations
    while giving CA customers the ability to\n   specifically authorize which service
    providers can request\n   certificates on their behalf.\n\n\t "

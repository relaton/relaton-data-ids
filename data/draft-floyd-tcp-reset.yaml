abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document is being written because there are a number of\nfirewalls
    in the Internet that inappropriately reset a TCP connection\nupon receiving certain
    TCP SYN packets, in particular, packets with\nflags set in the Reserved field
    of the TCP header.  In this document\nwe argue that this practice is not conformant
    with TCP standards, and\nis an inappropriate overloading of the semantics of the
    TCP reset.\nWe also consider the longer-term consequences of this and similar\nactions
    as obstacles to the evolution of the Internet infrastructure.\n\t "

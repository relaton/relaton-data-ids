  content: "   The Packet Replication and Elimination (PRE) mechanism duplicates\n
    \  data packets into several paths in the network to increase\n   reliability
    and provide low jitter.  Over a wireless medium, this\n   technique can take advantage
    of communication overhearing, when\n   parallel transmissions over two adjacent
    paths are scheduled.  This\n   document presents the concept and details the required
    changes to the\n   current specifications that will be necessary to enable PRE.\n\n\t "

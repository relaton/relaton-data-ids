  script: Latn
  content: "   Secure MIME (S/MIME) defined a method of placing security labels on
    a\n   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) object.  These labels are placed\n   as
    part of the data signed and validated by the parties.  This means\n   that the
    message content is visible to the recipient prior to the\n   label enforcement.
    \ A new model for enforcement of policy using a\n   third party is described in
    RFC TBD\n   [I.D-draft-freeman-plasma-requirements].  This is the Policy\n   Augmented
    S/MIME (PLASMA) system.  This document provides the details\n   needed to implement
    the new Plasma model in the CMS infrastructure.\n\n   An additional benefit of
    using the Plasma module is that the server,\n   based on policy, manages who has
    access to the message and how the\n   keys are protected.\n\n   The document details
    how the client encryption and decryption\n   processes are performed, defines
    how to construct the CMS recipient\n   info structure, a new content to hold the
    data required for the\n   Plasma server to store the keys and policy information.
    \ The document\n   does not cover the protocol between the client and the Plasma
    policy\n   enforcement server.  One example of the client/server protocol can
    be\n   found in RFC TBD [plasma-token].\n\n\t "

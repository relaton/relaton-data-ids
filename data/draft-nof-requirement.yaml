  content: "   NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range\n
    \  of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a\n   storage
    networking fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and\n   InfiniBand.  For Ethernet-based
    network, RDMA or TCP technology can\n   be used to transport NVMe, but the network
    management mechanism is\n   simple, and fault detection is weak.\n\n   This document
    describes the solution requirements for automatic\n   device discovery to improve
    usability and quick switchover to improve\n   reliability.\n\n\n\t "

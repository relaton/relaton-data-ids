  content: "   This document defines a protocol that facilitates integration of\n
    \  tools into the design and run-time operations of AI Agents.  The\n   focus
    is on enterprise AI agents that need to make use of APIs\n   exposed by third
    party providers.  This protocol, called the\n   Normalized API for AI Agents Calling
    Tools (N-ACT) - pronounced like\n   \"enact\" - defines an OpenAI spec that has
    two principle features -\n   enumeration of tools and invocation of tools.  The
    enumeration API\n   enables a human - the AI Agent designer employed by the enterprise
    -\n   to select and include tools from third-party vendors into operating\n   procedures
    (also known as skills or instructions) which direct the\n   behavior of AI Agents,
    including how and when to invoke those tools.\n   The enumeration API can also
    be used (optionally) at run-time for the\n   LLM to obtain tool descriptions.
    \ The second feature of the API -\n   invocation - allows the AI Agent executor
    to perform the inter-domain\n   invocation of the tool at run time.  By standardizing
    these two API\n   functions, the time and cost of integration of Internet APIs
    into AI\n   Agents can be reduced.\n\n\t "

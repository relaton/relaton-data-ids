- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a mechanism for authenticating OSPF packets
    \n   by making use of the HMAC algorithm in conjunction with the SHA \n   family
    of cryptographic hash functions. Because of the way the hash \n   functions are
    used in HMAC construction, the collision attacks \n   currently known against
    SHA-1 do not apply. \n    \n   This will be done in addition to the already documented
    \n   authentication schemes described in the base specification. \n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes scenarios where the behavior of the 5G\n   mobility
    management framework is different from earlier cellular\n   generations, and describes
    how it may benefit from some form of\n   adaptation of MPTCP implementations and
    protocol aspects in the 5G\n   system.  This document also describes how MPTCP
    may be leveraged in\n   5G system specifications.\n\n\t "

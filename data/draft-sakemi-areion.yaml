abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a series of cryptographic wide-block permutations
    referred to as Areion-256 and Areion-512. These permutations are constructed using
    AES round operations and are designed for ultra-low latency implementations on
    modern processors with AES instructions. The Areion permutations can be used as
    building blocks in various cryptographic constructions, including authenticated
    encryption and hashing of relatively short input data. Additionally, it describes
    AEAD schemes and hash functions constructed from Areion.</p>"

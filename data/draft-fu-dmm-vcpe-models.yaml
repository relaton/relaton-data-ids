  content: "   This document introduces the concept of Virtual Customer Premises\n
    \  Equipment (VCPE).  Such concept was first proposed in Broadband Forum\n   (BBF)
    as Network Enhanced Residential Gateway (NERG).  The concept is\n   further expanded
    as not only referring to virtual CPE of residential\n   network, but all the virtual
    network and service functions shifted\n   from the customer side to the operator
    side.  Deployment of VCPE in\n   some typical DMM (Distributed Mobility Management)
    scenarios brings\n   specific requirements and even protocol extension in DMM.
    \ In this\n   document, we will first explain the motivation and advantages of\n
    \  VCPE.  A usecases of VCPE in the community Wi-Fi deployment is\n   further
    discussed so as to explain the deployment of VCPE in a DMM\n   scenario.  Three
    models of field deployment of VCPE are discussed\n   afterwards to indicate the
    possible CP/DP decomposition requirement\n   and protocol extension.\n\n\t "

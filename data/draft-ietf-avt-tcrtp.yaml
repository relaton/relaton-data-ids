  content: "This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth utilization
    of RTP streams over network paths that carry multiple Real-time Transport Protocol
    (RTP) streams in parallel between two endpoints, as in voice trunking.  The method
    combines standard protocols that provide compression, multiplexing, and tunneling
    over a network path for the purpose of reducing the bandwidth used when multiple
    RTP streams are carried over that path.  This document specifies an Internet Best
    Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.\n\t "

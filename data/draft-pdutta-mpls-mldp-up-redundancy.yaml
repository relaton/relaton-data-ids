  content: "   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to-\n
    \  Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched\n   Paths.
    The existing specification for this functionality assumes that\n   a downstream
    LSR selects only one upstream LSR for a P2MP or MP2MP\n   LSP. A Make-Before-Break
    (MBB) procedure in mLdp base specification\n   [MLDP] for graceful upstream LSR
    change but that is not applicable\n   when the upstream LSR node fails. As IPTV
    deployments grow in number\n   and size, service providers are looking for solutions
    that minimize\n   the service disruption due to such failures. This document describes\n
    \  a set of procedures that minimize packet loss when an upstream LSR\n   node
    fails. This document does not change any specifications of mLdp\n   protocol as
    defined in [MLDP] and so there are no inter-operability\n   requirements for the
    procedures described in this document.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network-Infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP) is a cryptography-
    based session-layer protocol designed to operationalize Zero Trust principles
    by concealing protected network resources from unauthorized entities. NHP enforces
    authentication-before-connect access control, rendering IP addresses, ports, and
    domain names invisible to unauthorized users. This document defines the protocol
    architecture, cryptographic framework, message formats, and workflow to enable
    independent implementation of NHP. It represents the third generation of network
    hiding technology—evolving from first- generation port knocking to second-generation
    Single-Packet Authorization (SPA) and now to NHP with advanced asymmetric cryptography,
    mutual authentication, and scalability for modern threats. This specification
    also provides guidance for integration with Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP),
    DNS, FIDO, and Zero Trust policy engines.</p>"

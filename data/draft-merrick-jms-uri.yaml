  content: "This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
    as defined in RFC 3986, for designating connections and destination addresses
    used in the Java(tm) Messaging Service (JMS).  It was originally designed for
    particular uses, but applies generally wherever a JMS URI is needed to describe
    the connection to a JMS provider, and access to a JMS Destination.  The syntax
    of this JMS URI is not compatible with previously existing, but unregistered,
    \"jms\" URI schemes.  However, the expressiveness of the scheme described herein
    should satisfy the requirements of all existing circumstances.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

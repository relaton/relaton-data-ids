  content: "   Remote IETF hubs seem to be springing up organically in quite a few\n
    \  regions.  There appear to be regional differences in how hubs are\n   organized.
    \ Latin America has quite a few remote hubs as does India.\n   The two regions
    are different in how they arose, where they meet, and\n   what they do.\n\n   Thus,
    creating a template for a remote hub may not work because hubs\n   may be very
    different across cultures and of very different sizes.\n\n   Lastly, this document
    discusses how IETF \"central\" can assist with\n   remote hubs.\n\n\t "

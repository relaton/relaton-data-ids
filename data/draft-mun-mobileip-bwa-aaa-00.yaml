  content: "   Mobile IP has been recently getting popularity with some interesting\n
    \  transformation in order to be more suitable for use by existing and \n   emerging
    wireless technology, such as IEEE 802.16e Broadband \n   Wireless Access(BWA)
    One of the fundamental features to make Mobile \n   IP available in commercial
    world is secure access with it.\n   In this draft, we propose a novel scheme to
    locally authenticate\n   and authorize inter-domain roaming users for efficient
    way in IEEE\n   802.16e BWA based on authentication, authorization and \n   accout-ing(AAA)
    infrastructure. We present the detailed operations\n   to establish local security
    association(SA) for authentication and\n   performance evaluation by con-sidering
    the traffic and mobility \n   properties of a roaming user as well as the dis-tance
    between the \n   mobile node(MN) and its home AAA server. Proposed scheme outperforms\n
    \  exiting method with respect to authentication cost and ser-vice\n   latency.\n\n\t "

  content: "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) makes available
    to DNS zone administrators a very wide range of Unicode code points.  Most operators
    of zones should probably not permit registration of U-labels using the entire
    range.  This is especially true of zones that accept registrations across organizational
    boundaries, such as top-level domains and, most importantly, the root.  It is
    unfortunately not possible to generate algorithms to determine whether permitting
    a code point presents a low risk.  This memo presents a set of principles that
    can be used to guide the decision of whether a Unicode code point may be wisely
    included in the repertoire of permissible code points in a U-label in a zone.\n\t "

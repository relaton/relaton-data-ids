  content: "  A single JSON document can have multiple logically equivalent\n  physical
    representations. While convenient for human interaction, this\n  flexibility is
    inconvenient for cases where a machine is used to\n  assess the logical equivalence
    of documents. In cases where logical\n  equivalence is useful, an encoder should
    produce a canonical form of a\n  JSON document. For example, since digital signatures
    demand the same\n  physical representation for logically equivalent documents,
    a\n  canonical physical representation would allow the signature to apply\n  to
    the logical document. This internet draft has the goal to define a\n  canonical
    form of JSON documents. Two logically equivalent documents\n  should have same
    canonical form.\n\n\n\t "

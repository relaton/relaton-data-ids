  content: "Network virtualization technique leveraged by a virtual machine makes\nit
    possible to dynamically relocate functional entities without\ntopological and
    physical constraints.  By tapping into this\ntechnique, service mobility, which
    deals with not only functional\nentities but also sessions established between
    those entities, will\nbecome possible and such capability is especially longed
    for\nrealizing more scalable and reliable telecom networks.  This document\nprovides
    the reference model for service mobility in a virtual\nenvironment and defines
    the control protocol between the virtualized\nplatform and the managing controller
    to realize service mobility.\n\t "

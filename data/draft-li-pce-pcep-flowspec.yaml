  content: "   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable\n
    \  of selecting the paths through a traffic engineered network.  These\n   paths
    may be supplied in response to requests for computation, or may\n   be unsolicited
    directions issued by the PCE to network elements.\n   Both approaches use the
    PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey\n   the details of the computed path.\n\n
    \  Traffic flows may be categorized and described using \"Flow\n   Specifications\".
    \ RFC 5575 defines the Flow Specification and\n   describes how it may be distributed
    in BGP to allow specific traffic\n   flows to be associated with routes.\n\n   This
    document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support\n   dissemination of
    Flow Specifications.  This allows a PCE to indicate\n   what traffic should be
    placed on each path that it is aware of.\n\n\n\t "

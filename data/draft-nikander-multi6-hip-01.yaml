abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Host Identity Protocol implements the identifier locator\n   separation
    by introduing a new name space and a new layer to the IP\n   stack.  The new structure
    insulates the transport layer protocols\n   from the internetworking layer, thereby
    allowing transport sessions\n   to remain unaffected even if the underlying IP
    addresses change.\n   That, in turn, seems to make it easier to solve the so called
    site\n   multi-homing problem than without introducing such an indirection\n   layer.\n\n
    \  This document discusses how the proposed HIP mobility and\n   multi-homing
    solution, described separately, would fit to the IETF\n   multi6 working group
    requirements.\n\t "

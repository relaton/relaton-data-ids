  content: "   RFC 5785 defines a path prefix, \"/.well-known/\", that can be used
    by\n   well-known URIs, specifically for the \"http\" and \"https\" URI schemes,\n
    \  which has since been adopted by other URI schemes.  The present memo\n   formally
    updates RFC 7595, which defines the URI schemes regustry, to\n   record the availability
    of these well-known URIs to the URI schemes\n   registered there.\n\n\t "

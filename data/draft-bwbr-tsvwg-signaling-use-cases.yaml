  content: "   Host-to-network signaling can improve the user experience by\n   informing
    the network which flows are more important and which\n   packets within a flow
    are more important.  The differentiated service\n   may be provided at the network
    (e.g., packet prioritization), the\n   sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or
    through cooperation of both\n   the sender and the network.\n\n   This document
    outlines use-cases that highlight the need for a new\n   signaling protocol from
    the receiver to its network elements which\n   enables different traffic treatment.\n\n\t "

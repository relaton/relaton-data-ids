  content: "The Microsoft Windows 2000 implementation of Kerberos introduces a new
    encryption type based on the RC4 encryption algorithm and using an MD5 HMAC for
    checksum. This is offered as an alternative to using the existing DES-based encryption
    types.\n\n The RC4-HMAC encryption types are used to ease upgrade of existing
    Windows NT environments, provide strong cryptography (128-bit key lengths), and
    provide exportable (meet United States government export restriction requirements)
    encryption. This document describes the implementation of those encryption types.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "With current Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support, all\n   communications
    to and from mobile network nodes must go through the\n   MR-HA tunnel when the
    mobile network is away.  This results in\n   increased length of packet route
    and increased packet delay.  To\n   overcome these limitations, one might have
    to turn to route\n   optimization (RO) for NEMO.  This memo documents various
    types of\n   route optimization in NEMO, and explores the benefits and tradeoffs\n
    \  in different aspects of NEMO route optimization.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes the RTP payload format of the Secure\n   Communication
    Interoperability Protocol (SCIP).  SCIP is an\n   application layer protocol that
    provides end-to-end capability\n   exchange, packetization/de-packetization of
    media, reliable\n   transport, and payload encryption.\n\n   SCIP handles packetization/de-packetization
    of the encrypted media\n   and acts as a tunneling protocol, treating SCIP payloads
    as opaque\n   octets to be encapsulated within RTP payloads prior to transmission\n
    \  or decapsulated on reception.  SCIP payloads are sized to fit within\n   the
    maximum transmission unit (MTU) when transported over RTP thereby\n   avoiding
    fragmentation.\n\n   SCIP transmits encrypted traffic and does not require the
    use of\n   Secure RTP (SRTP) for payload protection.  SCIP also provides for\n
    \  reliable transport at the application layer, so it is not necessary\n   to
    negotiate RTCP retransmission capabilities.\n\n   To establish reliable communications
    using SCIP over RTP, it is\n   important that middle boxes avoid parsing or modifying
    SCIP payloads.\n   Because SCIP payloads are confidentiality and integrity protected
    and\n   are only decipherable by the originating and receiving SCIP devices,\n
    \  modification of the payload by middle boxes would be detected as an\n   integrity
    failure in SCIP devices, resulting in retransmission and/or\n   communication
    failure.  Middle boxes do not need to parse the SCIP\n   payloads to correctly
    transport them.  Not only is parsing\n   unnecessary to tunnel/detunnel SCIP within
    RTP, but the parsing and\n   filtering of SCIP payloads by middle boxes would
    likely lead to\n   ossification of the evolving SCIP protocol.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite\n   intended
    for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in\n   browsers - \"real
    time communication on the Web\".\n\n   It intends to serve as a starting and coordination
    point to make sure\n   all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are
    findable, and\n   that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are
    fully\n   specified and on the right publication track.\n\n   This work is an
    attempt to synthesize the input of many people, but\n   makes no claims to fully
    represent the views of any of them.  All\n   parts of the document should be regarded
    as open for discussion,\n   unless the RTCWEB chairs have declared consensus on
    an item.\n\n   This document is a candidate to become a work item of the RTCWEB\n
    \  working group.\n\n\n\t "

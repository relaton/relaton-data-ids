- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "There are many requirements of developing internationalized and \nhuman-readable
    Internet identifiers/names now, thereby there are many \nsystems based on DNS
    technology to meet such requirements. John C. \nKlensin has proposed a three-layer
    search-based access model for the DNS \n[DNSSEARCH]; this paper is only to explain
    some related problems \nmentioned in John C. Klensin's proposal. Especially it
    focuses on \nTraditional and Simplified Chinese problems and some other special
    \nChinese requirements. \n\nThe ultimate goal for any kinds of search-based access
    system is to help \nusers to access network resources in more natural ways, which
    have \ndifferent meaning for different user groups. On the premise of respecting
    Chinese user's language convention, it is very important for a valuable and human-friendly
    system to deal with traditional and simplified Chinese equivalence problems.\n\t "

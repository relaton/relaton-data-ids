  content: "This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 [X.660]\nencoding
    formats for additional elliptic curve field for digital \nsignatures and subject
    public keys used in the Internet X.509 Public \nKey Infrastructure (PKI).  This
    specification supplements [RFC 3280], \n'Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure:
    \ Certificate and \nCertificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile.' and [RFC3279]
    'Algorithms \nand Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
    \nCertificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile. ' \nImplementations
    of this specification MUST also conform to RFC 3280\nand RFC 3279.\nIn RFC 3279
    only prime-field and two-characteristic-field were used as \nfield which defines
    an elliptic curve. This document introduce\nodd-characteristic-extension-field
    as the 3rd field.\n\n\t "

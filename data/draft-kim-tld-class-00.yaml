  content: "     This document specifies a structural organization of Internet top\n
    \    level domain names based on the International Schedule of Classes\n     of
    Goods and Services. This structure intends to provide a\n     framework for classification
    such that web content providers can\n     differentiate their goods and services
    and minimize the probability\n     of name confusion and collision. Under each
    class, as specified by\n     the International Schedule of Classes of Goods and
    Services, single\n     or multiple top level domain names should be specified
    each\n     appropriately partitioning the class of goods or service into an\n
    \    appropriate sub-categorization. A method will further be described\n     to
    incorporate additions/modifications as becomes necessary by as\n     of yet unforseen
    future developments.\n \n     This document does not address the delegation or
    the administration\n     of top level domain names which the author feels should
    be\n     considered separately. However, the author does acknowledge that\n     some
    form of centralized authority should be in place to properly\n     control the
    structure to be described.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a procedure for performing the downgrading
    of\n   old Proposed and Draft standards described in RFC 2026 without\n   placing
    an unreasonable load on groups charged with performing other\n   tasks in the
    IETF.\n\n\n   It defines a new group, called the 'Commission for Protocol\n   Obsolesence',
    which shall recommend to the IESG downgrading or\n   progressing documents on
    the IETF standards track.  Ultimate\n   decisions still rest of with the IESG,
    with appeal to the IAB.\n\t "

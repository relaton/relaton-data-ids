abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an echo service for Bundle Protocol Version
    7 (BPv7) networks. The echo service receives bundles at a well-known endpoint
    and reflects them back to the originator, making only the minimal changes necessary
    to route the response. This enables round- trip time measurement and end-to-end
    connectivity verification in Delay-Tolerant Networks. This document requests IANA
    allocation of a well-known IPN service number and DTN demux for the echo service.</p>"

  content: "   JSON Content Rules (JCR) [JCR] provides a powerful, intuitive and\n
    \  concise method for defining the structure of JSON [RFC7159] messages.\n   However,
    modern JSON usage patterns occasionally mean that JCR alone\n   is not able to
    capture the required constraints in a satisfactory\n   way.  This document describes
    JCR Co-Constraints (JCRCC) which\n   defines additional JCR directives and annotations
    that can be added\n   to a JCR ruleset in order to define more detailed constraints
    on JSON\n   messages.\n\n\t "

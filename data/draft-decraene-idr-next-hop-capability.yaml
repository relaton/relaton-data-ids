  content: "   RFC 5492 defines capabilities advertisement for the BGP peer.  In\n
    \  addition, it is useful to be able to advertise BGP Next-Hop dependant\n   capabilities,
    in particular for forwarding plane features.  RFC 5492\n   is not applicable because
    the BGP peer may be different from the BGP\n   Next-Hop, in particular when BGP
    Route Reflection is used.  This\n   document defines a mechanism to advertise
    such BGP Next Hop dependant\n   Capabilities.\n\n   This document defines a new
    BGP non-transitive attribute to carry\n   Next-Hop Capabilities.  This attribute
    is deleted or possibly\n   modified when the BGP Next Hop is changed.\n\n   This
    document also defines a Next-Hop capability to advertise the\n   ability to handle
    the MPLS Entropy Label defined in RFC 6790.  It\n   updates RFC 6790 with regard
    to this BGP signaling.\n\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "MIPv6 is being defined with a security solution called Return\nRoutability
    (RR) that does not need any authentication infrastructure.\nGiven that the solution
    is 'infrastructureless' in this manner, it\nisn't very easy to control the solution
    once it is widely deployed. In\nparticular, it isn't clear how the solution could
    be changed to a new\nsolution, should that ever become necessary. Peers should
    be able to\nagree about the use the new solution in a secure manner, without Man-\nin-the-Middle
    attackers from being able to mount a Bidding Down attack\nand downgrade the security
    back to the original solution. This draft\nspecifies a simple but secure scheme
    which allows nodes to choose what\nsecurity solution they use. One currently known
    drawback of this\nscheme is that it is based on a technology that has IPR considera­\ntions.\n\n\t "

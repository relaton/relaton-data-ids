    \  to exchange with DHCP clients specific security configuration\n   information.
    \ This new options also defines a standard parameter\n   format and code so that
    there will be no ambiguity in interoperating\n   the information being exchanged
    and that there will be no issues\n   related to interoperability.  It also defines
    some other options that\n   may be used in enterprise networks but not included
    in [RFC2132].\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been used\n
    \  in Internet protocol design. More than sixteen years have passed\n   since
    RFC3552 was written and the structure and topology of the\n   Internet has changed.
    With those changes comes a question: has the\n   Internet Threat Model really
    changed? Or, is the model described in\n   RFC3552 still largely accurate?  This
    draft attempts to describe an\n   non-exhaustive list of changes in the current
    threat environment. It\n   suggests that there are both qualitative and quantitative
    differences\n   from the environment described in RFC3552 and is intended as input
    to\n   the IAB program on the Internet threat model started in 2020.\n\n\t "

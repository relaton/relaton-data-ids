  content: "This document attempts to clarify the notion of the Zero Window\nProbes
    (ZWP) described in RFC 1122 [RFC1122].  In particular, it\nclarifies the actions
    that can be taken on connections which are\nexperiencing the ZWP condition.  The
    motivation for this document\nstems from the belief that TCP implementations strictly
    adhering to\nthe current RFC language have the potential to become vulnerable
    to\nDenial of Service (DoS) scenarios.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft

  content: "   This document defines the Dynamic No-Entry Zone (DNEZ) information\n
    \  element and its dissemination mechanism using IPv6-based vehicular\n   networks.
    \ A DNEZ is a temporary lane-level polygonal area generated\n   by a stopped or
    faulty vehicle to indicate a region that surrounding\n   vehicles may need to
    avoid.  The primary use case is to provide\n   redundancy when roadside perception
    systems fail due to occlusion,\n   weather, or infrastructure limitations.\n\n
    \  The DNEZ is disseminated using geographically-scoped IPv6 multicast\n   (GeoBroadcast)
    as defined in RFC 9366.  Receiving vehicles or Road\n   Side Units (RSUs) may
    rebroadcast the message to extend coverage.\n   Local interpretation and usage
    of the DNEZ is implementation-specific\n   and outside the scope of this document.\n\n\t "

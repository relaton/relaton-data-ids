abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Dynamic No-Entry Zone (DNEZ) information
    element and its dissemination mechanism using IPv6-based vehicular networks. A
    DNEZ is a temporary lane-level polygonal area generated by a stopped or faulty
    vehicle to indicate a region that surrounding vehicles may need to avoid. The
    primary use case is to provide redundancy when roadside perception systems fail
    due to occlusion, weather, or infrastructure limitations. The DNEZ is disseminated
    using geographically-scoped IPv6 multicast (GeoBroadcast) as defined in RFC 9366.
    Receiving vehicles or Road Side Units (RSUs) may rebroadcast the message to extend
    coverage. Local interpretation and usage of the DNEZ is implementation-specific
    and outside the scope of this document.</p>"

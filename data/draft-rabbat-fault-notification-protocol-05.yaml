  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft presents a fault notification protocol for use in a GMPLS-\n
    \  based failure recovery scheme.  The protocol guarantees recovery\n   path(s)
    activation in a bounded time in the event of single resource\n   failures.  These
    failures include fiber cut, transponder failure and\n   node failure.  Bounded
    recovery time is achieved by pre-signaling\n   recovery paths whose nodes can
    be reached within a specific time,\n   based on the physical capabilities of the
    nodes and the delay\n   characteristics of the control plane.  We propose using
    a flooding\n   protocol for fault notification to allow for per-failure notification\n
    \  and to speed up the recovery process.  We justify choices made for\n   the
    notification method and the messaging required for the protocol.\n\n   The draft
    does not mandate a specific implementation of the Fault\n   Notification Protocol.\n\t "

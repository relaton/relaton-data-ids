  content: "   The purpose of this memo is to describe and analyze the occurrence
    of \n   misconnections in GMPLS networks.  We present a problem statement, \n
    \  and describe some scenarios under which misconnections may happen. We \n   then
    outline some common causes of misconnections and discuss some \n   solutions to
    address them. Our goal is to facilitate further \n   discussions of this issue
    and the associated solutions within the \n   CCAMP Working Group. \n\t "

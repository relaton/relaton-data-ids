  content: "The Handover Keying (HOKEY) Working Group seeks to minimize handover delay
    due to authentication when a peer moves from one point of attachment to another.
    Work has progressed on two different approaches to reduce handover delay: early
    authentication (so that authentication does not need to be performed during handover),
    and reuse of cryptographic material generated during an initial authentication
    to save time during re-authentication. A basic assumption is that the mobile host
    or \"peer\" is initially authenticated using the Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP), executed between the peer and an EAP server as defined in RFC 3748.\n\n
    This document defines the HOKEY architecture. Specifically, it describes design
    objectives, the functional environment within which handover keying operates,
    the functions to be performed by the HOKEY architecture itself, and the assignment
    of those functions to architectural components. It goes on to illustrate the operation
    of the architecture within various deployment scenarios that are described more
    fully in other documents produced by the HOKEY Working Group. This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.\n\t "

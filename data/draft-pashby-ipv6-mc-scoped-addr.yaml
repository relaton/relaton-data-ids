  content: "The purpose of this document is to define IPv6 Multicast Id ranges \nthat
    will not allow overlap between dynamically assigned global \nscoped addresses
    and dynamically assigned non-global scoped \naddresses, specifically dynamically
    assigned link-local scoped \naddresses.\n\n[RFC3307] defines IPv6 Multicast Group
    ID ranges for the following \nPermanent Addresses, Permanent Identifiers and Dynamic
    Addresses. \nHowever, there are certain multicast addresses that need to be \nassigned
    for closed systems that should not collide with the Group \nIDs used within the
    Internet. \n\nThis document further defines the Dynamic Addresses into two ranges
    \nDynamically Assigned Global (DAG) addresses and Dynamically \nAssigned Non-Global
    (DANG) addresses. The DANG range is further \nbroken down to Dynamically Assigned
    Link-Local (DALL) addresses and \nthe rest reserved for future. Future uses might
    be for Site-Local \nScoped and Organization Scoped ranges. The DALL range may
    be used \nto simplify the design of MLD Snooping layer 2 switches.\n\n[RFC3171]
    defines the Local Network Control Block address range for \nIPv4. A similar range
    should be defined to possibly simplify the \ndesign of MLD Snooping layer 2 switches.\n\t "

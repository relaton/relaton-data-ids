  content: "   Sheffer et al. published [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] on 9th\n
    \  January, 2025 and despite being wildly out of scope of SEAT charter,\n   the
    draft made its place -- getting two-thirds of meeting time -- in\n   the agenda
    for upcoming SEAT interim meeting within hours of\n   publishing.  In comparison,
    our request to present\n   [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] fully within the charter was
    refused.  In\n   this document, we disprove the claim made in\n   [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation]
    for backward compatibility with\n   standard TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].  We
    argue that\n   [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] is a much more reaonsable way of achieving\n
    \  the goal within the scope of SEAT charter.\n\n\t "

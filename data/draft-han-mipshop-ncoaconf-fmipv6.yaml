  content: "This document proposes a new care-of address (NCoA) configuration and\nconfirmation
    scheme for the Mobile IPv6 fast handover protocol\n(FMIPv6). The goal of this
    proposal makes FMIPv6 address\nconfiguration and confirmation 'very fast' and
    its confirmation\nresult 'always successful'. The proposed scheme can become a\nsupplementary
    function implemented in only nodes which play a role of\nnew access router in
    FMIPv6.\n\t "

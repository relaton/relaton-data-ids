  content: "This document proposes a multicast protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc networks,\ncalled
    the Multicast routing protocol based on Zone Routing (MZR). MZR\nis a source-initiated
    on-demand protocol, in which a multicast delivery\ntree is created using a concept
    based on the zone routing mechanism.\nIt belongs to the family of source-tree-based
    protocols, in which a\ndelivery tree rooted at the source is created for each
    active multicast\nsession.  MZR does not depend on any underlying unicast protocol
    for a\nglobal routing substructure.  The protocol's reaction to topological\nchanges
    is restricted to a node's neighborhood and is not propagated\nthroughout the network.\n\t "

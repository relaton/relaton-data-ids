  content: "   Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate\n
    \  the use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate the\n   services
    for which the encapsulations have been defined.  However,\n   some encapulations
    treat the Control Word as optional.  As a result,\n   implementations of the CW,
    for encapsulations for which it is\n   optional, vary by equipment manufacturer,
    equipment model and service\n   provider network.  Similarly, Virtual Circuit
    Connectivity\n   Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC) types
    and\n   multiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types.  This flexibility has\n
    \  led to reports of interoperability issues within deployed networks\n   and
    associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation.  This\n   survey of the
    PW/VCCV user community was conducted to determine\n   implementation trends.  The
    survey and results is presented herein.\n\n\n\t "

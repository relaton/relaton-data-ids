  content: "   The DHCPv6 protocol, defined in [RFC3315] allows for multiple servers\n
    \  to operate on a single network, however it does not define any way to\n   decide
    which server responds to which client queries.  Some sites are\n   interested
    in running multiple servers in such a way as to provide\n   increased availability
    in case of server failure.  In order for this\n   to work reliably, the cooperating
    primary and secondary servers must\n   maintain a consistent database of the lease
    information.  [RFC3315]\n   allows for but does not define any redundancy or failover
    mechanisms.\n   This document outlines requirements for DHCPv6 failover, enumerates\n
    \  related problems, and discusses the proposed scope of work to be\n   conducted.
    \ This document does not define a DHCPv6 failover protocol.\n\n\t "

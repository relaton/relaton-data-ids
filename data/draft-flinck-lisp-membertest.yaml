  content: "This document defines how a membership test can be used to convey all\nor
    some of the EID-to-RLOC mappings from an Egress Tunnel Router to\nrequesting Ingress
    Tunnel Router.  This draft proposes that an\nauthoritative ETR MAY return a group
    membership test in the LISP Map-\nReply Message that indicates if a given EID
    is served by the ETR.\nThe membership test is implemented as a Bloom filter.  A
    Bloom filter\nis compact data structure to represent a set of elements.  The\nmembership
    test \"aggregates\" EIDs beyond prefix based aggregation.\nMembership test decreases
    the load of the mapping system and\ndistributes the EID-to-RLOC resolution between
    an ITR and an ETR.\n\t "

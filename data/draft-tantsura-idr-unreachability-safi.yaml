abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new BGP Subsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI) called "Unreachability Information" that allows the propagation of prefix
    unreachability information through BGP without affecting the installation or removal
    of routes in the Routing Information Base (RIB) or Forwarding Information Base
    (FIB). This mechanism enables network operators to share information about unreachable
    prefixes for monitoring, debugging, and coordination purposes while maintaining
    complete separation from the active routing plane.</p>

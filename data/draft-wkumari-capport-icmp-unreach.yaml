  content: "   This document defines a new ICMP Type for Captive Portal Messages.\n
    \  The ICMP Type will only be known to clients supporting this\n   specification
    and provides both generic and flow 5-tuple specific\n   notifications from the
    Captive Portal NAS.\n\n   Further, This document defines a multi-part ICMP extension
    to ICMP\n   Destination Unreachable messages to signal, not only that the packet\n
    \  was dropped, but that it was dropped due to an Access Policy\n   requiring
    Captive Portal interaction.  Legacy clients will only be\n   processing the ICMP
    Destination Unreachable.\n\n   [ Editor note: The IETF is currently discussing
    improvements in\n   captive portal interactions and user experience improvements.
    \ See:\n   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/captive-portals ]\n\n   [RFC
    Editor: Please remove this before publication.  This document is\n   being stored

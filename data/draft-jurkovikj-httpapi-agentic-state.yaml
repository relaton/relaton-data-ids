abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP resources are frequently exposed in multiple representations (e.g.,
    text/html for rendering and application/json for processing) via Content Negotiation.
    However, standard HTTP concurrency controls (such as ETags) are typically scoped
    to the byte sequence of a specific representation. This creates a synchronization
    gap where a client modifying one representation cannot guarantee consistency with
    the underlying state of another representation, leading to race conditions and
    "lost updates" in multi-client environments. This document specifies _Agentic
    State Transfer_ (AST), an HTTP profile for managing _Canonical Resource State_
    (CRS) across multiple synchronized representations of the same resource. It defines
    the use of _Semantic Validators_ (Content Identity) to track the logical state
    of a resource independent of its serialization. It further mandates the use of
    Optimistic Concurrency Control via If-Match headers for state-changing operations,
    ensuring that mutations applied by automated agents are atomic and consistent
    across all views.</p>

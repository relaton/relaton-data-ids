  content: "   Multipath TCP (MPTCP), described in [4], is an extension to TCP to\n
    \  provide the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between\n   peers.\n\n
    \  draft-paasch-mptcp-application-authentication specifies \"application\n   layer
    authentication\" for Multipath TCP, an alternatively negotiated\n   keying mechanism
    for MPTCP.  This allows keying material to be\n   sourced from an application
    layer protocol in order to secure MP_JOIN\n   handshakes.\n\n   This document
    explains how to use the proposed application-layer\n   authentication extension
    with TLS [6], in order to leverage securely\n   exchanged keys for MPTCP security,
    whilst simultaneously freeing the\n   MPTCP token to be used as a channel for
    additional information.\n\n\t "

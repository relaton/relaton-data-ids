  content: "Given the large installed base of ring fiber-plants and the extensive
    \nexperience operators have gained in operating SONET (SDH) ring networks, \noptical
    rings are becoming increasingly important.  As such, optical \nrings will play
    a crucial role in the migration from existing TDM-based \nSONET (SDH) architectures
    to more dynamic lightpath provisioning \nparadigms.  To date, various optical
    ring concepts have been tabled, \nproposing multi-services support and mirroring
    the fast protection \nswitching capabilities of existing SONET (SDH) rings.  Nevertheless,
    \nthe emerging IP-based MPL(ambda)S framework for optical networks is \nlargely
    based upon (optical) mesh routing concepts.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Unlike Internet Protocol, version 4 (IPv4), Internet Protocol,\n   version
    6 (IPv6) does not include an Identification field in the\n   basic packet header.
    \ Instead, IPv6 includes a 32-bit Identification\n   field in a Fragment Header
    extension since the architecture assumed\n   that the sole purpose for the Identification
    is to support the\n   fragmentation and reassembly process.  This document asserts
    that\n   per-packet Identifications may be useful for other purposes, e.g., to\n
    \  allow recipients to detect spurious packets that may have been\n   injected
    into the network by an attacker.  But, rather than defining\n   a new extension
    header, this document recommends employing the\n   existing Fragment Header for
    per-packet identification even if the\n   packet itself appears as an \"atomic
    fragment\".\n\n\t "

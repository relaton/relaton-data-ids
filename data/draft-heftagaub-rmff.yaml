  content: "   The RealMedia File Format (RMFF) is designed to be a generic container\n
    \  for streaming media data.  This data may then be played back locally or\n   streamed
    over a network using protocols such as RTSP and RTP.  The\n   format is data-independent,
    allowing any data type to be recorded,\n   manipulated and played back.\n \n   Note:
    This document is intended to be informational in nature of what\n   the file format
    in use by RealNetworks' RealServer and RealPlayer\n   implementations.  Though
    we think that there are a lot of important\n   concepts embodied in this specification,
    and that it may even make the\n   basis of a ''standard'' file format, this is
    intended to eventually end\n   up as an Informational RFC.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Constrained Devices as they are used in the \"Internet of Things\"
    need\n   security.  One important element of this security is that devices in\n
    \  the Internet of Things need to be able to decide which operations\n   requested
    of them should be considered authorized, need to ascertain\n   that the authorization
    to request the operation does apply to the\n   actual requester, and need to ascertain
    that other devices they place\n   requests on are the ones they intended.\n\n
    \  To transfer detailed authorization information from an authorization\n   manager
    (such as an ACE-OAuth Authorization Server) to a device, a\n   representation
    format is needed.  This document provides a suggestion\n   for such a format,
    the Authorization Information Format (AIF).  AIF\n   is defined both as a general
    structure that can be used for many\n   different applications and as a specific
    refinement that describes\n   REST resources and the permissions on them.\n\n\t "

  content: "   STUN has proven to be a popular mechanism for providing basic NAT\n
    \  traversal capabilities for UDP traffic.  As it has matured it has\n   become
    an attractive target for extensions that move away from STUN's\n   discovery function
    towards explicit communication with middleboxes --\n   in other words, as an on-path
    signaling protocol.  This document\n   describes a more generalized framework
    for using STUN for solving on-\n   path signaling problems.\n\t "

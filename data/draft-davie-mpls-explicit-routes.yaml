- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "We define an `explicit route' as a route which is explicitly\n   specified
    as a sequence of hops rather than being determined solely\n   by conventional
    routing algorithms on a hop by hop basis. Using the\n   explicit route object
    proposed for use in RSVP [1] and the ability to\n   bind MPLS labels to RSVP flows
    [2] we describe how explicit routes\n   may be set up in an MPLS environment.
    The resulting label switched\n   paths may have associated resource reservations,
    or may be purely\n   best effort.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor model.  As\n   specified
    here, the model divides the responsibilities for the RFC\n   Series into two high-level
    functions: policy definition governing the\n   Series as a whole, and policy implementation
    through publication of\n   documents in the Series.  The policy definition function
    is the\n   responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces\n
    \  policy proposals that are subject to approval by the RFC Series\n   Approval
    Board (RSAB).  The policy implementation function is\n   primarily the responsibility
    of the RFC Production Center (RPC),\n   under the ultimate authority of the IETF
    Administration Limited\n   Liability Company (LLC).\n\n   This document reflects
    experience gained with version 1 of the RFC\n   Editor Model as specified in RFC
    5620 and with version 2 as specified\n   in RFC 6635 and RFC 8728.\n\n   This
    document obsoletes RFC 8728.\n\n\t "

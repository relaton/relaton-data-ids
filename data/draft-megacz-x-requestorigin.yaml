  content: "Security policies are often implemented by network intermediaries\nsuch
    as routers and proxies.  These intermediaries are unable to\ndistinguish between
    requests from requests initiated by a user and\nrequests initiated by untrusted
    mobile code running on the user's\nmachine.  This document describes the X-RequestOrigin
    hop-by-hop\nHTTP header, which an HTTP client uses to allow intermediate\nproxies
    to make this distinction.\n\t "

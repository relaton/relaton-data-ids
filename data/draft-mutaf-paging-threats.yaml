  content: "This document is an analysis of threats that arise from using \nlink layer
    paging technologies or IP paging in the Internet \nwhere denial-of-service attacks
    are common and easy. These \nproblems fall in the scope of IP paging, since link
    layer paging\ntechnologies do not have provisions for repelling such threats \nand
    the source of an attack may be anywhere in the Internet. In \naddition, vulnerabilities
    that may be added by IP paging are \nalso discussed.\n\t "

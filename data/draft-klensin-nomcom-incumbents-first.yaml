  content: "The traditional IETF Nomcom model treats incumbents and new nominees\n(for
    the same and other positions) as equivalent.  This has not\nproven realistic in
    practice and has had a number of undesirable side\neffects.  This document reviews
    the issues and the specific changes\nto the model that take advantage of the differences
    between\nincumbents and new nominees.\n\t "

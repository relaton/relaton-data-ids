  content: "   This document defines a Client Hint that aims to allow developers to\n
    \  opt-in to the ability to perform content negotiation based on the set\n   of
    natural languages preferred by the user agent.  This new mechanism\n   is intended
    to improve upon the privacy properties of the \"Accept-\n   Language\" header,
    and eventually to supplant it entirely.\n\n\t "

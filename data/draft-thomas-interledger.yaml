  content: "   This document specifies the Interledger Protocol (ILP).  It draws\n
    \  heavily from the definition of the Internet Protocol (IP) defined in\n   [RFC0791].
    \ The interledger protocol is the culmination of more than\n   a decade of research
    in decentralized payment protocols.  This work\n   was started in 2004 by Ryan
    Fugger, augmented by the development of\n   Bitcoin in 2008 and has involved numerous
    contributors since then.\n\nFeedback\n\n   This specification is a part of the
    Interledger Project [1] work.\n   Feedback related to this specification should
    be sent to public-\n   interledger@w3.org [2].\n\n\t "

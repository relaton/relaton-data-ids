  content: "This memo describes EAP-MAKE protocol, an authentication protocol\nbased
    on EAP which emphasizes on simplicity and scalability.\nAuthentication is provided
    through a mechanism derived from the\nDiffie-Hellman scheme, and it is possible
    to derive and check a\ncommon symmetric key for the purpose of privacy.  Scalability
    is\nprovided by the underlying support of legacy PKI systems.\n\n\t "

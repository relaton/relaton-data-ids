  content: "This document is a revision of RFC 1602, which defines the official procedures
    for creating and documenting Internet Standards.  Changes from RFC 1602 are marked
    by change bars ( | ) in the right margin.              This revision (revision
    3.1) includes changes made primarily in response to a preliminary legal review
    of the written procedures of the Internet standards process by Internet Society
    counsel.  The conclusions of the legal review may be summarized briefly as follows:
    \                        'Based on the principles found in the case law and enforcement
    agency pronouncements, a good standard setting program should have at a minimum
    the following characteristics:  (1) openness in participation; (2) careful and
    thorough record keeping throughout the various stages of setting the standard;
    (3) timely and adequate notice of both the initiation and development of a standard;
    (4) careful consideration of, and response to, all the views and objections of
    interested persons; and (5) a meaningful appeals process.'\n\t "

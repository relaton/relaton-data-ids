  content: "   BIER-TE is an application-state free, (loose) source routed multicast\n
    \  forwarding method where every hop and destination is identified via\n   bits
    in a bitstring of the data packets.  It is described in\n   [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].
    \ BIER-TE is a variant of [RFC8279] in\n   support of such explicit path engineering.\n\n
    \  This document described the traffic engineering control framework for\n   use
    with the BIER-TE forwarding plane: How to enable the ability to\n   calculate
    paths and integrate this forwarding plane into an overall\n   TE solution.\n\n\t "

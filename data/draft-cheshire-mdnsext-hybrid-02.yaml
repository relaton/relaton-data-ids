  content: "   Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely Multicast DNS\n
    \  allows discovery only of services present on the local link.  Using a\n   very
    large local link with thousands of hosts improves service\n   discovery, but at
    the cost of large amounts of multicast traffic.\n\n   Performing DNS-Based Service
    Discovery using purely Unicast DNS is\n   more efficient, but requires configuration
    of DNS Update keys on the\n   devices offering the services, which can be onerous
    for simple\n   devices like printers and network cameras.\n\n   Hence a compromise
    is needed, that provides easy service discovery\n   without requiring either large
    amounts of multicast traffic or\n   onerous configuration.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a secure method to configure a key for a\n   resource
    constrained node when it initially joins to network that is\n   currently in operation.
    The method is suited for a scenario, where\n   resource constrained nodes are
    interconnected with each other and\n   thus form a network called Internet of
    Things. It is assumed that\n   communications for all nodes are based on TCP/IP
    protocols and the\n   nodes use the constrained application protocol (CoAP). The
    presented\n   method does not cover all operations of secure bootstrapping for
    IoT\n   networks, but it is intended to securely support self-reconfiguration\n
    \  of the pre-installed temporary key of joined node.\n\n\n\n\t "

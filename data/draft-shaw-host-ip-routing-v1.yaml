  content: "This document specifies an additional ip routing technique.\n\nA host
    will use a route table to determine how to best transmit a\nnetwork datagram packet
    to the destination host.  The destination\naddress is compared to a locally maintained
    routing table to determine\nthe specific gateway.  The best route and/or lowest
    metric is used to\ndetermine the gateway to use to reach the destination host.
    \ A default\ngateway is used if no matches are found in the routing table.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes how service function chains (SFC) can be\n
    \  applied to traffic flows using routing in a virtual (overlay)\n   network to
    steer traffic between service nodes. Chains can include\n   services running in
    routers, on physical appliances or in virtual\n   machines. Service chains have
    applicability at the subscriber edge,\n   business edge and in multi-tenant datacenters.
    The routing function\n   into SFCs and between service functions within an SFC
    can be\n   performed by physical devices (routers), be virtualized inside\n   hypervisors,
    or run as part of a host OS.\n\n   The architecture uses a controller to calculate
    and install routes\n   to implement an SFC, based on a topological model of the
    chain and\n   knowledge of the network addresses that should pass through the\n
    \  chain. An advantage of the approach is that SFCs can be implemented\n   without
    alteration to today's BGP standard, and without change to\n   the current operation
    of routers.\n\n   Service chains need to support load balancing between network\n
    \  functions, and symmetric forward and reverse paths are required when\n   stateful
    services are involved. This document shows how these\n   requirements can be met
    by using VRFs at the ingress and egress of\n   each service instance and by performing
    load balancing after the\n   egress of each service as part of the routing function.\n\n\t "

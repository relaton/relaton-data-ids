  content: "   This document describes extensions to the format of electronic mail\n
    \  messages and a public-key infrastructure to permit verification of\n   the
    source of messages by either mail transport agents (MTAs) or mail\n   user agents
    (MUAs).  This may be used to implement a policy which,\n   for example, favors
    the delivery of identified messages over messages\n   lacking signatures or having
    incorrect signatures.  Mechanisms by\n   which signing of messages and verification
    of signatures can be\n   performed by trusted MTAs, in order to minimize impact
    on end users,\n   are also presented.\n\t "

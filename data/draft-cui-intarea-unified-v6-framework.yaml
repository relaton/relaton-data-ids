- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a unified IPv6 transition framework.  This\n
    \  framework makes use of the flow-based packet forwarding technology,\n   which
    can simplify the implementation of both control plane and data\n   plane operations
    of transition mechanisms.  The purpose of this work\n   is to provide an integrated
    and flexible framework to implement and\n   deploy the most popular translation
    and tunneling mechanisms, such as\n   NAT64, DS-Lite, Lightweight 4over6 and MAP-E.
    This framework can\n   benefit the industry by reducing the cost of implementation,\n
    \  providing flexibility for deployment, and enabling transition\n   mechanisms
    to coexist and cooperate in the common infrastructure.\n\n\n\t "

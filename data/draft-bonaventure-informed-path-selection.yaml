  content: "With today's peer-to-peer applications, more and more content is\navailable
    from multiple sources.  In tomorrow's Internet hosts will\nhave multiple paths
    to reach one destination host with the deployment\nof dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 hosts,
    but also with new techniques such as\nshim6 or other locator/identifier mechanisms
    being discussed within\nthe IRTF RRG.  All these hosts will need to rank paths
    in order to\nselect the best paths to reach a given destination/content.  In this\ndraft,
    we propose an informed path selection service that would be\nqueried by hosts
    and would rank paths based on policies and\nperformance metrics defined by the
    network operator to meet his\ntraffic engineering objectives.  A companion document
    describes a\nprotocol that implements this service.\n\t "

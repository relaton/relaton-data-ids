  content: "   This document specifies Anonymous Credit Tokens (ACT), a privacy-\n
    \  preserving authentication protocol that enables numerical credit\n   systems
    without tracking individual clients.  Based on keyed-\n   verification anonymous
    credentials and privately verifiable BBS-style\n   signatures, the protocol allows
    issuers to grant tokens containing\n   credits that clients can later spend anonymously
    with that issuer.\n\n   The protocol's key features include: (1) unlinkable transactions
    -\n   the issuer cannot correlate credit issuance with spending, or link\n   multiple
    spends by the same client, (2) partial spending - clients\n   can spend a portion
    of their credits and receive anonymous change,\n   and (3) double-spend prevention
    through cryptographic nullifiers that\n   preserve privacy while ensuring each
    token is used only once.\n\n   Anonymous Credit Tokens are designed for modern
    web services\n   requiring rate limiting, usage-based billing, or resource allocation\n
    \  while respecting user privacy.  Example applications include rate\n   limiting
    and API credits.\n\n   This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research
    Group (CFRG)\n   in the IRTF.\n\n\t "

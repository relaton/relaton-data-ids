  content: "This memo documents what needs to be removed and added to OSPF [RFC2328]\nto
    create a working implementation of the experimental protocol ospf-\nlite. ospf-lite
    runs over TCP and UDP ports 8899.\n\nospf-lite has been designed to provide a
    simpler version of the OSPF\nprotocol. A router running ospf-lite requires little
    configuration.\n\nMany of the Protocol complexities have been removed. Areas are
    not\nimplemented and Designated Router functionality has been removed from\nthe
    protocol. In almost every case with these removals the protocol is\nmade more
    scalable.\n\nospf-lite will run over non fully meshed NBMA clouds without explicit\nconfiguration.\n\nospf-lite
    contains support for External LSA's and opaque LSA's. The\nprotocol removes the
    support of LSA's type 2,3,4,7 and the DR function.\nPromiscuous hellos are introduced
    and a unified interface link type\nreplaces existing link types.\n\nThis work
    is intended to keep pace with the vast increases in processor\nperformance, memory
    size and link capacity since OSPF was originally\nconceived.\n\nWhere further
    details are required the authors refer the reader to [RFC\n2328].\n\nPlease send
    comments to mrthom@essex.ac.uk\n\t "

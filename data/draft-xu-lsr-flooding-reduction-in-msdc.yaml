  content: "   OSPF is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for MSDC\n   (Massively
    Scalable Data Center) networks.  For a given OSPF router\n   within the CLOS topology,
    it would receive multiple copies of exactly\n   the same LSA from multiple OSPF
    neighbors.  In addition, two OSPF\n   neighbors may send each other the same LSA
    simultaneously.  The\n   unneccessary link-state information flooding wastes the
    precious\n   process resource of OSPF routers greatly due to the fact that there\n
    \  are too many OSPF neighbors for each OSPF router within the CLOS\n   topology.
    \ This document proposes some extensions to OSPF so as to\n   reduce the OSPF
    flooding within MSDC networks greatly.  The reduction\n   of the OSPF flooding
    is much beneficial to improve the scalability of\n   MSDC networks.  These modifications
    are applicable to both OSPFv2 and\n   OSPFv3.\n\n\n\t "

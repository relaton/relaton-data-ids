  content: "Secure overlay services (SOS) architecture has been proposed to \nprovide
    reliable communication between clients and a target under\nDDoS attacks. The SOS
    architecture employs a set of overlay nodes\narranged in three hierarchical layers
    that controls access to the\ntarget. Although the architecture is novel and works
    well under \nsimple congestion based attacks, we observe that it is flimsy after\nit
    resisted the DDoS for a period of time and it didn't pay \nattention to the endurance
    of the Nodes. We propose an Algorithm to\nimprove the secure overlay services
    (SOS) both on load balance \nand resilient. \n\t "

  content: "   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM, RFC6376) permits claiming some\n
    \  responsibility for a message by cryptographically associating a\n   domain
    name with the message.  For data covered by the cryptographic\n   signature, this
    also enables detecting changes made during transit.\n   DKIM survives basic email
    relaying.  In a Replay Attack, a recipient\n   of a DKIM-signed message re-posts
    the message to other\n   recipients,while retaining the original, validating signature,
    and\n   thereby leveraging the reputation of the original signer.  This\n   document
    discusses the resulting damage to email delivery,\n   interoperability, and associated
    mail flows.  A significant challenge\n   to mitigating this problem is that it
    is difficult for receivers to\n   differentiate between legitimate forwarding
    flows and a DKIM Replay\n   Attack.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   In situations where direct connectivity is not available or desired,\n
    \  proxies in the network are used to forward and potentially translate\n   traffic.
    \ TCP is often used as a proxying or tunneling protocol.\n   QUIC is a new, emerging
    transport protocol and there is a similar\n   expectation that it too will be
    used as a substrate once it is widely\n   deployed.  Using QUIC instead of TCP
    in existing scenarios will allow\n   proxying and tunneling services to maintain
    the benefits of QUIC\n   natively, without degrading the performance and security\n
    \  characteristics.  QUIC also opens up new opportunities for these\n   services
    to have lower latency and better multistreaming support.\n   This document summarizes
    current and future usage scenarios to derive\n   requirements for QUIC as a substrate
    and to provide additional\n   considerations for proxy signaling and control protocol
    as proposed\n   by MASQUE.\n\n\t "

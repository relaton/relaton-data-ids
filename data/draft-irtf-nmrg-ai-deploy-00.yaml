  content: "   As the development of AI technology matured and AI technology began\n
    \  to be applied in various fields, AI technology is changed from\n   running
    only on very high-performance servers with small hardware,\n   including microcontrollers,
    low-performance CPUs and AI chipsets.  In\n   this document, we consider how to
    configure the network and the\n   system in terms of AI inference service to provide
    AI service in a\n   distributed method.  Also, we describe the points to be considered
    in\n   the environment where a client connects to a cloud server and an edge\n
    \  device and requests an AI service.  Some use cases of deploying\n   network-based
    AI services, such as self-driving vehicles and network\n   digital twins, are
    described.\n\n\t "

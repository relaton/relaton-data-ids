  content: "   Broadband Service Provider Industry has been gearing towards the\n
    \  adoption of Virtual CPE (vCPE) solutions.  The concept of vCPE is\n   build
    around the idea that the physical CPE device at the customer\n   premises can
    be simplified by moving some of the key feature\n   functionalities from the physical
    CPE device to the Service Provider\n   Network.  This document starts discussing
    the drivers behind vCPE\n   adoption followed by Solution level requirements.
    \ Two key\n   Architecture models for vCPE, which can address the service provider\n
    \  and subscriber requirements, are covered in this reference document.\n   Document
    also touches up on some of the key deployment\n   considerations, which can influence
    the adoption of the vCPE\n   architecture models.\n\n\t "

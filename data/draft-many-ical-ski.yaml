    \ adding structured information about people, places,\nthings, activities  and
    the conditions and terms for interaction with\nresources.SkiCal provides a structure
    for information about dates\nand times, directions, rules and recommendations
    for participation,\npricing and reservation schemes, access information for those
    with\nspecial needs, ownership and responsibilities and promotional\nmaterial.
    \ The referents of these listings, which are both events and\npersistent resources
    are referred to in this draft as SkiSources.\nSkiCal is based on and extends the

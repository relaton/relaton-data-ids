abstract:
- content: "<p>SOUTH defines an authorization protocol for evaluating requests issued
    by users, services, or autonomous agents. SOUTH allows a server to return a deterministic
    decision or an allow decision that is issued with a probability determined by
    local policy. This enables servers to incorporate uncertainty, contextual information,
    and load conditions into authorization decisions. SOUTH is transport independent
    and can be composed with existing authentication mechanisms such as OAuth, OpenID
    Connect, mutual TLS, or DPoP. This document describes the request and response
    objects, decision semantics, and an HTTP binding for interoperable deployment.</p>"

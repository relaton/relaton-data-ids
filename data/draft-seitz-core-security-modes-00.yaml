  content: "   The CoAP draft defines how to use DTLS as security mechanism.  In\n
    \  order to establish which nodes are trusted to initiate a DTLS session\n   with
    a device, the following security modes are defined: NoSec,\n   PreSharedKey, RawPublicKey,
    and Certificate.  These modes require\n   either to provision a list of keys of
    trusted clients, or to handle\n   heavyweight certificates.  This memo proposes
    two intermediate\n   security modes involving a trusted third party that are very
    similar\n   to PreSharedKey and RawPublicKey respectively, but which do not\n
    \  require out-of-band provisioning of client keys to the device.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Multi-agent Collaboration Protocol Suite
    based on Agent Gateway, which enables scalable, secure, and semantically driven
    collaboration among distributed agents across heterogeneous networks. The protocol
    suite introduces Agent Gateways as control-plane entities responsible for agent
    registration, authentication, capability management, semantic routing and other
    functions, while preserving direct peer-to-peer semantic interactions among agents.</p>"

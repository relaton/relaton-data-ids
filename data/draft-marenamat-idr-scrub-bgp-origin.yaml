  content: "   The BGP Origin attribute in its original meaning has been out of use\n
    \  for years.  Yet, the BGP Origin attribute has high priority in the\n   best
    route selection algorithm, right after the AS Path length, and\n   it's being
    used inconsistently over the Internet to manipulate the\n   route preference.\n\n
    \  This document updates RFC 4271 and RFC 7606 by making the BGP Origin\n   attribute
    half-optional and explicitly allowing its scrubbing to zero\n   (IGP).\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Origin attribute in its original meaning has been out of use
    for years. Yet, the BGP Origin attribute has high priority in the best route selection
    algorithm, right after the AS Path length, and it's being used inconsistently
    over the Internet to manipulate the route preference. This document updates RFC
    4271 and RFC 7606 by making the BGP Origin attribute half-optional and explicitly
    allowing its scrubbing to zero (IGP).</p>"

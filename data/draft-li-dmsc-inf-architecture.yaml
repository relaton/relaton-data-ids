abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an architectural framework for dynamic multi-
    agent collaboration from an infrastructure perspective. It outlines the network
    requirements introduced by large-scale agent collaboration, and proposes a systematic
    approach to enabling Dynamic Multi-agent Secured Collaboration (DMSC) through
    infrastructure capabilities. The architecture focuses on how network control and
    forwarding functions can actively participate in agent collaboration.</p>"

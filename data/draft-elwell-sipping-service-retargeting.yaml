  content: "   This contains motivation, requirements and a proposed solution for
    \n   indicating service retargeting information in SIP requests and \n   responses.
    Retargeting of a request can be considered to be service \n   retargeting when
    it goes beyond \"normal\" routing and might be of \n   interest to applications
    at the UAS or UAC. \n\t "

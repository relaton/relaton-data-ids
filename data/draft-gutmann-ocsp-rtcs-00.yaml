  content: "When the OCSP protocol was defined, the design was based on full compatibility
    with CRL-based mechanisms.  This requires the use of a complex means of certificate
    identification that has resulted in interoperability problems among implementations,
    a design unsuited for high-throughput, real-time operation, the inability to provide
    an unambiguous certificate status response (the only thing that a CRL can say
    with certainty is 'revoked'), and an online responder tied to an offline mechanism
    (some CAs issue CRLs only once or twice a day, even though they have an online,
    real- time certificate store\navailable).  A more practical problem is that it
    makes it impossible to\nimplement an OCSP responder not based on CRLs, for example
    one that consults a certificate database or in-memory hash table to determine
    the presence or absence of a valid certificate.\n\t "

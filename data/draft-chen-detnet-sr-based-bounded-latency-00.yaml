  content: "   One of the goals of DetNet is to provide bounded end-to-end latency\n
    \  for critical flows.  This document defines how to leverage Segment\n   Routing
    (SR) to implement bounded latency.  Specifically, the SR\n   Identifier (SID)
    is used to specify transmission time (cycles) of a\n   packet.  When forwarding
    devices along the path follow the\n   instructions carried in the packet, the
    bounded latency is achieved.\n   This is called Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding
    (CSQF) in this\n   document.\n\n   Since SR is a source routing technology, no
    per-flow state is\n   maintained at intermediate and egress nodes, SR-based CSQF
    naturally\n   supports flow aggregation that is deemed to be a key capability
    to\n   allow DetNet to scale to large networks.\n\n\n\t "

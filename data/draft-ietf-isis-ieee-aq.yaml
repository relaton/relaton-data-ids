  content: "802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) has been standardized by the IEEE
    as the next step in the evolution of the various spanning tree and registration
    protocols.  802.1aq allows for true shortest path forwarding in a mesh Ethernet
    network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths.  This permits it to support
    much larger Layer 2 topologies, with faster convergence, and vastly improved use
    of the mesh topology.  Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical
    connectivity membership, which includes point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and
    multipoint-to-multipoint variations.  This memo documents the IS-IS changes required
    to support this IEEE protocol and provides some context and examples. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

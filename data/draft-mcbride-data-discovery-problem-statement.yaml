  content: "   If data is the new oil of the 21st century, then we need a\n   standardized
    way of locating, capturing, classifying and transforming\n   this raw data to
    generate insights and recommendations.  Data, like\n   oil, needs to be discovered
    and captured in order to be refined and\n   valuable.  While the topic of data
    discovery can be far reaching,\n   this document focuses on the problem of actually
    locating data,\n   throughout a network of data servers, in a standardized way.\n\n\t "

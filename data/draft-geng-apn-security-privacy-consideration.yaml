    \  Information (APN attribute) including APN ID and APN parameters\n   indicating
    application group-level and user group-level requirements\n   along with the data
    packets into the network and enable the network\n   to provide corresponding fine-granular

    issues that\n   could potentially be introduced by conveying the APN attribute
    into\n   the network.  This document describes the security and privacy\n   considerations
    of APN in various possible scenarios wherein APN will\n   be deployed.\n\n\n\t "

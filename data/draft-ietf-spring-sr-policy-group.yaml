abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR Policy is associated
    with one or more candidate paths, and each candidate path is either dynamic, explicit,
    or composite. This document describes SR Policy Group in MPLS and IPv6 environments
    and illustrates some use cases for parent SR Policy and SR Policy Group to provide
    best practice cases for operators.</p>"

  content: "   The topology refresh protocol is intended for use in mobile social\n
    \  networks where user nodes announce their presence when they move into\n   contact
    with the network, see all existing users, know when old users\n   have left the
    network and new ones join the network, and communicate\n   with each other over
    optimal paths established on the fly.  TRP is a\n   very lightweight protocol
    but does require user nodes periodically\n   broadcast their ids along with some
    personal information to the\n   network.  These broadcasts serve the dual purpose
    of announcing\n   users' presence in the social network and establishing a complete\n
    \  topology of end-to-end optimal paths.  Individual user controls her\n   \"radius
    of users\" based on the number of hops and physical distance\n   between her and
    the others.  User nodes independently choose their\n   ids and dynamically resolve
    any duplicated ones.\n\n\t "

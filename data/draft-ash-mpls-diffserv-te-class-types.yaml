  content: "Service Provider requirements for support of DiffServ aware MPLS Traffic\nEngineering
    (MPLS-DS-TE) are presented in [MPLS-DS-TE-REQ].  This initiative includes the
    definition of MPLS-DiffServ-TE class types (CTs), wherein CTs are defined as aggregations
    of individual service classes.  Instead of having per-class parameters being configured
    and propagated on each LSR interface, classes are aggregated into CTs having common
    per-CT parameters (e.g., minimum bandwidth) to satisfy required performance levels,
    however, no bandwidth requirements are enforced for classes within a CT. The main
    motivation for grouping a set of classes into a CT is to improve the scalability
    of IGP LSAs by propagating information on a per-CT basis instead of on a per-class
    basis, and also to allow better bandwidth sharing between classes in the same
    CT.  In order to further improve scalability through the introduction of CTs,
    we propose to a) limit the number of CTs to 6, and b) to generalize the notion
    of CTs and consider them to be a combination of i) DiffServ/queuing priority per-hop-behaviors
    (PHBs), ii) QoS classes (e.g., as specified in [Y.1541]), iii) admission-control
    priority classes, and iv) restoration priority classes at both the MPLS-LSP and
    transport link level. \n\n\t "

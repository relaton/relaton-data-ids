  content: "VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP.  When MPLS \nlabels
    are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels.  For an \nMPLS VPN, the
    packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice \npayload is often no more
    than 30 bytes, for example.  VoIP header \ncompression can significantly reduce
    the VoIP overhead through various \ncompression mechanisms, such as enhanced compressed
    RTP (ECRTP). We \nconsider using MPLS to route ECRTP compressed packets over an
    MPLS LSP \nwithout compression/decompression cycles at each router.  Such an ECRTP
    \nover MPLS capability can increase the bandwidth efficiency as well as \nprocessing
    scalability of the maximum number of simultaneous VoIP flows \nthat use header
    compression at each router.\n\n\t "

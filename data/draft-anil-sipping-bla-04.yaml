  content: "   This document describes the implementation of a group telephony\n   feature
    commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA), Multiple\n   Line Appearance
    (MLA), or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA).  When\n   implemented using the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is\n   referred to as Multiple Appearances.  This
    feature is commonly\n   offered in the IP Centrex services and IP-PBX offerings
    and is likely\n   to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers
    used\n   in a business environment.  This specification defines a new SIP\n   dialog
    event package tag \"appearance\" and a method for a group of SIP\n   user agents
    to coordinate the identification of appearances between\n   them using SIP dialog
    package subscriptions.\n\n\t "

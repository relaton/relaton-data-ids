  content: "Voice & Video over Internet have strict QoS requirements. Generally, low\njitter,
    low delay and high bandwidth are the critical requirements for \nthis class of
    applications. However, achieving this goal is difficult, \nmore so in a wireless/internet
    environment, where the both networking & \ncommunication channel conditions are
    dynamically changing over time. In \nthis document, we propose a novel transport
    layer protocol that attempts \nto provide better QoS for multimedia applications.
    The purpose of the \nproposed technology is to act additively to existing QoS
    solutions at the lower protocol layers through enhancements to the SCTP protocol.\n\n\t "

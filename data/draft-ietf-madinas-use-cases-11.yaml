  content: "   To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a\n
    \  device, its traffic, its location, and its user, client and client\n   Operation
    System vendors have started implementing MAC address\n   randomization.  When
    such randomization happens, some in-network\n   states may break, which may affect
    network connectivity and user\n   experience.  At the same time, devices may continue
    using other\n   stable identifiers, defeating the MAC address randomization purposes.\n\n
    \  This document lists various network environments and a set of network\n   services
    that may be affected by such randomization.  This document\n   then examines settings
    where the user experience may be affected by\n   in-network state disruption.
    \ Last, this document examines solutions\n   to maintain user privacy while preserving
    user quality of experience\n   and network operation efficiency.\n\n\t "

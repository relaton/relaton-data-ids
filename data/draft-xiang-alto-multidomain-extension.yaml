  content: "   The emerging multi-domain applications, such as flexible interdomain\n
    \  routing, distributed, federated machine learning and multi-domain\n   collaborative
    dataset transfer, can benefit substantially from\n   getting information from
    networks.  The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285]\n   provides a northbound interface
    for applications to retrieve the\n   network information.  In particular, it specifies
    the communication\n   between an ALTO client and an ALTO server, where the ALTO
    is\n   implicitly assumed to be able to answer any query from the ALTO\n   client.
    \ However, it does not specify the cases when the network\n   information are
    originated from multiple domains (i.e.,\n   administrative entities or geographically
    partitions).  This document\n   summarizes the discussion on the ALTO weekly meeting
    since IETF 108\n   on how to extend ALTO to support multi-domain applications.
    \ It\n   identifies the key challenges for retrieving network information from\n
    \  multiple networks, reviews the existing efforts in the work group,\n   and
    discusses the next steps to fully address the challenges.\n\n\t "

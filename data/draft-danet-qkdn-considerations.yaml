  content: "   Quantum communication modules connected via a link, either via fiber\n
    \  or free-space communications, have been used since a while to\n   distribute
    random numbers as secure keys, but there are other use\n   cases, such as time
    synchronization.\n\n   By today, a number of research and industrial efforts are
    underway to\n   built complete networks, primary for secure key distribution,
    i.e.,\n   so-called Quantum Key Distribution Networks (QKDN).\n\n   This memo
    briefly explores the space of QKDNs and identifies spots of\n   potentials interest
    to develop standardized protocols specific for\n   such networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines low level monitoring and status MIBs for IPsec\nsecurity
    associations (SAs). It does not define MIBs that may be used\nfor configuring
    IPsec implementations or for providing low-level\ndiagnostic or debugging information.
    It assumes no specific use of\nIPsec. Further, it does not provide policy information.\nThe
    purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators to\ndetermine operating
    conditions and perform system operational level\nmonitoring of the IPsec portion
    of their network. Statistics are\nprovided as well. Additionally, it may be used
    as the basis for\napplication specific MIBs for specific uses of IPsec SAs.\n\t "

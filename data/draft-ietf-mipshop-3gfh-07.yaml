  content: "Mobile IPv6 is designed to maintain its connectivity while moving from
    one network to another.  It is adopted in 3G CDMA networks as a way to maintain
    connectivity when the mobile node (MN) moves between access routers.  However,
    this handover procedure requires not only movement detection by the MN, but also
    the acquisition of a new Care-of Address and Mobile IPv6 registration with the
    new care-of address before the traffic can be sent or received in the target network.
    \ During this period, packets destined for the mobile node may be lost, which
    may not be acceptable for a real-time application such as Voice over IP (VoIP)
    or video telephony.  This document specifies fast handover methods in the 3G CDMA
    networks in order to reduce latency and packet loss during handover.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

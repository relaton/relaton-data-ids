  content: "   Retransmission timeouts are detrimental to application latency,\n   especially
    for short transfers such as Web transactions where\n   timeouts can often take
    longer than all of the rest of a transaction.\n   The primary cause of retransmission
    timeouts are lost segments at the\n   tail of transactions.  This document describes
    an experimental\n   algorithm for TCP to quickly recover lost segments at the
    end of\n   transactions or when an entire window of data or acknowledgments are\n
    \  lost.  Tail Loss Probe (TLP) is a sender-only algorithm that allows\n   the
    transport to recover tail losses through fast recovery as opposed\n   to lengthy
    retransmission timeouts.  If a connection is not receiving\n   any acknowledgments
    for a certain period of time, TLP transmits the\n   last unacknowledged segment
    (loss probe).  In the event of a tail\n   loss in the original transmissions,
    the acknowledgment from the loss\n   probe triggers SACK/FACK based fast recovery.
    \ TLP effectively avoids\n   long timeouts and thereby improves TCP performance.\n\n\t "

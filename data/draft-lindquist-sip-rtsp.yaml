  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for establishing\nmultimedia
    sessions, whereas the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)\nis used in streaming
    media systems.  RTSP has a dual role: it\nestablishes a media session for the
    delivery of streaming media as\nwell as controls the streaming session once it
    has been set up.\nSince SIP is also used for session establishment, there exists
    an\noverlap between the functionality provided by SIP and RTSP.  In this\ndocument,
    we describe a model adopted by ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP, and Open\nIPTV Forum (OIPF)
    in which SIP and the SDP offer/answer model are\nused to set up a streaming session
    with an RTSP control channel and\none or more media delivery streams.  Such a
    model is beneficial since\nit allows the reuse of current architecture and functionality
    (e.g.,\nauthentication, charging, and QoS) established around SIP for RTSP-\nbased
    streaming.  The model benefits applications such as Internet\nProtocol Television
    (IPTV).  In addition to the model, the document\nspecifies two new variants of
    RTSP.\n\t "

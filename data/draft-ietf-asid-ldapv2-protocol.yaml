  content: "The protocol described in this document is designed to provide access
    to the X.500 Directory while not incurring the resource requirements of the Directory
    Access Protocol (DAP). This protocol is specifically targeted at simple management
    applications and browser applications that provide simple read/write interactive
    access to the X.500 Directory, and is intended to be a complement to the DAP itself.
    \                            Key aspects of LDAP are   -    Protocol elements
    are carried directly over TCP or other transport, bypassing much of the session/presentation
    overhead.    -    Many protocol data elements are encoding as ordinary strings
    (e.g.,      Distinguished Names).  -    A lightweight BER encoding is used to
    encode all protocol elements.\n\t "

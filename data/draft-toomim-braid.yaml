  content: "  Braid is a proposal for a new version of HTTP that transforms it from\n
    \ a state *transfer* protocol into a state *synchronization* protocol.\n  Braid
    puts the power of Operational Transform and CRDTs onto the web,\n  improving network
    performance and robustness, and enabling\n  peer-to-peer web applications.\n\n
    \ At the same time, Braid creates an open standard for the dynamic\n  internal
    state of websites.  Programmers can access state uniformly,\n  whether local or
    on another website.  This creates a separation of UI\n  from State, and allows
    any user to edit or choose their own UI for any\n  website's state.\n\n  We have
    a working prototype of the Braid, and have deployed it with\n  production websites.
    \ This memo describes the protocol, how it\n  differs from prior versions of HTTP,
    and a plan to deploy it in a\n  backwards-compatible way, where web developers
    can opt into the new\n  synchronization features without breaking the rest of
    the web.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a solution that is able to handle SIP\nsignaling
    together with NAT enabled firewalls. The intent is to show\nthat existing firewalls
    do not have to be replaced by 'SIP enabled'\nones, instead they will only have
    to be reconfigured slightly.\nThe main feature of this solution is using MGCP
    from a session\ncontrol proxy to open/close holes in an RTP proxy which then enables\nRTP
    traffic to flow between interconnected networks.\nWorth noting is that this solution
    will not only work for SIP, it\nwill also work for other protocols, such as H.323
    or Real Audio. It\ndoes not even have to be RTP that is passed through the RTP
    proxy,\nthough this draft assumes that the RTP stream is accompanied by\nRTCP.
    \ The solution will work for any protocol that wishes to\nopen/close ports dynamically
    in the RTP proxy (maybe it should be\ncalled Forwarding Engine in the general
    case).\n\t "

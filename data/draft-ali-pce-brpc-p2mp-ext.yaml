  content: "The ability to compute constrained Traffic Engineering Label \n\nSwitched
    Paths (TE LSPs) for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs \n\nin Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS \n\n(GMPLS) networks across multiple domains
    (where a domain is \n\na collection of network elements within a common sphere
    of \n\naddress management or path computational responsibility such \n\nas an
    IGP area or an Autonomous Systems) has been identified \n\nas a key requirement
    [PCEP-P2MP-REQ]. This document addresses \n\nthis requirement by extending backward
    recursive path \n\ncomputation (BRPC) technique proposed for Point-to-Point \n\n(P2P)
    LSPs in [P2P-BRPC] for P2MP LSP path computation in a \n\nmultiple domains network.

  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects\n
    \  to Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in\n   different
    domains, the current trend is to develop a common, \"thin\n   waist\" of protocols
    forming a unified, defragmented IoT platform.\n   Such a platform will make objects
    accessible to applications across\n   organizations and domains.  Towards this
    goal, quite a few proposals\n   have been made to build a unified IoT platform
    as an overlay on top\n   of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions, however,
    are inadequate\n   to address the important challenges posed by a heterogeneous,
    global\n   scale deployment of IoT, especially in terms of mobility,\n   scalability,
    and communication reliability, due to the inherent\n   inefficiencies of the current
    Internet.  To address this problem, we\n   propose to build a common set of protocols
    and services, which form\n   an IoT platform, based on the Information Centric
    Network (ICN)\n   architecture, which we call ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages the
    salient\n   features of ICN, and thus provides seamless mobility support,\n   scalability,
    and efficient content and service delivery.\n\n   This draft sets the IoT requirements
    and ICN challenges to realize a\n   unified ICN-IoT framework.  Towards this,
    we first identify a list of\n   important requirements which a unified IoT architecture
    should have\n   to support tens of billions of objects.  Then we analyze the current\n
    \  state of art deployment model and discuss important and popular IoT\n   scenarios
    including the \"smart\" home, campus, grid, transportation\n   infrastructure,
    healthcare, Education, and Entertainment.  Though we\n   see most of these requirements
    are met by ICN, we discuss specific\n   challenges ICN has to address to satisfy
    them considering\n   heterogeneity in IoT environments and scenarios.\n\n\t "

  content: "[MLDP] describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) \nfor
    setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint \n(MP2MP) Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs). LDP forwarding equivalence class \n(FEC) elements used
    to establish P2MP and MP2MP LSPs include type-\nlength-value (TLV) fields that
    carry information meaningful to \nIngress LSRs and Leaf LSRs and are termed as
    Opaque Value Elements in \n[MLDP]. This document defines Opaque Value Element
    structure to be \nused for provisioning P2MP and MP2MP Provider tunnels (P-Tunnels)
    for \nMulticast Virtual Private Network (MVPN). It is envisioned that this \nwould
    be useful for security and manageability of P-Tunnels used for \nMVPN from the
    ones provisioned for other applications and vice-versa.\n\t "

  content: "   This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers used when the\n
    \  signing operation is performed cooperatively between two parties.\n   When
    performing two-party signing, the first party typically hashes\n   the data to
    be signed and the second party signs the hashed data\n   computed by the first
    party.  This can be useful when communication\n   with the party holding the signing
    private key occurs over a limited-\n   bandwidth channel, such as NFC or Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), in\n   which it is infeasible to send the complete set of data
    to be signed.\n   The resulting signatures are identical in structure to those
    computed\n   by a single party, and can be verified using the same verification\n
    \  procedure without additional steps to preprocess the signed data.\n\n\t "

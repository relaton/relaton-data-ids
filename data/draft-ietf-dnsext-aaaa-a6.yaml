  content: "At this moment, there are two DNS resource record types defined for\nholding
    IPv6 address in the DNS database; AAAA [Thomson, 1995] and A6\n[Crawford, 2000]
    .  AAAA has been used for IPv6 network operation since\n1996.  Questions arose
    whether we really need A6 or not, or whether it\nis really possible to migrate
    to A6 or not.  Some says AAAA is enough\nand A6 is not necessary.  Some says A6
    is necessary and AAAA should get\ndeprecated.\n\t "

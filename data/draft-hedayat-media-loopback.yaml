  content: "    The wide deployment of VoIP and Video over IP services has \n    introduced
    new challenges in managing and maintaining voice/video \n    quality, reliability,
    and overall performance.  In particular, \n    media delivery is an area that
    needs attention.  One method of \n    meeting these challenges is monitoring the
    media delivery \n    performance by looping media back to the transmitter.  This
    is \n    typically referred to as \"active monitoring\" of services.   Media \n
    \   loopback is especially popular in ensuring the quality of transport \n    to
    the edge of a given VoIP or Video over IP service.  Today in \n    networks that
    deliver real-time media, short of running ' ping' and \n    ' traceroute' to the
    edge, service providers are left without the \n    necessary tools to actively
    monitor, manage, and diagnose quality \n    issues with their service.  The extension
    defined herein adds new \n    SDP media attributes which enables establishment
    of media sessions \n    where the media is looped back to the transmitter. Such
    media \n    sessions will serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools by \n
    \   providing the means for measurement of more advanced VoIP and Video \n    Over
    IP performance metrics.\n\t "

  content: "This memo presents a way for the server to unobtrusively advertise\nthe
    ways in which it differs from the IRC (Internet Relay Chat)\nspecification defined
    in RFC 1459 [6]. It is a primary goal to\nimplement this in a way which is completely
    backwards-compatible\nwith the original protocol, and also with current non-standard\nimplementations
    of the ISUPPORT numeric.\n\t "

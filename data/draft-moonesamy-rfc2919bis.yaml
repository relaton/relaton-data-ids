  content: "   Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers and\n
    \  user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to\n   a
    particular mailing list.  With the advent of list header fields, it\n   has become
    even more important to provide a unique identifier for a\n   mailing list regardless
    of the particular host that runs the mailing\n   list manager at any given time.\n\n
    \  The List-Id header field provides a standard location for such an\n   identifier.
    \ In addition, a namespace for mailing list identifiers\n   based on fully qualified
    domain names is described.  This namespace\n   is intended to guarantee uniqueness
    for list owners who require it,\n   while allowing for a less rigorous namespace
    for experimental and\n   personal use.\n\n   By including the List-Id field, mailing
    list managers can make it\n   easier for mail user agents to provide automated
    tools for users to\n   perform mailing list functions.  The mailing list identifier
    can\n   serve as a key for automated processing tasks\n\n\t "

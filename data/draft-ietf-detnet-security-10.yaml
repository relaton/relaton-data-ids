  content: "   A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance\n   guarantees
    to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates\n   and bounded latency.
    \ As a result, securing a DetNet implies that in\n   addition to the best practice
    security measures taken for any\n   mission-critical network, additional security
    measures may be needed\n   whose purpose is exclusively to secure the intended
    operation of\n   these novel service properties.\n\n   Designers of DetNet components
    (such as routers) that provide these\n   unique DetNet properties have the responsibility
    to uphold certain\n   security-related properties that can be assumed by DetNet
    system-\n   level designers.  For example, the assumption that network traffic\n
    \  associated with a given flow can never affect traffic associated with\n   a
    different flow is only true if the underlying components make it\n   so.\n\n   This
    document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from\n   the perspective
    of both the DetNet component designer and the DetNet\n   system-level designer.
    \ It is assumed that both classes of reader are\n   already familiar with network
    security best practices for the data\n   plane technologies underlying a given
    DetNet implementation.\n   Component-level considerations include isolation of
    data flows from\n   each other, ingress filtering, and detection and reporting
    of packet\n   arrival time violations.  System-level considerations include a\n
    \  threat model and a taxonomy of relevant attacks, including their\n   potential
    impacts and mitigations.\n\n   A given DetNet may require securing only certain
    aspects of DetNet\n   performance, for example extremely low data loss rates but
    not\n   necessarily bounded latency.  Therefore this document provides an\n   association
    of threats against various use cases by industry, and\n   also against the individual
    service properties as defined in the\n   DetNet Use Cases.\n\n   This document
    also addresses common DetNet security considerations\n   related to the IP and
    MPLS data plane technologies (the first to be\n   identified as supported by DetNet),
    thereby complementing the\n   Security Considerations sections of the various
    DetNet Data Plane\n   (and other) DetNet documents.\n\n\t "

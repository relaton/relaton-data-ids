- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   When the procedures per [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-srv6-egress-protection] are\n
    \  applied to EVPN services, the egress-protection on PLR is typically\n   more
    faster than the new DF node of the affected ESI is re-elected.\n   As a result
    of that, replicated BUM packets will be sent to the CEs\n   of the affected ES.
    \ This draft describes a \"NDF-bias\" mechanism that\n   is used to avoid such
    excessive BUM packets.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies SONAR (Statistical Observation Network for\n
    \  Attestation and Reach), a protocol combining three technical\n   constructs
    to enable verifiable multicast distribution: (1) Physical\n   layer efficiency
    through native IP multicast transmission achieving\n   O(1) network bandwidth
    regardless of receiver population, (2)\n   Cryptoeconomic receiver accountability
    via on-chain stake deposits,\n   Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) for unpredictable
    sampling, and\n   blockchain-recorded attestation reporting, and (3) Multicast
    source\n   authentication through ALTA-based asymmetric loss-tolerant packet\n
    \  verification enabling real-time content integrity proofs.  SONAR\n   achieves
    constant 6% bandwidth overhead through separation of content\n   authentication
    (broadcast to all receivers) from coverage\n   verification (statistical sampling
    with German Tank Problem\n   estimation).  The protocol employs zero-knowledge
    proof aggregation\n   via zkSNARKs for sample sizes exceeding 1,000 users, providing\n
    \  privacy protection (preventing on-chain correlation attacks), cost\n   efficiency
    (80-90% reduction), and maintaining O(1) on-chain\n   verification cost while
    scaling to populations exceeding 10^8\n   receivers.  SONAR enables cryptographically
    verifiable multicast\n   distribution without trusted intermediaries or per-receiver\n
    \  encryption overhead.\n\n\t "

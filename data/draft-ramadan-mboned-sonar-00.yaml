abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies SONAR (Statistical Observation Network for
    Attestation and Reach), a protocol combining three technical constructs to enable
    verifiable multicast distribution: (1) Physical layer efficiency through native
    IP multicast transmission achieving O(1) network bandwidth regardless of receiver
    population, (2) Cryptoeconomic receiver accountability via on-chain stake deposits,
    Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) for unpredictable sampling, and blockchain-recorded
    attestation reporting, and (3) Multicast source authentication through ALTA-based
    asymmetric loss-tolerant packet verification enabling real-time content integrity
    proofs. SONAR achieves constant 6% bandwidth overhead through separation of content
    authentication (broadcast to all receivers) from coverage verification (statistical
    sampling with German Tank Problem estimation). The protocol employs zero-knowledge
    proof aggregation via zkSNARKs for sample sizes exceeding 1,000 users, providing
    privacy protection (preventing on-chain correlation attacks), cost efficiency
    (80-90% reduction), and maintaining O(1) on-chain verification cost while scaling
    to populations exceeding 10^8 receivers. SONAR enables cryptographically verifiable
    multicast distribution without trusted intermediaries or per-receiver encryption
    overhead.</p>"

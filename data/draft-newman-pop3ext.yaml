  content: "     The POP3 protocol [POP3] includes a number of optional commands and\n
    \    some useful protocol extensions have also been published.\n     Currently
    these optional features and extensions can only be\n     detected by probing.
    This has resulted in some clients including\n     manual configuration options
    for POP3 server capabilities.\n\t "

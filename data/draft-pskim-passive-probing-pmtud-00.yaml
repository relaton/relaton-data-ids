  content: "   This draft consider an alternative PMTUD for QUIC. To discover the\n
    \  best PMTU, the passive probing approach is adopted. The process of\n   discovering
    the best PMTU is not carried out separately, but is\n   carried out simultaneously
    in the actual application data\n   communication. A probe packet is defined newly
    using 1-RTT packet\n   which includes actual application data as well as a short
    packet\n   header and a PING_EXT frame. The PING_EXT frame is also defined\n   newly.
    Until the best PMTU is discovered, the size of the probe\n   packet is changed
    according to the size of the PMTU candidate. A\n   simple discovery algorithm
    using only the PMTU candidate sequence\n   with linear upward is described in
    this draft. Other rather complex\n   discovery algorithms that consider various
    PMTU candidate sequences\n   will be dealt with in the future.\n\n\t "

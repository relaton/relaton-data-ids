abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft consider an alternative PMTUD for QUIC. To discover the
    best PMTU, the passive probing approach is adopted. The process of discovering
    the best PMTU is not carried out separately, but is carried out simultaneously
    in the actual application data communication. A probe packet is defined newly
    using 1-RTT packet which includes actual application data as well as a short packet
    header and a PING_EXT frame. The PING_EXT frame is also defined newly. Until the
    best PMTU is discovered, the size of the probe packet is changed according to
    the size of the PMTU candidate. A simple discovery algorithm using only the PMTU
    candidate sequence with linear upward is described in this draft. Other rather
    complex discovery algorithms that consider various PMTU candidate sequences will
    be dealt with in the future.</p>"

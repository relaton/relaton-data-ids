  content: "This document proposes an increase in the permitted TCP initial\nwindow
    (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in RFC 3390,\nto 10 segments.
    It discusses the motivation behind the increase, the\nadvantages and disadvantages
    of the higher initial window, and\npresents results from several large scale experiments
    showing that\nthe higher initial window improves the overall performance of many\nweb
    services without risking congestion collapse. Finally, it\noutlines a list of
    concerns to be addressed in future tests.\n\t "

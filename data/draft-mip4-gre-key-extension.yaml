  content: "The GRE specification contains a Key field, which MAY contain a value\nthat
    is used to identify a particular GRE data stream.  This\nspecification defines
    a new Mobile IP extension that is used to\nexchange the value to be used in the
    GRE Key field.  This extension\nfurther allows the Mobility Agents to setup the
    necessary protocol\ninterfaces prior to receiving the mobile's traffic.  The new\nextension
    option allows a foreign agent to request GRE tunneling\nwithout disturbing the
    Home Agent behavior specified for Mobile Ipv4.\nGRE tunneling provides an advantage
    that allows operator's private\nhome networks to be overlaid and allows the HA
    to provide overlapping\nhome addresses to different subscribers.  When the tuple
    < Care of\nAddress, Home Address and Home Agent Address > is the same across\nmultiple
    subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a means for\nthe FA and HA to
    identify data streams for the individual sessions\nbased on the GRE key.  In the
    absence of this key identifier, the\ndata streams cannot be distinguished from
    each other, a significant\ndrawback when using IP-in-IP tunneling.\n\t "

  content: "   When a TLS session is resumed via an abbreviated handshake, the\n   knowledge
    of the master secret is used to implicitly mutually\n   authenticate the two peers.
    \ However, an attacker can synchronize two\n   different TLS sessions, so that
    they share the same master secret,\n   breaking the resumption authentication
    property.  This specification\n   defines a TLS extension that cryptographically
    binds the resumption\n   abbreviated handshake with its original session, thus
    preventing this\n   attack.\n\n\t "

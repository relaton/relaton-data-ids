  content: "   This document defines a protocol for the authorization of Internet\n
    \  hosts to use domain names in the sender mailbox of mail that those\n   hosts
    send.  Authorization records are published in DNS for domain\n   names that may
    be used as part of sender mailboxes.  Mail receivers\n   then perform a check
    against those records to see if a client host\n   submitting a piece of mail is
    actually authorized.  Since there are\n   several different concepts of sender
    mailbox, this protocol is\n   generic and can be applied to one or more of such
    \"scopes\".\n\t "

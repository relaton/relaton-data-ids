  content: "   Modern networks require fast, adaptive Traffic Engineering (TE) to\n
    \  support demanding applications like AI training and real-time\n   services.
    \ Existing mechanisms for load balancing, protection, and\n   flow control often
    lack responsiveness and scalability.  This\n   document analyzes key gaps in current
    TE solutions and proposes fast\n   notification as a low-latency, event-driven
    enhancement.  Fast\n   notification enables real-time network awareness and quicker\n
    \  reactions to dynamic conditions, improving overall network efficiency\n   and
    reliability.\n\n\t "

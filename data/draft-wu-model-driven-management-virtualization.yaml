  content: "   Data models for service and network management provides a\n   programmatic
    approach for representing (virtual) services or networks\n   and deriving (1)
    configuration information that will be communicated\n   to network and service
    components that are used to build and deliver\n   the service and (2) state information
    that will be monitored and\n   tracked.  Indeed, data models can be used during
    various phases of\n   the service and network management life cycle, such as service\n
    \  instantiation, service provisioning, optimization, monitoring, and\n   diagnostic.
    \ Also, data models are instrumental in the automation of\n   network management.
    \ They also provide closed-loop control for the\n   sake of adaptive and deterministic
    service creation, delivery, and\n   maintenance.\n\n   This document provides
    a framework that describes and discusses an\n   architecture for service and network
    management automation that takes\n   advantage of YANG modeling technologies.
    \ This framework is drawn\n   from a network provider perspective irrespective
    of the origin of a\n   data module; it can accommodate even modules that are developed\n
    \  outside the IETF.\n\n   The document aims to exemplify an approach that specifies
    the journey\n   from technology-agnostic services to technology-specific actions.\n\n\t "

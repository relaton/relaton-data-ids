  content: "One of the primary concerns with SNMPv1 is the lack of security.           It
    is the purpose of this memo, Security Mechanisms for SNMPv1, to define a compatible
    method of adding authentication and privacy functions to the SNMPv1 framework.
    \                                                         This memo is applicable
    to SNMPv1 and should be applicable to any other SNMP framework that uses similar
    community name based authentication and packet structure as SNMPv1.\n\t "

  content: "   In situations where a transmitter of Security Event Tokens (SETs) to\n
    \  a network peer is also a receiver of SETs from the same peer, it is\n   helpful
    to have an efficient way of sending and receiving SETs in one\n   HTTP transaction.
    \ In many cases, such as when using the OpenID\n   Shared Signals Framework (SSF),
    the situation where each entity is\n   both a transmitter and receiver is getting
    increasingly common.\n\n   Using current mechanisms such as \"Push-Based Delivery
    of Security\n   Event Tokens (SETs) Using HTTP\" or \"Poll-Based Delivery of Security\n
    \  Event Tokens (SETs) Using HTTP\" both require two or more HTTP\n   connections
    to exchange SETs between peers.  This is inefficient due\n   to the latency of
    setting up each communication.  This specification\n   enables bi-directional
    transmission and reception of multiple SETs in\n   one HTTP connection, and enables
    them to do so over a single HTTP or\n   WebSocket connection.\n\n\t "

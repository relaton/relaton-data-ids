  content: "   EVPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) fabrics provide a flexible\n
    \  and extensible method for Layer-2 and Layer-3 overlay network\n   connectivity.
    \ [EVPN-IRB] defines operation for symmetric and\n   asymmetric EVPN IRB using
    distributed anycast gateway architecture\n   (DAG).  In a DAG architecture, both
    bridging and first-hop routing\n   functions for overlay subnets are located on
    leaf PEs, with first-hop\n   routing provided by a distributed anycast gateway
    provisioned across\n   the leaf PEs.  This document describes an architecture
    and operation\n   for EVPN Centralized Anycast Gateway (CAG), which allows the
    first-\n   hop routing function for overlay subnets to be centralized on\n   designated
    IRB GWs while the bridging function is still located on\n   the leaf PEs.  The
    documents also covers trade-offs of deploying a\n   CAG as compared with DAG.
    \ It further describes operation for inter-\n   op between CAG and DAG based EVPN-IRB
    network overlays.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Route Origin Validation (ROV) using the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure
    (RPKI) enables BGP routers to identify illegitimate\n   routes that violate Route
    Origin Authorizations (ROAs).  However,\n   widespread deployment of RPKI requires
    validation systems to process\n   high volumes of route announcements against
    increasingly large ROA\n   datasets, where ROV adoption faces significant barriers
    due to\n   concerns about its processing efficiency.  This document identifies
    a\n   performance issue inherent in current ROV procedure, which could be\n   exacerbated
    as the expanding coverage of ROAs.\n\n\t "

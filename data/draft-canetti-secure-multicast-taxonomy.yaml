  content: "With the growth and commercialization of the Internet, the need for\n
    \  secure IP multicast is growing. In this draft we present a taxonomy of\n   multicast
    security issues. We first sketch some multicast group\n   parameters that are
    relevant to security, and outline the basic\n   security issues concerning multicast
    in general, with emphasis on IP\n   multicast. Next we suggest two `benchmark'
    scenarios for secure\n   multicast solutions. Lastly we review some previous works.\n
    \n   This is a temporary version of the document. The authors will be\n   grateful
    for remarks, and will update and revise this document\n   accordingly.\n\t "

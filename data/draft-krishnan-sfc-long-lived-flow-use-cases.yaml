  script: Latn
  content: "   Long-lived flows such as file transfers, video streams are common in\n
    \  today's networks. In the context of service function chaining, this\n   draft
    suggests use cases for dynamic bypass of certain service nodes\n   for such flows.
    The benefit of this approach would be to avoid\n   expensive Layer 7 service node
    processing for such flows based on\n   dynamic decisions and improve overall performance.\n\n\t "

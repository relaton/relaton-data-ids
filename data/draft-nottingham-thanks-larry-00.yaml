abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   [RFC2324] was an April 1 RFC that lampooned the various ways HTTP was\n
    \  abused; one such abuse was the definition of the application-specific\n   418
    (I'm a Teapot) status code.\n\n   In the intervening years, this status code has
    been widely\n   implemented as an \"easter egg\", and therefore is effectively
    consumed\n   by this use.\n\n   This document changes 418 to the status of \"Reserved\"
    in the IANA\n   HTTP Status Code registry to reflect that.\n\n\t "

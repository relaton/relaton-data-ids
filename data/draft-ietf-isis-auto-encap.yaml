  content: "RFC 1195 [1] documents a dual routing protocol that can be used to \nroute
    both CLNP and IPv4, that is Integrated IS-IS.   Integrated IS-\nIS can now also
    be used to route IPv6 [12]. \nRFC 1195 [1] places certain topological restrictions
    on networks \nthat are routed using Integrated IS-IS, specifically that every
    \nIntermediate System in a level-1 area must be able to forward all \nnetwork
    layer protocols that are present in that area, and that \nevery level-2 Intermediate
    System must be able to forward all \nnetwork layer protocols present in the routing
    domain. \nThe mechanism described in this document enables an Intermediate \nSystem
    or a group of Intermediate Systems that do not support a \nparticular network
    layer protocol to be used in a level-1 area or \nlevel-2 subdomain where that
    network layer protocol is present. \nSpecifically the mechanism provides automatic
    encapsulation and \nunencapsulation so that a packet or PDU may pass through an
    \nIntermediate System that would not normally be able to forward that\ntype of
    packet.\n\t "

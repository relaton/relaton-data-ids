  script: Latn
  content: "The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of\n
    \  IPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4.  Nodes\n   will
    be able to be deployed with IPv6 addresses, but will still need\n   to communicate
    with IPv4 nodes that do not have a dual IP layer\n   supporting both IPv4 and
    IPv6.  This specification defines a\n   mechanism called Assignment of IPv4 Global
    Addresses to IPv6 Hosts\n   (AIIH), which will assign an IPv6 Host a temporary
    IPv4 Global\n   Address, which can be used to communicate with a Host that supports\n
    \  IPv4 or IPv4/IPv6.  An objective of this specification is to avoid\n   the
    use of address translation for the deployment of IPv6 in a\n   network.  Another
    objective is to demonstrate that IPv6 Addresses can\n   be deployed now instead
    of non-Global IPv4 Addresses within an\n   Intranet.\n\t "

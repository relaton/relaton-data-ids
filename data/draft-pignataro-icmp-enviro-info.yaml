  content: "   This document defines a data structure that can be appended to\n   selected
    ICMP messages.  The ICMP extension defined herein can be\n   used to gain visibility
    on environmental sustainability information\n   on the Internet by providing per-hop
    (i.e., per topological network\n   node) power metrics and other present or future
    sustainability\n   metrics.  This will contribute to achieving an objective mentioned
    in\n   the IAB E-Impact workshop.\n\n   The techniques presented are useful not
    only in a transactional\n   setting (e.g., a user-issued traceroute or a ping
    request), but also\n   in a scheduled automated setting where they may be run
    periodically\n   in a mesh across an administrative domain to map out environmental\n
    \  sustainability metrics.\n\n\t "

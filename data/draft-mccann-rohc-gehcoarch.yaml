  content: "Efficient transmission of voice over wireless links requires \nsignificant
    engineering effort.  Because of the high cost of bandwidth \non such links, special
    techniques for compression of voice data and its \ntransmission over the air have
    been developed.  The compression \ntechniques and the wireless physical layers
    have been co-designed for \nmaximum spectral efficiency and human perceptual euphony.\n\t "

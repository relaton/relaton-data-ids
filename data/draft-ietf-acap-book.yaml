  content: "Storing URLs [URL] for later access has become common in Internet\napplications
    (for example, web browsers, FTP clients); these saved\nURLs have become known
    as bookmarks.  It would be desirable to\naccess one's bookmarks from multiple
    clients and multiple machines.\nThe Application Configuration Access Protocol
    [ACAP] provides an\nideal mechanism for storage of bookmarks, providing for ease
    of\ncoordination and synchronization of bookmarks between diverse\napplications
    and systems, as well as for hierarchy, inheritance, and\nsharing between users.\nThis
    specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class for\nbookmarks.\n\t "

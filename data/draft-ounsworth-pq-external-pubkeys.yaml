- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Many of the post quantum cryptographic algorithms have either large\n
    \  public keys or signatures.  In the interest of reducing bandwidth of\n   transitting
    X.509 certificates, this document defines new public key\n   and signature algorithms
    for referencing external public key and\n   signature data by hash, URL, etc.
    \ This mechanism is designed to\n   mimic the behaviour of an Authority Information
    Access extension.\n\n\t "

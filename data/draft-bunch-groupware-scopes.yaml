  content: "   The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is widely used to provide\n   clients
    with delegated access to user data.  However, the core\n   specification leaves
    the definition of access scopes to individual\n   service providers.  This has
    led to a fragmented ecosystem for common\n   groupware services (Mail, Calendaring,
    Contacts), where each provider\n   uses proprietary, non-interoperable scope identifiers.
    \ Client\n   applications, such as desktop mail clients, are forced to hardcode\n
    \  configurations for a small number of large providers, stifling\n   innovation
    and harming open ecosystems.\n\n   This document proposes a framework that combines
    a minimal set of\n   standardized OAuth 2.0 scopes with a detailed structure for
    use with\n   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR).  This hybrid approach\n
    \  provides a simple baseline for legacy clients while enabling\n   powerful,
    granular, and privacy-preserving authorization for modern\n   clients.  It defines
    RAR type values, actions, datatypes, and custom\n   fields for specifying fine-grained
    permissions for groupware\n   resources.\n\n\t "

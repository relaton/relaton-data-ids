  content: "There are many circumstances in LDAP [1] when the result of a Search \noperation
    returns attribute values that have the distinguished name \n(DN) syntax.  This
    document defines controls that allow the client \nto request that the server tag
    each DN with its object classes.  \nThis is a useful feature because object classes
    such as groups [3] \nmay hold many DNs, each of which is a potentially different
    object \nclass.  When using this control in a search, the LDAP client request
    \nthat the server return the object classes of each DN that is an \nattribute
    value of the search result.  This control also defines a \nway to limit the kinds
    of DNs that should be returned in a Search \nresult.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines the 'taler' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n
    \  scheme for triggering interactions with a GNU Taler wallet.\n\n   This URI
    scheme allows applications to trigger interactions with the\n   GNU Taler wallet,
    such as withdrawing money, making payments,\n   receiving refunds and restoring
    a wallet from a backup.  Applications\n   may receive such URIs in many ways (including
    via NFC, QR codes, Web\n   links or messaging applications), or might generate
    them internally\n   to interact with a wallet.  By having a Taler wallet handle
    the\n   respective URIs, applications can integrate Taler payments without\n   having
    to support the Taler protocol directly.  Furthermore, by\n   passing control to
    a Taler wallet process, the wallet's database with\n   its financial data might
    be better protected from application\n   failures.\n\n\t "

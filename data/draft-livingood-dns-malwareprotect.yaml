  content: "The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called\nDNS-based
    malware protection services deployed by Internet Service\nProviders (ISPs), DNS
    Application Service Providers (ASPs), and other\norganizations.  These organizations
    provide so-called DNS-based\nmalware protection services via their recursive DNS
    servers.  This\ndocument specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where
    these\nDNS servers are being utilized to provide a service for end users\nwhich
    blocks domains hosting malicious software, and makes\nrecommendations concerning
    operation of such a service.\n\t "

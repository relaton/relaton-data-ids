  content: "   This document proposes using the SCITT (Supply Chain, Integrity,\n
    \  Transparency, and Trust) protocol to record, communicate and\n   coordinate
    the lifecycle of Virtual Conversations (vCons), which are\n   standardized containers
    for conversational data like call recordings,\n   transcripts, and chat logs.
    \ While vCons enable capturing and sharing\n   conversation details for AI analysis
    and business purposes, they lack\n   mechanisms for proving compliance with privacy
    regulations and\n   consent management.  SCITT addresses this by providing an
    immutable,\n   append-only transparency ledger that records key lifecycle\n   events—from
    vCon creation and consent management to call recording,\n   as well as data processing
    and deletion—enabling entities to\n   demonstrate regulatory compliance and maintain
    trust across\n   distributed systems.  The framework specifically addresses consent\n
    \  management challenges under regulations like GDPR and CCPA, where\n   consent
    can be revoked at any time, requiring coordinated deletion\n   across all parties
    that have received the vCon.  By combining vCons\n   with SCITT, organizations
    can build scalable, transparent governance\n   systems that protect personal data
    rights while enabling responsible\n   use of conversational data for AI and business
    applications.\n\n\t "

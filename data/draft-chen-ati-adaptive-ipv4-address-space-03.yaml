  content: "   This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion\n
    \  issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of\n   the
    original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy IPv4),
    outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system architecture
    enhancement considerations. The EzIP may\n   expand an IPv4 address by a factor
    of 256M without affecting the\n   existing IPv4 based Internet, nor the current
    private networks. The\n   EzIP is in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol,
    and supports not\n   only both direct and private network connectivities, but
    also their\n   interoperability. The EzIP deployment may coexist with the current\n
    \  Internet traffic and the IoT (Internet of Things) operations without\n   perturbing
    their setups, while offering end-users the freedom to\n   choose either. If the
    IPv4 public pool allocations were allowed to be\n   reorganized, the assignable
    pool could be multiplied by 512M times or\n   even more. The EzIP may be implemented
    as a software / firmware\n   enhancement to the Internet edge routers or private
    network routing\n   gateways wherever needed, or simply installed as an inline
    adjunct\n   hardware module between the two, enabling a seamless introduction.\n
    \  The 256M case detailed herein establishes a complete sphere of\n   routers
    for interfacing between the Internet core fabic and the end\n   user premises.
    Incorporating the caching proxy technology in the\n   gateway, a fairly large
    geographical area may enjoy an EzIP based\n   sub-Internet operating from as few
    as one ordinary IPv4 public\n   address. This will immediately resolve the IPv4
    address shortage\n   anywhere, while transparent to the current Internet operation.
    Under\n   the Dual-Stack environment, these proposed interim facilities will\n
    \  relieve the IPv4 address shortage issue, while affording the IPv6\n   more
    time to orderly reach the maturity and the availability levels\n   required for
    delivering a long-term general service.\n\n\n\n\t "

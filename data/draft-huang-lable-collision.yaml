  content: "Upstream Label Suggestion and upstream label allocation schemes are \nintroduced
    and simply defined in [OVER][UPSTREAM]. But it is possible \nthat the same label
    will be allocated for unicast LSP and multicast \nLSP on the same link. In upstream
    label allocation, it solves the \ncollision through layer 2 encapsulation and
    context-specific label \nspace. But in the Upstream Label Suggestion allocation
    scheme, the \ncollision can not be solved if downstream LSRs do not support \ncontext-specific
    label space. This document details the solution of \nlabel collision between multicast
    and unicast for the Upstream Label \nSuggestion allocation scheme. \n\t "

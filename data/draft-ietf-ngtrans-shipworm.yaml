- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or\nseveral
    IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets\nover UDP; we call
    this the Teredo service. Running the service\nrequires the help of 'Teredo servers'
    and 'Teredo relays'; the\nTeredo servers are stateless, and only have to manage
    a small\nfraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays\nact
    as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the 'native' IPv6\nInternet.\n\t "

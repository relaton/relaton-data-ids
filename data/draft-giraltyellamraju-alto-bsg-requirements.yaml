  content: "   This document proposes an extension to the base Application-Layer\n
    \  Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol to support bottleneck structures\n   as
    an efficient representation of the state of a network.  Bottleneck\n   structures
    are efficient computational graphs that allow network\n   operators and application
    service providers to optimize application\n   performance in a variety of communication
    problems including routing,\n   flow control, flow scheduling, bandwidth prediction,
    and network\n   slicing, among others.  This document introduces a new abstraction\n
    \  called Bottleneck Structure Graph (BSG) and the necessary\n   requirements
    to integrate it into the ALTO standard.\n\n\t "

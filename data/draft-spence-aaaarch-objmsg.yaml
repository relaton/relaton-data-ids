  content: "This memo specifies the top level data objects to be carried in an\nAAA
    Protocol that supports the generic AAA architecture described in\nRFC 2903.  It
    also specifies the required message types.  Data\nobjects and message types are
    defined in an abstract way without\nregard to encoding.  The message types defined
    could be thought of as\nthe use cases (in the UML sense) for a generic AAA server.
    \ They\ndefine what can be asked of or provided to a generic AAA server.  The\ndata
    objects specify what kinds of information can be routed among\nthe AAA servers
    in the generic AAA infrastructure.  Suggestions as to\nwhich data objects would
    be carried in each message type are\nprovided.\n\t "

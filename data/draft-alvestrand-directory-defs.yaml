  content: "When discussing systems for making information accessible through the
    Internet in standardized ways, it may be useful if the people who are discussing
    it have a common understanding of the terms they use.  For example, a reference
    to this document would give one the power to agree that the DNS (Domain Name System)
    is a global lookup repository with perimeter integrity and loose, converging consistency.
    \ On the other hand, a LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory
    server is a local, centralized repository with both lookup and search capability.
    \ This document discusses one group of such systems which is known under the term,
    \"directories\".  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   I In current multipath load balancing network scenario, all path\n
    \  detection mechanisms have a defect.  A typical load balancing route\n   selection
    mechanism cannot cover all forwarding paths, which will\n   cause missing detection.This
    document describes how to extend a new\n   path detection mechanism to instruct
    intermediate devices to send\n   probe packets to all downstream paths.  This
    new mechanism is named\n   load-sharing multipath replication forwarding (LMRF).\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) \nTraffic
    Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be \ncomputed by Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP \ncrosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous
    Systems (ASes), the \npath may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with
    each \nresponsible for computing a segment of the path. To preserve \nconfidentiality
    of topology with each AS, the PCE supports a \nmechanism to hide the contents
    of a segment of a path, called the \nConfidential Path Segment (CPS), by encoding
    the contents as a \nPath Key Subobject (PKS). This document describes the addition
    of \nthis information to Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling \nby inclusion
    in the Explicit Route Object (ERO) and Record Route \nObject (RRO).\n\t "

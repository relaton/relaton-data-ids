  content: "The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for\n
    \  transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\n \n   This
    document introduces a new PPP feature called Semi Connected\n   Mode. When both
    sides of a point-to-point link agree to use Semi Con-\n   nected Mode, either
    side can transparently disconnect and re-\n   establish a circuit-switched connection
    without having to reconfigure\n   the point-to-point link each time.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) can be\n
    \  used to protect CoAP messages end-to-end between two endpoints at the\n   application
    layer, also in the presence of intermediaries such as\n   proxies.  This document
    defines how to use OSCORE for protecting CoAP\n   messages also between an origin
    application endpoint and an\n   intermediary, or between two intermediaries.  Also,
    it defines how to\n   secure a CoAP message by applying multiple, nested OSCORE\n
    \  protections, e.g., both end-to-end between origin application\n   endpoints,
    as well as between an application endpoint and an\n   intermediary or between
    two intermediaries.  Thus, this document\n   updates RFC 8613.  The same approach
    can be seamlessly used with\n   Group OSCORE, for protecting CoAP messages when
    group communication\n   with intermediaries is used.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Multiple enterprises (tenants) consuming resources in a public Cloud\n
    \  shares the physical infrastructure of one or more DCs out of which\n   the
    Cloud resources are serviced.  Hence one of the major features\n   that has to
    be supported in public Cloud DCs is multitenant\n   isolation, which is realized
    via various DC isolation technologies,\n   such as VLAN or VxLAN.  In a hybrid
    Cloud environment where a public\n   Cloud (more specifically off-premises public
    Cloud resources acquired\n   by a tenant ) becomes an _extension_ of a tenant
    intranet or private\n   Cloud, the multitenant isolation capability has to be
    extended beyond\n   the public Cloud DCs.  The multitenant isolation _domain_
    has to span\n   end-to-end from the tenant network or on-premises resources via
    the\n   MAN/WAN and the public Cloud DC networks to tenant off-premises\n   resources.
    \ While multitenant isolationI isolates one tenant from\n   another (inter-hybrid
    Cloud isolation), an enterprise may desire\n   controlled connectivity to a hybrid
    Cloud from another Cloud or\n   network or tenant or select resources.  In addition,
    there may be\n   need for controlling direct reachability of resources within
    a hybrid\n   Cloud itself (intra-hybrid Cloud).  The tenant network may be\n   connected
    to the public Cloud (DCs) over the Internet or a private\n   IP/MPLS MAN/WAN owned
    or operated by a service provider, which also\n   may support PPVPN (Provider
    Provided VPN) service, such as the L3\n   MPLS VPN.  In this work we consider
    the latter type of network and\n   describe a framework for supporting inter-hybrid
    Cloud multitenant\n   isolation, inter-hybrid Cloud connectivity and intra-hybrid
    Cloud\n   reachability.\n\n\n\t "

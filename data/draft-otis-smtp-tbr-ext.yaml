  content: "   This document describes an extension to SMTP that allows email to be\n
    \  exchanged as a storage system immutable XAM (eXtensible Access\n   Method)
    reference.  When MTAs employ the TBR mode, message\n   origination can not be
    spoofed, and message acceptance is not\n   asserted until retrieval of the referenced
    message.  This strategy\n   ensures a minimal SMTP overhead, increasing the responsibility
    of\n   senders in order to limit the load of unwanted messages upon\n   receivers.\n\n
    \  In addition, the TBR extension requires an [RFC2821] MAIL FROM\n   address
    in the same domain as the server from which the XAM will be\n   fetched, so that
    a dependable status-reporting path is assured.\n\t "

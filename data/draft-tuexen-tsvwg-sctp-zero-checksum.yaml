abstract:
- content: "<p>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) uses a 32-bit checksum
    in the common header of each packet to provide some level of data integrity. When
    the lower layer used by SCTP does already provide the same or a higher level of
    data integrity, computing this checksum does not provide any additional protection,
    but does require computing resources. This document provides a simple extension
    to SCTP allowing to save these computing resources by using the constant 0 as
    the checksum.</p>"

  content: "   This proposal provides a method to implement identifier to locator\n
    \  mapping in the datapath without the need to access an in-network\n   mapping
    database or cache. Mappings are encoded in Firewall and\n   Service Tickets (FAST)
    tickets as locator information. When a packet\n   is sent by a mobile node, a
    ticket is attached that providers the\n   locator to use in the return path. Peer
    nodes receive packets with\n   these tickets, cache the tickets in a flow context,
    and then attach\n   them to packets they send as reflected tickets. When a packet
    with a\n   reflected ticket enters an identifier-locator domain, the ticket is\n
    \  parsed to extract the locator. That locator is then used to send the\n   packet
    to the appropriate destination over a network overlay.\n\n\t "

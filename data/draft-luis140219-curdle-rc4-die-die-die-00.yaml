abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RC4 is extremely weak as shown by RFC 6649 and RFC 7457, is\n   prohibited
    in TLS by RFC 7465, is prohibited in Kerberos by RFC xxxx\n   and it needs to
    be prohibited in all IETF protocols. Documents that\n   provide technology that
    can only use RC4 are obsoleted by this\n   document, so this document obsoletes
    and moves to Historic RFC 3078\n   \"Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE)
    Protocol\" (only supports\n   RC4), RFC 4345 \"Improved Arcfour Modes for the
    Secure Shell (SSH)\n   Transport Layer Protocol\" (note Arcfour and RC4 are synonymous),\n
    \  RFC 4757 \"The RC4-HMAC Kerberos Encryption Types Used by Microsoft\n   Windows\"
    (only supports RC4) and RFC 6229 \"Test Vectors for the\n   Stream Cipher RC4\"
    (provides test vectors for historic cryptography).\n   RFC 2118, RFC 3961, RFC
    4120, RFC 4253, RFC 6150, RFC 6649, RFC 7457,\n   RFC 7905 and RFC xxxx are updated
    to note the deprecation of RC4 in\n   all IETF protocols. (Please do not confuse
    RFC 4757 with RFC 7457.)\n\n\t "

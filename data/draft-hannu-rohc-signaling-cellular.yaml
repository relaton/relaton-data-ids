  content: "This draft discusses problems arising when ASCII based application\nsignaling
    protocols are used over cellular access channels. The\nprotocols discussed are
    SIP, RTSP and SDP. The problems are call\nsetup delays and decreased system capacity
    due to inefficient\nsignaling by these protocols. An outline of an algorithm for\ncompression
    of these protocols is given\n\t "

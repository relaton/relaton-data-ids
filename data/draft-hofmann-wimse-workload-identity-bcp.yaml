  script: Latn
  content: "   The use of the OAuth 2.0 framework for container orchestration\n   systems
    poses a challenge as managing secrets, such as client_id and\n   client_secret,
    can be complex and error-prone.  \"Service account\n   token volume projection\",
    a term introduced by Kubernetes, provides a\n   way of injecting JSON Web Tokens
    (JWTs) to workloads.\n\n   This document specifies the use of JWTs for client
    credentials in\n   container orchestration systems to improve interoperability
    in\n   orchestration systems, to reduce complexity for developers, and\n   motivates
    authorization server to support RFC 7523.\n\n\t "

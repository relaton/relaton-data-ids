  content: "According to IPv6 operation in cellular networks, one prefix can only\nbe
    assigned to one interface of a mobile node by an access router and\ndifferent
    mobile nodes can't share a prefix.  Managing Per-MN\ninterface prefixes is likely
    to increase the processing load at the\naccess router.  Based on the idea that
    DHCPv6 servers can manage\nprefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique
    in which\nthe access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the\nprefixes
    to an DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a\nprefix for an incoming
    mobile node to the DHCPv6 server.  The access\nrouter next advertises the prefix
    information to the mobile node with\na Router Advertisement message.  When the
    mobile node hands off, the\nprefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server.  We also
    describe how AAA\nservers can help in prefix delegation.\n\t "

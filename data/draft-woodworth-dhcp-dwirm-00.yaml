  script: Latn
  content: "   Internet of Things (IoT) devices are commonly added to home networks\n
    \  without fully understanding which services (hosts, ports, protocols)\n   are
    being provided or consumed for those devices to operate.  As a\n   result, they
    are essentially unmanaged threats with full access to\n   that network and the
    internet.  The Defend the World from IoT Remote-\n   threats & Malware (DWIRM)
    extension to DHCP provides a framework for\n   IoT devices to negotiate services
    that the local router in turn\n   enforces as policy.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports a proposal for semantics of SIP spam scoring
    in order to achieve a flexible signalling standardization allowing an incremental
    adoption of the scoring mechanism. This approach can give early experimental implementers
    the possibility to start using spam scoring extensions in an explorative fashion
    without running into interoperability problems.</p>"

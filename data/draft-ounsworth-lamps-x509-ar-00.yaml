  content: "   This document defines extensions for X.509 certificates to include\n
    \  attestation results as part of the certificate's content.  The\n   primary
    use case for these extensions is in the context of\n   Certificate Signing Request
    (CSR) attestation, where claims about the\n   trustworthiness of an Attester are
    conveyed to the Certification\n   Authority (CA) as part of the CSR process.  These
    extensions enable\n   the CA to appraise the submitted evidence and embed attestation\n
    \  results into the issued certificate.  This allows Relying Parties to\n   evaluate
    the Attester's trustworthiness consistently and efficiently,\n   supporting scalable
    policies for verification in environments with\n   diverse attestation technologies.\n\n\t "

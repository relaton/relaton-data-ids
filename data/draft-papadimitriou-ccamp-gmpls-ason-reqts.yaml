  content: "The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocol has been defined to\ncontrol
    different switching technologies as well as different\napplications. These include
    support for requesting TDM connections\nincluding SONET/SDH and Optical Transport
    Networks (OTNs).\nThis document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS\nsuite
    of protocols. It identifies the features to be covered by the\nsignalling protocol
    to support the capabilities of an Automatically\nSwitched Optical Network (ASON).
    This document provides a problem\nstatement and additional requirements on the
    GMPLS signaling\nprotocol to support the ASON functionality.\n\t "

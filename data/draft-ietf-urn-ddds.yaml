  content: "This document describes the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)
    algorithm for applying dynamically retrieved string transformation rules to an
    application-unique string.  Well-formed transformation rules will reflect the
    delegation of management of information associated with the string.  This document
    is also part of a series that is completely specified in \"Dynamic Delegation
    Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS\" (RFC 3401).  It is
    very important to note that it is impossible to read and understand any document
    in this series without reading the others. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

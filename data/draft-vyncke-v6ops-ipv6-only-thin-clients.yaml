  content: "   While IPv6-only (no IPv4 at all) is becoming an objective, there are\n
    \  remaining issues on this road for the wired thin clients.  This\n   document
    enumerates of couple of them; each with a short description,\n   followed by a
    description of the issue in IPv6-only networks then\n   some solutions.\n\n   It
    is expected that this document will grow by collecting other\n   roadblocks and
    suggestions to remove them.\n\n\t "

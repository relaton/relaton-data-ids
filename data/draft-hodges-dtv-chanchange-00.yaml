  content: "Advances in video compression techniques and new technology for\ndelivering
    broadband services are making digital television (DTV)\nservices practical and
    marketable.  One of the missing elements is a\nflexible and open protocol for
    DTV clients to request desired\nvideo/audio streams, or 'channel changing'.\nThis
    document describes a protocol that a client may use to change\nDTV channels, and
    how servers may authenticate the client, authorize\nthe requested streams, perform
    viewership accounting, and form a\nreply to inform the client on the status of
    the request.\n\n\t "

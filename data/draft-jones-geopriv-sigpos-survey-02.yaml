  content: "   Location Information Servers rely on signal surveys to create a\n   signal
    map allowing for subsequent device location determination.\n   This document describes
    a method by which a Survey Device is able to\n   provide indoor location related
    measurement data to a LIS for\n   positioning purposes.  Location related measurement
    information\n   comprises observations concerning properties related to the position\n
    \  of a Survey Device and the radio, electromagnetic, and other\n   observable
    environmental measures as perceived by the Survey Device.\n   These measurements
    could be data about Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth\n   signals, barometric pressure,
    or any other environmental measurement\n   which could sent to a LIS for subsequent
    processing to help determine\n   the location of devices that later enter the
    venue.  A basic set of\n   location-related measurements, data rights disclosure
    and location\n   types are defined.\n\n\t "

  content: "   As mobile nodes move to new links, they need to resume their\n   communications
    in a timely fashion.  To communicate, IPv6 nodes need\n   to complete router discovery,
    address auto-configuration, and other\n   tasks.  Unfortunately, this depends
    on prior completion of the\n   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol, introducing
    a mandatory\n   delay of up to one second.  This document discusses where this
    can be\n   problematic and proposes solutions that can alleviate the problem.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The design of scheduling data amongst multiple asynchronous paths\n
    \  impacts the performance of multipath transport protocols. This draft\n   proposes
    a path-aware scheduling scheme, which adaptively selects the\n   most suitable
    scheduling scheme according to the path characteristics\n   in a time-variant
    multipath transport scenario. When the path\n   characteristics are unknown, the
    redundant mode is employed to\n   achieve at least as good performance as that
    of the best single path.\n   The condition for choosing the most suitable scheduling
    mode relies\n   on the measured path characteristics and the application\n   requirements.
    Especially, the path-aware scheduling scheme is\n   designed in this draft in
    terms of of the delay difference of\n   multiple paths, compared with a pre-defined
    delay threshold.\n\n\t "

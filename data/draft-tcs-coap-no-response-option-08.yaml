  script: Latn
  content: "   There can be typical M2M scenarios where responses from server\n   against
    request from client might be considered redundant. This kind\n   of open-loop
    exchange (with no reverse path from the server to the\n   client) may be typically
    desired to minimize resource consumption in\n   constrained systems while simultaneously
    updating a bulk of\n   resources or updating a resource with a very high frequency.
    CoAP\n   already provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of exchange where the\n
    \  server end-point does not respond with ACK. However, the server end-\n   point
    responds back with a status code indicating \"the result of the\n   attempt to
    understand and satisfy the request\".\n\n   This draft introduces a header option
    for CoAP called 'No-Response'.\n   The option explicitly tells the server to suppress
    responses about\n   the state of the resource against the request from the client.
    This\n   option also provides granular control by allowing suppression of a\n
    \  typical class or a combination of classes of responses. This option\n   may
    be effective for both unicast and multicast requests. This draft\n   discusses
    few exemplary applications which might benefit from this\n   option.\n\n\t "

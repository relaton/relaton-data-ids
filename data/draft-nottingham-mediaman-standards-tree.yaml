  content: "   Over time, it has become clear that there are media types which have\n
    \  the character of belonging in the standards tree (because they are\n   not
    associated with any one vendor or person), but are not published\n   by a standards
    body.  This draft suggests an update to [RFC6838] to\n   allow their registration.\n\n\t "

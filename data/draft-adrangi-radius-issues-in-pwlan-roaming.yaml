  content: "There are a number of IETF drafts that describe use of RADIUS in a \nvariety
    of scenarios.  However, in the context of Public Wireless \nLAN (PWLAN) deployments,
    there are still some areas where either \nuse of RADIUS is unclear or not covered.
    To address this problem, \nwe first need to generate a list of RADIUS issues significant
    to \npublic wireless LAN roaming (authenticating and obtaining service \non a
    network operated by or affiliated with a home provider’s \n'roaming partner').
    \ Once these issues are understood and \nanalyzed, we can take appropriate actions
    to solve them.  This \ndocument describes some of RADIUS issues encountered in
    PWLAN \ndeployments and roaming scenarios.\n\t "

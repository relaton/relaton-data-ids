  content: "   Satellite networks present some interesting challenges for packet\n
    \  networking.  The entire topology is continually in motion, with links\n   that
    are far less reliable than what is common in terrestrial\n   networks.  Some changes
    to link connectivity can be anticipated due\n   to orbital mechanics.\n\n   This
    document proposes a routing architecture for satellite networks\n   based on existing
    routing protocols and mechanisms, enhanced with\n   scheduled link connectivity
    change information.  This document\n   proposes no protocol changes.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces a communication semantic for multicast that\n
    \  is initiated through forward requests, resulting in dynamic return\n   multicast
    to the set of initiating clients.  The key dynamic nature\n   here is the return
    multicast relations being possibly different for\n   every transmission.\n\n   We
    introduce this semantic more formally, present exemplifying use\n   cases and
    then focus on realizing this semantic using two multicast\n   technologies.\n\n
    \  Although this document formally introduces the FRRM semantic as a new\n   communication
    semantic, it does not intend to show the realization of\n   it through the specific
    multicast technologies in all details.  This\n   is left for separate documents,
    if desired.\n\n\t "

  content: "The charter of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Extensions working group
    (pppext) includes the responsibility to \"actively advance PPP's most useful extensions
    to full standard, while defending against further enhancements of questionable
    value.\" In support of that charter, the allocation of PPP protocol and other
    assigned numbers will no longer be \"first come first served.\" This document
    specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n\t "

  content: "   NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range\n
    \  of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a\n   storage
    networking fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and\n   InfiniBand.  For IP-based
    network, RDMA or TCP technology can be used\n   to transport NVMe commands.  When
    a network fault occurs, NVMe\n   connections need to be switched over.  Currently,
    no effective method\n   is available for quick detection, switchover is performed
    only based\n   on KA timeout, resulting in low performance.\n\n   This document
    defines the basic framework of how network-assisted\n   hosts and storage devices
    can quickly detect NVMe connection failures\n   caused by network faults for NVMe
    IP-based SANs.\n\n\n\t "

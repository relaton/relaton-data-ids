  script: Latn
  content: "This draft describes the basic concepts of point-to-multipoint \n(p2mp)
    path computation on the basis of the Path Computation Element \nMetric Protocol
    (PCEMP). PCEMP, being soft-memory based, has the \ncapability of dynamic configuration
    of its finite state machines \n(FSMs) in the participating PCEMP peers, and thus
    can support a \nwide variety of traffic engineering techniques that are needed
    to \nguarantee bandwidth demand and scalable fast protection and \nrestoration
    in PCE based p2mp frameworks. To take advantage of \nbandwidth considerations
    and fast restoration mechanisms, the \ncentralized Controller, which is the key
    element in a PCE node, \nis used for path computation in case of p2mp paths and
    can be used \nin a scenario where reliable multicasting of bandwidth-on-demand
    \nservices becomes an important criteria for multiple-domain and/or \ninter-domain
    PCE based architectures.\n\t "

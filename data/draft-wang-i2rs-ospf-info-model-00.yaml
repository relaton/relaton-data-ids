  content: "   As one of well-known link-state protocols, OSPF has been widely used\n
    \  in the routing of intra domain networks.  During the past decades, it\n   has
    been deployed with the help of typical interfaces such as CLI,\n   SNMP and NETCONF.
    \ As modern networks grow in scale and complexity,\n   the necessity for rapid
    and dynamic control has been increased.  The\n   I2RS is a standard-based interface
    which provides a programmatic way\n   to achieve this goal.\n\n   This document
    specifies an information model for the OSPF protocol to\n   facilitate the definition
    of a standardized data model, which can be\n   used to define interfaces to the
    OSPF from an entity that may even be\n   external to the routing system.  Based
    on standardized data model and\n   interfaces, use cases of IGP protocols defined
    by I2RS-WG can be\n   supported.\n\n\n\t "

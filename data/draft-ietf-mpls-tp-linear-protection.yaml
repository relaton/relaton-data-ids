  content: "This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.\n\n
    This document addresses the functionality described in the MPLS-TP Survivability
    Framework document (RFC 6372) and defines a protocol that may be used to fulfill
    the function of the Protection State Coordination for linear protection, as described
    in that document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "This document looks at games and their use on computers, where they have
    been and where they are going, their relationship to the Internet and its eventual
    to communicate for multi-player capability. The document solicits input on, and
    proposes creating, a generic standard for game protocols and other systems that
    generate real-time and transaction-based traffic.       If such a standard for
    transaction-based traffic exists, other applications may be able to use it, and
    server programs to handle processing of multi-user games may then be possible.\n\t "

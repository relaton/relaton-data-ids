  content: "This document specifies an event package for content push delivery\nprotocol
    over SIP.  The purpose is to allow an application on a UA to\nsubscribe to updates
    to its own application events containing either\ncontent or references to the
    content.  This document describes how\ncontent can be pushed out to an application
    by the use of push\nevents.  A new SIP event package is defined for notification
    of push\nevents for content delivery.\n\t "

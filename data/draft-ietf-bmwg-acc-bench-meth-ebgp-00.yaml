  content: "   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with
    \n   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and \n
    \  being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is \n   necessary
    that the router be tested in these simultaneous operational \n   conditions, which
    is known as Stress Testing.  This document provides \n   the Methodology for performing
    Stress Benchmarking of networking \n   devices when subjected to instability with
    eBGP-4.  Descriptions of \n   Test Topology, Benchmarks and Reporting Format are
    provided in \n   addition to procedures for conducting various test cases.  This
    \n   methodology is based upon the accelerated stress methodology \n   guidelines
    [6] and is to be used with the companion terminology \n   document [4]. \n\t "

  content: "The growth in mobile terminal access to the Internet has been one of \nthe
    greatest growth areas in the past year. Indeed the so-called 3rd \ngeneration
    mobile networks being designed are premised upon Internet \nservices and protocols.
    Both mobility and wireless access bring with \nthem unique requirements that needs
    to be addressed within the \nInternet community such as address space and limited
    access \nbandwidth. This document is a synthesis of a yearlong study of \nmobile
    operators and mobile ISPs to crystallise these unique \nrequirements. These are
    provided for guidance and are not intended \nto be prescriptive on the current
    Internet Architectural Framework.\n\t "

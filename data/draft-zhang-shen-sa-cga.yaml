  content: "This memo describes an approach to negotiate ESP SA when both sides\nare
    using CGAs as IP address.  The solution provides as an alternate\nsolution of
    IKE when CGAs are available.  One round of message\nexchanges is described in
    order to take place of the initial\nexchanges of IKEv2 or the phase 1 exchange
    of IKE.  A new IPv6\nextension header, CGA extension header, is described in order
    to\ncarry CGA related payloads.\n\t "

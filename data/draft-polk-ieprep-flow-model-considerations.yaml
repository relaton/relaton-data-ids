  content: "This document diagrams the packet flows - both signaling and data - \nof
    Internet Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) related protocols. This \ndocument serves
    as a point of reference for the WG when discussing \nwhich QoS mechanisms can
    be employed for each individual \n(application) protocol packet flow to function
    properly during \ncongestion events from IP source to IP destination, as well
    as a \npotentially different QOS mechanism for a related but separate data \nflow
    (if present).\n\t "

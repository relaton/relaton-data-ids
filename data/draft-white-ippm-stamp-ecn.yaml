  content: "   The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) enables one-\n
    \  way and round-trip measurement of network metrics between IP hosts,\n   and
    has a facility for defining optional extensions.  This document\n   defines a
    STAMP extension to enable the measurement of manipulation\n   of the value of
    the explicit congestion notification (ECN) field of\n   the IP header by middleboxes
    between two STAMP hosts, and to enable\n   discovery and measurement of paths
    that provide differential\n   treatment of packets depending on the value of their
    ECN field.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The need for individual right to privacy and the need for law\n   enforcement
    to be able to effectively investigate crime are sometimes\n   portrayed as being
    irreconcilably in direct conflict with each other.\n   Both needs are legitimate
    and ignoring the challenges presented by\n   areas of conflict will not make the
    problem go away.\n\n   The document presents a conceptual model that allows for
    both sets of\n   requirements to be met simultaneously.  The reason for this\n
    \  publication is to show that, with some creative thinking, it is\n   possible
    to identify win-win solutions that simultaneously achieve\n   both privacy and
    law enforcement goals.\n\n\t "

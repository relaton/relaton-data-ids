- language: en

  content: "   As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed\n
    \  approach is needed to Mobile IPv6.  This document defines a\n   distributed
    mobility management protocol.  Protocol is based on\n   Mobile IPv6 and its extensions
    for multiple care of address\n   registration, flow mobility and dual stack mobile
    IPv6 with minimum\n   extensions.  Control and data plane separation is achieved
    by\n   separating Home Agent functionalities into the control and data\n   planes.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies how a document written using the Standardized
    General Markup Language (SGML) is to be carried within a MIME message.  MIME provides
    a flexible mechanism for structuring RFC 822 message bodies.  Additional mechanisms
    are required to encapsulate SGML documents which can consist of multiple parts.
    \ The mechanisms specify how to label the SGML parts and how to represent the
    internal references between the files.  In addition, this document specifies the
    requirements for conformance to the SGML Document Interchange Format (SDIF).  Subtypes
    are proposed for the Multipart and Application content types to support SGML documents
    and their interchange format within MIME.                  SGML is one of a class
    of compound documents which consist of a number of a set of parts or files, some
    of which may contain references to other files in the set.  Explicit indications
    of the bindings between the sender's file names and the MIME body parts are needed
    to re-bind the sender's file names to ones on the recipient's system.  Further,
    the document may refer to host system commands, a security hazard which must be
    controlled.\n\t "

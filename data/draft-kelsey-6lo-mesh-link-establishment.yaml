  content: "   This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for\n
    \  establishing and configuring secure radio links in IEEE 802.15.4\n   radio
    mesh networks.  MLE extends IEEE 802.15.4 for use in multihop\n   mesh networks
    by adding three capabilities: 1) dynamically\n   configuring and securing radio
    links, 2) enabling network-wide\n   changes to radio parameters, and 3) determining
    link quality prior to\n   link configuration MLE operates below the routing layer,
    insulating\n   it from the details of configuring, securing, and maintaining\n
    \  individual radio links within a larger mesh network.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document is in response to a request made by the Traffic\nEngineering
    Working Group for a set of traffic engineering practices\nfrom a sample of the
    ISP engineering community.  It reflects the\ncurrent traffic engineering principles
    and practices that Cable &\nWireless uses for its global 'packet' networks (including
    IP and\nMPLS) at the time of publication.  It will also identify some of the\nhistory
    that has lead to the specific principles and practices as\nwell as some of the
    trade-offs between these methods and other\npossible approaches.  It is not intended
    to be a detailed engineering\nguide or 'how-to' document.\n\n\t "

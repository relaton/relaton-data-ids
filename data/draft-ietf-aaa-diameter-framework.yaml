  content: "Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks by\nusing
    the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication,\nAuthorization and Accounting
    (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recent\nwork done in the Roaming Operations
    (ROAMOPS) Working Group was to\ninvestigate whether RADIUS could be used in a
    roaming network, and\nconcluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain purposes.\n\t "

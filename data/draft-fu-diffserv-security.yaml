  content: "This document provides a security analysis for the differentiated\nservice
    framework. We studied what kinds of attacks can be performed\nand how badly attacks
    can affect network services under the DiffServ\nframework. Without a careful investigation
    of potential attacks and\nimpacts, the protection systems can not be effectively
    developed and\nevaluated. The DiffServ working group, as a whole, needs to decide\nwhat
    the important security issues are (or what specific attacks we\nneed to defend
    against). Then, it will be meaningful to discuss the\npossible solution to those
    realistic DiffServ vulnerabilities. Our\nobjective in this report is to define
    a model for denial of service\nattacks under the DiffServ framework.\n\n\t "

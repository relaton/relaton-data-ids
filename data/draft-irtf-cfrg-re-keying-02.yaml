  content: "   If encryption is performed under a single key, there is a certain\n
    \  maximum threshold amount of data that can be safely encrypted.  This\n   amount
    is called key lifetime.  This specification contains a\n   description of a variety
    of methods to increase the lifetime of\n   symmetric keys.  It provides external
    and internal re-keying\n   mechanisms based on hash functions and on block ciphers
    that can be\n   used with such modes of operations as CTR, GCM, CCM, CBC, CFB,
    OFB\n   and OMAC.\n\n\t "

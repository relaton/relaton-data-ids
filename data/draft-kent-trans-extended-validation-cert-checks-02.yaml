  content: "   Certificate Transparency (CT) [RFC6962-bis] is a system for publicly\n
    \  logging the existence of X.509 certificates as they are issued or\n   observed.
    \ The logging mechanism allows anyone to audit certification\n   authority (CA)
    activity and detect the issuance of \"suspect\"\n   certificates.  Detecting mis-issuance
    of certificates is a primary\n   goal of CT.\n\n   A certificate is considered
    to be mis-issued if it fails to meet\n   syntactic and/or semantic criteria associated
    with the type of\n   certificate being issued.  Mis-issuance can be detected by
    CT log\n   servers, whose feedback to a CA could prompt the CA to not issue a\n
    \  suspect certificate.  (Preventing the mis-issuance of such a\n   certificate
    is preferable to issuing it and detecting it later.)\n\n   Compliant CT log servers
    could offer these checks to a CA submitting\n   a pre-certificate to be logged.
    \ These checks are intended to be used\n   in an environment in which CAs optionally
    assert the version of the\n   EV guidelines to which the submitted pre-certificate
    purportedly\n   conforms.  Log servers would then perform the checks of supported\n
    \  [CABF-EV] versions and include the CA's assertion and the log\n   server's
    result in its Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT).\n\n   Monitors can also perform
    checks to detect suspect certificates on\n   behalf of certificate Subjects.  Checks
    performed by a Monitor also\n   serve to double check log servers that claim to
    have checked a\n   certificate, to identify those that are not doing the checks\n
    \  properly, e.g., because of errors, compromise, or conspiracy.  This\n   provides
    Monitors and CT clients with additional information when\n   choosing which logs
    to use.\n\n\t "

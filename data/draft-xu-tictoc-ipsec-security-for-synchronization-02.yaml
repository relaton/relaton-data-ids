  content: "   Cellular networks often use Internet standard technologies to handle\n
    \  synchronization.  This document defines an extension based on WESP.\n   Usually,
    several traffic flows are carried in one IPsec tunnel, for\n   some applications,
    such as, 1588 or NTP, the packets need to be\n   identified after IPsec encryption
    to handle specially.  In order to\n   achieve high scalability in implement, a
    separate IPsec tunnel will\n   not be established for some special traffic.  This
    document analyses\n   the need for security methods for synchronization messages\n
    \  distributed over the Internet.  This document also gives a solution\n   on
    how to mark the synchronization message when IPSec is implemented\n   in end to
    end frequency synchronization.\"\n\n\t "

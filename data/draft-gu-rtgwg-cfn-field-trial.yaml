  content: "   Compute First Networking (CFN) enables the routing of the service\n
    \  request to an optimal edge site to improve the overall system load\n   balancing
    and efficiency. Especially when an edge site is overloaded,\n   other edges with
    service equivalency can dynamically serve the\n   request. This document describes
    a CFN field trial to show the effect\n   that CFN can achieve. Edge to edge interaction
    to get the available\n   computing resources information for services and the
    network status\n   to each other is introduced. Data plane to support late binding
    based\n   dynamic anycast is illustrated too. The field trial shows that CFN\n
    \  can greatly improve the overall query per second served for a service\n   hosted
    on multiple edges in a more balanced way.\n\n\t "

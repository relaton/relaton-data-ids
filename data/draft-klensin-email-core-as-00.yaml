  content: "   Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet applications that is\n
    \  still in very active use.  While the basic protocols and formats for\n   mail
    transport and message formats have evolved slowly over the\n   years, events and
    thinking in more recent years have supplemented\n   those core protocols with
    additional features and suggestions for\n   their use.  This Applicability Statement
    describes the relationship\n   among many of those protocols and provides guidance
    and makes\n   recommendations for the use of features of the core protocols.\n\n\t "

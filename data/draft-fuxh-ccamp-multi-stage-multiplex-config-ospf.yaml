  content: "Multi stages multiplexing configuration requirement is defined in\n[MULTI-STAGES-MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-REQ]
    document.  Multi stages\nmultiplexing configuration framework is diefined in [MULTI-STAGES-\nMULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-FRW]
    document.  They describe some scenarios for\nthe interworking between regions
    with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS and the\nmulti-domain OTN applications based on the
    tunnel design.  Multi\nstages multiplexing is desirable to facilitate the introduction
    of\nnew ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without having to\nupgrade
    every node in the network.  So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped\ninto ODU1/ODU2/ODU3
    and transit across the 2.5G TS region.  Multi\nstages multiplexing/demultiplexing
    are also used to support the\nmulti-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel
    design.  From the\nperspective of Management Plane and Control Plane, they must
    get\nmulti stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability of each gateway\nnodes
    for path computation.  This document describes the OSPF-TE\nextension for multi
    stages multiplexing configuration in G.709\nOptical Transport Network.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies SONAR (Statistical Observation Network for
    Attestation and Reach), a protocol for verifiable multicast delivery claims without
    trusted intermediaries. SONAR combines: (1) O(1) IP multicast efficiency versus
    O(N) unicast to detect cheating, (2) cryptoeconomic accountability via on-chain
    stake deposits, VRF-based unpredictable sampling, and blockchain attestations,
    and (3) ALTA- based real-time multicast authentication. SONAR separates content
    authentication from coverage verification: ALTA authenticates all packets with
    ~6% bandwidth overhead, while statistical coverage verification adds minimal overhead
    (320 KB challenge messages per 15-60 minute test period, 0.7-2.8 Kbps). Coverage
    estimation samples 0.1% of receivers using German Tank Problem inference. For
    privacy and cost efficiency at scale, zkSNARK proof aggregation (recommended for
    &gt;1,000 sampled users) maintains O(1) on-chain verification cost, enabling populations
    exceeding 10^8 receivers.</p>"

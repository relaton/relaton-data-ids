    to pass information to another party.  This memo\nspecifies a Generic Referral
    Object (GRO) to be used in the context\nof referrals.  The proposed object is
    compact and is application-\nindependent.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 schemes are supported,
    as well as\nupper layer identifiers.  Additional information to characterise an\nenclosed
    reference is also described.  To allow proper interpretation\nof referrals, a
    new notion of scope identifiers is introduced.\n\t "

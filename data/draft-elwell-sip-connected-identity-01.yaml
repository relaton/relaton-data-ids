  content: "Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming request, the UAS can have\na
    different identity from that in the To header.  This document\nprovides a means
    for that UA to supply its identity to the peer UA by\nmeans of a request in the
    reverse direction and for that identity to\nbe signed by an authentication service.
    \ The same mechanism can be\nused to indicate a change of identity during a dialog,
    e.g., because\nof some action in a PSTN behind a gateway.\n\nThis work is being
    discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.\n\t "

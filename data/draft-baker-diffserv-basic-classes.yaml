  content: "   This paper summarizes the recommended correlation between service\n
    \  classes and their usage, with references to their corresponding\n   recommended
    Differentiated Service Code Points (DSCP), traffic\n   conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors
    (PHB) and Active Queue Management\n   (AQM) mechanisms. There is no intrinsic
    requirement that particular\n   DSCPs, traffic conditioner PHBs and AQM be used
    for a certain service\n   class, but as a policy it is useful that they be applied
    consistently\n   across the network.\n\t "

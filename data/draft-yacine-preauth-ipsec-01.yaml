  content: "This document describes how to achieve media-independent pre-\nauthentication
    (MPA) in the context of network accesses protected by\nIPsec.  In such environments,
    access is protected by an IPsec tunnel\nmode security association (SA) established
    between a client of the\nnetwork and an access gateway.  This SA normally needs
    to be\nestablished by running an IKE exchange between the two SA endpoints.\nThe
    duration of this IKE exchange make it impractical to use when the\nnode is mobile
    and frequently change either its location or its\naccess gateway during a handover.
    \ In most case it is expected that\nreal time traffic will be impacted by the
    handover.  This note\ndescribes a method that alleviate this issue by leveraging
    on the\nIKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE).  The described\nmethod
    supresses the need to run a full IKE exchange after each\nhandover, thereby greatly
    reducing the impacts of handovers on real-\ntime traffic.\n\t "

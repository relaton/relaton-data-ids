  content: "   Bootstrapping refers to the process of creating state (typically\n
    \  security associations) between two or more entities based on a trust\n   relationship
    between these two or more parties AND a trusted third\n   party.  Some work has
    been done in the area of bootstrapping in the\n   IETF recently.  So far, the
    focus was on creating security\n   associations.  This document aims to attach
    authorization information\n   to the bootstrapping process.\n\t "

  content: "   This document proposes a syntax and semantics as an extension of the\n
    \  Internet Message Format (e-mail message) allowing a Sending User of\n   an
    e-mail message to express his or her preference for how the\n   message content
    is to be handled by the Receiving Users.  For this\n   purpose, semantics of sets
    of different character combinations\n   (\"Privicons\") are described.  These
    can syntactically be integrated\n   either in the first-line of the body, in the
    subject line and/or in a\n   dedicated header of any e-mail message.  The Privicons
    icon set\n   consists of six different icons.  They will be machine-readable.
    \ The\n   Privicons concept is partly borrowing its approach from the concept\n
    \  of emoticons.  For example, to express that the content may be\n   forwarded
    and even be published.  The Sending User could use the\n   Privicon \"[>]\", which
    may be followed by an additional explanations,\n   such as \"please share\".\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path\n   elements
    examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and\n   explicit signals.
    \ For example, TCP's state mechanics uses a series\n   of well-known messages
    that are exchanged in the clear.  Because\n   these are visible to network elements
    on the path between the two\n   nodes setting up the transport connection, they
    are often used as\n   signals by those network elements.  In transports that do
    not\n   exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack\n
    \  those signals.  Often, the removal of those signals is intended by\n   those
    moving the messages to confidential channels.  Where the\n   endpoints desire
    that network elements along the path receive these\n   signals, this document
    recommends explicit signals be used.\n\n\t "

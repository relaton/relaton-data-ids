  content: "   Upon establishing a new link-layer connection, a host determines\n
    \  whether a link change has occurred, that is, whether or not it has\n   moved
    at layer 3 and therefore needs new IP configuration.  This\n   draft presents
    a way to robustly check for link change without\n   assuming any changes to the
    routers.  We choose to uniquely identify\n   each link by the set of prefixes
    assigned to it.  We propose that, at\n   each attached link, the host generates
    the Complete Prefix List, that\n   is, a prefix list containing all the valid
    prefixes on the link, and\n   when it receives a hint that indicates a possible
    link change, it\n   detects the identity of the currently attached link by consulting
    the\n   existing prefix list.  This memo describes how to generate the\n   Complete
    Prefix List and to robustly detect the link identity even in\n   the presence
    of packet loss.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX type
    devices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based Address of Records.
    In doing so it has selected a solution that is not compatible with the solution
    that was specified in ETSI TISPAN and 3GPP for subscription based business trunking.
    The latter solution not only covers E.164 numbers but also handles non-E.164 numbers
    and alphanumeric AOR's. This document defines a extension of the martini mechanism
    that allows it to be used also with ETSI TISPAN and 3GPP standard subscription
    based business trunking arrangements.</p>"

  content: "   This memo suggests a set of requirements for the implementation\n   of
    a protocol in which a messaging system (e.g. email server, \n   voice mail system,
    etc.) submit alerts, which describe \n   potential notification events, regarding
    an end user mailbox status \n   change (e.g. new message has arrived, mailbox
    is full, etc.). \n   These alerts are sent to a notification service, which may,
    \n   in turn, generate an end user alert notification.\n\t "

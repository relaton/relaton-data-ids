  content: "   Currently, most route computing algorithms only compute a shortest
    or\n   an optimal path.The results of this computation just refer to link\n   level,
    without consideration of fibers.  But, in real networks, the\n   link between
    two adjacent nodes always has multi-fibers.  This\n   condition above happens
    more frequently especially for the gateway\n   nodes in the multi-domain network.
    \ Moreover, the number of links\n   between two adjacent domains is always more
    than one.  From the view\n   of parent PCE, the two conditions above will be regarded
    as the\n   problem of multi-fibers between adjacent nodes.  However, most route\n
    \  computing algorithms always can not solve the problem of multi-fiber\n   between
    adjacent nodes.  As a result, parent PCE can not compute the\n   route sequence
    with specific fibers.  It brings distress and problems\n   when parent PCE computing
    the loose route sequence.\n\n   In order to solve the problems existing in real
    networks, an\n   efficient solution will be proposed for parent PCE facing the
    multi-\n   fiber between adjacent nodes.  Some interface and structure will be\n
    \  expanded in this proposal.\n\n\t "

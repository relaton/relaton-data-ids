  content: "This document defines HNEWS (HTTP News Protocol), an HTTP-tunneling\nnews
    protocol.  The NNTP(Network News Transfer Protocol) protocol\ndescribed in RFC
    977 is recast as HTTP CGI (Common Gateway Interface)\nrequests that may be filled
    by any server that supports CGI.  Two new\ncommands are defined for connecting
    and disconnecting from an HNEWS\nserver.  Also, a mechanism for session state
    management is described.\nThis document assumes that you have a working knowledge
    of the Common\nGateway Interface [2] for running executable content on a web server
    and\nsome familiarity with the NNTP news protocol [1].\nA new URL scheme has also
    been specified for HNEWS and is described in\na separate document [5].\n\t "

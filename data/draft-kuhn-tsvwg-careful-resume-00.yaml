  script: Latn
  content: "   This document discusses careful convergence of Congestion Control\n
    \  (CC) in QUIC, providing a cautious method that enables fast startup\n   in
    a wide range of connections : reconnections using previous\n   transport security
    credentials (0-RTT context), reconnections between\n   2 peers (prior knowledge
    of transport context), application-limited\n   traffic.\n\n   The method provides
    QUIC with transport services that resemble those\n   currently available in TCP,
    such as TCP Control Block (TCB) [RFC9040]\n   caching or updates to support application-limited
    traffic.\n\n   The method reuses a set of computed CC parameters that are based
    on\n   the previously observed path characteristics between the the same\n   pair
    of transport endpoints, such as the bottleneck bandwidth,\n   available capacity,
    or the RTT.  These parameters are stored,\n   allowing then to be later used to
    modify the CC behavior of a\n   subsequent connection.  The document also discusses
    assumptions and\n   defines requirements around how a sender utilizes these parameters
    to\n   provide opportunities for a new connection to more quickly get up to\n
    \  speed (i.e. utilize the available capacity).  It discusses how these\n   changes
    impact the capacity at a shared network bottleneck and the\n   safe response that
    is needed after any indication that the new rate\n   is inappropriate.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a communication security\n
    \  protocol that is attractive for use in constrained environments, in\n   which
    it is important to minimize the data expansion added by the\n   security protocol,
    and to support multicast security .  Authenticated\n   Encryption with Replay
    prOtection (AERO) is a cryptographic technique\n   that is well suited for use
    in DTLS, especially in these scenarios:\n   it has minimal data expansion, avoids
    the need to manage implicit\n   state, works well with multiple receivers and
    multiple senders, and\n   provides strong misuse resistance.  This document describes
    how AERO\n   can be used in DTLS.\n\n\t "

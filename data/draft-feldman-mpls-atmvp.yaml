  content: "   The MPLS Architecture [ARCH] discusses the way in which ATM\n   switches
    may be used as Label Switching Routers.  The MPLS ATM VC\n   switching document
    [ATMVC] details the way in which ATM-LSRs are\n   used, specifically in the presence
    of non-merge and VC-merge\n   capable switches.  This document is a companion
    document to\n   [ATMVC]; it extends the ATM procedures for the support of VP-\n
    \  switching on ATM-LSRs.  It is assumed the reader is familiar with\n   the contents
    of [ATMVC].\n\n\t "

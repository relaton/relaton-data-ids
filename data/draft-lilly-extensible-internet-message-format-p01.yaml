  content: "   The Internet Message Format originally formally specified in RFC 561\n
    \  has been extended in some ways and for some purposes which have posed\n   difficulties
    for some desirable operations such as digitally signed\n   messages, have led
    to clutter in message content which in turn has\n   led user agent implementers
    to suppress display of some originator\n   message content, leading in some cases
    to user confusion, surprise,\n   and embarrassment.  This memo is part of a multi-document
    series that\n   specifies an extensible message format which is intended to\n
    \  facilitate operations hampered by extensions to the current format\n   and
    to reduce clutter in the user-to-user message content.  This memo\n   will present
    a brief history of the Internet Message Format\n   evolution, will identify problems
    caused by changes that have been\n   made, and will introduce terminology and
    concepts that will be used\n   in other documents in the series.\n\t "

  content: "IKEv2 is a popular protocol for setting up VPN tunnels from a remote\nlocation
    to a gateway so that the VPN client can access services in\nthe network behind
    the gateway.  Currently there is no standard\nmechanism specified that allows
    an overloaded VPN gateway to re-\ndirect the VPN client to attach to another gateway.
    \ This document\nproposes a re-direct mechanism for IKEv2.  The proposed mechanism
    can\nalso be used for Mobile IPv6 to enable the home agent to re-direct\nthe mobile
    node to another home agent.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the usage of the IP Flow Information \n    Export
    (IPFIX) protocol for the case of exporting and processing \n    per-packet information.
    \ \n    The main idea is to export two types of records per flow: the \n    first
    one contains the usual flow information plus a unique flow \n    identifier while
    the other one consists of the actual per-packet \n    information plus a flow
    identifier that refers to the flow the \n    specific packet belongs to -- that
    means the flow identifier is \n    used to associate the packet data to its corresponding
    flow.\n\t "

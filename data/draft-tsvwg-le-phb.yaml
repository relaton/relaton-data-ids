  content: "   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Lower\n
    \  Effort (LE) per-hop behavior (PHB).  The primary objective of this LE\n   PHB
    is to protect best-effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with\n   the default
    PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when\n   resources become
    scarce, best-effort traffic has precedence over LE\n   traffic and may preempt
    it.  There are numerous uses for this PHB,\n   e.g., for background traffic of
    low precedence, such as bulk data\n   transfers with low priority in time, non
    time-critical backups,\n   larger software updates, web search engines while gathering\n
    \  information from web servers and so on.  This document recommends a\n   standard
    DSCP value for the LE PHB.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document proposes extending NFSv4 operations to enable\n   file
    extended attributes or xattr to be used in the protocol to\n   provide information
    about the data reduction properties of files.\n   New xattrs are proposed to allow
    the client application to\n   communicate to the NFSv4 server data reduction attributes\n
    \  associated with files and directories using opaque metadata, not\n   interpreted
    by the file system, but communicated to the Block\n   Storage data reduction engines.
    Corresponding new file attributes\n   are proposed to allow clients and client
    applications to query the\n   server for data reduction xattr support and allow
    to get and set\n   data reduction xattrs on files and directories. Such data reduction\n
    \  metadata is used as hints to the file server about what type of data\n   reduction
    to apply. The proposed data reduction attributes include\n   achievable ratios
    for compression and deduplication plus whether\n   each data reduction technique
    applies to the file.\n\n\t "

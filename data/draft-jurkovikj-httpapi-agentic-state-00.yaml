  content: "   HTTP resources are frequently exposed in multiple representations\n
    \  (e.g., text/html for rendering and application/json for processing)\n   via
    Content Negotiation.  However, standard HTTP concurrency controls\n   (such as
    ETags) are typically scoped to the byte sequence of a\n   specific representation.
    \ This creates a synchronization gap where a\n   client modifying one representation
    cannot guarantee consistency with\n   the underlying state of another representation,
    leading to race\n   conditions and \"lost updates\" in multi-client environments.\n\n
    \  This document specifies _Agentic State Transfer_ (AST), an HTTP\n   profile
    for managing _Canonical Resource State_ (CRS) across multiple\n   synchronized
    representations of the same resource.  It defines the\n   use of _Semantic Validators_
    (Content Identity) to track the logical\n   state of a resource independent of
    its serialization.  It further\n   mandates the use of Optimistic Concurrency
    Control via If-Match\n   headers for state-changing operations, ensuring that
    mutations\n   applied by automated agents are atomic and consistent across all\n
    \  views.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document provides the mechanism for the autoconfiguration of \nrecursive
    DNS server in mobile node and the optimization of DNS name \nresolution in the
    hierarchical mobile IPv6 network.  Whenever the \nmobile node moves into a new
    MAP domain, the region managed by \nanother MAP, in the hierarchical mobile IPv6
    network, it detects the \naddresses of recursive DNS servers which are placed
    in the region and \nreplaces the old ones with the new ones for DNS name resolution.
    \ \nThis allows the time for DNS name resolution much reduced by using \nthe nearest
    recursive DNS server which exists in the region.  \nTherefore, the mechanism of
    this document can optimize the DNS name \nresolution. \n\t "

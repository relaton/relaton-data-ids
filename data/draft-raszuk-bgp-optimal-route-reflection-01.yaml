abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "[RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)\ncost
    to a given point in the network will vary across routers, \"the\nroute reflection
    approach may not yield the same route selection\nresult as that of the full IBGP
    mesh approach.\"  One practical\nimplication of this assertion is that the deployment
    of route\nreflection may thwart the ability to achieve hot potato routing.  Hot\npotato
    routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest AS egress\npoint in cases where
    no higher priority policy dictates otherwise.\nAs a consequence of the route reflection
    method, the choice of exit\npoint for a route reflector and its clients will be
    the egress point\nclosest to the route reflector - and not necessarily closest
    to the\nRR clients.\n\nSection 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach
    and a set of\nconstraints which, if satsified, would result in the deployment
    of\nroute reflection yielding the same results as the iBGP full mesh\napproach.
    \ Such a deployment approach would make route reflection\ncompatible with the
    application of hot potato routing policy.\n\nAs networks evolved to accommodate
    architectural requirements of new\nservices, tunneled (LSP/IP tunneling) networks
    with centralized route\nreflectors became commonplace.  This is one type of common
    deployment\nwhere it would be impractical to satisfy the constraints described
    in\nSection 11 of [RFC4456].  Yet, in such an environment, hot potato\nrouting
    policy remains desirable.\n\nThis document proposes two new solutions which can
    be deployed to\nfacilitate the application of closest exit point policy centralized\nroute
    reflection deployments.\n\t "

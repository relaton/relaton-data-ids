  content: "In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial\ninformation
    networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network\nperformance criteria (e.g.
    latency) have become (or are becoming) as\n(or more) critical to data path selection
    than other metrics.\n\nThis document describes extensions to the BFD protocol,
    such that\nnetwork performance information can be gathered in a scalable\nfashion,
    and subsequently used (by other protocols) to make path\nselection decisions.
    These extensions will also provide granular\nperformance monitoring information.\n\t "

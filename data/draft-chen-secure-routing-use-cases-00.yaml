abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Traditional path selection conditions include the shortest path, the\n
    \  lowest delay, and the least jitter, this paper proposes to add a new\n   factor:
    security, which determines the forwarding path from security\n   dimension.\n\n
    \  The frequent occurrence of security incidents, users' demand for\n   security
    services is increasingly strong.  As there are many security\n   devices in the
    ISP's network, this draft proposes secure routing, the\n   purpose of secure routing
    is to converge security and routing to\n   ensure the security of the transmission
    process.\n\n   The scope is transmission process security, end-to-end security
    and\n   processing security are out of scope.\n\n\t "

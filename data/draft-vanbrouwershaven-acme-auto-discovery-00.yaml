abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A significant impediment to the widespread adoption of the Automated\n
    \  Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555] is that ACME\n   clients
    need to be pre-configured with the URL of the ACME server to\n   be used.  This
    often leaves domain owners at the mercy of their\n   hosting provider as to which
    Certification Authorities (CAs) can be\n   used.  This specification provides
    a mechanism to bootstrap ACME\n   client configuration from a domain's DNS CAA
    Resource Record\n   [RFC8659], thus giving control of which CA(s) to use back
    to the\n   domain owner.\n\n   Specifically, this document specifies two new extensions
    to the DNS\n   CAA Resource Record: the \"discovery\" and \"priority\" parameters.\n
    \  Additionally, it registers the URI \"/.well-known/acme\" at which all\n   compliant
    ACME servers will host their ACME directory object.  By\n   retrieving instructions
    for the ACME client from the authorized\n   CA(s), this mechanism allows for the
    domain owner to configure\n   multiple CAs in either load-balanced or fallback
    prioritizations\n   which improves user preferences and increases diversity in\n
    \  certificate issuers.\n\n\t "

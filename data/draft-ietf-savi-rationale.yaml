  content: "The IETF working group on Source Address Validation Improvements,\nSAVI,
    is chartered to design methods for IP source address validation\nthat complement
    ingress filtering with finer-grained protection.\nThis document summarizes the
    discussion in the SAVI working group and\ndesign-related conclusions.  The purpose
    of this is two-fold:  First,\nto guide the design process in the working group
    with written\ndocumentation of decisions and their rationale.  Second, to provide
    a\nmeasure for assessing the IP source address validation methods that\nthe working
    group will eventually deliver.\n\t "

  content: "The IDNA is a key issue for the IUCG as a paradigm for the future of\nthe
    Internet. There is therefore a need to make sure its description\ndocument set
    reflects a complete IETF and users consensus. To help\nthis, this memo keeps track
    of the WG-IDNABIS/LC requested and\nreceived answers. The IAB Draft on IDN has
    been added because some\nremarks have been made which are important. The author
    is quoted if\nthe comment is not from IUCG\n\t "

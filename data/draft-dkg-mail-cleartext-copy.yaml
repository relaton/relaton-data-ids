- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   When an e-mail program generates an encrypted message to multiple\n
    \  recipients, it is possible that it has no encryption capability for\n   at
    least one of the recipients.\n\n   In this circumstance, an e-mail program may
    choose to send the\n   message in cleartext to the recipient it cannot encrypt
    to.\n\n   This draft currently offers several possible approaches when such a\n
    \  choice is made by the sender, so that the recipient can reason about\n   and
    act on the cryptographic status of the message responsibly.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo describes the character encoding scheme used in electronic\n
    \   mail, NetNews, and world wide web messages in Japanese networks.  It\n    was
    first specified by and used in JUNET then described in RFC 1468.\n    The name
    of this character encoding scheme was originally known as\n    'JUNET code' and
    is now called 'ISO-2022-JP' when used in the\n    context of MIME.\n \n    In
    ISO-2022-JP text, both one 7-bit byte Latin script (ASCII or JIS\n    X 0201 Latin
    set) and two 7-bit bytes Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana and\n    some other symbols
    and characters (JIS X 0208) are employed.\n    Switching the graphic character
    sets is based on the extension\n    techniques defined in ISO 2022.\n \n    This
    memo eliminates some ambiguities of RFC 1468.  However, it\n    NEVER introduces
    any essential changes against RFC 1468.  Since the\n    character encoding scheme
    is now widely used in Japanese IP\n    communities, backward compatibility is
    most important in this\n    revision.\n \n    This memo revises RFC 1468 on the
    following points:\n\n    1. It is clarified that ISO-2022-JP does NOT conform
    to ISO 2022.\n    2. The formal syntax is divided into two new yet compatible
    rules,\n        namely, ISO-2022-JP decoding syntax and ISO-2022-JP encoding\n
    \       syntax.\n    3. The bit combinations permitted in JIS X 0208 are explicitly\n
    \       described in the syntax so that the invalid character positions\n        will
    be excluded in ISO-2022-JP text.\n    4. Recommended graphic character sets are
    specified.  That is, ASCII\n        is RECOMMENDED rather than JIS X 0201 1976
    Latin set.  ONLY to\n        embed YEN SIGN and OVER LINE, JIS 0201 Latin set
    MAY be used.\n        Also, JIS X 0208 1983 (including 1990) is RECOMMENDED rather\n
    \       than JIS X 0208 1978.\n\t "

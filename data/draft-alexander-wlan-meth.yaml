  content: "This document provides a framework and methodology for performing\n   stress
    testing and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) devices,\n   including clients
    (i.e., host interfaces) and Access Points.  The\n   document defines and discusses
    a number of tests and associated test\n   conditions that may be used to characterize
    the performance of such\n   devices, and also supplies the methods used to calculate
    the results\n   of these tests.  This document also describes specific formats
    for\n   reporting the results of the tests. It extends the methodology\n   defined
    for benchmarking network interconnecting devices in RFC 2544\n   and LAN switches
    in RFC 2889 to IEEE 802.11 WLAN devices.\n\t "

  content: "In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names in\nApplications
    (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from user\ninput were mapped into
    a set of Unicode code points that \"make\nsense\", which were then encoded and
    passed to the domain name system\n(DNS).  The current version of IDNA presumes
    that the input to the\nprotocol comes from a set of \"permitted\" code points,
    which it then\nencodes and passes to the DNS, but does not specify what to do
    with\nthe result of user input.  This document describes the actions that\ncan
    be taken by an implementation between user input and passing\npermitted code points
    to the new IDNA protocol.\n\t "

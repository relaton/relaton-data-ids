  content: "   The proposed path failover mechanism provides a seamless way to\n   recover
    from path failures in Multipath QUIC.  It allows the protocol\n   to take advantage
    of multiple paths while maintaining reliability and\n   security.  The implementation
    and deployment of this mechanism should\n   be done with careful consideration
    of security and performance.\n\n\t "

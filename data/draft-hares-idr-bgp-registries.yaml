  script: Latn
  content: "   The BGP Registries at IANA were set up as one of the earliest IANA\n
    \  registries.  Over time, the registries have become denoted as\n   requiring
    \"standards action\", \"early allocation\", \"FCFS (first-come,\n   first served)\",
    \"vendor specific\", and \"IETF review\".  This draft\n   proposes that certain
    BGP registries that are labelled \"standards\n   action\", \"early allocation\",
    or \"IETF Review\" add to these\n   registration actions a \"Expert Review.  It
    also proposes that the\n   chairs of BGP Protocol related WG groups be part of
    the review team.\n   The intent is that these chairs will be responsible for bringing\n
    \  questionable allocations to their workings attention.\n\n   The BGP relate
    working groups are currently the IDR, BESS, SIDROPS,\n   and GROW, but other working
    groups like SPRING might be added.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The email ecosystem currently lacks a cohesive mechanism through\n
    \  which email senders and receivers can make use of multiple\n   authentication
    protocols in an attempt to establish reliable domain\n   identifiers.  This lack
    of cohesion prevents receivers from providing\n   domain-specific feedback to
    senders regarding the accuracy of\n   authentication deployments.  Inaccurate
    authentication deployments\n   preclude receivers from safely taking deterministic
    action against\n   email that fails authentication checks.  Finally, email senders
    do\n   not have the ability to publish policies specifying actions that\n   should
    be taken against email that fails multiple authentication\n   checks.\n\n   This
    memo presents a proposal for a scalable mechanism by which an\n   organization
    can express, using the Domain Name System, domain-level\n   policies and preferences
    for message validation, disposition, and\n   reporting with predictable and accurate
    results.\n\n   The enclosed proposal is not intended to introduce mechanisms that\n
    \  provide elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email.  The\n   proposal
    presents a mechanism for policy distribution that enables a\n   continuum of increasingly
    strict handling of messages that fail\n   multiple authentication checks, from
    no action, through silent\n   reporting, up to message rejection.\n\n\t "

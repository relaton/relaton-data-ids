  script: Latn
  content: "[RFC 1035 Section 5.1] describes how to encode domain names as character
    strings. It however allows non printable characters to be used. It also allows
    for encodings of text files which would not survive intact ftp ASCII mode transfers,
    different end of line conventions. This document addresses these problems by stating
    where decimal escapes SHOULD be used.  While a applications MUST continue to read
    the full range as expressed by [RFC 1035 5.1]. They SHOULD emit only this selected
    subset.\n\t "

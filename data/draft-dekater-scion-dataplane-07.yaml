  content: "   This document describes the data plane of the path-aware, inter-\n
    \  domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and\n   Isolation
    On Next-generation networks).  One of the basic\n   characteristics of SCION is
    that it gives path control to endpoints.\n   The SCION Control Plane is responsible
    for discovering these paths\n   and making them available as path segments to
    the endpoints.  The\n   role of the SCION Data Plane is to combine the path segments
    into\n   end-to-end paths, and forward data between endpoints according to the\n
    \  specified path.\n\n   The SCION Data Plane fundamentally differs from today's
    IP-based data\n   plane in that it is _path-aware_: In SCION, interdomain forwarding\n
    \  directives are embedded in the packet header.  This document provides\n   a
    detailed specification of the SCION data packet format as well as\n   the structure
    of the SCION header.  SCION also supports extension\n   headers, which are additionally
    described.  The document continues\n   with the life cycle of a SCION packet while
    traversing the SCION\n   Internet, followed by a specification of the SCION path
    authorization\n   mechanisms and the packet processing at routers.\n\n   This
    document contains new approaches to secure path aware\n   networking.  It is not
    an Internet Standard, has not received any\n   formal review of the IETF, nor
    was the work developed through the\n   rough consensus process.  The approaches
    offered in this work are\n   offered to the community for its consideration in
    the further\n   evolution of the Internet.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes the current thinking of the collaborators of\nITU-T
    Question 10/2, 'Management and development of PSTN-based\ntelecommunication services,'
    about service principles when public\ncircuit switched international telecommunication
    networks interwork\nwith IP-based networks. This document contains most of the
    text\n(there has been some rearrangement of the text) from draft new\nRecommendation
    E.370 [1], starting from section 3 of this Internet\nDraft, which was determined
    to be stable at the March 2000 meeting\nof Study Group 2. It may be approved by
    the members of the ITU,\nsubject to written comments received from those members,
    at a\nmeeting of the Study Group (or its successor) in early 2001\n(provisionally
    23-26 January 2001). It is hoped that this document\nwill further the collaborative
    efforts between Study Group 2 and the\nvarious working groups of the IETF.\n\t "

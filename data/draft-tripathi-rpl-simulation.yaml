  content: "This document presents a performance evaluation of RPL in a single\nDAG
    scenario, and comparison of the same with shortest path routing\nin a LLN.  Metrics
    to capture the significant performance aspects are\nidentified and detailed simulations
    are carried out on a set of real-\nlife scenarios.\n\t "

  content: "   There are deployments where the Layer-3 interface on which IGP\n   operates
    is a Layer-2 interface bundle.  Existing IGP advertisements\n   only support advertising
    link attributes of the Layer-3 interface.\n   If entities external to IGP wish
    to control traffic flows on the\n   individual physical links that comprise the
    Layer-2 interface bundle,\n   link attribute information about the bundle members
    is advertised by\n   IGP extensions for Layer-2 (L2) bundle.\n\n   When Segment
    Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is used with Layer-2 interface\n   bundle to control
    traffic flows on the individual member links, the\n   SRv6 SIDs which represent
    the Layer 2 member links of the L2 bundle\n   needs to be advertised in IGP.\n\n
    \  This document proposes the IGP extensions to advertise the SRv6 SIDs\n   of
    the Layer 2 (L2) bundle member links.\n\n\n\t "

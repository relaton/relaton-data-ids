abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the applicability of the Standard Communication
    with Network Elements (SCONE) protocol to IEEE 802.11 based access networks. SCONE
    defines a mechanism by which an on-path network element can provide advisory downlink
    throughput guidance to QUIC endpoints. The SCONE protocol is access agnostic and
    does not assume any specific access technology. In IEEE 802.11 deployments, such
    constraints may be derived at access points or controllers that combine policy
    awareness, with visibility into access network conditions. This document explains
    how existing SCONE roles and throughput advice semantics apply in these deployments
    without assuming any specific IEEE 802.11 MAC or PHY behavior. This document does
    not define new protocol extensions and does not modify SCONE behavior. Its purpose
    is to clarify deployment considerations for IEEE 802.11 environments.</p>"

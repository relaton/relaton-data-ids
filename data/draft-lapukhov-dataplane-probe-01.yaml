  content: "   Detecting and isolating network faults in IP networks has\n   traditionally
    been done using tools like ping and traceroute (see\n   [RFC7276]) or more complex
    systems built on similar concepts of\n   active probing and path tracing.  While
    using active synthetic probes\n   is proven to be helpful in detecting data-plane
    faults, isolating\n   fault location is a much harder problem, especially in diverse\n
    \  networks with multiple active forwarding planes (e.g.  IP and MPLS).\n   Moreover,
    existing end-to-end tools do not generally support\n   functionality beyond dealing
    with packet loss - for example, they are\n   hardly useful for detecting and reporting
    transient (i.e. milli- or\n   even micro-second) network congestion.\n\n   Modern
    network forwarding hardware can allow for more sophisticated\n   data-plane functionality
    that provides substantial improvement to the\n   isolation and identification
    capabilities of network elements.  For\n   example, it has become possible to
    encode a snapshot of a network\n   element's state within the packet payload as
    it transits the device.\n   One example of such state would be queue depth on
    the egress port\n   taken by that specific packet.  When combined with a unique
    device\n   identifier embedded in the same packet, this could allow for precise\n
    \  time and topological identification of the the congested location\n   within
    the network.\n\n   This document proposes a format for requesting and embedding\n
    \  telemetry information in active probes, i.e. packet designated for\n   actively
    testing the network while not carrying application traffic.\n   These active probes
    could be conveyed over multiple protocols (ICMP,\n   UDP, TCP, etc.) and the document
    does not prescribe any particular\n   transport.  In addition, this document provides
    recommendations on\n   handling the active probes by devices that do not support
    the\n   required data-plane functionality.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a reference model for building SDN control\n
    \  plane with multiple controllers. It defines the key components in\n   the model
    and introduces an effective mechanism to balance the load\n   between controllers.
    The design also considers the tradeoff between\n   scalability and performance.\n\n\t "

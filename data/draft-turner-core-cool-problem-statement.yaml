  content: "   A significant part of the next tens of billion of devices that will\n
    \  be connected to the Internet will be constrained devices, connecting\n   over
    constrained networks.  Managing these devices and the networks\n   they form in
    a consistent, scalable, extensible, secure, energy-\n   efficient manner with
    low computational and protocol complexity\n   cannot be done in an ad-hoc manner.
    \ This document outlines the\n   problem at hand and provides a roadmap of the
    possible solutions\n   develped at the IETF.  The description includes the basic
    constrained\n   management problem, as well as properties of the solution.  Details\n
    \  as to the Constrained Objecs Language (CoOL) protocol itself can be\n   found
    in companion documents.\n\n\t "

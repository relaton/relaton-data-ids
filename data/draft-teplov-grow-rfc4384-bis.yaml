  content: "BGP communities [RFC 1997] are 64-bit values that are used to tag\nthe
    originated or traversing prefixes for the different purposes, such as origination
    tagging or policy application purposes. These values can\nbe displayed in a new
    and old format, which notes different\nrepresentation of the same 64-bit value.
    This document defines the way\nof tagging prefixes based upon their geographical
    origination to assist\nin development of geographically-based policies that, ideally,
    will\nresult in RTD (Round Trip Delay) value improvements, as optimized paths\ncan
    be established.\n\t "

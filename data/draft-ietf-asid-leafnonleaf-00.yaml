abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Applications of X.500, LDAP, and similar directory services need to be
    able to efficiently and unambiguously determine if an entry is a leaf entry (no
    entries exist beneath the entry) or a non-leaf entry (entries do exist beneath
    the entry).  While some implementations use proprietary object classes to allow
    directory clients to make the distinction, there is no standard defined.  This
    document defines two object classes that may be used by all implementations to
    allow directory clients to distinguish leaf entries from non-leaf entries.\n\t "

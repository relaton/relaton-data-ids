  content: "       Dual-Stack Lite, combining IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and Carrier Grade
    NAT\n       technologies, provides an approach that offers IPv4 service via IPv6\n
    \      network by sharing IPv4 addresses among customers during IPv6\n       transition
    period. Dual-stack lite, however, requires CGN to maintain\n       active NAT
    sessions, which means processing performance, memory size\n       and log abilities
    for NAT sessions should scale with number of\n       sessions of subscribers;
    Hence increasing in CAPEX for operators\n       would be resulted in when traffic
    increase.\n\n       This document propose the NAT offload extensions to DS-Lite,
    which\n       allows offloading NAT translation function from centralized network\n
    \      side (AFTR) to distributed customer equipments (B4), thereby offering\n
    \      a trade-off between CAPEX (e.g. less performance requirements on AFTR\n
    \      device) and OPEX (e.g., easy and fast deployment of Dual-Stack Lite)\n
    \      for operators. The ability of easily co-deploying with basic Dual-\n       Stack
    Lite is essential to NAT offload extension to DS-Lite.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines a textual convention, ReusableRow, similar to\nthe
    RowStatus and StorageType textual conventions defined in RFC 2579\n[7].  Like
    these two textual conventions, ReusableRow characterizes\nthe conceptual row of
    which it is a part.  It indicates whether, in\nthe course of a cloning activity,
    the row should be duplicated (with,\nobviously, a different index value), or simply
    pointed to by one or\nmore newly cloned objects.  This cloning may involve the
    scripting-\nbased techniques defined under the SNMP Configuration umbrella, but
    it\nneed not: cloning can also be realized with ordinary SNMP Get and Set\noperations.\n\t "

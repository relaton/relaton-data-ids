  content: "   The layer 3 mobility management in a mobile wireless network can be\n
    \  performed with Mobile IPv4.  The solution however requires the mobile\n   nodes
    to have Mobile IPv4 clients.  There may be scenarios where the\n   mobile devices
    do not have Mobile IPv4 clients.  The layer 3 mobility\n   for these devices (often
    called simple IPv4 mobiles) can be done if\n   the network has a Mobile IPv4 client
    function that can perform Mobile\n   IPv4 procedures on behalf of the mobile nodes.
    \ This document defines\n   such a mechanism.\n\t "

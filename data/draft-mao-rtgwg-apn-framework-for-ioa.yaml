  content: "   With the rapid development of large model technologies in the AI\n
    \  field, it has become possible to develop more intelligent assistant\n   software,
    which is currently referred to as AI Agents in the\n   industry.  These agents
    may come from different manufacturers and be\n   deployed on different cloud platforms
    and regions.  They need to\n   communicate and collaborate with each other through
    the Internet,\n   which is called Internet of Agents (IoA).  Different interactions
    of\n   AI agents have varying task requirements, which also lead to\n   different
    demands on the network.  This requires network providing\n   various fine granular
    services for the interactions of AI agents.\n\n   This document proposes the application
    of the APN framework in the\n   IoA scenario and analyzes its necessity.\n\n\t "

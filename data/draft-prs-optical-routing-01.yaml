  script: Latn
  content: "The objective of this draft is to describe mechanisms for exchanging \nrouting
    information between IP routers and optical networks, \nand between optical sub-networks.
    Such information exchange would \nallow automated establishment of end-to-end
    paths in an optical \nnetwork comprising of  multiple sub-networks. Furthermore,
    it would \nallow optical network clients, specifically IP routers, to discover
    \ntheir remote peers dynamically. Determination of reachability could \nbe the
    first step in dynamic provisioning of optical paths using \nsignaling. \n  \n
    \  (A postscript version of this draft with figures is available as\n    draft-optical-routing-00.ps).\n\t "

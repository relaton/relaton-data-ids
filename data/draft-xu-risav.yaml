  content: "   This document presents RISAV, a protocol for establishing and using\n
    \  IPsec security between Autonomous Systems (ASes) using the RPKI\n   identity
    system.  In this protocol, the originating AS adds\n   authenticating information
    to each outgoing packet at its Border\n   Routers (ASBRs), and the receiving AS
    verifies and strips this\n   information at its ASBRs.  Packets that fail validation
    are dropped\n   by the ASBR.  RISAV achieves Source Address Validation among all\n
    \  participating ASes.\n\n\t "

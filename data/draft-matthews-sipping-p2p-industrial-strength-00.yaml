  script: Latn
  content: "   If internet telephony networks based on peer-to-peer and Session \n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) technology are to become as viable as \n   existing
    centralized telephony services, the peer-to-peer SIP \n   technology must offer
    all the features of existing technologies. This \n   draft lists some features
    which are in some way \"challenging\" for \n   peer-to-peer SIP to support, and
    proposes a structure for the \n   resulting protocol suite. \n\t "

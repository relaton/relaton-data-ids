  content: "   This document describes the Kademlia-directed ID-based Routing\n   Architecture
    KIRA.  KIRA offers highly scalable zero-touch IPv6\n   connectivity, i.e., it
    can connect hundred thousands of routers and\n   devices in a single network (without
    requiring any form of hierarchy\n   like areas).  It is self-organizing to achieve
    a zero-touch solution\n   that provides resilient (control plane) IPv6 connectivity
    without\n   requiring any manual configuration by operators.  It works well in\n
    \  various topologies and is loop-free even during convergence.  The\n   architecture
    consists of the ID-based network layer routing protocol\n   R²/Kad in its routing
    tier and a Path-ID-based forwarding tier.  The\n   topological independent IDs
    can be embedded into IPv6 addresses, so\n   that KIRA provides zero-touch IPv6
    connectivity between KIRA nodes.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Society (ISOC)\n
    \  hosted a day-long Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale\n   (CARIS)
    workshop which took place 18 June 2015 in coordination with\n   the Forum for
    Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) Conference\n   in Berlin.  The workshop
    included members of the FIRST community,\n   attack response working group representatives,
    network & security\n   operators, RIR representatives, researchers, vendors, and\n
    \  representatives from standardisation communities.  Key goals of the\n   workshop
    were to improve mutual awareness, understanding, and\n   coordination among the
    diverse participating organizations.  The\n   workshop also aimed to provide greater
    awareness of existing efforts\n   to mitigate specific types of attacks, and greater
    understanding of\n   the options available to collaborate and engage with these
    efforts.\n\n\t "

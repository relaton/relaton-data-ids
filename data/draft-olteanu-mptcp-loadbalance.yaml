  script: Latn
  content: "   Layer 4 loadbalancers are widely used in the deployment of large-\n
    \  scale web services.  A large number of servers accept incoming\n   connections
    from clients, while multiple loadbalancers make sure that\n   traffic is spread
    evenly across the servers.\n\n   Due to its use of multiple subflows, Multipath
    TCP poses several\n   issues to the design of a scalable layer 4 loadbalancer
    that supports\n   it.  This document presents two ways in which MPTCP connections
    can\n   be loadbalanced across a large pool of servers.  Both approaches\n   entail
    using a slightly modified server stack and work well with\n   unmodified MPTCP
    clients.\n\n\t "

  content: "   BGP flow specification (RFC5575) describes the distribution of\n   filters
    and actions that apply when packets are received on a router\n   with the flow
    specification function turned on.  If one considers the\n   reception of the packet
    as an event, then BGP flow specification\n   describes a set of minimalistic Event-Match
    Condition-Action\n   policies.  The initial set of policy (RFC5575 and RFC7674)
    for this\n   policy includes 12 types of match filters encoded in the NLRI for
    two\n   types of SAFIs (IP-only SAFI, 133; VPN SAFI, 134) for IPv4.  The\n   popularity
    of these flow specification filters in deployment for DoS\n   and SDN/NFV has
    led to the requirement for more BGP flow\n   specification match filters in the
    NLRI and more BGP flow\n   specification actions.\n\n   This document provides
    rules for combining new flow specification\n   packet ECA policies which support
    IPv6, L2, nvo03 and MPLS match\n   filters, and new actions.  This document also
    provides rules for the\n   interaction of IDR Flow Specification policy (session
    ephemeral\n   policy) with policy found in I2RS (reboot ephemeral policy), and\n
    \  policy found in ACLs and Policy routing (configuration policy).\n\n\t "

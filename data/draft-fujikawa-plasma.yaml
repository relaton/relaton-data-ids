- language: en

  content: "This document describes PLASMA, which enables a simple multicast mechanism
    and autoconfiguration in an IP subnet consisting of point-to-point links, such
    as ATM, Frame Relay, SONET/SDH, etc.  PLASMA utilizes an L2 label switching mechanism
    and creates data flow paths in a subnet using the PLASMA protocol.  The PLASMA
    protocol is very simply defined and works effectively within a single IP subnet.
    \ PLASMA applications to ATM and PPP are also described.\n\t "

  content: "A number of methods and tools are available for defining the format\nof
    messages used for signalling protocols.  However, many of these\nmethods and tools
    have been designed for purposes other than message\ndefinition, and have been
    adopted on the basis that they are readily\navailable rather than being ideally
    suited to the task.  This often\nmeans that the methods make it difficult to get
    definitions correct,\nor result in unnecessary verbosity both in the definition
    and on the\nwire.\nUMF - the Universal Message Format - has been custom designed
    for the\npurpose of message definition.  It is thus easy to specify messages\nin
    a compact, extensible format that is readily machine manipulated\nto produce a
    compact encoding on the wire.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Virtually every application on the web today that allows a user to\n
    \  log in or manipulate information stored on a server maintains some\n   form
    of state management information.  Usually, the session context\n   is established
    through the use of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\n   parameter or a Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookie that\n   identifies the session.  Without the
    use of Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS), such an information exchange introduces
    a security risk.  For\n   a variety of reasons, TLS may not be desired or preferred
    in all\n   situations and, in those cases, users are left vulnerable.  This\n
    \  memo provides a simple method for enabling secure exchange of state\n   management
    information through HTTP in situations where TLS is not\n   employed.\n\n\t "

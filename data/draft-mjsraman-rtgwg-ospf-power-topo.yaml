abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   In a Interior Gateway Protocol like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)\n
    \  the computation of the Constrained shortest path to destinations is\n   computed
    for an area say a backbone or a non-backbone area using the\n   TE-metrics advertised
    in the area. With importance given to the\n   reduction of power within a network
    it becomes important to provide a\n   solution that reduces the power consumed
    amongst routers and links\n   that make up the network (in this case an area or
    a collection of\n   areas including the backbone and non-backbone areas). This
    proposal\n   aims at providing such a solution by producing a power topology of\n
    \  the area / areas. This power topology is constructed by assigning\n   metrics
    to links based on the power consumed by the linecards (and\n   hence their respective
    ports in an indirect way) of adjacent routers\n   that are interconnected by each
    such link.\n\n\n\n\t "

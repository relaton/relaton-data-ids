  content: "   Currently a path computation is the ability to find the path/s\n   connecting
    two or more points of the network identified with\n   addresses.  The path selection
    can be driven requiring constraints\n   and metric minimization in traversing
    the network.  The computed\n   paths may be used for realizing a network slice
    providing\n   connectivity to applications that shall be able to reach addresses
    of\n   the end-points.\n\n   A cloud native application (CNA) becomes a network
    point only when an\n   instance of it has been deployed in a site fulfilling the\n
    \  requirements for resources, scalability, reliability, security and\n   costs...
    \ The process for identifying where to deploy a CNA is\n   disjoined from path
    computation that is executed in a following step.\n   If the path computation
    cannot satisfy the request not finding a\n   connectivity solution, the chosen
    end-points shall be changed\n   restarting the process from the selection of the
    deployment sites.\n\n   The CNA problem can be generalized to all the cases where
    more end-\n   points can be alternatives for terminating a path.  For example,
    an\n   enterprise site may be attached to the ISP backbone via more nodes in\n
    \  risk diversity belonging to different network segments.  How\n   computing
    the best connectivity in the ISP network including the\n   selection of the best
    placement for the end-points in the enterprise\n   sites?  Where locating end-points
    of overlay network may be managed\n   as well as an application.\n\n\t "

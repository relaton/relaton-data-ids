  content: "   QUIC uses UDP as its transport layer protocol.  Many existing NAT\n
    \  routers rely on observing TCP SYN, ACK, and FIN packets to determine\n   the
    establishment and termination of connections, thereby precisely\n   maintaining
    the lifecycle of NAT mapping entries.  For QUIC, NAT\n   devices can only manage
    mapping entries based on ordinary UDP aging\n   mechanisms, which may cause NAT
    entries for long-lived QUIC\n   connections to be prematurely aged and re-bound,
    resulting in changes\n   to source ports.  This document proposes a solution that
    extends the\n   IP header options field to identify QUIC connections, facilitating\n
    \  NAT devices that do not recognize QUIC to accurately determine the\n   lifecycle
    of QUIC connections and prevent random aging and re-mapping\n   of long-lived
    QUIC connections.\n\n\n\t "

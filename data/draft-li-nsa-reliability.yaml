  content: "   Native Short Address (NSA [I-D.li-6lo-native-short-address]),\n   proposes
    to algorithmically assign short addresses to nodes in a 6lo\n   environment so
    to achieve stateless forwarding, hence, avoiding using\n   a routing protocol.
    \ NSA is more suitable in case of stable and\n   static wireline connectivity,
    in order to avoid renumbering due to\n   topology changes.  Even in such kind
    of scenarios, reliability\n   remains an issue.  This memo tackles specifically
    reliability in NSA\n   deployments, analyzing possible broad solution categories
    to solve\n   the issue.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document explores the issues in the registration of internationalized
    domain names (IDNs).  The basic IDN definition allows a very large number of possible
    characters in domain names, and this richness may lead to serious user confusion
    about similar-looking names.  To avoid this confusion, the IDN registration process
    must impose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations.  This
    document suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to define and
    implement such rules for a broad range of languages, including adaptation of methods
    developed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean domain names.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

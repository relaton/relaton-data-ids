abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The congestion avoidance processes of several transmission capacity\n
    \  sharing TCP flows tend to be synchronized among each other, so that\n   the
    rate variations of the individual flows do not compensate. In\n   contrary, they
    accumulate into large variations of the whole\n   aggregate. The effect is known
    as global synchronization. Large\n   queuing buffer demand and large latency and
    jitter are the\n   consequences. Global Synchronization Protection (GSP) is an
    extension\n   of regular tail drop packet queuing schemes that prevents global\n
    \  synchronization. For large traffic aggregates the de-correlation\n   between
    the individual flow variations reduces buffer demand and\n   packet sojourn time
    by an order of magnitude and more. Even though\n   quite simple, the solution
    has a theoretical background and is not\n   heuristic. It has been tested with
    a Linux kernel implementation and\n   shows equivalent performance as other relevant
    AQM schemes.\n\n\t "

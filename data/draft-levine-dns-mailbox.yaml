- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Many applications would like to store per-mailbox information\n   securely
    in the DNS.  Mapping mailbox local-parts into the DNS is a\n   difficult problem,
    due to the fuzzy matching that most mail systems\n   do, and the DNS design that
    only does exact matching.  We propose\n   several experimental approaches that
    attempt to implement the\n   required fuzzy matching through DNS queries.\n\n\t "

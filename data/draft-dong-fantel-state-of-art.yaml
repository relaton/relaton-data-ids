  content: "   This document provides an overview of routing technologies that\n   address
    the needs of traffic engineering and load balancing, with a\n   focus on fast
    notification for example in adaptive or perceptive\n   routing.  As the scale
    and complexity of networks grow, these\n   technologies are becoming increasingly
    important when fault tolerance\n   and rapid convergence are critical.  This document
    explores existing\n   solutions from both the IETF and the broader industry, highlighting\n
    \  their applicability to various use cases, including AI workloads and\n   general
    services that demand low-latency, fault recovery, and dynamic\n   load distribution
    across data center networks and inter data center.\n   It also offers suggestions
    for potential IETF initiatives to further\n   develop and standardize these techniques.\n\n\t "

  content: "Growth in the Internet has made us aware of the need for improved authentication
    of routing information.  OSPF provides two authentication mechanisms for use in
    an area: 'No Authentication' and 'Simple Password'.  Both are vulnerable to passive
    attacks currently widespread in the Internet.  Well-understood security issues
    exist in routing protocols [4].  Clear text passwords, currently specified for
    use with OSPF, are no longer considered sufficient [5].                                          If
    authentication is disabled, then only simple misconfigurations are detected.  Simple
    passwords transmitted in the clear will further protect against the honest neighbor,
    but are useless in the general case.  By simply capturing information on the wire
    - straightforward even in a remote environment - a hostile process can learn the
    password and overcome the network.\n\t "

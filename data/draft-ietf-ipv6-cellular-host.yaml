  content: "As the deployment of second and third generation cellular networks \nprogresses,
    a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to \nthe Internet. Standardization
    organizations are making IPv6 \nmandatory in their specifications. However, the
    concept of IPv6 \ncovers many aspects and numerous specifications. In addition,
    the \ncharacteristics of cellular links in terms of bandwidth, cost and \ndelay
    put special requirements on how IPv6 is used. This document \nconsiders IPv6 for
    cellular hosts that attach to the General Packet \nRadio Service (GPRS), or Universal
    Mobile Telecommunications System \n(UMTS) networks. The document lists basic components
    of IPv6 \nfunctionality and discusses some issues relating to the use of these
    \ncomponents when operating in these networks.\n\t "

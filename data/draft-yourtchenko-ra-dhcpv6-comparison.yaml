  content: "   This document attempts to make a balanced comparison between the RA-\n
    \  based and DHCPv6-based host configuration mechanisms.  It compares\n   the
    two on different aspects, e.g: underlying media assumptions,\n   coordination,
    locality, etc.  and highlights the strong and weak\n   sides of both protocols
    for each scenario.\n\n\t "

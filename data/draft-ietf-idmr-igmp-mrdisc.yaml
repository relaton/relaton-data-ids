  content: "The concept of IGMP snooping requires the ability to identify the \nlocation
    of multicast routers.  Since IGMP (and MLD) snooping is not \nstandardized, there
    are many mechanisms in use to identify the \nmulticast routers.  However, this
    scenario can lead to \ninteroperability issues between multicast routers and layer-2
    \nswitches from different vendors. \nThis document introduces a general mechanism
    that allows for the \ndiscovery of multicast routers.  By introducing these new
    messages, \nsnooping devices have a uniform means of identifying multicast \nrouters
    without dependency on particular routing protocols.  These \nmessages may also
    be used to convey configuration parameters to all \nsystems on a network.  In
    addition, other devices that may need to \ndiscover multicast routers can utilize
    these messages.\n\t "

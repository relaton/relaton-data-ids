  content: "   Agent application will be surely the common trend for a long time in\n
    \  future, while agent protocols are so popular that more and more\n   protocols
    are being worked out.  The telecommunication industry plays\n   a pivotal role
    in the Agent ecosystem.  The overall technology\n   success hinges on how telecommunication
    industry could adopt the\n   latest AI trends in order to handle its specific
    usage scenarios and\n   performance requirements, e.g., in the coming 6G era.
    \ This document\n   will provide the first attempt to analyze the agent protocol\n
    \  requirements and relevant enabling technologies based on mobile\n   communication
    system specific characteristics.\n\n\t "

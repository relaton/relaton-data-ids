  content: "   The DKIM base protocol has offers two digital signature\n   canonicalization
    (cl4n) methods called \"relaxed\" and \"simple\" with\n   low reliability and
    survivability during in-transient operations.\n   This proposal describes a new
    STRIP canonicalization algorithm and\n   method to increase the reliability and
    survivability of the digital\n   signature.  In additional, the proposal describe
    new original body\n   hashing requirements to help secure STRIP c14n security
    concerns\n   found in a similar but deprecated NOFWS c14n method.\n\n\t "

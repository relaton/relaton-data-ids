  content: "   This note describes mechanisms for address selection in hosts within\n
    \  a multihomed site.  The goal of these mechanisms is to allow hosts\n   within
    the multihomed site to establish new communications after an\n   outage.  The
    presented mechanisms are not by themselves a complete\n   multihoming solution
    but rather a component of such solution.\n\t "

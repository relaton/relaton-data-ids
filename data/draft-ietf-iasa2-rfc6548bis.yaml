  content: "This document describes the function and responsibilities of the RFC Independent
    Submission Editor (ISE). The Independent Submission stream is one of the stream
    producers that create draft RFCs, with the ISE as its stream approver. The ISE
    is overall responsible for activities within the Independent Submission stream,
    working with draft editors and reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production
    Center and Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor (RSE). The ISE is appointed by
    the IAB, and also interacts with the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company
    (LLC).\n\n This version obsoletes RFC 6548 to replace all references to the Internet
    Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and related structures with those defined
    by the IASA 2.0 structure.\n\t "

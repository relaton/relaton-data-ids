  content: "This document proposes a 'Record Route for IPv6 (RR6)' mechanism.  It\nis
    composed of one new IPv6 hop-by-hop option (RR6 option) extension.\nThe RR6 mechanism
    is redesigned to establish an optimized record\nroute mechanism for IPv6. Two
    types of new features are introduced.\n1. In order to prevent scalability problems
    and to make the mechanism\nflexible, the beginning and ending points of the data
    recording range\nare controlled by using their specifiers.\n2. In order to record
    long IPv6 addresses efficiently, a simple\naddress compression method is introduced.
    Since the compression is\nachieved by utilizing characteristics of recorded IPv6
    addresses\neffectively, the mechanism is efficient and optimized for IPv6.\n\n\t "

  content: "   With the development of AI(Artificial Intelligence) technology, large\n
    \  model have shown significant advantages and great potential in\n   recognition,
    understanding, decision-making, and generation, and can\n   well match the self-intelligent
    network management requirements for\n   the goal of autonomous network or Intent-based
    Networking, and can be\n   used as one of the potential driving technologies to
    drive high-level\n   autonomous networks.  When introducing AI for network management,
    how\n   to integrate AI technology and deal with the relationship with the\n   existing
    network management entity (such as network controller) is\n   the focus of research
    and standardization.\n\n   This document presents the concept of AI based network
    management\n   agent(NMA), provides the basic definition and reference architecture\n
    \  of NMA, discusses the relationship of NMA with traditional network\n   controller
    or other network management entity by exploring the\n   delpoyment mode of NMA,
    and proposes the comman processing flow and\n   typical application scenarios
    of NMA.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations\n
    \  associated with pervasive surveillance.  Some of the reported attacks\n   involved
    compromising smart cards, such as attacking SIM card\n   manufacturers and operators
    in an effort to compromise shared secrets\n   stored on these cards.  Since the
    publication of those reports,\n   manufacturing and provisioning processes have
    gained much scrutiny\n   and have improved.  However, the danger of resourceful
    attackers for\n   these systems is still a concern.\n\n   This specification is
    an optional extension to the EAP-AKA'\n   authentication method which was defined
    in RFC 5448.  The extension\n   provides Perfect Forward Secrecy for the session
    key generated as a\n   part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.  This prevents
    an\n   attacker who has gained access to the long-term pre-shared secret in\n
    \  a SIM card from merely passively eavesdropping the EAP-AKA' exchanges\n   and
    deriving associated session keys, forcing attackers to use active\n   attacks
    instead.\n\n\t "

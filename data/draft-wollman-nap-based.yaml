  content: "This document describes NAP-based addressing, a scheme for abstracting
    and encoding hierarchical addresses in a name service in such a way as to allow
    the entities responsible for various levels in an address to change  their portions
    independently and scaleably.   As a byproduct, it also defines a particular addressing
    scheme which the author believes to be  appropriate for the existing model of
    Internet connectivity.\n\t "

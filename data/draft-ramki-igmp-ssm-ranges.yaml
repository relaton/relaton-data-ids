  content: "   In an IGMP snooping multicast network with version 3 (v3) enabled on\n
    \  the routers, when a v2 join/leave is received for a multicast group\n   the
    router operates on V2 compatible mode.  For SSM ranges a (*,G)v2\n   or v3 report
    should be ignored by the router/switch.  The IGMP\n   snooping switches may not
    have knowledge about the user configured\n   SSM range in the network to correctly
    discard/ignore the v2 join/\n   leave.  Accepting (*,G) v2 or v3 will cause SSM
    operations to fail.\n   This draft discusses distribution of SSM ranges in the
    L2 multicast\n   network so that L2 snooping switches can learn about the configured\n
    \  SSM ranges and discard any (*,G) v2/v3 reports for the said ranges.\n\n\t "

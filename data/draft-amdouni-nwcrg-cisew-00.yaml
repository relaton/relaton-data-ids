  content: "   This document details an online coding method for network coding\n
    \  called CISEW: Coding Interval-based Sliding Encoding Window.  The\n   method
    is proposed as a building block that could be integrated in a\n   complete network
    coding protocol.  This building block is responsible\n   of:\n\n      - decoding:
    maintaining and decoding of the set of received coded\n      payloads,\n\n      -
    recoding: selecting the content of generated coded payloads,\n\n      - signaling:
    allowing for nodes to collect the information on the\n      state of their neighbors.\n\n
    \  CISEW is based on a sliding window method; it generates coded\n   payloads
    using only a small subset of original payloads.  This allows\n   for some real-time
    decoding (online decoding).  CISEW is a overhaul\n   and redesign of a similar
    method called SEW, part of the previously\n   proposed protocol DRAGONCAST.  CISEW
    refines the signaling and\n   algorithms of SEW, and makes them more general.
    \ CISEW offers a\n   general framework for online network coding, with associated\n
    \  signaling.  From this framework, several online coding policies can\n   be
    implemented.\n\n\t "

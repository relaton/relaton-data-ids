  content: "While the current GMPLS WSON formalism can deal with many types of \nwavelength
    switching systems there is a desire to extend this control \nplane to include
    other common optical or hybrid electro optical \nsystems such as OEO switches,
    regenerators, and wavelength \nconverters.\n\n\nThis document provides a WSON
    signal definition and characterization \nbased on ITU-T interface and signal class
    standards and describes the \nsignal compatibility constraints of this extended
    set of network \nelements. The signal characterization and network element \ncompatibility
    constraints enable GMPLS routing and signaling to \ncontrol these devices and
    PCE to compute optical light-paths subject \nto signal compatibility attributes.\n\t "

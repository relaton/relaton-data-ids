  content: "   This document describes an extension used to convey information about\n
    \  media frames, that is used for specific handling by network nodes,\n   including
    error recovery and congestion handling.  These functions\n   can be critical to
    improve energy efficiency and network capacity in\n   some (especially wireless)
    networks.  Due to the end-to-end\n   encryption performed in MOQ, MOQ relays are
    expected to implement\n   these functions, and unencrypted metadata will be exposed
    to MOQ\n   relays.  Since we are in the early stages of MOQ protocol design,\n
    \  this document initially proposes base protocol requirements.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>In some inter-AS and inter-area deployment scenarios for LSP Ping and
    Traceroute, a replying LSR may not have the available route to the initiator,
    and the Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded resulting
    in false negatives or complete failure of operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute.
    This document describes extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying
    LSR to have the capability to relay the echo response by a set of routable intermediate
    nodes to the initiator during the traceroute process in inter-AS and inter-area
    scenarios.</p>"

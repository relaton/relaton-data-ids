  script: Latn
  content: "The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of\n
    \  IPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4.  Nodes\n   will
    be able to be deployed with IPv6 addresses, but will still need\n   to communicate
    with IPv4 nodes that do not have a dual IP layer\n   supporting both IPv4 and
    IPv6.  This specification defines a\n   mechanism called No Network Address Translation
    (NNAT), which will\n   assign an IPv6 node a temporary IPv4 address, which can
    be used to\n   communicate with a node that supports only IPv4.\n\t "

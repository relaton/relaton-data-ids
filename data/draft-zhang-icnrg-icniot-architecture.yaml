  content: "   The Internet of Things (IoT) technology promises to connect billions\n
    \  of objects to Internet.  Today, the IoT landscape is very fragmented\n   from
    both the technology and service perspectives.  As a consequence,\n   it is difficult
    to integrate and cross-correlate data coming from the\n   heterogeneous contexts
    and build value-added services on top.  This\n   reason has motivated the current
    trend to develop a unified de-\n   fragmented IoT architecture so that objects
    can be made accessible to\n   applications across organizations and domains.  Several
    proposals\n   have been made to build a unified IoT architecture as an overlay
    on\n   top of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions, however, inherit\n   the
    existing limitations of the IP protocol: mobility, security,\n   scalability,
    and communication reliability.  To address this problem,\n   A unified IoT architecture
    based on the Information Centric\n   Networking (ICN) architecture, which we call
    ICN-IoT [1] has been\n   proposed.  ICN-IoT leverages the salient features of
    ICN, and thus\n   provides seamless device-to-device (D2D) communication, mobility\n
    \  support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery.\n   Furthermore,
    in order to guarantee the real diffusion of ICN-IoT\n   architecture it is fundamental
    to deal with self-configuring features\n   such as device onboarinding and discovery,
    service discovery,\n   scalability, security and privacy requirements, content\n
    \  dissemmination since the IoT system will comprise of diverse\n   applications
    with heterogenous requirements including connectivity,\n   resource constraints
    and mobility.  Towards this, the draft\n   elaborates on a set of middleware functions
    to enable large operation\n   of an ICN-IoT deployment.\n\n   This draft begins
    by motivating the need for an unified ICN-IoT\n   architecture to connect heterogeneous
    IoT systems.  We then propose\n   an ICN-IoT system architecture and middleware
    components which\n   includes device/network-service discovery, naming service,
    IoT\n   service discovery, data discovery, user registration, and content\n   delivery.
    \ For all of these components, discussions for secure\n   solutions are offered.
    \ We also provide discussions on inter-\n   connecting heterogeneous ICN-IoT domains.\n\n\t "

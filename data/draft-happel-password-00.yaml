  content: "User security has been compromised at many visited web sites due\nto the
    wide variety of password construction requirements being\npresented to Internet
    users. One single, flexible, password\nconstruction requirement accepted throughout
    the global Internet\ncommunity would promote web site user security by establishing
    a\nconstruct, wherein any user established password would be\nuniversally acceptable
    to any web site contacted.\n\t "

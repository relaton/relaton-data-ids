  content: "This specification defines a multicast routing algorithm efficient for\nmulticast
    \ groups  that are densely distributed across a network. This\nprotocol does not
    have a topology discovery mechanism often used by  a\nunicast  routing protocol.
    It employes the same packet formats sparse-\nmode PIM [PIMSM] uses. This protocol
    is  called  dense-mode  PIM.  The\nfoundation of this design was largely built
    on Deering's early work on\nIP multicast routing [Deering91].\n\t "

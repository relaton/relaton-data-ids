  content: "   The DHKEM Algorithm is a one-pass (store-and-forward) mechanism for\n
    \  establishing keying data to a recipient using the recipient's Diffie-\n   Hellman
    or elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman public key.  This document\n   defines a mechanism
    to wrap Ephemeral-Static (E-S) Diffie-Hellman\n   (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    (ECDH) such that it can be\n   used in KEM interfaces within the Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS).\n   This is a sister document to RSA-KEM [RFC5990] and simplifies
    future\n   cryptographic protocol design by only needing to handle KEMs at the\n
    \  protocol level.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In this draft, we propose some protocol requirements for mobility \n
    \  in LowPAN networks within the context of the IETF LowPAN working \n   group
    (IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4). To achieve mobility in LowPAN \n   networks, there
    may be inter-domain movement of network elements \n   across different LowPAN
    domains or across domains that do not \n   comprise LowPAN autonomous systems.
    To address routing issues in\n   inter-domain LowPAN networks that conform to
    fitting within a \n   single IEEE 802.15.4 frame, there are needs for collaborative
    \n   and distributed methodologies for route computation, information \n   storage
    and retrieval, and security issues in protocols targeted\n   to LowPAN mobility.
    \n\n   This draft proposes some requirements of mobility in LowPAN \n   protocols
    from the perspective of protocol-independent metrics,\n   algorithm complexities,
    scalability and security criteria. \n\t "

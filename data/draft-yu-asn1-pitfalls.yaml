- language: en

  content: "A number of IETF protocols make use of Abstract Syntax Notation One\n(ASN.1),
    which is a very complex language for describing abstract\ntypes and values, in
    addition to several sets of encoding rules for\nthose types and values.  Some
    of these uses of ASN.1, particularly\nthe Kerberos protocol [RFC1510] pose implementation
    problems.  This\ndocument analyzes some of the likely problems associated with
    the use\nof ASN.1 in IETF protocols, and some possible reasons for these\nproblems.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a Merkle-tree-based approach that can act as
    an\n   audit-layer detection mechanism to identify a malicious hub,\n   responsible
    for interoperable group communication between various\n   messaging platforms.
    \ The proposed approach is based on the MIMI\n   protocol, which uses a central
    hub for timestamping and broadcasting\n   messages to clients operating on different
    platforms.  Even though\n   all MLS ciphertexts are end-to-end encrypted, they
    are routed through\n   the hub, making it a lucrative attack surface for message
    reordering\n   attacks.  To detect such attacks, the proposed approach suggests\n
    \  creating Merkle proofs of messages and timestamps on the client-side,\n   which
    can subsequently be broadcast to other clients for verification\n   with local
    Merkle proofs.  The broadcast messages are encrypted too\n   and are sent probabilistically
    to avoid being dropped by the hub.  If\n   any of the proofs do not match, an
    alert is broadcast to the room,\n   indicating a malicious hub.  The approach
    has minimal communication\n   overhead for practical purposes.\n\n\t "

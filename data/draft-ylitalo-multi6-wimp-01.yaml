  content: "   Weak Identifier Multihoming Protocol Framework (WIMP-F) is a wedge\n
    \  layer 3.5 framework to be applied with different kind of routable\n   application
    layer identifiers (AIDs) and layer 3.5 context\n   identifiers (CIDs) presented
    in Group-F.  WIMP-F consists of context\n   establishment and re-addressing exchanges
    that are protected with\n   one-way hash chains and a technique called as secret
    splitting.  The\n   hash chain protects a host from re-direction attacks, but
    not\n   directly from an CID or AID theft.  The ownerships can be provided in\n
    \  variable ways presented in other Multi6 drafts.\n\t "

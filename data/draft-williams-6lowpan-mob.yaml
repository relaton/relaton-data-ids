  content: "There has been discussion recently within the 6LoWPAN community\nregarding
    mobile usage scenarios.  Mobility considerations is\nrequired for the deployment
    of SmartGrids.  The mobility analysis for\nSmartGrid and 6lowpan deployment is
    required to ensure proper\nperformance for the mobile usage cases.  Also, mobility
    in 6LoWPAN\nsensor networks may present unique challenges to the 6LoWPAN\narchitecture.
    \ Hence it is best to have mobility as a consideration\nupfront rather than an
    after thought in the development of 6LoWPAN\nmilestones.  This document provides
    a mobility perspective to the\n6LoWPAN sensor network architecture.\n\t "

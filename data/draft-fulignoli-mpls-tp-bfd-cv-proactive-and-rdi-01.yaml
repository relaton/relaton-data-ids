- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Several documents on BFD based OAM for MPLS-TP has been put \n   forward
    and the dependencies between those drafts are not yet \n   fully sorted out; this
    document is one of these drafts. It is \n   published in now to make ideas, motivations
    and approaches \n   available. However we expect the final BFD based solution
    for \n   MPLS-TP will be a cooperation of the parties between the \n   existing
    drafts and that the BFD based OAM solution for MPLS-TP \n   will merge into an
    agreed set of drafts approved by the MEAD \n   team.  \n\n   This document specifies
    the BFD extension and behaviour to meet \n   the requirements for MPLS-TP proactive
    Continuity Check and \n   Connectivity Verification functionality and the RDI
    \n   functionality as defined in [3].\n\t "

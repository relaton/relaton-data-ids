  content: "   This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code.  This\n
    \  response code enables calling parties to learn their call was\n   rejected
    by an intermediary and will not be answered.  As a 6xx code,\n   the caller will
    be aware that future attempts to contact the same UAS\n   will be likely to fail.
    \ The present use case driving the need for\n   the 608 response code is when
    the intermediary is an analytics\n   engine.  In this case, the rejection is by
    a machine or other\n   process.  This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response
    code,\n   which a human at the target UAS indicated the call was not wanted.\n
    \  In some jurisdictions this distinction is important.  This document\n   defines
    the use of the Call-Info header in 608 responses to enable\n   rejected callers
    to contact entities that blocked their calls in\n   error.\n\n\t "

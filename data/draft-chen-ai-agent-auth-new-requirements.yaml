abstract:
- content: "<p>AI Agents are rapidly evolving from academic concepts into the core
    engines driving next-generation applications. However, their autonomy, dynamic
    nature, and complex delegation relationships pose a fundamental challenge to our
    existing authentication and authorization frameworks, which were designed for
    human users and traditional software. This document dissects the novel characteristics
    of AI Agents and outlines the new requirements for authentication and authorization
    which can manage dynamic behavior rather than verifying static identity.</p>"

  content: "   AI Agents are rapidly evolving from academic concepts into the core\n
    \  engines driving next-generation applications.  However, their\n   autonomy,
    dynamic nature, and complex delegation relationships pose a\n   fundamental challenge
    to our existing authentication and\n   authorization frameworks, which were designed
    for human users and\n   traditional software.  This document dissects the novel\n
    \  characteristics of AI Agents and outlines the new requirements for\n   authentication
    and authorization which can manage dynamic behavior\n   rather than verifying
    static identity.\n\n\t "

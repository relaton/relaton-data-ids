  content: "Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) provides a method
    to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS.  Because of Unicode
    decisions, appearance, language and writing system conventions, and historical
    reasons, it often has been asserted that there is more than one way to write what
    competent readers and writers think of as the same host name; these different
    ways of writing are often called \"variants\". (The authors note that there are
    many conflicting definitions for the term \"variant\" in the IDNA community.)
    This document surveys the approaches that top-level domains have taken to the
    registration and provisioning of domain names that have variants.  This document
    is not a product of the IETF, does not propose any method to make variants work
    \"correctly\", and is not an introduction to internationalization or IDNA.\n\t "

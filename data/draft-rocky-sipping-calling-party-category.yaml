  content: "   SS7 ISUP [3] defines a Calling Party's Category (CPC) parameter that
    \n   characterizes the station used to originate a call and carries other \n   important
    state that can describe the originating party. Based on the \n   CPC parameter
    from the calling network, the called network can do \n   some special processes
    related to the calling party category, just \n   like override the calee's DND
    and some other barring services. \n\n   This document specifies a way to deliver
    the calling party category \n   to implement some supplementary services derived
    from the PSTN \n   network. \n\t "

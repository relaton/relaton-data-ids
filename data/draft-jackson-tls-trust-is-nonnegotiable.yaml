  content: "   This document considers proposals to enable the negotiation of trust\n
    \  anchors in TLS.  It makes three basic arguments: that trust\n   negotiation
    is not helpful in addressing the problems it claims to\n   address, that trust
    negotiation instead comes with material harms to\n   the critical trust infrastructure
    of the Internet, and that the\n   proposed mechanisms for deploying trust negotiation
    are unworkable.\n   This draft goes on to discuss simpler and more effective solutions
    to\n   these problems.\n\n\t "

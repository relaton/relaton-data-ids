  content: "   The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) defines mechanisms for\n   extensibility.
    \ The mechanisms provided are for Attribute-Value\n   Pair (AVP) fields received
    in control messages to be set as\n   Mandatory or not.  This document specifies
    a mechanism whereby an\n   L2TP implementation can signal its support of the set
    of L2TP\n   extensions that it supports.  This then allows the L2TP\n   implementations
    to use extensions such as L2TP message types not\n   defined in [1], the presence
    of existing AVPs in messages they are\n   not currently defined to be in, and
    the definition of new AVPs that\n   can be marked as Mandatory, beyond those defined
    in [1].\n\n\t "

  content: "   Network operators are facing the challenge of providing better\n   network
    services for users.  As the ever-developing 5G and industrial\n   verticals evolve,
    more and more services that have diverse network\n   requirements such as ultra-low
    latency and high reliability are\n   emerging, and therefore differentiated service
    treatment is desired\n   by users.  On the other hand, as network technologies
    such as\n   Hierarchical QoS (H-QoS), SR Policy, and Network Slicing keep\n   evolving,
    the network has the capability to provide more fine-\n   granularity differentiated
    services.  However, network operators are\n   typically unaware of the applications
    that are traversing their\n   network infrastructure, which means that not very
    effective\n   differentiated service treatment can be provided to the traffic\n
    \  flows.  As network technologies evolve including deployments of IPv6,\n   SRv6,
    Segment Routing over MPLS dataplane, the programmability\n   provided by IPv6
    and Segment Routing can be augmented by conveying\n   application related information
    into the network satisfying the fine-\n   granularity requirements.\n\n   This
    document analyzes the existing problems caused by lack of\n   service awareness,
    and outlines various use cases that could benefit\n   from an Application-aware
    Networking (APN) framework.\n\n\t "

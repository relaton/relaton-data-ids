  content: "This document's goal is to organize the discussion of a potential 'Internet\nScale
    Event Notification Service' (ISENS) working group effort by defining a\nmodel
    of Event Notification Service (ENS), identifying a taxonomy of design\nchoices
    and their tradeoffs, sketching some usage scenarios, and briefly\nevaluating a
    host of candidate solutions, old and new.\n \n[NOTE: this edition is largely unchanged
    from an August 13th, 1998 draft\npresented at the Chicago NOTIFY BOF.]\n\n\t "

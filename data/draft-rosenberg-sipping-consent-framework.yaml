  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports communications across\n
    \  many media types, including real-time audio, video, text, instant\n   messaging,
    and presence. In its current form, it allows session\n   invitations, instant
    messages, and other requests to be delivered\n   from one party to another without
    requiring explicit consent of the\n   recipient. Without such consent, it is possible
    for SIP to be used\n   for malicious purposes, including spam and denial-of-service
    attacks.\n   This document identifies a framework for consent-based communications\n
    \  in SIP.\n\t "

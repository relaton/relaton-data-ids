  content: "Mobility access through IPv4 and IPv6 provides seamless services for \n
    \ the user terminals across different access networks. To provide \n  seamless
    continuity while the mobile is moving from one access \n  networks to another
    is provided by different mechanisms, on the whole \n  the proposed mechanisms
    provides mobility with special requirements \n  access mechanism. The foremost
    popular of the mobility mechanisms is \n  provided by Charles Perkins in mobile
    IPv4 IETF RFC 2002. There are \n  some of the issues that MIP doesn't provide
    as a total mobility \n  solution. The Proxy MIP is a mobility mechanism to ensure
    mobility \n  management of the user terminal in different access networks. This
    \n  method provides the network based mobility management without any \n  client
    interactions. By this method the signaling overhead and the \n  latency during
    the handover and roaming is reduced. In this proposed \n  mechanism the mobile
    node doesn't need to have support for the \n  mobility instead the access network
    provide the mobility for the user \n  terminal. \n\n  Even though the proxy mobile
    IPv4 provides the mobility management \n  there are some of the issues that have
    to be solved for the network \n  controlled mobility management. In this proposed
    draft we proposed \n  new mechanism using proxy mobile IP with the mobility extensions
    \n  provided by the AAA server at the time of authentication and \n  authorizing
    a user terminal. Later in the draft we discuss the novel \n  architecture and
    packet format for PMIP interactions with AAA of the \n  access networks.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A recursive DNS server generally uses random port numbers to send\n
    \  outbound requests to protect against DNS spoofing attacks.  Due to\n   the
    limitation of operation system, a process typically can only open\n   numerable
    file descriptors simultaneously.  This limit reduces\n   recursion performance
    of resolvers.  This draft offers an approach to\n   improve both recursion performance
    and security for recursive\n   servers.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document briefly examines what is known about the effects of the\nBGP
    MRAI timer, particularly on convergence.  It highlights published\nwork which
    suggests the MRAI interval as deployed has an adverse\neffect on the convergence
    time of BGP.\n\nIt then recommends revised, lower default values for the MRAI
    timer,\nthought to be more suited to today's Internet environment.\n\t "

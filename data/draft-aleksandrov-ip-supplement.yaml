  content: "The Real Time Network Service (RTNS) is a process of data transfer \n
    \  (with real time characteristics) between two end systems. It is part \n   of
    the OSI model of the Network layer. It is not a separate protocol, \n   but rather
    an additional service, of which applications, exchanging \n   data in real time,
    can take advantage. In the current document this \n   service is defined as an
    option of the Internet Protocol.\n\t "

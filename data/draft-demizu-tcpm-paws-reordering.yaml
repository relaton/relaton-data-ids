- language: en

  content: "   The purpose of PAWS (Protect Against Wrapped Sequence numbers),\n   defined
    in RFC1323, is to protect a TCP connection against old\n   duplicate segments
    from the same connection.  There is a possibility,\n   however, that PAWS may
    discard valid reordered segments.  This memo\n   proposes a modification to PAWS
    to solve this problem.\n\t "

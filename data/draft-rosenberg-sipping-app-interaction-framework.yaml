  content: "This document describes a framework and requirements for the\ninteraction
    between users and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based\napplications. By interacting
    with applications, users can guide the\nway in which they operate. The focus of
    this framework is stimulus\nsignaling, which allows a user agent to interact with
    an application\nwithout knowledge of the semantics of that application. Stimulus\nsignaling
    can occur to a user interface running locally with the\nclient, or to a remote
    user interface, through media streams.\nStimulus signaling encompasses a wide
    range of mechanisms, ranging\nfrom clicking on hyperlinks, to pressing buttons,
    to traditional Dual\nTone Multi Frequency (DTMF) input. In all cases, stimulus
    signaling\nis supported through the use of markup languages, which play a key\nrole
    in this framework.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation\nProtocol
    (SIP) for publishing event state used within the framework\nfor SIP Event Notification.
    The first application of this extension\nis targeted at the publication of presence
    information.\nThe mechanism described in this document can be extended to support\npublication
    of any event state, for which there exists an appropriate\nevent package. It is
    not intended to be a general-purpose mechanism\nfor transport of arbitrary data,
    as there are better suited\nmechanisms for this purpose (FTP, HTTP, etc.)\n\n\t "

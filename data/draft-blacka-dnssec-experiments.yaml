  content: "   In the long history of the development of the DNS security [1]\n   extensions,
    a number of alternate methodologies and modifications\n   have been proposed and
    rejected for practical, rather than strictly\n   technical, reasons.  There is
    a desire to be able to experiment with\n   these alternate methods in the public
    DNS.  This document describes a\n   methodology for deploying alternate, non-backwards-compatible,
    DNSSEC\n   methodologies in an experimental fashion without disrupting the\n   deployment
    of standard DNSSEC.\n\t "

  content: "   A Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) server can experience\n   temporary
    overload because one or more clients are sending requests\n   to the server at
    a higher rate than the server is capable or willing\n   to handle.  This document
    defines a new CoAP Response Code for a\n   server to indicate that a client should
    reduce the rate of requests.\n\n\t "

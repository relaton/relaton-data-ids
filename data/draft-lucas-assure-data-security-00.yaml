  content: "   aSSURE uses industry standards and best practice to provide a\n   secure
    communications platform for device configuration and life\n   cycle management
    across the entire range of smart devices, from\n   the largest servers through
    to more constrained devices, with\n   minimal human involvement. Based on extensions
    to current standard\n   methods, aSSURE also provides secure end to end communication\n
    \  across any network type.\n\n   A new approach allows key distribution and encrypted
    channels to\n   be established between devices that support RSA, EC and/or simple\n
    \  shared secrets. For devices that only support shared secrets, key\n   derivation
    algorithms ensure that forward and backward compatible\n   secrecy is supported
    so that secure change of ownership can be\n   obtained. Owners prove ownership
    via a \"case ID\" known by the\n   manufacturer and the \"Trusted Authority\"
    ID Server but not known\n   by the device.\n\n   aSSURE defines end-to-end encryption
    links, called \"channels\", so\n   that pairs of devices communicate with a unique
    set of encryption\n   keys. These unique keys, coupled with the end-to-end encryption,\n
    \  mean communication is both secure and private.\n\n   DTLS supports both certificates
    and pre-shared keys, but does not\n   cover key distribution or management. DTLS
    does not support\n   client-specific pre-shared keys because the client cannot
    identify\n   itself during the handshake. Herein are all the APIs required to\n
    \  support key distribution and management as well as an extension to\n   the
    DTLS handshake that allows the client identity to be provided.\n\n   aSSURE cleanly
    integrates with the Open Interconnect Consortium\n   (OIC) architecture. Both
    use CBOR encoded data with CoAP over UDP\n   and DTLS. aSSURE URIs do not collide
    with OIC URIs and aSSURE\n   channels can be used as a secure transport for OIC
    requests.\n\n\t "

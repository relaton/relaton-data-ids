  content: "This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session\nInitiation
    Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminology\ndocument [5].  The methodology
    and terminology are to be used for\nbenchmarking signaling plane performance with
    varying signaling and\nmedia load.  Both scale and establishment rate are measured
    by\nsignaling plane performance.  The SIP Devices to be benchmarked may\nbe a
    single device under test (DUT) or a system under test (SUT).\nBenchmarks can be
    obtained and compared for different types of\ndevices such as SIP Proxy Server,
    SBC, P-CSCF, and Server paired with\na Firewall/NAT device.\n\t "

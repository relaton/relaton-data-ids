  content: "This document describes a new IPSec protocol called QoS-friendly \n   Encapsulating
    Security Payload (Q-ESP).  Q-ESP provides \n   confidentiality, data origin authentication,
    anti-reply, \n   connection less integrity, and facilitates QoS active admission
    \n   control. The currently implemented IPSec Encapsulating Security \n   Payload
    (ESP) protocol is not QoS friendly as it encrypts the upper \n   layer transmission
    protocol and prevents network control devices \n   such as routers and switches
    from utilizing this information in \n   performing classification appropriately.
    In this document we provide \n   the specification of Q-ESP which gives the same
    security services \n   provided by ESP, in addition to strong source and destination
    \n   addresses authentication and its ability to facilitate QoS \n   classification.\n\t "

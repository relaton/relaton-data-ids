  content: "   In various network deployments, end to end forwarding paths are\n   partitioned
    into multiple segments.  For example, in some cloud-based\n   WAN communications,
    stitching multiple overlay tunnels are used for\n   traffic policy enforcement
    matters such as to optimize traffic\n   distribution or to select paths exposing
    a lower latency.  Likewise,\n   in satellite communications, the communication
    path is decomposed\n   into two terrestrial segments and a satellite segment.
    \ Such long-\n   haul paths are naturally composed of multiple network segments
    with\n   various encapsulation schemes.  Packet loss may show different\n   characteristics
    on different segments.\n\n   Traditional transport protocols (e.g., TCP) respond
    to packet loss\n   slowly especially in long-haul networks: they either wait for
    some\n   signal from the receiver to indicate a loss and then retransmit from\n
    \  the sender or rely on sender's timeout which is often quite long.\n   With
    the increase of end-to-end transport encryption (e.g., QUIC),\n   traditional
    PEP (performance enhancing proxy) techniques such as TCP\n   splitting are no
    longer applicable.\n\n   LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) is a network-assisted\n
    \  performance enhancement over path segment and it aims to provide\n   local
    in-network recovery to achieve better data delivery by making\n   packet loss
    recovery faster.  In an overlay network scenario, LOOPS\n   can be performed over
    a variety of the existing, or purposely\n   created, tunnel-based path segments.\n\n\t "

  content: "   One of the key goals of NFV is to optimize the infrastructure\n   resource
    usage while driving operational simplicity. Real-time\n   analytics providing
    insight into various components such as compute\n   (e.g. dynamic CPU utilization),
    storage (e.g. dynamic capacity\n   usage), network (e.g. dynamic bandwidth utilization),
    energy (e.g.\n   dynamic power consumption) is key to not only providing visibility\n
    \  into the NFV infrastructure and thus driving operational simplicity\n   but
    also optimizing resource usage for the purposes of\n   orchestration. This draft
    focusses on use cases and architectural\n   framework for real-time analytics
    and orchestration including Big\n   Data predictive analytics for addressing the
    aforementioned\n   requirements.\n\n\t "

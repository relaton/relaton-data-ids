  content: "This document proposes a trusted browser security model intended to\n
    \   secure the mutual automated consent between the end-user and the\n    content
    provider before allowing a web browser to engage the\n    services of an arbitrary
    third-party add-on, extension or service.\n    Properly implemented, this proposed
    security model would create a\n    standardized API across all browsers to further
    the security of\n    e-commerce and other on-line transactions.\n\t "

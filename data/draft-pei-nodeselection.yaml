  content: "   Based on the hybrid spectrum sensing method, this paper proposes a\n
    \  SENS node selection algorithm which effectively reduces the number\n   of nodes
    participated in spectrum sensing. The algorithm reduces the\n   loads and energy
    consumption of the cognitive wireless sensor\n   networks. It conforms to the
    development trend of current cognitive\n   wireless sensor networks. At the same
    time, This method is also\n   suitable for traditional wireless sensor networks.
    This algorithm\n   which considers the perception of energy consumption and performance\n
    \  parameters of nodes forms a node priority function, The network\n   selects
    the nodes according to the priority of nodes, It reduces\n   energy consumption
    and improves the spectrum sensing performance. In\n   the cooperative spectrum
    sensing, sensor nodes transmit the sensing\n   results to the fusion center. Moreover,
    this paper uses the \"OR\"\n   standard, the node whose local sensing decision
    is \"1\" transmits the\n   local sensing result to the fusion center. So it can
    reduce the\n   energy consumption in the process of spectrum sensing and achieve\n
    \  the purpose of energy saving.\n\n\t "

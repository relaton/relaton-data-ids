  content: "As we approach IPv4 address depletion, the IETF must provide for IPv4\nand
    IPv6 coexistence:  a way for ISPs and enterprises to reduce\npublic IPv4 address
    consumption and a way for hosts to migrate to\nIPv6 connectivity -- while providing
    reasonable access for those IPv6\nhosts to access the IPv4 Internet.\n\nThis draft
    compares eight proposals for IPv6 and IPv4 coexistence.\n\t "

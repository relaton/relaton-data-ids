  content: "   This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer\n   Security
    (DTLS) as a transport protocol for Session Traversal\n   Utilities for NAT (STUN).
    \ It provides guidances on when and how to\n   use DTLS with the currently standardized
    STUN Usages.  It also\n   specifies modifications to the STUN URIs and TURN URIs
    and to the\n   TURN resolution mechanism to facilitate the resolution of STUN
    URIs\n   and TURN URIs into the IP address and port of STUN and TURN servers\n
    \  supporting DTLS as a transport protocol.\n\n\t "

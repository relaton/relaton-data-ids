  content: "This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of  \nP-Charging-Function-Addresses
    and P-Charging-Vector headers. The \nformer header is used to pass the addresses
    of entities that \nprovide a charging function. The latter header is used to pass
    \ncharging correlation information. The affected UAs and proxies \nassociated
    with a dialog or standalone transaction need to know the \nidentities or addresses
    of the appropriate charging entities. They \nalso need to pass correlation information
    so that the records \ngenerated and sent to the charging entities may be properly
    \nassociated for a coordinated billing effort.\n\t "

  content: "   WebRTC applications rely on ICE candidates to enable peer-to-peer\n
    \  connections between clients in as many network configurations as\n   possible.
    \ To maximize the probability to create a direct peer-to-\n   peer connection,
    client private IP addresses are often exposed\n   without user consent.  This
    is currently used as a way to track\n   users.  This document describes a way
    to share IP addresses with\n   other clients while preserving client privacy.
    \ This is achieved by\n   obfuscating IP addresses using dynamically generated
    names resolvable\n   through Multicast DNS [RFC6763].\n\n\t "

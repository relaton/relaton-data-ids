  content: "The emerging and growing deployment of IPv6 networks will introduce cases
    where connectivity with IPv4 networks crossing IPv6 transit backbones is desired.
    \ This document describes a mechanism for automatic discovery and creation of
    IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels via extensions to multiprotocol BGP.  It is targeted at
    connecting islands of IPv4 networks across an IPv6-only backbone without the need
    for a manually configured overlay of tunnels.  The mechanisms described in this
    document have been implemented, tested, and deployed on the large research IPv6
    network in China.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

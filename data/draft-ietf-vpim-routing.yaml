  content: "Voice messaging is traditionally addressed using telephone number addressing.
    \ This document describes two techniques for routing voice messages based on a
    telephone number.  The complete service uses the Voice Profile for Internet Mail
    (VPIM) Directory service to lookup a VPIM email address with a telephone number
    and confirm that the address is both valid and associated with the intended recipient.
    \ However, this service will take time to become widely deployed in the near term.
    \ This document also describes a basic send-and-pray service that routes and delivers
    messages using only the ENUM telephone number resolution service and the existing
    DNS mail routing facilities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a DPoP-inspired JWT-based profile for workload-
    to-workload authentication within the WIMSE (Workload Identity in Multi System
    Environments) architecture. This profile uses the Workload Identity Token (WIT)
    combined with a Workload Proof Token (WPT) to provide cryptographic proof of possession.
    The WPT is a signed JWT that demonstrates the sender's possession of the private
    key bound to the WIT, while also binding the authentication to the specific request
    context.</p>"

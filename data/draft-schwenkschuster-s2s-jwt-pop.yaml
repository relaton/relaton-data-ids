  content: "   This document defines a DPoP-inspired JWT-based profile for workload-\n
    \  to-workload authentication within the WIMSE (Workload Identity in\n   Multi
    System Environments) architecture.  This profile uses the\n   Workload Identity
    Token (WIT) combined with a Workload Proof Token\n   (WPT) to provide cryptographic
    proof of possession.  The WPT is a\n   signed JWT that demonstrates the sender's
    possession of the private\n   key bound to the WIT, while also binding the authentication
    to the\n   specific request context.\n\n\t "

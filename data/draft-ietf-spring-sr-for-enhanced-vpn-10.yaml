  content: "   Enhanced VPNs aim to deliver VPN services with enhanced\n   characteristics,
    such as guaranteed resources, latency, jitter, etc.,\n   so as to support customers
    requirements on connectivity services with\n   these enhanced characteristics.
    \ Enhanced VPN requires integration\n   between the overlay VPN connectivity and
    the characteristics provided\n   by the underlay network.  A Network Resource
    Partition (NRP) is a\n   subset of the network resources and associated policies
    on each of a\n   connected set of links in the underlay network.  An NRP could
    be used\n   as the underlay to support one or a group of enhanced VPN services.\n\n
    \  Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  A node\n   steers
    a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called\n   \"segments\".  A
    segment is referred to by its Segment Identifier\n   (SID).  SIDs can represent
    topological or service based instructions.\n   SIDs can further be associated
    with a set of network resources used\n   for executing the instruction.  Such
    SIDs are called resource-aware\n   SIDs.  A group of resource-aware SIDs may be
    used to build SR based\n   NRPs, which provide customized network topology and
    resource\n   attributes required by one or a group of enhanced VPN services.\n\n
    \  This document describes an approach to build SR based NRPs using\n   resource-aware
    SIDs.  The SR based NRP can be used to deliver\n   enhanced VPN services in SR
    networks.\n\n\t "

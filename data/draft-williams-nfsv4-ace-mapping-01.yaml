  content: "This document presents a model for mapping the domain-qualified\nuser
    and group names used in the Network File System version 4's\nAccess Control List
    (ACL) entries (ACEs) to internal identifiers\nsuch as POSIX UIDs and GIDs, as
    well as reverse mappings as well\nas a protocol for effecting such mappings in
    a consistent way\nacross a server cluster, site, or entire domain.\nThe main goals
    of this model and protocol are to allow the use of\nuser and group names from
    multiple domains to be used in POSIX\nenvironments as well as enabling multi-protocol
    fileserver\nimplementations which must support the use of a variety of user\nand
    group identifiers.\n\n\t "

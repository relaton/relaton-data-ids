- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The GSS-API [GSS-API1,2] offers security services independent of\n
    \  underlying mechanisms. A possible GSS-mechanism is the Simple Public\n   Key
    Mechanism [SPKM]. This paper complements [SPKM] by providing\n   concrete rules
    for the Credential Management. Our proposal allows\n   beside the standard Credential
    Management based on X.509v3 [X509v3]\n   and PKIX [PKIX] the self certification
    of temporary public keys,\n   which may be used to implement a Secure Single Login
    variant, which\n   works with temporary keys instead of the sensitive long term
    keys.\n   The benefits of this approach are discussed in [SSLogin] more\n   detailed.
    Since DL-based signature- and encryption algorithms are\n   very well suited for
    the efficient generation of the temporary keys\n   we propose two new RECOMMENDED
    algorithms for SPKM.\n\n\t "

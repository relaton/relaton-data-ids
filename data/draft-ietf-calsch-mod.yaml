  content: "Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols require the definition of\nobjects
    to encapsulate an event to be scheduled, a calendar on which\nthe event will be
    stored, and means for exchanging these objects across\nthe Internet between calendars
    on behalf of people for whom the\ncalendars are meaningful.  This document gives
    an abstract model of the\nobjects and the protocols necessary to accomplish this
    kind of\ninformation exchange.  It will establish the context in which other\nCalendaring
    and Scheduling RFCs can be interpreted.  Included are brief\nintroductions to
    the other components of Internet calendar protocols\nand definitions of nomenclature
    common to all documents defining these\nprotocols.  Reading this document will
    enable implementors and users of\nInternet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols
    to understand the goals\nand constraints chosen for related protocols.\n\n\t "

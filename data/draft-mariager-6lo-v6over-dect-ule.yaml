  content: "   DECT Ultra Low Energy is a low power air interface technology that
    is\n   defined by the DECT Forum and specified by ETSI.\n\n   The DECT air interface
    technology has been used world-wide in\n   communication devices for more than
    15 years, primarily carrying\n   voice for cordless telephony but has also been
    deployed for data\n   centric services.\n\n   The DECT Ultra Low Energy is a recent
    addition to the DECT interface\n   primarily intended for low-bandwidth, low-power
    applications such as\n   sensor devices, smart meters, home automation etc.  As
    the DECT Ultra\n   Low Energy interface inherits many of the capabilities from
    DECT, it\n   benefits from long range, interference free operation, world wide\n
    \  reserved frequency band, low silicon prices and maturity.  There is\n   an
    added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE\n   such as
    for Internet of Things applications.\n\n   This document describes how IPv6 is
    transported over DECT ULE using\n   6LoWPAN techniques.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies a symmetric key format for transport and\n   provisioning
    of symmetric keys (One Time Password (OTP) shared\n   secrets or symmetric cryptographic
    keys) to different types of strong\n   authentication devices.  The standard token
    format enables\n   enterprises to deploy best-of-breed solutions combining components\n
    \  from different vendors into the same infrastructure.\n\n   This work is a joint
    effort by the members of OATH (Initiative for\n   Open AuTHentication) to specify
    a format that can be freely\n   distributed to the technical community.  The authors
    believe that a\n   common and shared specification will facilitate adoption of
    two-\n   factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability\n
    \  between commercial and open-source implementations.\n\t "

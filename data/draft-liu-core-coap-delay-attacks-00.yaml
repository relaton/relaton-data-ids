  content: "   Various attacks including delay attacks have become a topic in the\n
    \  security of Internet of Things (IoT) especially for the constrained\n   nodes
    utilizing sensors and actuators which connect and interact with\n   the physical
    world.  [I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators] describes\n   several serious delay
    attacks, discusses tougher requirements and\n   then recommends mechanisms to
    mitigate the attacks.  It also\n   specifies some disadvantages with the mechanisms.
    \ This document\n   proposes alternative mechanisms that address some of the\n
    \  disadvantages\n\n\t "

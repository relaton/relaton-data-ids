  content: "Next generation Internet requires decentralized and distributed\nintelligence
    in order to make available a new type of\nexperience to serve the user's interests.
    Such new services\nwill be enabled by deploying the intelligence\nover a high
    volume of IoT devices in a form of distributed\nprotocol. Such a  protocol will
    orchestrate the machine learning\n(ML) application in order to train the aggregated
    data available\nfrom the IoT devices. The training is not an easy task in such\na
    distributed environment, where the amount of connected IoT\ndevices will scale
    up and the needs for both interoperability\nand computing are high. This draft,
    addresses both issues\nby combining two emerging technologies known as edge AI\nand
    fog computing. The protocol procedures aggregate the data\ncollected by the IoT
    devices into a fog node and apply edge AI\nfor data analysis at the edge of the
    infrastructure. The\nanalysis of the IoT requirements resulted in an end-to-end
    ML\nprotocol specification which is presented throughout this draft.\n\n\t "

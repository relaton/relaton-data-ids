  content: "This informational document describes and identifies the requirements
    for transactions to handle Public Key Certificate (PKC) lifecycle transactions
    between Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Systems
    using Internet Key Exchange (IKE) (versions 1 and 2) and Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) Systems.  These requirements are designed to meet the needs of enterprise-scale
    IPsec VPN deployments.  It is intended that a standards track profile of a management
    protocol will be created to address many of these requirements.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "The objective of the Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) architecture is
    to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.
    \ It achieves this by marking packets belonging to PCN-flows when the rate of
    traffic exceeds certain configured thresholds on links in the domain.  These marks
    can then be evaluated to determine how close the domain is to being congested.
    \ This document specifies how such marks are encoded into the IP header by redefining
    the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within such domains.  The
    baseline encoding described here provides only two PCN encoding states: Not-marked
    and PCN-marked.  Future extensions to this encoding may be needed in order to
    provide more than one level of marking severity. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

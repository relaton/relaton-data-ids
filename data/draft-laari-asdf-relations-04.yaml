  content: "   The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) base specification defines set\n
    \  of basic information elements that can be used for describing a large\n   share
    of the existing data models from different ecosystems.  While\n   these data models
    are typically very simple, such as basic sensors\n   definitions, more complex
    models, and in particular bigger systems,\n   benefit from ability to describe
    additional information on how\n   different definitions relate to each other.
    \ This document specifies\n   an extension to SDF for describing complex relationships
    in class\n   level descriptions.  This specification does not consider instance-\n
    \  specific information.\n\n\t "

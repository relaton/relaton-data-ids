abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding formats
    for the Hash-Based Signature (HBS) schemes Hierarchical Signature System (HSS),
    eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), and XMSS^MT, a multi-tree variant of
    XMSS, as well as SPHINCS+, the latter being the only stateless scheme. This specification
    applies to the Internet X.509 Public Key infrastructure (PKI) when digital signatures
    are used to sign certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).</p>"

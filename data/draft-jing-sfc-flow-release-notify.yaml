  content: "   Service function chain is the definition of an ordered set of service\n
    \  functions.  After instantiated, the service function path is created\n   and
    the classified traffic is steered through the corresponding\n   service function
    path and then forwarded to the final destination.\n   SFs and SFC Proxies do not
    know the termination of a service flow.\n   This document describes a method to
    notify the SFs and SFC Proxies\n   the termination of a service flow.\n\n   When
    one service flow goes through the SFP, there may create some\n   states in some
    SFs or SFC Proxies.  However, when the service flow\n   terminates, the SFs and
    SFC Proxies are unaware of that and maintain\n   the states as well.This document
    describes a method to notify the SFs\n   and SFC Proxies the termination of a
    service flow and release the\n   resources occupied by the flow.\n\n\t "

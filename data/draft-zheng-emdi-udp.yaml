  content: "   A Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement that can be used as a\n   diagnostic
    tool or a quality indicator for monitoring flows that are\n   sensitive to arrival
    time and packet loss is defined in [RFC4445].\n   This document extends the Media
    Delivery Index with a new component:\n   Effective Loss Factor (ELF), which takes
    loss distribution into\n   account when measuring packet loss.  ELF is also applicable
    when\n   certain Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes are used.\n\n\t "

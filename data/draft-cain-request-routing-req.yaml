  content: "Request-routing systems (RRS) are components of Content Distribution\nNetworks
    (CDNs) that direct client requests to an available copy of\ncontent based on one
    or more metrics.  To enable the interconnection of\nCDNs [MODEL][ARCH], it is
    necessary for their request-routing systems to\ninterconnect and exchange information
    such that client requests can be\nrouted between CDNs.  This is called request-routing
    internetworking.\nThis document specifies the requirements for request-routing\ninternetworking.\n\n\t "

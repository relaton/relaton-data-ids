  content: "  In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), as also in IEEE Bridged \n  Networks,
    the switches simply flood multicast traffic on all ports in \n  the LAN by default.
    IGMP Snooping is commonly deployed to ensure \n  multicast traffic is not forwarded
    on ports without IGMP receivers. \n  The procedures and recommendations for IGMP
    Snooping are defined in \n  [IGMP-SNOOP]. But when any protocol other than IGMP
    is used, the \n  common practice is to simply flood multicast traffic to all ports.
    \n  PIM-SM, PIM-SSM, PIM-BIDIR are widely deployed routing protocols. PIM \n  Snooping
    procedures are important to restrict multicast traffic to \n  only the routers
    interested in receiving such traffic. \n  While most of the PIM Snooping procedures
    defined here also apply to \n  IEEE Bridged Networks, VPLS demands certain special
    procedures due to \n  the split-horizon rules that require the Provider Edge (PE)
    devices \n  to co-operate. This document describes the procedures and \n  recommendations
    for PIM-Snooping in VPLS to facilitate replication to \n  only those ports behind
    which there are interested PIM routers and/or \n  IGMP hosts. \n   \n  This document
    also describes procedures for PIM Proxy. PIM Proxy is \n  required on PEs for
    VPLS Multicast to work correctly when Join \n  suppression is enabled in the VPLS.
    PIM Proxy also helps scale VPLS \n  Multicast much better than just PIM Snooping.

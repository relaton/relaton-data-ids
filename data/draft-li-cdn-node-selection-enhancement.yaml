  content: "   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are critical infrastructure for\n
    \  improving user experience by serving content from geographically\n   proximate
    servers.  Traditional CDN node selection mechanisms, such\n   as DNS-based redirection
    and BGP-based anycast, primarily rely on\n   network proximity and often lack
    awareness of server load or specific\n   application requirements.  This can lead
    to suboptimal performance\n   and inefficient resource utilization.\n\n   This
    document proposes an enhanced mechanism for dynamic CDN node\n   selection that
    leverages IPv4/v6 anycast, BGP, and the QUIC transport\n   protocol.  The proposed
    solution enables CDN nodes to advertise or\n   withdraw their anycast routes based
    on real-time load and link\n   quality.  Furthermore, it defines a mechanism for
    clients to signal\n   their service requirements (e.g., high-compute, low-latency,
    or high-\n   bandwidth) and for servers to redirect clients to more optimal nodes\n
    \  using QUIC's connection migration capabilities.  This allows for a\n   more
    intelligent, load-aware, and application-aware CDN node\n   selection process.\n\n\n\t "

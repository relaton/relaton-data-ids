  content: "This document describes the Jumbo Payload option for IPv6, which is\n
    \  used to send IPv6 packets with payloads longer than 65,535 octets.\n   This
    option is relevant only for IPv6 nodes that may be attached to\n   links with
    a link MTU greater than 65,575 octets, and need not be\n   implemented or understood
    by IPv6 nodes that do not support\n   attachment to links with such large MTUs.\n\t "

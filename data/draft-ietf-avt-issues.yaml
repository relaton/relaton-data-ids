  content: "This memorandum is a companion document to the current version of the
    RTP protocol specification draft-ietf-avt-rtp-*.{txt,ps}. It discusses aspects
    of transporting real-time services (such as voice or video) over the Internet.
    \  It compares and evaluates design alternatives for a real-time transport protocol,
    providing rationales for the design decisions made for RTP. Also covered are issues
    of port assignment and multicast address allocation.   A comprehensive glossary
    of terms related to multimedia conferencing is provided.            This document
    is a product of the Audio-Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering
    Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's
    mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or the author(s).\n\t "

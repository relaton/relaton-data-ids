  content: "Some IPTV deployments that are using the Real Time Streaming Protocol\n(RTSP)
    require the ability of the server to notify clients about\nasynchronous events
    occurring during an RTSP session.  Current\ndeployments typically use the ANNOUNCE
    method of RTSP 1.0 for sending\nsuch asynchronous events from a server to clients
    by using some\nproprietary extensions.  However, the ANNOUNCE method has been\nremoved
    from the current RTSP 2.0 draft, leaving the new\nspecification without a mechanism
    for sending asynchronous messages\nfrom the server.  This memo describes a use
    case for such an\nasynchronous message and proposes a new RTSP 2.0 method.\n\t "

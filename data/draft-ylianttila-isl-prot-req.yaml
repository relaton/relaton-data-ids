  content: "This document addresses those requirements for IP spatial location\nprotocol
    that emerges from the situation where mobile hosts (MH) use\nlocation information
    in the inter-domain mobility management. While IP\nspatial location protocol has
    many other usage cases, this document\nfocuses on the requirements for mobile
    IP device that needs to know the\nwhereabouts of IP subnetwork to be visited in
    order to prepare for\nhandoff. Three inter-technology handoff (ITHO) scenarios
    and the related\nproblems are presented, and the requirements for the system\narchitecture,
    terminal and IP spatial location protocol are outlined. \n\n\n\t "

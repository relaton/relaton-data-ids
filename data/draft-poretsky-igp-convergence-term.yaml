  content: "This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking IGP Route \nConvergence.
    \ The motivation and applicability for this \nbenchmarking is provided in [1].
    \ The methodology to be used for \nthis benchmarking is described in [2].  The
    methodology and \nterminology to be used for benchmarking route convergence can
    be \napplied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [3] and OSPF [4].  The \ndata
    plane is measured to obtain the convergence benchmarking metrics.  \nThe purpose
    of this document is to introduce new terms required to \ncomplete execution of
    the IGP Route Convergence Methodology [2].\n\t "

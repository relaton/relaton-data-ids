  content: "The aim of this document is to define a small set of metrics that are\nrobust,
    easy to understand, orthogonal, relevant, and easy to\ncompute.  The IPPM WG has
    defined a large number of richly\nparameterized metrics because network measurement
    has many purposes.\nOften, the ultimate purpose is to report a concise set of
    metrics\ndescribing a network's state to an end user.  It is for this purpose\nthat
    the present set of metrics is defined.\n\t "

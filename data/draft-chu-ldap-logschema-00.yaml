  content: "In order to facilitate remote administration and auditing of LDAP\nserver
    operation, it is desirable to provide the server's operational\nlogs themselves
    as a searchable LDAP directory.  These logs may also\nbe used as a persistent
    change log to support various replication\nmechanisms.  This document defines
    a schema that may be used to\nrepresent all of the requests that have been processed
    by an LDAP\nserver.  It may be used by various applications for auditing, flight\nrecorder,
    replication, and other purposes.\n\n\t "

  content: "BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed before\nthe
    Internet environment became perilous, is designed with little\nconsideration for
    protection of the information it carries.  There are\nno mechanisms in BGP to
    protect against attacks that modify, delete,\nforge, or replay data, any of which
    has the potential to disrupt overall\nnetwork routing behavior.\n\n\t "

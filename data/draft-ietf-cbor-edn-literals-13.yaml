  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (STD 94, RFC 8949)
    is\n   a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely\n
    \  small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without\n   the
    need for version negotiation.\n\n   In addition to the binary interchange format,
    CBOR from the outset\n   (RFC 7049) defined a text-based \"diagnostic notation\"
    in order to be\n   able to converse about CBOR data items without having to resort
    to\n   binary data.  RFC 8610 extended this into what is known as Extended\n   Diagnostic
    Notation (EDN).\n\n   This document consolidates the definition of EDN, sets forth
    a\n   further step of its evolution, and is intended to serve as a single\n   reference
    target in specifications that use EDN.\n\n   It specifies an extension point for
    adding application-oriented\n   extensions to the diagnostic notation.  It then
    defines two such\n   extensions that enhance EDN with text representations of
    epoch-based\n   date/times and of IP addresses and prefixes (RFC 9164).\n\n   A
    few further additions close some gaps in usability.  The document\n   modifies
    one extension originally specified in Appendix G.4 of RFC\n   8610 to enable further
    increasing usability.  To facilitate tool\n   interoperation, this document specifies
    a formal ABNF grammar, and it\n   adds media types.\n\n\n   // (This \"cref\"
    paragraph will be removed by the RFC editor:) The\n   // present revision -13
    reflects the branches \"roll-up\" and \"roll-up-\n   // 2\" in the repository,
    an attempt to contain the entire\n   // specification of EDN in this document,
    instead of describing\n   // updates to the existing documents RFC 8949 and RFC
    8610.\n   // Editorial work on the branch \"roll-up-2\" might continue.  The\n
    \  // exact reflection of this document being a replacement for both\n   // Section
    8 of RFC 8949 and Appendix G of RFC 8610 needs to be\n   // recorded in the metadata
    and in abstract and introduction.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the JWT claims\n
    \  that can be included in the PASSporT as defined in RFC 8225.  If the\n   signer
    includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then\n   the recipient
    will reject the entire PASSporT.  This document defines\n   additional ways that
    the JWT claims can be constrained.\n\n\t "

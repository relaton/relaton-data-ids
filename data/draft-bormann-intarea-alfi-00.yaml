  content: "   IPv6 defines a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.  Many link layers are more\n
    \  limited in their choice of packet size.  Typically, IP adaptation\n   layers
    for these link layers define a segmentation or fragmentation\n   scheme to transport
    larger IP packets in multiple link layer packets.\n\n   Often, adaption layer
    fragmentation schemes reduce some performance\n   metric, such as the packet delivery
    rate.  Where application or\n   transport protocols have a choice, it would therefore
    be desirable\n   for them to know about any adaptation layer fragmentation that
    is\n   going on, so they can choose packet sizes that minimize adaptation\n   layer
    fragmentation.\n\n   At the IP layer, fragmentation can be detected using a number
    of\n   mechanisms used in Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery [RFC4821].\n
    \  However, adaptation later fragmentation schemes are often designed to\n   be
    \"transparent\", i.e. there is no way at higher layers to find out\n   they had
    to be employed (except maybe by elaborate measurement\n   schemes targeting one
    of the impacted performance metrics; this\n   approach does not appear to be viable)
    [WEI].\n\n   The present specification defines a mechanism for IPv6 adaptation\n
    \  layers to indicate the presence of adaptation layer fragmentation, as\n   well
    as an indication of preferred packet sizes.\n\n   The main objective of this version
    of the draft is to present a\n   complete design in order to be able to gauge
    the complexity of the\n   approach against the gains to be expected from implementing
    it.\n\n   Comments are appreciated and should go to the intarea@ietf.org\n   mailing
    list.\n\n\t "

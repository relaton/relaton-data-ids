  content: "This document describes the goals of Voice Profile for Internet Mail \n(VPIM),
    Version 3 and establishes a baseline of desired \nfunctionality against which
    proposed MIME profiles for Internet \nvoice messaging can be judged. The primary
    goal for this version is \nto support interoperability with desktop clients. Other
    goals for \nthis version of VPIM include backward compatibility, expanded \ninteroperability
    with unified messaging systems, and conformance to \nInternet standards. This
    document does not include goals that were \nmet fully by VPIM version 2 [VPIM2].
    \nDifferent levels of desirability are indicated throughout the \ndocument. \n\n\t "

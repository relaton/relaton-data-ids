  content: "   This document extends the STIR architecture by defining a Personal\n
    \  Assertion Token (PASSporT) with a type of \"vesper\" (VErifiable Sti\n   PERsona)
    and specifies the use of PASSporTs as a JSON Web Tokens\n   (JWT) and Selective
    Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) for representing\n   verifiable claims related to a persona
    (a person or business entity)\n   associated with a Secure Telephone Identity
    (STI).  This set of\n   extensible claims can include verifiable information such
    as the\n   assignment of a telephone number, the output of a Know Your Customer\n
    \  (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB) type of vetting process, Rich Call\n   Data
    (RCD) or claims of consent provided to the telephone number\n   holder.  The architecture,
    dependencies, and process flow of Vesper\n   includes logical roles that represent
    certain responsibilities for\n   establishing a secure telephone identity.  These
    roles represent the\n   basis for trusted relationships to information that is
    being claimed\n   and who is validating and taking responsibility for the accuracy
    of\n   that information.  These roles begin with a Subject Entity (SE) that\n
    \  is the end entity that intended to be represented by the STI\n   telephone
    number identifier.  A Vetting Claim Agent (VCA) establishes\n   the Subject Entity
    as a vetted entity after performing the initial\n   vetting and existence as a
    entity that fulfills the criteria and\n   policies of the ecosystem to be associated
    with an STI.  A Notary\n   Agent (NA) is a neutral role that maintains a graph
    of relationships\n   among all roles, claims, and identities, but importantly,
    for\n   protecting privacy, doesn't hold any claim information other than the\n
    \  recording of claim events to the STI telephone number.  The NA\n   records
    these claim event transactions with a corresponding\n   transparency log that
    generates verifiable receipts to \"notarize\" the\n   recording of these relationships
    and claims being established.\n   Privacy is enabled in this Notary role because
    the submitters have\n   the option of submitting hashes of claims to protect information,
    or\n   may usefully want to publicly declare their association to a claim to\n
    \  allow the public monitoring to avoid duplicate, mistaken or negligent\n   claims
    which can be identified before illegitimate usage in the eco-\n   system can occur.
    \ Other Claim Agents are defined producing claims in\n   the form of SD-JWT +
    receipts from the NA.  There are multiple claim\n   agent types with corresponding
    extensible claim definitions with key\n   value pairs that can be required or
    optionally included.  These SD-\n   JWT + receipt claim objects are then collected
    by the SE into a\n   digital wallet that it can then use for selective disclosure\n
    \  presentation and incorporate into a \"vesper\" PASSporT signed by the a\n   delegate
    certificate associated with STI telephone number to validate\n   the SE is indeed
    the authorized holder of the telephone number and\n   vesper token at the time
    the presentation is required and ties the SE\n   to the STIR eco-system a STIR
    certificates policy for use in\n   communications.\n\n\t "

  content: "This draft describes some extensions for enhancing SIP response\n   authentication.
    \ In the real-world SIP deployment, TLS may be not\n   available on some hops.
    \ Due to the lack of other response\n   authentication mechanisms in SIP, several
    kinds of security attacks\n   could be conducted on those hops through SIP response.
    \ This draft\n   suggests some approaches for complementary enhancement on SIP\n
    \  response authentication.  With the new per-hop response\n   authentication
    proposed in this draft, the security gaps on the hops\n   without TLS can be bridged.\n\t "

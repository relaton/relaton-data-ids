  script: Latn
  content: "   It seems reasonable to suggest that, despite the huge variety of\n
    \  types of endpoints on the Internet, there are categories of\n   similarity.
    \ These categories are important because categories of\n   endpoint devices may
    share particular advantages or limitations for\n   endpoint security. This draft
    attempts to suggest a classification of\n   endpoints as a foundation for further
    work on operational security.\n   The goal is to identify classes of endpoints
    with similar\n   characteristics. Those characteristics may lead to the discovery
    that\n   the devices in a particular category share similar characteristics\n
    \  for endpoint security.\n\n\t "

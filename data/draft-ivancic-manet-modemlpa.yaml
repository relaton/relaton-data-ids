  content: "   Nework devices and applications are increasingly connected to a\n   variety
    of smart modems whose incoming and outgoing link rates can be\n   varied over
    time to suit the channel characteristics.  Such rate\n   changes can result from
    use of adaptive coding and modulation.  The\n   link rate and conditions offered
    by the modem to connected devices\n   therefore vary.  In order for connected
    devices and applications to\n   get the most out of the modem's link capacity,
    it is necessary for\n   the applications and connected devices to condition traffic.
    \ Thus,\n   they need some knowledge of the modem's link conditions.  This\n   document
    describes one simple method for a modem to advertise link\n   rate and other characteristics,
    via UDP messages, and discusses\n   alternative approaches to communicating this
    information.  While the\n   mechanism in this document is described in the context
    of a modem, it\n   can also be broadly applied to other scenarios such as cryptographic\n
    \  devices.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the lack of layer interaction between networked applications
    and the network during service provisioning, many end user applications and services
    cannot efficiently utilize the network capabilities, nor can achieve the desired
    quality of service objectives. This document describes the general problem of
    cross layer optimization. Cross-layer optimization (CLO) involves the overall
    optimization of application layer and network resources by providing an interface
    for interactions and exchanges between the two layers. The potential gains of
    cross layer optimization are illustrated via examples from content delivery systems,
    video on demand systems, and grid computing.</p>"

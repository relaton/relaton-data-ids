  content: "   There has been an increasing level of discussion within the IETF\n
    \  about the best Working Group (WG) structures for handling the wide\n   array
    of DNS work being conducted within the IETF.  Wes Hardaker was\n   asked to gather
    information from the community at large through\n   email, hallway discussions,
    and meetings and create a small team to\n   discuss potential structural changes
    to be shared with the community.\n   This document is the result of that effort.\n\n\t "

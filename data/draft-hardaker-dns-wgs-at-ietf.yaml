abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been an increasing level of discussion within the IETF about
    the best Working Group (WG) structures for handling the wide array of DNS work
    being conducted within the IETF. Wes Hardaker was asked to gather information
    from the community at large through email, hallway discussions, and meetings and
    create a small team to discuss potential structural changes to be shared with
    the community. This document is the result of that effort.</p>"

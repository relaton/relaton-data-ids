  content: "   Consider a BGP free core scenario with LDP running in the core.\n   Suppose
    the edge BGP speakers PE1 and PE2 know about a prefix P/m\n   via the external
    routers CE1 and CE2.  If the edge LSR PE1 crashes\n   or becomes totally disconnected
    from the core, it is desirable for a\n   core LSR \"P\", that is carrying traffic
    to the failed edge LSR PE1,\n   to immediately restore traffic by re-routing packets
    destined to the\n   prefix P/m from the LSP terminating on PE1 to be forwarded
    over the\n   LSP terminating on PE2, until BGP reconverges. If the packets\n   originally
    flowing to the failed edge LSR PE1 are BGP labeled, then\n   the repairing core
    LSR P must swap the label (corresponding to\n   prefix P/m) advertised by the
    failed edge LSR PE1 with the label\n   advertised for the same prefix by the edge
    LSR PE2 before re-routing\n   the packets through an LSP terminating on PE2. To
    implement BGP edge\n   node protection in a BGP-free LDP core, this document proposes
    an\n   extension to LDP. This extension allows an LDP speaker running on a\n   Edge
    LSR Node (e.g. PE1) to inform the LDP speakers running on core\n   LSRs about
    the \"Repair\" edge LSR (e.g. PE2), as well as Repair LSR's\n   label for prefix
    P/m, if any.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a solution for link protection, node\n   protection,
    Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) protection and fast\n   recovery of inter-AS packet
    based LSPs. These problems are\n   highlighted in [ASREQ]. The proposed solution
    is based on RSVP-TE\n   [RFC3209] as recommended by [ASREQ]. Only the protection
    of links\n   between 2 ASs, the protection of their SRLGs and of the nodes at
    the\n   border of an AS are in the scope of this document.\n\t "

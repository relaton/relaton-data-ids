  content: "This document is written to aid the process of selecting and \ncompleting
    the definition of the MIDCOM protocol, which will operate \nbetween MIDCOM Agents
    and Middleboxes such as firewalls and NATs.  It \ndescribes the semantics which
    the protocol must support.  These \nsemantics are derived from the MIDCOM requirements
    and the MIDCOM \nusage scenarios which helped to inspire the requirements.  \nThis
    is intended to be a working document of the IETF Middlebox \nCommunications (MIDCOM)
    Working Group. \n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a set of enhancements to the Network News  Transport
    \ Protocol  [NNTP-977]  that  provide  a generic mechanism by which clients and
    servers can exchange configuration information. It was  originally  designed as
    a method by which an NNTP client could request URLs from the server in order to
    access out-of-band information.  It  is  not however  limited  to  URLs and may
    be used to communicate such things as language settings, client prefences, formatting
    \ information,  etc.  The protocol  additions are designed in a manner which allows
    the client and server to exchange key/data pairs of arbitrary text strings.\n\t "

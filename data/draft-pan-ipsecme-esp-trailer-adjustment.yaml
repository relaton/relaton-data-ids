  content: "   Implementing IPsec in hardware is a way to improve the forwarding\n
    \  performance of IPsec.  However, the current IPsec ESP packet design,\n   i.e.,
    the position of ESP trailer, imposes a new overhead challenge\n   for implementing
    IPsec in hardware.  This document explains how this\n   overhead challenge occurs
    and proposes the possible solutions.\n\n\t "

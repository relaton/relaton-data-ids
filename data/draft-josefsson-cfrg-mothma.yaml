abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specify Mothma as a generic family of instantiated Post-Quantum/Traditional
    (PQ/T) Hybrid Digital Signatures. The goal is to provide a generic hybrid signature
    pattern that can be analysed separately for security assurance, and to offer concrete
    instantiated algorithms for integration into protocol and implementations. Identified
    instances are provided based on combinations of the traditional EdDSA, ECDSA and
    RSA methods with the post-quantum methods of ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, XMSS and LMS.</p>"

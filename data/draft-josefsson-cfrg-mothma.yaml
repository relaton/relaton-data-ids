  content: "   This document specify Mothma as a generic family of instantiated\n
    \  Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid Digital Signatures.  The goal\n   is
    to provide a generic hybrid signature pattern that can be analysed\n   separately
    for security assurance, and to offer concrete instantiated\n   algorithms for
    integration into protocol and implementations.\n   Identified instances are provided
    based on combinations of the\n   traditional EdDSA, ECDSA and RSA methods with
    the post-quantum\n   methods of ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, XMSS and LMS.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism.  This\n
    \  solution attempts to provide transparent routing to end-nodes in V6\n   realm
    trying to communicate with end-nodes in V4 realm and vice\n   versa.  This is
    achieved using a combination of Network Address\n   Translation and Protocol Translation.
    \ The scheme described does not\n   mandate dual stacks (i.e., IPv4 as well as
    V6 protocol support) or\n   special purpose routing requirements (such as requiring
    tunneling\n   support) on end nodes.  This scheme is based on a combination of\n
    \  address translation scheme and V6/V4 protocol translation scheme.\n\t "

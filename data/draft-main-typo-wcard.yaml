  content: "Many Internet protocols have as an essential element a mapping from a\ntextual
    name to some resource.  There is a technique, popular in some\ncircles, of providing
    a default resource, which is returned in\nresponse to a lookup that does not match
    any known name, rather than\nreturning an indication that there is no resource
    of that name.  This\ntechnique is dangerous and is to be discouraged in all contexts.\nThis
    memo discusses the issues.\n\t "

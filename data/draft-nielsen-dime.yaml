  content: "Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (DIME) is a lightweight, \nbinary
    message format that can be used to encapsulate one or more \napplication-defined
    payloads of arbitrary type and size into a \nsingle message construct. Each payload
    is described by a type, a \nlength, and an optional identifier. Both URIs and
    MIME media type \nconstructs are supported as type identifiers. The payload length
    is \nan integer indicating the number of octets of the payload. The \noptional
    payload identifier is a URI enabling cross-referencing \nbetween payloads. DIME
    payloads may include nested DIME messages or \nchains of linked chunks of unknown
    length at the time the data is \ngenerated. DIME is strictly a message format:
    it provides no \nconcept of a connection or of a logical circuit, nor does it
    \naddress head-of-line problems. \n\n\t "

  content: "   To cumulate design lessons from our protocol development efforts,\n
    \  this document provides a preliminary comparison between two transport\n   protocol
    designs, Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) and Quick\n   UDP Internet Connections
    (QUIC).  We identify their commonalities and\n   differences, summarize the characteristics
    of QUIC which we believe\n   represent progresses in transport protocol designs.
    \ We hope this\n   draft useful in helping others to gain further understanding
    of both\n   SCTP and QUIC, and in future protocol design efforts.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a key management scheme that can be used for real-time
    applications (both for peer-to-peer communication and group communication).  In
    particular, its use to support the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol is described
    in detail.  Security protocols for real-time multimedia applications have started
    to appear.  This has brought forward the need for a key management solution to
    support these protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

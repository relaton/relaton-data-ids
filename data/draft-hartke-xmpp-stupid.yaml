  content: "NAT (Network Address Translator) Traversal may require TURN\n(Traversal
    Using Relays around NAT) functionality in certain cases\nthat are not unlikely
    to occur.  There is little incentive to deploy\nTURN servers, except by those
    who need them -- who may not be in a\nposition to deploy a new protocol on an
    Internet-connected node, in\nparticular not one with deployment requirements as
    high as those of\nTURN.\n\n\"STUN/TURN using PHP in Despair\" is a highly deployable
    protocol for\nobtaining TURN-like functionality, while also providing the most\nimportant
    function of STUN.\n\t "

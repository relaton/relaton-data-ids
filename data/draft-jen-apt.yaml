  content: "The size of the global routing table is a rapidly growing problem.\nSeveral
    solutions have been proposed.  These solutions commonly\ndivide the Internet into
    two address spaces, one for determining the\ndelivery location, and one to use
    during transit.  Packets destined\nfor delivery addresses are tunneled through
    the default-free zone\n(DFZ), which uses only transit addresses.  For this process
    to work,\nthere must be a mapping service that can supply an appropriate\ndestination
    transit address for any given delivery address.  We\npresent a design for such
    a mapping service.  We adhere to a \"do no\nharm\" design philosophy: maintain
    all desirable features of the\ncurrent architecture without negatively affecting
    its security or\nreliability.  Our design aims to minimize delay and prevent loss
    in\npacket encapsulation, minimize the number of modifications to\nexisting hardware,
    minimize the number of new devices, and keep the\nlevel of control traffic manageable.\n\t "

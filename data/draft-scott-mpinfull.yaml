  content: "   In this document, the M-PIN FULL protocol for two factor\n   authentication
    and key exchange is described. This protocol mutually\n   identifies a Client
    to a Server and the Server to the Client, and\n   agrees between them a cryptographic
    strong encryption key for\n   subsequent communication. M-PIN FULL requires an
    external Trusted\n   Authority to issue secrets to participating Clients and Servers.\n\n\t "

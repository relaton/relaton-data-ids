  content: "The operation of optical networks requires information on the \nphysical
    characterization of optical network elements, subsystems, \ndevices, and cabling.
    These physical characteristics may be important \nto consider when using a GMPLS
    control plane to support path setup \nand maintenance. This document discusses
    how the definition and \ncharacterization of optical fiber, devices, subsystems,
    and network \nelements contained in various ITU-T recommendations can be combined
    \nwith GMPLS control plane protocols and mechanisms to support \nImpairment Aware
    Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in \noptical networks.\n\t "

  content: "   We propose an API standard for BGP Peering, also known as interdomain\n
    \  interconnection through global Internet Routing.  This API offers a\n   standard
    way to request public (settlement-free) peering, verify the\n   status of a request
    or BGP session, and list potential connection\n   locations.  The API is backed
    by PeeringDB OIDC, the industry\n   standard for peering authentication.  We also
    propose future work to\n   cover private peering, and alternative authentication
    methods.\n\n\t "

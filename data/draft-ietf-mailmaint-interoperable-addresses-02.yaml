  content: "   This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible\n
    \  enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while\n   avoiding
    elements that harm human-to-human interoperation.\n\n   This is one of a pair
    of documents: this contains recommendations for\n   what addresses humans should
    use, such that address provisioning\n   systems can restrain themselves to addresses
    that email valdidators\n   accept.  (This set can also be described in other ways,
    including\n   \"simple to cut-and-paste\" and \"understandable by some community\".)\n
    \  Its companion defines simpler rules, accepts more addresses, and is\n   intended
    for software like MTAs.\n\n\t "

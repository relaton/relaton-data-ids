  content: "Some networks require certain packet flows to be transported with \npreferential
    treatment over others of the same type (e.g., voice or \nvideo).  This document
    defines a new PHB (Per Hop Behavior), the \nMulti-Level Expedited Forwarding (MLEF)
    PHB, which is a minor \nextension to EF defined in RFC 3246.  RFC 3246 defines
    the Expedited \nForwarding PHB for applications requiring low latency, but with
    a \nsingle DSCP and treatment per queue.  Although EF suggests that \npacket discard
    should be used to achieve this behavior, it does not \ndefine an algorithm for
    packet discard.  This document extends that \nconcept and defines a PHB with multiple
    discard treatments for \npacket flows for applications requiring low latency and
    multiple \npriority levels. \n\n\t "

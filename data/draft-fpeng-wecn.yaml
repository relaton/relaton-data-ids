  content: "TCP congestion control has been developed on the assumption that \ncongestion
    in the network to be the only cause for packet loss. Thus, \nit drops its transmit
    window upon detecting a packet loss. In the \npresence of high erro rates and
    intermittent connective \ncharacteristic of wireless link, these results in an
    unnecessary \nreduction in link bandwidth utilization for packet losses are not
    \nmainly due to congestion.\n\t "

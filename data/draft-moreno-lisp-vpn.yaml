  content: "   This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol\n
    \  (LISP) to create Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  LISP is used to\n   provide
    segmentation in both the LISP data plane and control plane.\n   These VPNs can
    be created over the top of the Internet or over\n   private transport networks,
    and can be implemented by Enterprises or\n   Service Providers.  The goal of these
    VPNs is to leverage the\n   characteristics of LISP - routing scalability, simply
    expressed\n   Ingress site TE Policy, IP Address Family traversal, and mobility,
    in\n   ways that provide value to network operators.\n\n\n\t "

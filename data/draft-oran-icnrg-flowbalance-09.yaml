  content: "   Deeply embedded in some ICN architectures, especially Named Data\n
    \  Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) is the notion\n   of
    flow balance.  This captures the idea that there is a one-to-one\n   correspondence
    between requests for data, carried in Interest\n   messages, and the responses
    with the requested data object, carried\n   in Data messages.  This has a number
    of highly beneficial properties\n   for flow and congestion control in networks,
    as well as some\n   desirable security properties.  For example, neither legitimate
    users\n   nor attackers are able to inject large amounts of un-requested data\n
    \  into the network.\n\n   Existing congestion control approaches however have
    a difficult time\n   dealing effectively with a widely varying MTU of ICN data
    messages,\n   because the protocols allow a dynamic range of 1-64K bytes.  Since\n
    \  Interest messages are used to allocate the reverse link bandwidth for\n   returning
    Data, there is large uncertainty in how to allocate that\n   bandwidth.  Unfortunately,
    most current congestion control schemes in\n   CCNx and NDN only count Interest
    messages and have no idea how much\n   data is involved that could congest the
    inverse link.  This document\n   proposes a method to maintain flow balance by
    accommodating the wide\n   dynamic range in Data message size.\n\n\t "

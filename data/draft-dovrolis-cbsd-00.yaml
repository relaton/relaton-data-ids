  content: "This document describes the Class-Based Service Differentiation (CBSD)\narchitecture
    and it proposes a set of Per-Hop-Behaviors that can be used\nfor implementing
    it. According to CBSD, the network traffic is mapped to\na set of classes. The
    differentiating factor between traffic classes is\nthe relative forwarding quality
    in a DS capable router. The Class PHBs\nhave quite similar semantics with the
    Precedence PHBs, recently proposed\nby Baker et.al. in [PREC], but an attempt
    is made here to define them in a\nmore general manner, decoupling them from specific
    implementation\npossibilities. There is also a semantical overlap between the
    Expedited\nForwarding PHB of [DSFIELD] and the highest Class PHB. Consequently,
    the\nDiffserv working group may want to combine these three PHB proposals in a\nsingle
    one, minimizing the number of DS Field bits used.\n\n\t "

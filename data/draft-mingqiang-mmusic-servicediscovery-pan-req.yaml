  content: "Several protocols exist in the industry for device/service \ndiscovery.
    Each of these protocols addresses the aspects of \ndevice/service discovery in
    different network environments. \nA Service Discovery in a PAN \nPersonal Area
    Network (PAN) is dynamic in its nature where devices \nmay join and leave the
    network very frequently. A PAN, being an ad-\nhoc network, also differs from fixed
    networks in many other ways. \nThe current generation of service protocols such
    as SLP were not \ndesigned for such an environment. This document specifies the
    \nrequirements of a service discovery protocol for PANs, which \nspecifically
    can be used for applications such as multimedia \nsession transfer between devices
    within a PAN. \n\t "

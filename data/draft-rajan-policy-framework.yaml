  content: "Many new protocols defined in the IETF have a regulatory\ncomponent, i.e.,
    network administrators have to decide what\nusers, applications or hosts should
    have access to what\nresources/services under what conditions.  Large-scale deployment
    of services using such protocols is critically dependent on the presence of a
    network-wide policy infrastructure that allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs)and
    corporate administrators to regulate the network rather than configure individual
    devices.  A key component of this\neffort is to evolve standards-based means of
    representing and storing policy information in a unified manner, with a focus
    on schema for storing policy information in directories.  This document presents
    concepts, terminology,a policy framework and requirements for such a definition.\n\t "

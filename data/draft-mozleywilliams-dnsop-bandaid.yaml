abstract:
- content: "<p>The emerging field of agent-to-agent protocol standards introduces
    new requirements in order to facilitate discovery, trust signaling, session negotiation
    and communication. This document specifies a method for utilizing the Domain Name
    System (DNS) to facilitate scalable and interoperable discovery between AI agents.
    The proposed mechanism, referred to as _Brokered Agent Network for DNS AI Discovery_
    (BANDAID), defines a structured DNS namespace and record usage model to support
    metadata exchange and capability advertisement. BANDAID introduces a leaf zone
    convention (e.g., _agents.example.com) containing Service Binding (SVCB) records
    (e.g., chat._agents.example.com) that encode application-specific metadata. These
    records enable agents to retrieve operational parameters prior to initiating a
    session, supporting both targeted lookups and capability-based discovery. The
    approach leverages existing DNS infrastructure, including DNS Service Discovery
    (DNS-SD), DNSSEC, and DANE, to provide integrity, authenticity, and automation
    without requiring human intervention. Lastly, the draft for Domain Control Validation
    (DCV) proposes a best current practice to prove an agent is authorized to act
    on behalf of a domain. _This document proposes no change to the structure of DNS
    messages, and no new operation codes, response codes, resource record types, or
    any other new DNS protocol values._</p>"

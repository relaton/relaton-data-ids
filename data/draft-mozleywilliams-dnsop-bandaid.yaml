  content: "   The emerging field of agent-to-agent protocol standards introduces\n
    \  new requirements in order to facilitate discovery, trust signaling,\n   session
    negotiation and communication.  This document specifies a\n   method for utilizing
    the Domain Name System (DNS) to facilitate\n   scalable and interoperable discovery
    between AI agents.  The proposed\n   mechanism, referred to as _Brokered Agent
    Network for DNS AI\n   Discovery_ (BANDAID), defines a structured DNS namespace
    and record\n   usage model to support metadata exchange and capability\n   advertisement.\n\n
    \  BANDAID introduces a leaf zone convention (e.g., _agents.example.com)\n   containing
    Service Binding (SVCB) records (e.g.,\n   chat._agents.example.com) that encode
    application-specific metadata.\n   These records enable agents to retrieve operational
    parameters prior\n   to initiating a session, supporting both targeted lookups
    and\n   capability-based discovery.  The approach leverages existing DNS\n   infrastructure,
    including DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), DNSSEC, and\n   DANE, to provide integrity,
    authenticity, and automation without\n   requiring human intervention.  Lastly,
    the draft for Domain Control\n   Validation (DCV) proposes a best current practice
    to prove an agent\n   is authorized to act on behalf of a domain.\n\n   _This
    document proposes no change to the structure of DNS messages,\n   and no new operation
    codes, response codes, resource record types, or\n   any other new DNS protocol
    values._\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: '<p>The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
    of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor the new incoming
    algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the required data lifetimes.
    The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptanalysis,
    while the incoming post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
    mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that have not had
    sufficient maturing time to rule out classical cryptanalytic attacks and implementation
    bugs. Cautious implementer may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such that
    an attacker would need to break all of them in order to compromise the data being
    protected. For digital signatures, this is referred to as "dual", and for encryption
    key establishment this as referred to as "hybrid". This document, and its companions,
    defines a specific instantiation of the dual and hybrid paradigm called "composite"
    where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key, signature,
    or key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) such that they can be treated as a single
    atomic object at the protocol level. EDNOTE: the terms "dual" and "hybrid" are
    currently in flux. We anticipate an Informational draft to normalize terminology,
    and will update this draft accordingly. This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue,
    and CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective structure for each
    component algorithm. The generic composite variant is defined which allows arbitrary
    combinations of signature algorithms to be used in the CompositeSignatureValue
    and CompositeParams structures without needing the combination to be pre-registered
    or pre-agreed. The explicit variant is also defined which allows for a set of
    signature algorithm identifier OIDs to be registered together as an explicit composite
    signature algorithm and assigned an OID. This document is intended to be coupled
    with corresponding documents that define the structure and semantics of composite
    public and private keys and encryption [I-D.draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-
    01], however may also be used with non-composite keys, such as when a protocol
    combines multiple certificates into a single cryptographic operation.</p>'

  content: "   The Content Provenance Profile (CPP) is an open specification for\n
    \  cryptographically verifiable media capture provenance.  This document\n   defines
    the core data model, hashing conventions, Merkle tree\n   construction rules,
    RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Authority (TSA) anchoring\n   protocol, and offline verification
    procedures for CPP.\n\n   CPP enables capture devices to produce tamper-evident
    provenance\n   records that bind media content to external timestamps via trusted\n
    \  third parties.  Unlike self-attestation models, CPP requires\n   independent
    timestamp verification through RFC 3161 TSA services,\n   providing externally
    verifiable proof of when media was captured.\n\n   This revision (-01) incorporates
    implementation experience from\n   multi-platform deployments, adding self-attested
    signer identity,\n   hardware-backed key requirements, chain context for partial\n
    \  submission detection, depth analysis extensions for screen detection,\n   and
    a Pre-Publish Verification Extension for social media sharing\n   workflows.  It
    also defines interoperability mappings with the C2PA\n   specification.\n\n\t "

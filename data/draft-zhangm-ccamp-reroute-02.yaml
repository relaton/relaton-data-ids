  content: "   The ubiquitous presence of the internet coupled with the increasing\n
    \  demand for high bandwidth dedicated large scale network has made it\n   imperative
    that the multi-domain networks are facilitated by the\n   development of GMPLS.
    \ In such large scale network, the high\n   performance network survivability
    is a significant factor to resist\n   the fault service discontinue and interruption
    even to decrease\n   economic loss and the society impact.  This document proposes
    a\n   series of network survivability evaluation metrics and methodologies\n   that
    can be used to demonstrate the network survivability performance\n   in single
    and multi-domain GMPLS networks, more specifically, the\n   network fault restoration
    performance.\n\n\t "

- language: en

  content: "This memo describes an extension to LDP signaling that enables the PW\nownership
    transfer between the Management Plane and the Control\nPlane.  This document defines
    all PW transfer related procedures.\nThis includes the handling of failure conditions
    and subsequent\nreversion to original state.  A basic premise of the extension
    is\nthat the transfer procedures must never impact an already established\nData
    plane connection.\n\t "

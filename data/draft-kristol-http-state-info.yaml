  content: "HTTP, the protocol that underpins the World-Wide Web (WWW), is stateless.
    \ That is, each request stands on its own; origin servers don't need to remember
    what happened with previous requests to service a new one.  Statelessness is a
    mixed blessing, because there are potential WWW applications, like ``shopping
    baskets'' and library browsing, for which the history of a user's actions is useful
    or essential.                    This proposal outlines a way to introduce state
    into HTTP.  A new request/response header, State-Info, carries the state back
    and forth, thus relieving the origin server from needing to keep an extensive
    per-user or per-connection database.  The changes required to user agents, origin
    servers, and proxy servers to support State-Info are very modest.\n\t "

  content: "The current Internet fairness paradigm mandates that all protocols\nhave
    equivalent response to packet loss, such that relatively simple\nnetwork devices
    can attain a weak form of fairness by sending uniform\nsignals to all flows.  This
    \"TCP-friendly\" paradigm has been the\npolicy of the IETF for nearly two decades.
    \ Although it was only an\ninformal policy in the beginning, it progressively
    became more formal\nfollowing the publication of RFC 2001 in 1997.\n\nHowever
    we observe two trends that differ from this policy: an\nincreasing number of environments
    where applications and other\ncircumstances create situations that are \"unfair\",
    and ISPs that are\nresponding to these situation by imposing traffic control in
    the\nnetwork itself.\n\nThis note explores the question of whether TCP-friendly
    paradigm is\nstill appropriate for the huge breadth of technology and scale\nencompassed
    by today's global Internet.  It considers the merits and\ndifficulties of changing
    IETF policy to embrace these changes by\nprogressively moving the responsibility
    for capacity allocation from\nthe end-system to the network.  Ultimately this
    policy change might\neliminate or redefine the requirement that all protocols
    be \"TCP-\nFriendly\".\n\nThis note is intended foster discussion in the community
    and\neventually become input to the IESG and IAB, where it might evolve\ninto
    a future architecture statement.\n\t "

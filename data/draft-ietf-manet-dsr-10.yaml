  content: "The Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is a simple and efficient routing
    protocol designed specifically for use in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks of
    mobile nodes.  DSR allows the network to be completely self-organizing and self-configuring,
    without the need for any existing network infrastructure or administration.  The
    protocol is composed of the two main mechanisms of \"Route Discovery\" and \"Route
    Maintenance\", which work together to allow nodes to discover and maintain routes
    to arbitrary destinations in the ad hoc network.  All aspects of the protocol
    operate entirely on demand, allowing the routing packet overhead of DSR to scale
    automatically to only what is needed to react to changes in the routes currently
    in use.  The protocol allows multiple routes to any destination and allows each
    sender to select and control the routes used in routing its packets, for example,
    for use in load balancing or for increased robustness.  Other advantages of the
    DSR protocol include easily guaranteed loop-free routing, operation in networks
    containing unidirectional links, use of only \"soft state\" in routing, and very
    rapid recovery when routes in the network change.  The DSR protocol is designed
    mainly for mobile ad hoc networks of up to about two hundred nodes and is designed
    to work well even with very high rates of mobility.  This document specifies the
    operation of the DSR protocol for routing unicast IPv4 packets.  This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   This document discusses a simplified regular DNS query (resolving\n
    \  from a domain name to IP address(es)) method under IPv4/IPv6 mixed\n   environment.\n\n
    \  With current DNS query method under IPv4/IPv6 mixed environment, it\n   requires
    for a client to issue Two pairs of DNS query/response\n   messages (one for A(IPv4)
    record, the other for AAAA(IPv6) record)\n   to obtain all of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    of the node with its One\n   domain name argument.\n\n   It is clear that the
    current method (that requires to issue Two\n   pairs of DNS query/response messages
    for One domain name resolving)\n   is not sophisticated and not optimized for
    current IPv4/IPv6 mixed\n   environment.\n\n   The method was designed at the
    initial stage of IPv6 deployment\n   (when IPv6 was minority). At that time, it
    was a best practical\n   solution. However, now IPv6 is widely spreading. The
    current DNS\n   query method is getting problematic and will never last to the\n
    \  future IPv6 fully deployed environment.\n\n   Goals of this document are:\n
    \    1. to clarify the problems of current regular DNS query method\n     2. to
    propose a simplified regular DNS query method:\n       (\"One pair of DNS query/response
    messages for One domain name\n      resolving\")\n       that is suitable for
    current IPv4/IPv6 mixed environment.\n\n\n\t "

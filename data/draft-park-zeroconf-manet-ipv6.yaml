abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The concept of IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SAA) lends\nitself
    easily to a mobile ad hoc network where no administrative\nconfigurations are
    available. However, the SAA designed to operate\non a single link is not directly
    applicable to the mobile ad hoc\nnetwork with multi-hop paths. In this document,
    we extend the\ncurrent SAA to overcome this limitation by using the IPv6 site-\nlocal
    address.\n\t "

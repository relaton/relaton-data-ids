abstract:
- content: "<p>In confidential computing, device assignment (DA) is the method by
    which a device (e.g., network adapter, GPU), whether on-chip or behind a PCIe
    Root Port, is assigned to a Trusted Virtual Machine (TVM). For the TVM to trust
    an assigned device, the device must provide the TVM with attestation Evidence
    confirming its identity and the state of its firmware and configuration. Since
    Evidence claims can be processed by 3rd party entities (e.g., Verifiers, Relying
    Parties) external to the TVM, there is a need to standardize the representation
    of DA-related information in Evidence to ensure interoperability. This document
    defines an attestation Evidence format for DA as an EAT (Entity Attestation Token)
    profile.</p>"

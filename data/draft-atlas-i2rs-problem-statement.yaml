  content: "   As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid\n
    \  and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even\n   the
    simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the\n   ability to
    quickly interact with more complex operations such as\n   policy-based controls.\n\n
    \  In order to enable network applications to have access to and control\n   over
    information in the Internet's routing system, we need a publicly\n   documented
    interface specification.  The interface needs to support\n   real-time, asynchronous
    interactions using data models and encodings\n   that are efficient and potentially
    different from those available\n   today.  Furthermore, the interface must be
    tailored to support a\n   variety of use cases.\n\n   This document expands upon
    these statements of requirements to\n   provide a detailed problem statement for
    an Interface to the Routing\n   System (I2RS).\n\n\t "

  content: "LDAP was originally developed as a lightweight protocol but through its\ndevelopment
    it has added many features to a point where there is very\nlittle difference in
    terms of simplicity or code size to that of DAP.\nHowever, DAP included features
    which provided efficient navigation\nthrough a multi server distributed directory
    systems (List), efficient\nretreival (Read)and the ability to provide service
    controls to select\noperation requestpriority, permit/deny chained operations
    and the\nability to select master/replica data in the operation response.\n \nLDAP
    is now widely used as the access for X.500 distributed directory\nsystems, however
    LDAP in its original form omitted the items (List, Read\nand Service Controls)
    as defined above.\nThe List/Read requirements were serviced by LDAP through the
    use of\n'pre-selected' Search operations. The Service Controls as per X.511\nfor
    distributed operation control have in most part been omitted from\nLDAP. (These
    are the subject of another proposal.)\n \nExperience in the field is showing that
    not having a List (and to a\nlesser degree, Read) operations in LDAP accessing
    to distributed\ndirectory system causes very inefficient multi server\nnavigation
    compared to that of an LDAP Search being used. A Search\noperation is the most
    complicated of directory services, yet in the LDAP\ncase it is being used for
    lesser and more efficient functions.\n\nFor instance, in the LDAP only multi -
    server environments, not having\na List operation causes considerable  client
    re processing and protocol\nexchanges due to dealing with system referrals. This
    leads to extended\nuser/client response times. For those who have already implemented
    a\nLDAP Search operation a Read and List should be of little consequence.\n \nThis
    document defines two additional operations for LDAP namely List\nand Read that
    extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP] operations to provide a simple\nnavigation/browsing and
    information retrieval mechanism by which a\nLDAP client can be\n\t "

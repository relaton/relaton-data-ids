  content: "This draft presents a Feedback Control extension to Differentiated\nServices.
    Differentiated Services have been designed for scalability\nthrough handling aggregates
    of traffic instead of individual flows as\nin the Integrated Services. However,
    it has been observed that the DS\nmechanism in some situations can hardly achieve
    the desired quality of\nservice and may result in unfair conditions.  To remedy
    these\nproblems, this draft describes a general feedback control paradigm\nthat
    enables a network provider to impose a control mechanism upon\ntheir DS domain.
    As an instance of the general framework, a feedback\ncontrol mechanism is proposed.
    Our simulation analysis demonstrates\nthat the overall feedback controlled DS
    can offer a better resource\nutilisation and a fair resource sharing. Such control
    mechanism can\nalso help enforce the desired service assurances. This document
    is\nintended to stimulate discussion in this direction. Further work is\nrequired
    to carefully define a set of primitive requirements that\nenables interoperability.\n

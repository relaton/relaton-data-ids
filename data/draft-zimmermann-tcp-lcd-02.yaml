  content: "Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity which last longer than\none
    retransmission timeout cause suboptimal TCP performance.  The\nreason for the
    performance degradation is that TCP interprets segment\nloss induced by connectivity
    disruptions as a sign of congestion,\nresulting in repeated backoffs of the retransmission
    timer.  This\nleads in turn to a deferred detection of the re-establishment of
    the\nconnection since TCP waits until the next retransmission timeout\noccurs
    before attempting the retransmission.\n\nThis document describes how standard
    ICMP messages can be exploited\nto disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion
    loss caused\nby long connectivity disruptions.  Moreover, a revert strategy of
    the\nretransmission timer is specified that enables a more prompt\ndetection of
    whether the connectivity to a previously disconnected\npeer node has been restored
    or not.  The specified algorithm is a TCP\nsender-only modification that effectively
    improves TCP performance in\npresence of connectivity disruptions.\n\t "

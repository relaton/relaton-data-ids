  content: "   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come\n
    \  the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different\n   cryptographic
    algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual\n   post-quantum algorithms
    is at question, a multi-key cryptographic\n   operation will need to be performed
    in such a way that breaking it\n   requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually.\n   This requires defining new structures for holding composite
    signature\n   data.\n\n   This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue,
    and\n   CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective structure for\n
    \  each component algorithm.  This document also defines processes for\n   generating
    and verifying composite signatures.  This document makes\n   no assumptions about
    what the component algorithms are, provided that\n   their algorithm identifiers
    and signature generation and verification\n   processes are defined.\n\n\t "

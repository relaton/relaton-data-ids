  content: "The current usage based IPv4 address assignment policies might have\nprolonged
    the useful lifetime of IPv4 address space but this has to\nthe detriment of the
    the end-to-end architecture of the Internet.\nThis memo proposes the adoption
    of an address assignment strategy\nthat releases large blocks of IPv4 address
    space into the Internet.\nThe objective of this policy is to encourage healthy
    Internet\ndeployment models with end-to-end transparency and association of\npermanent
    connectivity with a stable IP address. This is intended to\nencourage provider
    support for open transparent Internet service\nenvironments that can be sustained
    with the adoption of IPv6.\n\n\t "

  content: "As transport of diverse traffic types such as voice, frame\nrelay, and
    ATM over MPLS become more common, the ability to detect,\nhandle and diagnose
    control and data plane defects becomes critical.\nDetection and specification
    of how to handle those defects is not\nonly important because such defects may
    not only affect the\nfundamental operation of an MPLS network, but also because
    they\nmay impact SLA commitments for customers of that network.\nThis Internet
    draft describes requirements for user and data\nplane operations and management
    (OAM) for Multi-Protocol\nLabel Switching (MPLS). These requirements have been
    gathered\nfrom network operators who have extensive experience deploying\nMPLS
    networks, similarly some of these requirements have\nappeared in other documents
    [Y1710]. This draft specifies OAM\nrequirements for MPLS, as well as for applications
    of MPLS such\nas pseudowire voice and VPN services. Those interested in specific\nissues
    relating to instrumenting MPLS for OAM purposes are directed\nto [FRAMEWORK]\n\t "

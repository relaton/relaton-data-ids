  content: "Many recent router architectures decouple the routing engine from\nthe
    forwarding engine, so that packet forwarding can continue even\nif routing software
    is not active.  The current definition of the\nBGP protocol does not support this.
    \ We propose a new variety of\nCEASE NOTIFICATION message (IBB) which indicates
    to a peer that the\nrouter sending the notification expects to be able to continue\nforwarding
    traffic for a certain period of time without an\nestablished BGP peering session.
    \ We also propose a new OPEN\nmessage (ICB) that if received during the HOLDTIME
    period, does not\nrequire conventional reestablishment of the BGP peering session.\nThese
    capabilities are useful for orderly and non-intrusive routing\nsoftware updates,
    operating system updates, AS number migration,\nredundancy and catastrophic event
    handling.\n\t "

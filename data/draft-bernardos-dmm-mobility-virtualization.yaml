  content: "   Mobility is no longer restricted to physical end systems roaming\n
    \  among radio points of attachment.  Current mobile network deployments\n   do
    not only consider the traditional client-server model, but also\n   include scenarios
    in which services are decomposed into functions\n   that run on virtualized resources,
    thus becoming virtual functions.\n   This opens the door for new scenarios in
    which mobility now includes:\n   (i) the end-system mobility (traditional scenario),
    (ii) a physical\n   resource hosting a virtual function (part of a service being
    consumed\n   by a end-system) moving, and (iii) a virtual function part of a\n
    \  service moving (migrating) to a different physical resource.  As\n   these
    scenarios are expected to be more commonly deployed in the\n   short future, this
    documents aims at presenting the new mobility-\n   related scenarios and the potential
    gaps in terms of IETF protocols.\n\n\t "

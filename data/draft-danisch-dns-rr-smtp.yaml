  content: "   This memo introduces a new authorization scheme for SMTP e-mail\n   transport.
    \ It is designed to be a simple and robust protection\n   against e-mail fraud,
    spam, and worms.  It is based solely on\n   organisational security mechanisms
    and does not require but still\n   allow use of cryptography.  This memo also
    focuses on security and\n   privacy problems and requirements in context of spam
    defense.\n   This document is part of the LMAP work of the Anti-Spam Research\n
    \  Group (ASRG) of the IRTF.\n\t "

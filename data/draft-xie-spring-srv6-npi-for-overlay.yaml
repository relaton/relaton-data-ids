  content: "   This document describes a framework and a detailed suite of network\n
    \  programming interface (NPI) examples for provisioning of underlay\n   services
    to overlay networks.  It provides background by reviewing\n   the growing pains
    that commonly faced today by enterprise for its\n   flexiable WAN sites connection.
    \ It assumes that WAN connection\n   services are and will continue to be provided
    by multiple underlay\n   networks operated by different administrative entities.
    \ Based on the\n   pains and the assumptions, this document propose to use SRv6
    binding\n   SIDs (BSIDs) on a transport network (TN) edge router as NPI for\n
    \  service provisioning to be accessed remotely and securely by a\n   customer
    router that constitutes to a higher overlay network,\n   including the requirements
    of such service, the illustration of how\n   it may work, and the possible applicability
    of the solution.\n\n\n\t "

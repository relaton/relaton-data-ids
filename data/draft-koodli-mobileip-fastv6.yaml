  content: "When a mobile node moves to a new point of attachment in the\nInternet,
    relying on router advertisements may be insufficient to\ninsure adequate performance
    of time-critical applications running on\nthe mobile node.  In many cases, other
    indications are available to\ntrigger handover of the mobile node to a new point
    of attachment,\nat a new access router.  The mobile node and the access router
    may\nthen be able to take steps, in addition to those specified for Mobile\nIPv6,
    to reduce the time during which the mobile node is effectively\ndisconnected from
    the Internet.  This specification defines the fast\nhandover problem and outlines
    a proposed solution to the problem.\n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes an IP Multicast Shortcut Service (IMSS) over a\n
    \  large ATM cloud. The service enables cut-through routing between\n   routers
    serving different Logical IP Subnets (LISs). The presented\n   solution is complementary
    to MARS [2], adopted as the IETF standard\n   solution for IP multicast over ATM.\n
    \n   IMSS consists of two orthogonal components: CONnection-oriented Group\n   address
    RESolution Service (CONGRESS) and IP multicast SErvice for\n   Non-broadcast Access
    Networking TEchnology (IP-SENATE). An IP class D\n   address is resolved into
    a set of addresses of multicast routers that\n   should receive the multicast
    traffic targeted to this class D\n   address. This task is accomplished using
    CONGRESS. The cut-through\n   routing decisions and actual data transmission are
    performed by IP-\n   SENATE.\n \n   IMSS preserves the classical LIS model [8].
    The scope of IMSS is to\n   facilitate inter-LIS cut-through routing, while MARS
    provides tools\n   for the intra-LIS IP multicast.\n\n\t "

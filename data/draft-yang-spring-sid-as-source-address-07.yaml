abstract:
- content: "<p>SRv6 is being rapidly deployed and is currently primarily used in trusted-domain
    backbone networks. However, we have also observed that SRv6 is beginning to extend
    toward end-user devices, e.g., in SD-WAN deployments. SD-WAN can be deployed in
    third-party clouds or at customer sites, causing the physical boundary of SRv6
    to become blurred. This introduces certain security issues, such as middlebox
    filtering and unauthorized access to others’ VPN in Section 8.1 and Section 6
    in [I-D.draft-ietf-spring-srv6-security]. This proposal mitigates these risks
    by using SID as source address in SRv6 packets.</p>"

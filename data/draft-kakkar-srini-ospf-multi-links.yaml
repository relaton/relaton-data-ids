  content: "OSPF is a link state IGP routing protocol, but it does not utilizes \n
    \  multiple links between adjacent routers efficiently. \n   This Memo tries to
    utilize multiple links between adjacent routers to \n   make initial adjacency
    establishment & flooding more optimized, such \n   that these procedures become
    faster and consumes lesser bandwidth.\n\t "

  content: "   This document is an implementation report for the BGP Link-State\n
    \  Shortest Path First (SPF) Routing.  The authors did not verify the\n   accuracy
    of the information provided by respondents.  The respondents\n   are experts with
    the implementations they reported on, and their\n   responses are considered authoritative
    for the implementations for\n   which their responses represent.  The respondents
    were asked to only\n   use the \"YES\" answer if the feature had at least been
    tested in the\n   lab.\n\n\n\t "

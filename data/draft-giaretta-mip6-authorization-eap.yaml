  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft defines an architecture, and related protocols, for \n   performing
    dynamic Mobile IPv6 authorization and configuration \n   relying on a AAA infrastructure.
    The necessary interaction between \n   the AAA server of the home provider and
    the mobile node is \n   realized using EAP, exploiting the capability of some
    EAP methods \n   to convey generic information items together with authentication
    \n   data. This approach has the advantage that the access equipment \n   acts
    as a simple pass-through for EAP messages and therefore does \n   not play any
    active role in the Mobile IPv6 negotiation procedure, \n   which makes the solution
    easier to deploy and maintain. \n\n\t "

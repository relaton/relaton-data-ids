  content: "   The problem of today's VoIP user agents (hardware terminals, SIP soft\n
    \  phones) is the need for quite a bit of manual configuration at the\n   initialization
    time as well as when moving from one environment to\n   another.  The information
    to be configured is typically not known by\n   the end-user.  Automatic configuration
    of SIP user agents would\n   release the user of these configuration tasks.  This
    memo describes\n   the challenges of auto-configuration of SIP user agents and
    gives\n   some requirements for further discussions.\n\t "

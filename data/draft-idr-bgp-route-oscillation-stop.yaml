  content: "   In this document we present two sets of paths for an address prefix\n
    \  that can be advertised by a BGP route reflector or confederation ASBR\n   to
    eliminate the MED-induced route oscillations in a network.  The\n   first set
    involves all the available paths, and would achieve the\n   same routing consistency
    as the full IBGP mesh.  The second set,\n   which is a subset of the first one,
    involves the neighbor-AS based\n   Group Best Paths, and would be sufficient to
    eliminate the MED-\n   induced route oscillations (subject to certain commonly
    adopted\n   topological constrains).\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines methodologies for benchmarking the performance
    of intra-domain and inter-domain source address validation (SAV) mechanisms. SAV
    mechanisms are utilized to generate SAV rules to prevent source address spoofing,
    and have been implemented with many various designs in order to perform SAV in
    the corresponding scenarios. This document takes the approach of considering a
    SAV device to be a black box, defining the methodology in a manner that is agnostic
    to the mechanisms. This document provides a method for measuring the performance
    of existing and new SAV implementations.</p>"

  content: "   Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting up\n   networks
    so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does\n   not rely on centralized
    deployed anchors to provide IP mobility\n   support.\n\n   There are many different
    approaches to address Distributed Mobility\n   Management, as for example extending
    network-based mobility protocols\n   (like Proxy Mobile IPv6), or client-based
    mobility protocols (as\n   Mobile IPv6), among others.  This document follows
    the former\n   approach, and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in
    which\n   mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called\n   distributed
    gateway).  The distributed gateway is an enhanced access\n   router which is also
    able to operate as local mobility anchor or\n   mobility access gateway, on a
    per prefix basis.  The draft focuses on\n   the required extensions to effectively
    support simultaneously\n   anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways.\n\n
    \  This draft introduces the concept of distributed logical interface\n   (at
    the distributed gateway), which is a software construct that\n   allows to easily
    hide the change of anchor from the mobile node.\n   Additionally, the draft describes
    how to provide session continuity\n   in inter-domain scenarios in which dynamic
    tunneling or signaling\n   between distributed gateways from different operators
    is not allowed.\n\n\n\t "

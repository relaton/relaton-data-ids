  content: "   For a Traffic Engineered (TE) point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label\n   Switched
    Path (LSP), it is preferable in some cases to re-evaluate\n   and re-optimize
    the entire P2MP-TE LSP by re-signaling all its\n   Source-to-Leaf (S2L) sub-LSP(s).
    \ Existing mechanisms, a mechanism\n   for an ingress Label Switched Router (LSR)
    to trigger a new path re-\n   evaluation request and a mechanism for a mid-point
    LSR to notify an\n   availability of a preferred path, operate on an individual
    or a sub-\n   group of S2L sub-LSP(s) basis only.\n\n   This document defines
    RSVP-TE signaling extensions to allow an\n   ingress node of a P2MP-TE LSP to
    request the re-evaluation of the\n   entire LSP tree containing one or more S2L
    sub-LSPs whose paths are\n   loose (or abstract) hop expanded, and for a mid-point
    LSR to notify\n   to the ingress node that a preferable tree exists for the entire\n
    \  P2MP-TE LSP.  This document also defines markers to indicate\n   beginning
    and end of a S2L sub-LSP descriptor list when RSVP message\n   needs to be fragmented
    due to large number of S2L sub-LSPs when\n   performing re-optimization.\n\n\n\t "

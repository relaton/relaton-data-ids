  content: "   Web-based malware and attacks are proliferating rapidly on the\n   Internet.
    \ New web security mechanisms are also rapidly growing in\n   number, although
    in an incoherent fashion.  This document provides a\n   brief overview of the
    present situation and the various seemingly\n   piece-wise approaches being taken
    to mitigate the threats.  It then\n   provides an overview of requirements as
    presently being expressed by\n   the community in various online and face-to-face
    discussions.\n\n\t "

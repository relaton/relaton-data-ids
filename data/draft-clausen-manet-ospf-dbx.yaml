  content: "   This memo describes a mechanism providing database exchange and\n   reliable
    transmission capabilities in a way which is adapted to link\n   state routing
    on ad hoc networks.  This mechanism is specified in\n   this document for wireless
    OSPF interfaces as specified in draft-\n   spagnolo-manet-ospf-wireless-interface-00.txt.
    \ A signature exchange\n   technique is proposed, providing a very compact way
    for the nodes to\n   communicate and compare the state of their respective link-state\n
    \  databases.  Upon receiving such a signature, a node can quickly\n   detect
    if a discrepancy is present and, furthermore, determine which\n   information
    must be exchanged in order to alleviate this discrepancy.\n\t "

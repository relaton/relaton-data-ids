  content: "   A Fibre Channel pseudowire (PW) is used to carry Fibre Channel frames
    \n   over an MPLS network. This enables service providers to offer \n   \"emulated\"
    Fibre Channel services over existing MPLS networks. This \n   document specifies
    the mechanisms controlling the reliable transport \n   of Fibre Channel PW over
    MPLS networks. The encapsulation of Fibre \n   Channel PDUs within a pseudowire
    and the procedures for using a PW to \n   provide a Fibre Channel service are
    specified in [FC-encap]. \n\t "

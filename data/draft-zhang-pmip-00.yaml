  content: "As the number of Mobile IP users grow so will the signaling overhead\non
    the core IP network in support of mobility management. In cellular\nnetworks registration
    and paging techniques are used to minimize the\nsignaling overhead and optimize
    the mobility management performance.\nCurrently, Mobile IP supports registration
    but not paging. We believe\nthat Mobile IP support for paging is important to
    improve the\nscalability of Mobile IP networks. Recently, a number of micro-\nmobility
    protocols [8] have been proposed that have built-in paging\nfunctions. These micro-mobility
    protocols are independent of the base\nMobile IP protocol and interwork with Mobile
    IP [2] through mobile\ngateways. We take a different approach and propose a minimal
    set of\npaging extensions to the base Mobile IP called P-MIP. P-MIP is\ndesigned
    to reduce signaling load in the core Internet and power\nconsumption of mobile
    nodes. In this draft, P-MIP, which assumes the\nuse of foreign agents, is described
    and the construction of paging\nareas, movement detection, registration, paging
    and data handling are\npresented.\n\t "

  content: "   This document extends the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Internet Draft to
    \n   include the reception and transmission of Any Source Multicast \n   traffic
    at the Mobile Node. It introduces handover mechanisms for \n   IPv6 mobile multicast
    listeners and mobile multicast senders. \n   Operations are based on a Mobile
    IPv6 environment with local mobility \n   anchor points. These local anchor points
    are conformal with a \n   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 proxy infrastructure. Handover
    latencies in \n   the proposed scheme remain bound to link switching delays with
    \n   respect to these local proxy points. Thus the M-HMIPv6 achieves \n   seamless
    mobility, even though no bicasting of multicast streams is \n   used. Multicast
    listeners in addition encounter the option to \n   optimize multicast routing
    by turning to a direct data reception. \n   The mechanisms described in this document
    do not rely on assumptions \n   of any specific multicast routing protocol in
    use. The M-HMIPv6 \n   protocol operations utilize the existing HMIPv6, MIPv6
    and MLDv2 \n   messages under minor extensions. \n\t "

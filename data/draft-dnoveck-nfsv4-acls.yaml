  content: "   This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the\n
    \  description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc5661bis\n   respecification
    effort for NFSv4.1.  It describes the structure and\n   function of NFsv4 Access
    Control Lists within all existing minor\n   versions of NFSv4.\n\n   It describes
    the structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their role in the NFSv4\n   security architecture.
    \ While the focus of this document is on the\n   role of ACLs in providing a more
    flexible approach to file access\n   authorization than is made available by the
    POSIX-derived\n   authorization-related attributes, the potential provision of
    other\n   security-related functionality is covered as well.\n\n   [Consensus
    Needed (Item #117a)]: Because of the failure of previous\n   specifications to
    provide a satisfactory approach to either of the\n   two ACL models for which
    support was originally intended, this\n   document clarifies the status of draft-POSIX
    ACLs, with the\n   expectation that support for these might be provided via a
    later\n   extension.  In addition, this document will include some small\n   protocol
    extensions to correct protocol defects, as provided for in\n   RFC8178.\n\n   [Consensus
    Needed (Item #117a)]: In this document, the relationship\n   among the multiple
    ACL models for which support was intended has\n   changed.  A core set of functionality,
    shared in large part with that\n   derived from a subset of the functionality
    provided by the now-\n   withdrawn draft-POSIX ACLs is presented as the conceptual
    base of the\n   feature set.  Additional sets of features used to provide the\n
    \  functionality within the NFSv4 ACL model and the full draft-POSIX ACL\n   model
    are considered as OPTIONAL extensions to that core, with the\n   latter not yet
    present in NFsv4.1.\n\n   [RFC Editor: please remove this parapgraph and the following\n
    \  paragraph prior to publishing this document as an RFC].\n\n   The current version
    of the document is intended, in large part, to\n   result in working group discussion
    regarding repairing problems with\n   previous specifications of ACL-related features
    and to enable work to\n   provide a greater degree of interoperability than has
    been available\n   heretofore.  The drafts provide a framework for addressing
    these\n   issues and obtaining working group consensus regarding changes that\n
    \  will be necesasary before publication of RFCTBD10.\n\n   When the resulting
    document is eventually published as an RFC, it\n   will supersede the descriptions
    of ACL structure and semantics\n   appearing in existing minor version specification
    documents for\n   NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby updating RFC7530 and RFC8881.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Filters for Mobile Ad hoc networks (NOMADHOC) introduces a set of \n
    \  extensions applicable to a range of on-demand ad hoc networking \n   protocols
    that allow an ad hoc node to distribute its active flows \n   across multiple
    routing paths. These extensions are based on the \n   filter structure defined
    in NOMAD to enable a filtering behavior at \n   the originator and the destination
    nodes.  \n\t "

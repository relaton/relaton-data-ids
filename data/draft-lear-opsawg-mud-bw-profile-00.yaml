  content: "   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) are a means by which devices\n
    \  can establish expectations about how they are intended to behave, and\n   how
    the network should treat them.  Earlier work focused on access\n   control.  This
    draft specifies a means by which manufacturers can\n   express to deployments
    what form of bandwidth profile devices are\n   expected to have with respect to
    specific services.\n\n\t "

  content: "   RBridges provide the ability to have an entire campus, with multiple
    \n   physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows \n   for
    zero configuration of switches within a campus, optimal pair-wise \n   routing,
    safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and \n   the ability to
    cut down on ARP/ND traffic. The design also supports \n   VLANs, and allows forwarding
    tables to be based on RBridge \n   destinations (rather than endnode destinations),
    which allows \n   internal routing tables to be substantially smaller than in
    \n   conventional bridge systems.  \n\n   This document is a work in progress;
    we invite you to participate on \n   the mailing list at http://www.postel.org/RBridge

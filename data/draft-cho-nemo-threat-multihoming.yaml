  content: "   In mobile networks, the Mobile Router (MR) is an operational main \n
    \  entity. With multiple MRs, mobile networks can provide the stability \n   of
    service. And, there already exist various multi-homing scenarios. \n   However,
    because of mobility and MR-HA relations, there are several \n   security problems
    in multi-homed mobile networks. In this draft, we \n   identify threats to multi-homed
    mobile networks. And we will \n   illustrate several scenarios of Denial-of-Service
    (DoS) attacks, \n   Redirection attacks, and Replay attacks.    \n\t "

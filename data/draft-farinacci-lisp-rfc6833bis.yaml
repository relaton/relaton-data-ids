  content: "   This document describes the Control-Plane and Mapping Service for the\n
    \  Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), implemented by two new types\n   of
    LISP-speaking devices -- the LISP Map-Resolver and LISP Map-Server\n   -- that
    provides a simplified \"front end\" for one or more Endpoint ID\n   to Routing
    Locator mapping databases.\n\n   By using this control-plane service interface
    and communicating with\n   Map-Resolvers and Map-Servers, LISP Ingress Tunnel
    Routers (ITRs) and\n   Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) are not dependent on the details
    of\n   mapping database systems, which facilitates experimentation with\n   different
    database designs.  Since these devices implement the \"edge\"\n   of the LISP
    infrastructure, connect directly to LISP-capable Internet\n   end sites, and comprise
    the bulk of LISP-speaking devices, reducing\n   their implementation and operational
    complexity should also reduce\n   the overall cost and effort of deploying LISP.\n\n\t "

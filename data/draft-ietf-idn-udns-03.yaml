  content: "Since the Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] was created there have\nbeen
    a desire to use other characters than ASCII in domain names.\nLately this desire
    have grown very strong and several groups have\nstarted to experiment with non-ASCII
    names.  This document defines\nhow the Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646]
    is to be used in\nDNS.  It includes both a transition scheme for older software\nsupporting
    non-ASCII handling in applications only, as well as how to\nuse UCS in labels
    and having more than 63 octets in a label.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a new domain, _service., which can be used for\n
    \  automatic service configuration and discovery.  The associated\n   anycast
    prefixes can be used to configure a default DNS server, which\n   provides lookups
    for a local _service. domain but also acts as a\n   (caching) recursive DNS server,
    thus allowing DNS clients to use this\n   well-known address as their default
    DNS server as well as to use it\n   to find various well known services, thus
    avoiding manual\n   configuration.\n\t "

  content: "   Modulated optical interfaces with coherent detection receivers are
    in\n   widespread use in Internet networking equipment.  Various\n   implementations
    are in deployment since 2012 but there is no standard\n   available defining those
    interfaces, nor their capabilities.  This\n   document identifies the need for
    work on control plane aspects pre-\n   standard coherent optical DWDM applications.\n\n\t "

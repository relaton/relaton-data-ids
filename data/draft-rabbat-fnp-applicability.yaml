  content: "The Fault Notification Protocol (FNP) is a set of procedures designed\nto
    enable time-bounded failure notification in networks using an IP-\nbased control
    plane. This document discusses the applicability of FNP\nin the context of optical
    transport networks. It highlights the\nprotocol?s principles of operation, and
    then describes the network,\nnode, fault, and operational models in optical networks
    for which the\nprotocol is designed. It also discusses the relationship to higher\nlayers,
    and issues of scalability. Some guidelines for deployment are\nalso provided.\n\t "

abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   This document provides a methodology for automatically allocating\n
    \  IPv6 [RFC2460] address blocks for networks that run BGP [RFC4271] and\n   are
    either single-homed or multi-homed [BARBER2011].  The automatic\n   allocation
    is taken from a specific /16 block assigned by IANA for\n   this purpose.\n\n
    \  Networks that require more than this single /48 can still request\n   additional
    allocations via the existing RIR process.  Networks are\n   not forced to use
    this allocation and can ignore this completely.\n   Availability of the /48 assignment
    via this mechanism does not change\n   existing mechanisms for obtaining IPv6
    assignments through the\n   existing RIR (Regional Internet Registry) or LIR (Local
    Internet\n   Registry) mechanisms.\n\n   There is an implicit assumption that
    it's a good thing to promote\n   networks to enable IPv6 with a near-zero effort.\n\n\t "

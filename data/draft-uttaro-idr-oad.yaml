- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The notional premise that different Autonomous Systems belong to\n
    \  different administrative authorities may not always hold.  A single\n   administrative
    authority may instantiate services on and across\n   multiple ASes.  A customer
    accessing those services can reasonably\n   expect that attributes such as LOCAL_PREF
    that influence routing be\n   applicable even across different ASes.  This document
    describes a\n   mechanism to do so.\n\n\t "

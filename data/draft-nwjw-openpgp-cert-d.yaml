  content: "   This document defines a generic OpenPGP certificate store that can
    be\n   shared between implementations.  It also defines a way to root trust,\n
    \  and a way to associate petnames with certificates.  Sharing\n   certificates
    and trust decisions increases security by enabling more\n   applications to take
    advantage of OpenPGP.  It also improves privacy\n   by reducing the required certificate
    discoveries that go out to the\n   network.\n\n\t "

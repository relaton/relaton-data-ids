  content: "   The DNS query aggregation mechanism is a critical defense against DNS\n
    \  cache poisoning attacks that exploit the \"Birthday Paradox\".\n   However,
    recent research has revealed that flawed implementations of\n   the EDNS Client
    Subnet (ECS) option, as specified in RFC 7871, can be\n   exploited to bypass
    this defense.  This allows attackers to force a\n   resolver to issue multiple
    simultaneous queries for the same domain\n   name by crafting queries with different
    ECS options.  This\n   vulnerability revives the classic DNS Birthday Attack,
    posing a\n   significant threat to DNS resolvers and the clients they serve.\n\n
    \  This document specifies a stricter and more coherent processing model\n   for
    the ECS option in DNS resolvers.  It introduces a mechanism for\n   resolvers
    to track the ECS support state of authoritative nameservers\n   and mandates query
    aggregation for zones determined to not support\n   ECS.  These changes are designed
    to close the identified\n   vulnerability and restore the effectiveness of query
    aggregation as a\n   defense mechanism.\n\n\t "

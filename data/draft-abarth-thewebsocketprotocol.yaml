  content: "The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a user\nagent
    running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to a\nremote host that
    has opted-in to communications from that code.  The\nsecurity model used for this
    is the Origin-based security model\ncommonly used by Web browsers.  The protocol
    consists of an initial\nhandshake followed by basic message framing, layered over
    TCP.  The\ngoal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based\napplications
    that need two-way communication with servers that does\nnot rely on opening multiple
    HTTP connections (e.g. using\nXMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).\n\nPlease
    send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.\n\t "

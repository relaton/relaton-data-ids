  content: "As the work of the NSIS working group has begun there are also \nconcerns
    about security and its implication for the design of a \nsignaling protocol. In
    order to understand the security properties \nand available options of RSVP a
    number of documents have to be read. \nThis document tries to summarize the security
    properties of RSVP and \nto view them from a different point of view. This work
    in NSIS is \npart of the overall process of analyzing other protocols and to \nlearn
    from their design considerations. This document should also \nprovide a starting
    point for further discussions. \n    \n\n\t "

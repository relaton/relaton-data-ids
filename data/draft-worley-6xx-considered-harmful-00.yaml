abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "\n   The specification of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) permits
    a\n   user agent (UA) that receives a call to generate a response in the\n   \"6xx
    class\" that not only rejects the call but also requires the\n   termination of
    all attempts to route the call to alternative\n   destinations.  As the call may
    have reached the UA through multiple\n   forwardings whose meanings cannot be
    known by the UA, the global\n   termination of alternative routing can only rarely
    be correctly\n   requested by the UA.  Because such responses are almost never\n
    \  appropriate, ability of a UA to generate such responses is harmful,\n   and
    all 6xx class responses should be replaced with 4xx class\n   responses with similar
    meanings.  However, there is no 4xx class\n   response similar to \"603 Decline\",
    and so one needs to be created.\n\n\t "

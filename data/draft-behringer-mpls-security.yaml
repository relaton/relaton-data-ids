  content: "This document analyses the security of the BGP/MPLS IP virtual private
    network (VPN) architecture that is described in RFC 4364, for the benefit of service
    providers and VPN users.\n\n The analysis shows that BGP/MPLS IP VPN networks
    can be as secure as traditional layer-2 VPN services using Asynchronous Transfer
    Mode (ATM) or Frame Relay. This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "A network may comprise multiple layers. It is important to globally optimize
    network resource utilization, taking into account all layers rather than optimizing
    resource utilization at each layer independently. This allows better network efficiency
    to be achieved through a process that we call inter-layer traffic engineering.
    The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool to achieve inter-layer
    traffic engineering.\n\n This document describes a framework for applying the
    PCE-based architecture to inter-layer Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) traffic engineering. It provides suggestions for the
    deployment of PCE in support of multi-layer networks. This document also describes
    network models where PCE performs inter-layer traffic engineering, and the relationship
    between PCE and a functional component called the Virtual Network Topology Manager
    (VNTM). This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

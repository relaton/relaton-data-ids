  content: "Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) is a generic mechanism to statelessly\nestablish
    tunnels, point-to-multipoint, for packets of an address\nfamily that traverse
    domains whose routing is in another address\nfamily (mesh softwires).  It extends
    tunneling principles of [6rd] to\nother address-family combination than IPv6 across
    IPv4 domains.  It\nthus introduces, for a variety of use cases, a simpler mesh-softwire\nmodel
    than that of [RFC5565].\n\nAmong SAM use cases, some are solutions to previously
    unsolved\nproblems: native IPv6 across IPv4 NATs, with optimized paths;\nmultihoming
    with independent CPEs and provider-aggregatable prefixes;\npublic IPv4 addresses
    across IPv6-only domains with optimized paths;\nstatic sharing of IPv4 addresses,
    without impact on routing\ninformation bases.\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides an architectural framework for network\n   telemetry
    to address the current and future network operation\n   challenges and requirements.
    \ As evidenced by the defining\n   characteristics and industry practice, network
    telemetry covers\n   technologies and protocols beyond the conventional network\n
    \  Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM).  Network telemetry\n   promises
    better flexibility, scalability, accuracy, coverage, and\n   performance and allows
    automated control loops to suit both today's\n   and tomorrow's network operation
    requirements.  This document\n   clarifies the terminologies and classifies the
    modules and components\n   of a network telemetry system.  The framework and taxonomy
    help to\n   set a common ground for the collection of related work and provide\n
    \  guidance for future technique and standard developments.\n\n\t "

  content: "Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a layer 2 VPN service that \n   provides
    multipoint connectivity in the form of an Ethernet emulated    \n   LAN, while
    usual L2 VPN services are typically point-to-point. Such \n   emulated LANs can
    span across metropolitan area networks as well as \n   wide area networks.  \n
    \   \n   [VPLS-LDP] defines a method for signaling MPLS connections between \n
    \  member PEs of a VPN and a method for forwarding Ethernet frames over \n   such
    connections. This document describes the applicability of such \n   procedures
    to provide VPLS services.  \n    \n   This document also compares the characteristics
    of this solution \n   against the requirements specified in [L2VPN-REQ]. In summary,
    there \n   are no architectural limitations to prevent the requirements from \n
    \  being met.  But meeting certain requirements (e.g. QoS) is beyond \n   the
    specification of [VPLS-LDP], and requires careful planning and \n   precise implementation
    of the Service Provider (SP) networks. This \n   document attempts to capture
    such issues, presents the potential \n   solutions to these issues, and discusses
    the pros and cons of each \n   alternative.   \n    \n   This document does not
    cover the applicability of [VPLS-BGP].\n\t "

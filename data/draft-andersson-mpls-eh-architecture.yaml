  content: "   Extension Headers (EH) carry information on in-network services and\n
    \  functions in an MPLS network.  This document describes an\n   architecture
    for EHs and what actions an EH capable Label Switching\n   Router (LSR) takes
    when finding or not finding an EH in the packet.\n\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) is a widely deployed forwarding\n   technology.  It uses label stack entries
    that are pre-pended to\n   either the EH or the ACH which in turn is pre-pended
    to the payload.\n   The label stack entries are used to identify the forwarding
    actions\n   by each LSR.  Actions may include pushing, swapping or popping the\n
    \  labels, and using the labels to determine the next hop for forwarding\n   the
    packet.  Labels may also be used to establish the context under\n   which the
    packet is forwarded.\n\n   The extension headers are carried after the MPLS Label
    Stack, and the\n   presence of EHs are indicated in the label stack by an Extension\n
    \  Header Indicator (EHI).\n\n\t "

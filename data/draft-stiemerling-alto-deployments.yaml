  content: "Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as\npieces
    of information or server processes, which are available in\nseveral equivalent
    replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but\nis not limited to, peer-to-peer
    file sharing applications.  The goal\nof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) is to provide\nguidance to these applications, which have to select one
    or several\nhosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired\nresource.
    \ The protocol is under specification in the ALTO working\ngroup.  This memo discusses
    deployment related issues of ALTO for\npeer-to-peer and CDNs, some preliminary
    security considerations, and\nalso initial guidance for application designers
    using ALTO.\n\t "

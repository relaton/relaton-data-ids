abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an algorithm for the generation of TCP Initial
    Sequence Numbers (ISNs), such that the chances of an off-path attacker of guessing
    the sequence numbers in use by a target connection are reduced. This document
    is a revision of RFC 1948, and takes the ISN generation algorithm originally proposed
    in that document to Standards Track.</p>"

  content: "   A Segment Routing (SR) node steers a packet through an ordered list\n
    \  of instructions, called segments.  A segment can represent any\n   instruction,
    topological or service-based.  Segment Routing (SR) is a\n   protocol designed
    to forward packets on the network based on the\n   concept of source routing.
    \ The Segment Routing architecture can be\n   directly applied to the MPLS data
    plane with no change in the\n   forwarding plane.  It simplifies the MPLS control
    protocol,\n   simplifies the configuration of the network, and can achieve SDN\n
    \  better.\n\n   Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
    has the\n   ability of path planning and resource reservation.  In the process
    of\n   traditional network evolution to Segment Routing, there will\n   inevitably
    be coexistence of RSVP-TE and Segment Routing.  The\n   Document describes how
    to interact with nodes that support Segment\n   Routing capabilities and nodes
    that support RSVP-TE capabilities.\n\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "Many (if not all) terminal servers support the ability to set up a\n   telnet
    listener on a serial port.  This allows a connection to a port\n   to be made
    via the network, however only (two way) data can be\n   transferred between the
    client and the port.\n \n   By using the Remote Serial Port (RSP) telnet option,
    the client is\n   able to control non-data aspects of the port such as baud rate
    and\n   modem signals.  This is especially important where the port is\n   attached
    to a modem and modem signals are required to hangup the\n   modem.\n \n   This
    document defines a simple protocol which allows terminal servers\n   (and other
    systems which provide access to serial ports via a network\n   connection) to
    provide access to these features.\n\t "

  content: "   Some AI services drive the need to transmit RMDA packets across wide\n
    \  area network (WAN) via SRv6 tunnels.  RoCEv2 is the most popular open\n   standard
    for achieving RDMA and network offloads over ethernet, with\n   its congestion
    control based on the combination of PFC and ECN.  Due\n   to certain limitations
    of PFC and ECN, some drafts have been put\n   forward to realize more faster congestion
    notification (FANTEL).\n   Upon detection of congestion, these drafts proposals
    directly sending\n   congestion notifications to relevant nodes, enabling near
    real-time\n   congestion control.  However, in SRv6-based WAN environments,\n
    \  congestion notifications cannot be directly delivered from WAN\n   devices
    to intra-DC devices.  This document specifies new SRv6\n   Segment Identifiers
    (SIDs) and the corresponding processing rules for\n   device, supporting the forwarding
    of congestion notification across\n   domains.\n\n\t "

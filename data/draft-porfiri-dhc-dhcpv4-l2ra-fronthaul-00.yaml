  content: "   The fronthaul portion of a cellular network is the part of the\n   network
    that connects centralized radio controllers and the\n   distributed radio units
    at the edge of the cellular network.  A\n   switched fronthaul network is one
    where the connectivity is provided\n   through one or more stages of switches.\n\n
    \  When performing address assignment and configuration tasks in such\n   networks,
    knowledge of how the different devices are connected is\n   beneficial.  Networks
    that employ IPv6 can use DHCPv6 to support\n   Relay Agents.  However, those networks
    that continue to be based on\n   IPv4 have no easy way to support this, as the
    DHCPv4 support for\n   relays is limited.\n\n   This document explores how to
    provide Relay Agent functionality in\n   IPv4-based switched fronthaul networks.\n\n\t "

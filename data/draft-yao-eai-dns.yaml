  content: "   Key RFCs for internationalized email addresses specify the basic\n
    \  protocols for using them.  The SMTP client can only know the SMTP\n   server's
    ability by EHLO command.  In order to help the\n   internationalized email address
    delivery, this document suggests to\n   add the new DNS RR type for internationalized
    email protocols.\n   Through this RR type, the SMTP client can know whether the\n
    \  destination SMTP server can support the SMTPUTF8 ability before\n   sending
    the EHLO command to the server.\n\n\t "

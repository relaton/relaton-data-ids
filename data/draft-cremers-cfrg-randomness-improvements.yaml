  content: "   Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related security\n   protocols.
    \ Weak or predictable \"cryptographically-strong\"\n   pseudorandom number generators
    (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited\n   for malicious purposes.  The Dual EC
    random number backdoor and\n   Debian bugs are relevant examples of this problem.
    \ This document\n   describes a way for security protocol participants to mix
    their long-\n   term private key into the entropy pool(s) from which random values\n
    \  are derived.  This augments and improves randomness from broken or\n   otherwise
    subverted CSPRNGs.\n\n\t "

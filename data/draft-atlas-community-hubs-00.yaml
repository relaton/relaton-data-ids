  content: "   IETF Community Hubs are geographically-focused groups that facilitate\n
    \  participation in IETF activities.  An IETF Community Hub may have\n   different
    focuses, depending upon the interests of those\n   participating, such as cross-area
    learning, outreach, mentoring,\n   problem refinement, implementation and interop
    testing, and social.\n   An IETF Community Hub's focuses and the energy of its
    coordinators\n   will determine what types of activities are organized.  Sample\n
    \  activities may include sessions of technical talks, social get-\n   togethers,
    remote hubs during some IETF WG meetings, hackathons, etc.\n\n\t "

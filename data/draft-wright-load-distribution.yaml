  content: "Online traffic load distribution for a single class of service has\nbeen
    explored extensively given that extensions to IGP can provide\nloading information
    to network nodes.   To perform traffic\nengineering of load distribution for multi-service
    networks, or off\nline traffic engineering of single service networks, a control\nmechanism
    for provisioning bandwidth according to some policy must\nbe provided. This draft
    identifies the mechanisms that affect load\ndistribution and the controls for
    mechanisms that affect load\ndistribution to enable policy based traffic engineering
    of the load\ndistribution to be performed. This draft identifies the mechanisms\nthat
    affect load distribution and the control for those mechanisms\nto enable policy
    based traffic engineering of load distribution.\nThis draft also presents guidelines
    for the use of these load\ndistribution mechanisms in the context of  single IP
    network\nadministration.\n\t "

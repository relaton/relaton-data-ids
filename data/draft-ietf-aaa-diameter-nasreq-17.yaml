  content: "This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for Authentication,
    Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services in the Network Access Server (NAS)
    environment. When combined with the Diameter Base protocol, Transport Profile,
    and Extensible Authentication Protocol specifications, this application specification
    satisfies typical network access services requirements.\n\n Initial deployments
    of the Diameter protocol are expected to include legacy systems. Therefore, this
    application has been carefully designed to ease the burden of protocol conversion
    between RADIUS and Diameter. This is achieved by including the RADIUS attribute
    space to eliminate the need to perform many attribute translations.\n\n The interactions
    between Diameter applications and RADIUS specified in this document are to be
    applied to all Diameter applications. In this sense, this document extends the
    Base Diameter protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

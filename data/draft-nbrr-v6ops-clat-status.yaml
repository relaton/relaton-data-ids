  content: "   This document reports findings in the availability and operational\n
    \  performance of the client side translator (CLAT) feature within\n   464XLAT
    as defined in [RFC6877].  It also identifies remaining issues\n   in providing
    ubiquitous and efficient CLAT support on a global scale.\n   Since publication
    in April 2013, 464XLAT has made a significant\n   impact on mobile networks wishing
    to implement endpoints purely with\n   IPv6.  This has allowed the IPv6 Internet
    to expand dramatically as\n   well as increase IPv6 deployments across wireline
    and enterprise-\n   style networks.\n\n\t "

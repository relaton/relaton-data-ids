  content: "   This document is intended to provide operational guidelines for\n   datacenter
    operators planning to deploy IPv6 in their\n   infrastructures.  It aims to offer
    a reference framework for\n   evaluating different products and architectures,
    and therefore it is\n   also addressed to manufacturers and solution providers,
    so they can\n   use it to gauge their solutions.  We believe this will translate
    in a\n   smoother and faster IPv6 transition for datacenters of these\n   infrastuctures.\n\n
    \  The document focuses on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation,\n   and
    the aspects related to DC interconnection through IPv6.  It does\n   not consider
    the particular mechanisms for making Internet services\n   provided by applications
    hosted in the DC available through IPv6\n   beyond the specific aspects related
    to how their deployment on the\n   Data Center (DC) infrastructure.\n\n   Apart
    from facilitating the transition to IPv6, the mechanisms\n   outlined here are
    intended to make this transition as transparent as\n   possible (if not completely
    transparent) to applications and services\n   running on the DC infrastructure,
    as well as to take advantage of\n   IPv6 features to simplify DC operations, internally
    and across the\n   Internet.\n\n\t "

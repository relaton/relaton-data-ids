  content: "The danger in defining a new protocol specifically for discovering\nresources
    on the Internet is that, like DNS, the protocol would\nprobably be deployed internally
    as well.  Developers would then have\nthe opportunity to use the protocol to perform
    service discovery on\nthe client side by downloading resources and inferencing
    over them\nrather than using protocols such as Service Location Protocol (SLP)\nor
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) that inference on\nthe server side.
    \ Besides the increased amount of network traffic\ninvolved in transferring attributes
    rather than the smaller query,\nevery client would need to incorporate its own
    inferencing code.  In\nthis document, we discuss how the requirements for wide
    area resource\ndiscovery can be met by slightly modifying SLP to remove features\nmore
    appropriate for internal networks and by establishing a few\nnaming conventions.
    \ An added benefit of this design is that Internet\nclients can perform service
    discovery as well as simple resource\ndiscovery.  It should be noted the proposals
    in this document are not\nmeant to suggest that SLP is the only or even the best
    candidate for\nInternet resource discovery among existing protocols.  The point
    of\nthis paper is to emphasize the need for a concerted effort to make an\nexisting
    discovery or directory services protocol fill the Internet\nresource discovery
    niche, rather than inventing yet another protocol\noffering discovery or directory
    services capabilites.\n\t "

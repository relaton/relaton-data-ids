  content: "This document describes a scheme that allows a node to determine an IP
    \naddress corresponding to a given link-layer id.  The node performing the \nquery
    doesn't need to be on the same link or subnet of the node \nassociated with the
    link-layer id.  This scheme was designed for the \nhandoff candidate access router
    discovery in wireless networks, but may \nalso be applied to other networks with
    similar behavior.\n\t "

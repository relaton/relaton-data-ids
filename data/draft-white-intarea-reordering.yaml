abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Several link technology standards mandate that equipment guarantee\n
    \  in-order delivery of layer 2 frames, apparently due to a belief that\n   this
    is required by higher layer protocols.  To meet this requirement\n   they implement
    a \"resequencing\" operation to restore the original\n   packet order.  This can
    introduce delays that result in net\n   degradation of performance.  Modern TCP
    and QUIC implementations\n   support features that significantly improve their
    tolerance to out-\n   of-order delivery.  This draft is intended to provide new
    information\n   for layer 2 technology standards regarding the need to assure
    in-\n   order delivery to support IETF protocols.\n\n\t "

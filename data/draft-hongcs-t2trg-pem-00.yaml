  content: "Renewable energy enabled sustainable energy management ensures\na high
    degree of reliability in order to fulfill the energy\ndemand of a smart city.
    In such case, renewable energy\ngeneration is random over time and also energy
    consumption of\nsmart city users’ is nondeterministic in nature. Therefore, to\nensure
    sustainable energy management for smart city,\na proactive energy management scheme
    should be integrated into\nsmart city network. In which, edge node should be considered
    as\nlocal computational unit for each energy user and microgrid\ncontroller should
    be played the role of energy management decision\naggregator. As a result, proactive
    energy management scheme\nnot only overcomes the challenges of renewable energy-aware\ndemand
    scheduling but also establishes a strong relationship\nfor both energy generation
    and consumption over time.\nTherefore, a distributed mechanism is considered,
    where the edge\nnode for executing local agent to determine an individual\nusers’
    policy with respect to energy consumption and renewable\nenergy generation (users’
    own sources). On the other hand,\nmicrogrid controller determines meta-policy
    through a meta-agent\nwith Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Since a meta-agent
    accepts\nlocal policy as an input with historical observations, which\nensures
    fast and efficient execution of proactive energy management\nfor the smart city.\n\n\t "

  content: "   To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) Service, Service Providers (SPs) need\n
    \  to instantiate multicast tunnels (known as \"P-tunnels\") that enable\n   the
    Provider Edge (PE) routers of a given VPN to transmit multicast\n   packets to
    each other.  Some SPs organize their networks in a\n   hierarchical manner, with
    the PE routers in \"edge areas\", and the\n   edge areas connected to each other
    via a \"core area\". A P-tunnel that\n   connects PE routers in different edge
    areas can be thought of as\n   having three segments: a segment through one edge
    area, a segment\n   through the core area, and a segment through the second edge
    area.\n   It is desirable to preserve the independence of the core area by\n   allowing
    it to use a different tunneling technology than that used in\n   the edge areas.
    \ However, it is not desirable for the core area\n   Border Routers (BRs) to participate
    in the MVPN-specific signaling,\n   or even to have any knowledge of which MVPNs
    are in the edge areas\n   that attach to it.  This document specifies a simple
    method for\n   segmenting MVPN P-tunnels at the BRs, subject to these constraints.\n\n\n\t "

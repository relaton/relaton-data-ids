  content: "This document describes a methodology for Network Address Translator\n(NAT)
    traversal for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This\nmethodology is called
    Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE).\nICE is not a new protocol, but
    rather makes use of existing\nprotocols, such as Simple Traversal of UDP Through
    NAT (STUN),\nTraversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) and even Real Specific IP (RSIP).\nICE
    works through the mutual cooperation of both endpoints in a SIP\ndialog. By having
    the endpoints work together in NAT traversal, a\nnumber of important properties
    are obtained. ICE always works,\nindependent of the types or number of NATs. It
    always represents the\ncheapest solution for a carrier. It always results in the
    minimum\nvoice latency. It can be done with no increase in call setup delays.\nIt
    is far less brittle than STUN. ICE also facilitates the transition\nof the Internet
    from IPv4 to IPv6, supporting calls between\ndual-stack and v6 clients behind
    a 4to6 NAT. Preconditions can be\nused in conjunction with ICE, to guarantee that
    the phone never rings\nunless the users will both hear and see each other when
    they pick up.\n\t "

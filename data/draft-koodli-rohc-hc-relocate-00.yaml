  content: "In networks with limited bandwidths, such as wireless cellular\nnetworks,
    compression of IP and transport headers may be employed to\nobtain better utilization
    of the available spectrum capacity.  When\nheader compression is used along with
    handoffs in such networks,\nthe header compression context needs to be relocated
    from one IP\naccess point (i.e., a router) to another in order to achieve seamless\noperation.
    \ In this document, we propose a mechanism to achieve this\ncompression context
    relocation using IPv6 and Mobile IPv6.\n\t "

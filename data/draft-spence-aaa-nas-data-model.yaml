  content: "Recently, considerable attention has been given to the need to better\nstructure
    the information carried in protocols operating within the\nnetwork access environment.
    \ The arguable benefits of structured\ninformation is consistency in the definitions
    and reuse of individual\ndata elements and well defined means for extending existing\nstructures
    to support new or proprietary features and capabilities.\nIn an effort to demonstrate
    the benefits of organizing data elements\nand provide a practical means for deploying
    such a model, this memo\ntakes the existing attributes currently used in RADIUS
    and maps them\ninto a data model.  To demonstrate the deployment of the data model\nwithin
    the network access environment, the data model has been\nrepresented as a PIB.
    \ While the data model could be implemented to\nrun over protocols other than
    COPS, SPPI is currently the only\nlanguage available which expresses data modeling
    concepts with\nsufficient detail to demonstrate the benefits in a practical manner.\n\n\t "

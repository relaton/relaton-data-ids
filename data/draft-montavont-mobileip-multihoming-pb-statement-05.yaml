- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The use of multiple interfaces is foreseen to provide ubiquitous,   \n
    \  permanent and fault-tolerant access to the Internet, particularly on\n   mobile
    nodes which are more prone to failure or sudden lack of\n   connectivity.  However,
    Mobile IPv6 currently lacks support for such\n   multihomed nodes.  Individual
    solutions have been proposed to extend\n   Mobile IPv6 but all issues have not
    been addressed in a single\n   document.  The purpose of the present document
    is thus to fill up\n   this gap and to raise the discussion in order to make sure
    that\n   forthcoming solutions will address all the issues.  In this document,\n
    \  we propose a taxonomy to classify the situations where a mobile node\n   could
    be multihomed.  This taxonomy is then used to highlight the\n   issues preventing
    mobile nodes operating Mobile IPv6 to be\n   multihomed.\n\t "

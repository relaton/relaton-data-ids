  script: Latn
  content: "Internet technical specifications often need to define a\nformat syntax
    and are free to employ whatever notation their\nauthors deem useful.  Over the
    years, a modified version of\nBackus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF),
    has\nbeen popular among many Internet specifications.  It\nbalances compactness
    and simplicity, with reasonable\nrepresentational power.  In the early days of
    the Arpanet,\neach specification contained its own definition of ABNF.\nThis included
    the email specifications, [RFC733] and then\n[RFC822] which have come to be the
    common citations for\ndefining ABNF.  The current document separates out that\ndefinition,
    to permit selective reference.  Predictably, it\nalso provides some modifications
    and enhancements.\nThe differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming\nrules,
    repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and\nvalue ranges.  Appendix A (Core)
    supplies rule definitions\nand encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type
    common\nto several Internet specifications.  It is provided as a\nconvenience
    and is otherwise separate from the meta language\ndefined in the body of this
    document, and separate from its\nformal status.\n\n\t "

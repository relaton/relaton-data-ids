  content: "   This document outlines an API-independent concept that allows\n   applications
    to share their knowledge about upcoming communication\n   and express their performance
    preferences in a portable and abstract\n   way: Socket Intents.  Socket Intents
    express what an application\n   knows, assumes, expects or wants to prioritize
    regarding its own\n   network communication.  The information provided by Socket
    Intents\n   should be taken into account by the network stack in a best-effort\n
    \  way.\n\n   Socket Intent can be used to stem against the complexity and make
    use\n   of multiple provisioning domains as well as new transport protocols\n
    \  and features available to a larger user base by expressing the\n   applications
    intents in an abstract and portable way.\n\n\t "

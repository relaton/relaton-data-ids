  content: "   This document describes procedures to damp multicast VPN routing\n
    \  state changes and control the effect of the churn due to the\n   multicast
    dynamicity in customer site.  The procedures described in\n   this document are
    applicable to BGP-based multicast VPN and help\n   avoid uncontrolled control
    plane load increase in the core routing\n   infrastructure.  New procedures are
    proposed inspired from BGP\n   unicast route damping principles, but adapted to
    multicast.\n\n\n\t "

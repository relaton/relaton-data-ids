  content: "During the last year, participants in the Real-time Applications and\nInfrastructure
    (RAI) area have been quite active in discussing\nproposals that could improve
    their way of working.  This document is\na contribution to that discussion and
    focuses on the reduction of\ndelays experienced in producing specifications.  We
    believe that this\nis one of the main problems in the RAI area (and quite likely
    in\nother areas of the IETF as well) and it requires attention.  A number\nof
    side effects, caused by the long specification work, are\nillustrated in this
    document.\n\t "

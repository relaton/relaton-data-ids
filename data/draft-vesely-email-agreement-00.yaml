abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft proposes a way to standardize an agreement between a\n   recipient
    and a sender, acknowledged by the recipient's MTA.  The\n   subject of the agreement
    expresses the willingness of the recipient\n   to receive an identified, authenticated
    mail stream.  After an MTA\n   acknowledges the agreement, it will unconditionally
    accept complying\n   messages, even if the recipient is not mentioned in any destination\n
    \  address field.\n\n\t "

  content: "Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the\nspace
    of federated access management.  Most of this effort has\nfocused on two use-cases:
    network and web-based access.  However, the\nsolutions to these use-cases that
    have been proposed and deployed\ntend to have few common building blocks in common.\n\nThis
    memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to\nthe commonly used
    security mechanisms for both federated and non-\nfederated access management,
    including RADIUS, Diameter, GSS, GS2,\nEAP and SAML.  The architecture addresses
    the problem of federated\naccess management to primarily non-web-based services,
    in a manner\nthat will scale to large numbers of federations.\n\t "

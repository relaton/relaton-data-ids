  content: "   CoAP utilizes DNS to discovery the IP address of the CoAP server.\n
    \  However DNS is heavy for the most resource constrained end-points.\n   In this
    case the assistance from CoAP proxy or research directory\n   (RD) is needed for
    CoAP transaction.  This specification proposes to\n   define one new dhcp option
    for proxy/RD discovery for the most\n   resource constrained end-points.\n\n\t "

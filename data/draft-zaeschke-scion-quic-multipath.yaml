  content: "   This document provides informational guidance for using the Multipath\n
    \  Extension for QUIC with the SCION networking technology.\n\n   SCION is an
    inter-domain routing protocol that supports path-aware\n   multi-path networking.
    \ The multiple paths and their associated path\n   information offered by SCION
    provide opportunities as well as\n   challenges for combining QUIC-MP with SCION.\n\n
    \  This document explores various aspects of this combination, such as\n   algorithms
    for congestion control, RTT estimation, and general\n   application scenarios.
    \ In addition, it provides techniques and\n   guidance to maintain the security
    of QUIC-MP and SCION, and to\n   leverage path-aware multi-path networking with
    QUIC-MP.\n\n\t "

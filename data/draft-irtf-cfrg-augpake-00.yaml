abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a secure and highly-efficient augmented\n   password-authenticated
    key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user\n   remembers a low-entropy password
    and its verifier is registered in\n   the intended server.  In general, the user
    password is chosen from a\n   small set of dictionary whose space is within the
    off-line dictionary\n   attacks.  The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure
    against\n   passive attacks, active attacks and off-line dictionary attacks (on\n
    \  the obtained messages with passive/active attacks).  Also, this\n   protocol
    provides resistance to server compromise in the context that\n   an attacker,
    who obtained the password verifier from the server, must\n   at least perform
    off-line dictionary attacks to gain any advantage in\n   impersonating the user.
    \ The AugPAKE protocol is not only provably\n   secure in the random oracle model
    but also the most efficient over\n   the previous augmented PAKE protocols (SRP
    and AMP).\n\n\t "

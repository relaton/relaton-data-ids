  script: Latn
  content: "Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable\ncommunications
    channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to\nTCP [RFC0793].  With the
    widespread deployment of Network Address\nTranslators (NAT), specialized code
    has been added to NAT for TCP\nthat allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT
    and yet use only a\nsingle globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind
    the\nNAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This\nadditional
    code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port\nTranslation or NAPT.
    \ To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet\nbeen added to most NAT's so
    that only pure NAT is available.  The end\nresult of this is that only one SCTP
    capable host can be behind a\nNAT.\n\nThis document describes an SCTP specific
    variant of NAT which\nprovides similar features of NAPT in the single point and
    multi-point\ntraversal scenario.\n\t "

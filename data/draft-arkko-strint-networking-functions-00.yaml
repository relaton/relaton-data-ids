  content: "   This paper discusses the inherent tussle between network functions\n
    \  and some aspects of privacy.  There is clearly room for a much\n   improved
    privacy in Internet communications, but there are also\n   interesting interactions
    with network functions, e.g., what\n   information networks need to provide a
    service.  Exploring these\n   limits is useful to better understand potential
    improvements.\n\n\t "

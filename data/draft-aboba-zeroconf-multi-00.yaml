  content: "Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is an increasing\nneed
    for simplified mechanisms for IPv4 address allocation within multi-\nsegment networks
    connected by a single router. This issue can arise, for\nexample, in the case
    of a home network supporting 802.11 wireless as\nwell as Ethernet.\nIn multi-segment
    small networks connected by a single router, it may be\ndesirable to provide for
    consistent IPv4 addressing in the case where\nthe small network has not been assigned
    a routable IPv4 address prefix.\nThis draft describes how this problem may be
    solved through\nimplementation of a mini-DHCP server within the router. The router
    may\neither be disconnected from the Internet, in which case the hosts on the\nmultiple
    segments will only be able to reach other, or the router may\noffer Internet connectivity
    via Network Address Translation (NAT), or\nanother suitable mechanism, such as
    RSIP.\n\n\t "

  content: "   For an virtualized overlay network, there are many encapsulations\n
    \  that may be used.  Different customer have their own preference.  So\n   if
    some of these different encapsulation can be interconnected\n   together, the
    virtualized overlay network would be more compatible\n   and have loose strict
    on access.  This document is going to provide\n   an architecture of different
    overlay encapsulation interconnection\n   and an tranformer gateway for these
    end station connected to the\n   virtual network.\n\n\t "

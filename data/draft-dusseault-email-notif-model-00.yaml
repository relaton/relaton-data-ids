  content: "   Email servers have event information which is of interest to a wide\n
    \  variety of clients, devices and users, and this motivates an effort\n   to
    tie Email servers into the existing Internet notifications\n   architecture as
    described by the Common Profile for Presence (CPP).\n   This document describes
    where Email servers fit into CPP and what\n   pieces are missing.  This is not
    purely a requirements document\n   because it describes a specific architecture,
    but it makes some\n   requirements on future documents that fill in pieces of
    the\n   architecture.\n\n\n\t "

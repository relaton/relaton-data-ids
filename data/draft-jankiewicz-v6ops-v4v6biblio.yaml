  content: "The Internet is in the early stages of what may be a protracted\nperiod
    of coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6.  Network operators are\nchallenged with the task
    of activating IPv6 without negative impact\non operating IPv4 networks and their
    customers.  This draft is an\ninformational \"annotated bibliography\" compiled
    to help in the\nanalysis and development of basic guidelines and recommendations
    for\nnetwork operators.  The goal of this document is to survey the\ncurrent state
    of RFCs, Internet-Drafts and external reference\nmaterials that define the use
    cases, problem statements, protocols,\ntransition mechanisms and coexistence tools
    that will be of interest\nto a network operator planning to turn on IPv6.\n\t "

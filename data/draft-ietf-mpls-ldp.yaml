  content: "A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs)
    must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through
    them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called
    a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings
    it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label
    Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding
    along normally routed paths. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

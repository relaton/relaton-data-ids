  content: "The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused changes in Internet
    user behavior, particularly during the introduction of initial quarantine and
    work-from-home arrangements. These behavior changes drove changes in Internet
    traffic.\n\n The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss
    network impacts of the pandemic on November 9-13, 2020. The workshop was held
    to convene interested researchers, network operators, network management experts,
    and Internet technologists to share their experiences. The meeting was held online
    given the ongoing travel and contact restrictions at that time.\n\n Note that
    this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions
    documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily
    reflect IAB views and positions.\n\t "

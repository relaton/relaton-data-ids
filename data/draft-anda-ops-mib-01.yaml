  content: "This document specifies an Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) that\naddresses
    the needs of an Integrated Communications Network (ICN)\nfor remote and automatic
    service turn-up and for the simplification\nof monitoring and fault management
    across multiple network elements\nwithin the Loop Access environment and within
    the Customer Premises\nEnvironment (CPE) environment. OPS extends the standard
    Simple\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB)\nby
    defining voice/data integration and flow-through provisioning\ncapabilities for
    the various devices within the ICN, such as\nIntegrated Access Devices (IADs).\nOPS
    enables Carriers or Service Providers to control their\nIntegrated Access Services
    (IAS) from the network management system\nin the Network Operation Center (NOC).
    Flow-through provisioning\nallows administrators to send provisioning commands
    to multiple\nnetwork elements across the ICN. The provisioning commands are used\nto
    define or modify a customer's services and to turn those services\non and off.
    Similarly, customer-initiated service requests as well\nas performance and fault
    management information for existing\nservices can flow back to the carrier or
    service provider.\n\t "

  content: "The  Internet  Call  Waiting  (ICW)  has  recently  become a standard\n'check-list'
    service offered  by  many  Telecommunications  providers\nsuch as  Nortel  and
    \ Lucent.    While differing in many details, all\nthese schemes rely on the LEC
    provider ability to detect  and  signal\nthe 'busy-line'  state.    This  signal
    triggers the execution of the\nservice logic that provides the desirable effect.
    \ As a  result,  the\nInternet  Call Waiting is most meaningful when offered by
    LEC [6] but\nof limited interest for long-distance providers, such as  AT&T,  MCI,\netc.
    \  In  the broader prospective, ICW may be considered a member of\nthe class of
    services that manage incoming calls by making use of  an\nInternet connection.
    \ Of special interest the Long Distance Providers\nis  a specific subclass of
    services that 'by-passes' LEC; the purpose\nof this paper is to begin the discussion
    of what can  be  implemented\nwhen LEC services are either not available or not
    desirable.  To this\nend  we  introduce  a  service--Advance  Internet  Caller-ID
    Delivery\nService--that comes 'close' to ICW and yet,  does  not  rely  on  the\nterminating
    \ LEC.  In  addition,    this  service related to the PINT\n'click-to-dial' service
    and could make use of the PINT protocol.\n\n   The rest of this document is as
    follows:\n \n   Section 2 describes the service offered to the end Subscriber.\n
    \n   Section 3 describes the architecture requirements  to  support    the\n   Advance
    Intenet Calle-ID Delivery Service.\n \n   Section 4 descibes the call flows for
    typical scenarios.\n \n   Sections  5  and  6  respectively  supply  referneces
    and provide the\n   author address.\n\t "

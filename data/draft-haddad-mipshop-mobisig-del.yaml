  content: "   This memo describes a mechanism which delegates the exchange of\n   mobility
    signaling messages between the mobile and correspondent\n   nodes to the network
    infrastructure.  Goals outlining the proposed\n   delegation are to further reduce
    the IP handoff latency and to\n   relieve the mobile node from exchanging a considerable
    amount of\n   signaling messages with correspondent nodes while retaining full\n
    \  control on the critical ones.\n\n\t "

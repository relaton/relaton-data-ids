  content: "   Regulatory entities in many countries are making spectrum previously\n
    \  used by television stations available for secondary use as a result\n   of
    the switch from analog to digital.  The spectrum in such cases is\n   still owned
    by the primary user to whom it is licensed.  However\n   parts of the spectrum
    may be unused at a given location or time and\n   hence can be made available
    for secondary use.  In order to use such\n   spectrum a device has to query a
    database in order to obtain a list\n   of available channels or spectrum at a
    given location and time.  This\n   document specifies protocol elements that can
    be used to query a\n   white space database and obtain a response by a device.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) has been widely deployed to satifisfy
    all kinds of requirements of traffic engineering for transport of services. Complexity
    of configuration has much negative effect on the MPLS TE deployment in the large-scale
    network. The document identifies the configuration issues for MPLS TE deployment
    and proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven mechanism, by which the setup
    of co-routed MPLS Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched Paths(TE LSPs) is triggered
    by the bidirectional service. Then the document proposes the framework for setting
    up service-driven co-routed MPLS TE LSP for L2VPN and L3VPN.</p>"

  content: "   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were standardized\n
    \  a couple of decades ago but it has not been widely deployed.  Thus, a\n   vast
    majority of DNS messages in the real world are still vulnerable\n   to various
    kinds of integrity attacks like cache poisoning attacks.\n   This document describes
    a mechanism that extends the current DNSSEC\n   protocol in such a way that guarantees
    the integrity of DNS messages\n   using PKIX certificates without any dependencies
    on other entities in\n   the DNS infrastructure.\n\n\t "

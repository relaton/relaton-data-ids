  content: "Without caches in the infrastructure, peer to peer content delivery's\nprimary
    effect is cost shifting rather than cost savings.  Even with\nperfect localization,
    depending on the relative cost of last-mile\nuplink bandwidth verses transport
    bandwidth, P2P may substantially\nincrease aggregate cost.  Yet the addition of
    edge caches, caches\nlocated in the ISPs near the customers, radically change
    the\neconomics of P2P content delivery.  Edge caches interact very\nstrongly with
    localization services for P2P content delivery, and any\nlocalization service
    must be tightly integrated into edge-cache\noperation.\n\t "

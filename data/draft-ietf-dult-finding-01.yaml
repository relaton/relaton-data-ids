  content: "   Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to\n
    \  locate items.  These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced\n   tracking
    network in which devices belonging to other network users\n   (e.g., phones) report
    which tags they see and their location, thus\n   allowing the owner of the tag
    to determine where their tag was most\n   recently seen.  This document defines
    the protocol by which devices\n   report tags they have seen and by which owners
    look up their\n   location.\n\n\t "

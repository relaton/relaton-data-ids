  content: "6rd is One of the most popular methods to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 \nconnectivity
    services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing \nperiod. The DHCP 6rd
    option has been defined to configure 6rd CPE. \nBut in many networks, the configuration
    information may be stored in \nAAA servers while user configuration is mainly
    from Broadband Network \nGateway (BNG) through DHC protocol. This document defines
    a RADIUS \nattribute that carries 6rd configuration information from AAA server
    \nto BNG.\n\t "

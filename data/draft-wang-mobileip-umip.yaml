  content: "Global roaming is one of the design objectives for next generation\n(3G)
    cellular networks.  To efficiently support real-time\napplications for mobile
    users in these networks, signaling and\npayload traffic delays must be minimal.
    \ It has been identified that\none of the sources causing long delays is triangle
    routing. That is,\nfor example, in the registration process the registration requests\nhave
    to be transmitted from a foreign agent in the visited network\nall the way to
    the home network every time the mobile node initiates\na call or when the mobile
    node roams into a different visiting\nnetwork [2].\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a set of practices for connecting stub\n   networks
    to adjacent infrastructure networks.  This is applicable in\n   cases such as
    constrained (Internet of Things) networks where there\n   is a need to provide
    functional parity of service discovery and\n   reachability between devices on
    the stub network and devices on an\n   adjacent infrastructure link (for example,
    a home network).\n\n\t "

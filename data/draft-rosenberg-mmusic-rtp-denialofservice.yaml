  content: "The Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides unreliable transport\nof
    real time media from a sender to one or more recipients. RTP\nsessions are typically
    set up through signaling protocols such as the\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    or the Real Time Streaming Protocol\n(RTSP). When RTP is set up with these protocols,
    a potential Denial\nof Service (DoS) attack is introduced. This attack allows
    an attacker\nto cause a flood of RTP packets to be sent towards a target. We\ndescribe
    this attack, and also show how it is effectively prevented\nusing Interactive
    Connectivity Establishment (ICE), first introduced\nas a means of handling Network
    Address Translator (NAT) traversal.\n\n\t "

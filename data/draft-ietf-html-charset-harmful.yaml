  content: "The term character set is often used to describe a ditigal representation
    of text. ASCII is perhaps the most widely deployed representation of text, and
    in the interest of interoperability, information systems on the Internet traditionally
    rely on it exclusively.                             The Multipurpose Internet
    Mail Extensions (MIME) introduces Internet Media Types, including text representations
    besides ASCII. The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) used in the World-Wide Web
    is a proposed Internet Media Type. But HTML is also an application of Standard
    Generalized Markup Language (SGML).\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines a new approach, called NGISec, for end-to-end\nsecure
    communication system that is compatible with other networking\nprotocols. Such
    a solution is needed because IPSec is incompatible\nwith network address translation
    (NAT), ICMP, and QoS protocols such\nas differentiated services, RSVP, RED, and
    ECN. Most of the proposed\nsolutions to mitigate or remove the incompatibility
    problems of\nIPSec only address a small sub-section of the problems, and proposed\nsolutions
    have severe drawbacks. By using our proposed approach, one\ncan achieve end-to-end
    secure communication in LANs, VPNs, and\nnetwork-to-network connections. This
    approach can be viewed as an\nalternative to IPSec that solves the severe problems
    faced by IPSec\nand paves the way for simultaneous use of security and QoS services.\nWhile
    it is aimed to be an alternative to IPSec, it re-uses critical\ncomponents of
    the IPSec infrastructure such as the Internet key\nexchange (IKE). An interesting
    aspect of the proposed protocol is\nthat it also allows the use of SSL/TLS to
    build VPNs.\n\n\t "

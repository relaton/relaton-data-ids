  content: "A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) request must be \ndirected
    to an appropriate server for processing. This document \nspecifies an extension
    to the Domain Name System (DNS) and specifies \na method for discovering such
    servers using information in DNS.  \nThis document complements and enhances previously
    specified methods \nof locating an appropriate server in that it works for distinguished
    \nnames constructed with or without the 'dc' attribute type. \n    \n   The DNS
    extension is specified as an AVA Resource Record.  The \n   method of discovering
    servers queries DNS for AVA records to resolve \n   a DN to a fully qualified
    domain name, then queries DNS for SRV \n   records to complete the location process.\n\t "

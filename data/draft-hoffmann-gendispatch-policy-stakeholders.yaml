abstract:
- content: "<p>At IETF115 a side meeting on policymaker engagement with the IETF was
    held. This meeting identified the significance of the IETFâ€™s work for wider societal,
    economic, and political communities, as well as existing gaps and barriers to
    engagement for policy experts. This informational draft provides an overview of
    the side meeting and introduces the problem statement and gap analysis of existing
    initiatives in this space. It also poses questions we hope to work through with
    others in the IETF community regarding how to better enable policy expert engagement
    in IETF standardisation, and on how we can build a culture which better supports
    technical and policy experts working together to develop more robust standards.</p>"

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for combining a traditional MLS
    session with a post-quantum (PQ) MLS session to achieve flexible and efficient
    amortized PQ confidentiality and authenticity that amortizes the computational
    cost of PQ Key Encapsulation Mechanisms and Digital Signature Algorithms. Specifically,
    we describe how to use the exporter secret of a PQ MLS session, i.e., an MLS session
    using a PQ ciphersuite, to seed PQ guarantees into an MLS session using a traditional
    ciphersuite. By supporting on-demand traditional-only key updates (a.k.a. PARTIAL
    updates) or hybrid-PQ key updates (a.k.a. FULL updates), we can reduce the bandwidth
    and computational overhead associated with PQ operations while meeting the requirement
    of frequent key rotations.</p>"

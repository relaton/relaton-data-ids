  content: "   This draft proposes a distributed architecture of mobility management\n
    \  in terms of abstracted logical functions.  Mobility management\n   functions
    are abstracted into different logical functions: (1)\n   allocation of home network
    prefixes or home addresses to mobile\n   nodes; (2) location management which
    includes managing the IP\n   addresses and locations of the mobile nodes; and
    (3) mobility routing\n   which includes intercepting and forwarding packets.  A
    distributed\n   architecture can be contructed by providing the mobility routing\n
    \  functions in multiple networks in the data plane and a distributed\n   database
    is used to host the location management function.  This\n   generalized architecture
    enables different distributed mobility\n   designs using primarily the existing
    mobility protocols (MIP and\n   PMIP) and their extensions.  Several existing
    distributed mobility\n   management proposals are briefly reviewed using this
    framework.  It\n   is expected that the different proposals, when expressed in
    terms of\n   the generalized framework of logical functions, can interwork with\n
    \  each other as well as with the existing hierarchical deployments.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251] is widely used for purposes\n
    \  including secure remote administration, file transfer using SFTP and\n   SCP,
    and encrypted tunneling of TCP connections.  Because it is based\n   on TCP, SSH
    suffers similar problems as are motivating the HTTP\n   protocol to transition
    its transport to UDP-based QUIC [QUIC].  These\n   include: unauthenticated network
    intermediaries can trivially\n   disconnect SSH sessions; SSH connections are
    lost when mobile clients\n   change IP addresses; and performance limitations
    in OS-based TCP\n   stacks.  This memo leverages QUIC to provide a UDP-based transport
    to\n   SSH sessions with full backward compatibility, after completing the\n   initial
    SSH key exchange.\n\n\t "

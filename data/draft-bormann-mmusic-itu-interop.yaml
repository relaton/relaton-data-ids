  content: "This memo is a rough summary of potential scenarios where teleconferencing
    systems based on ITU standards (H.320, T.120) interoperate with teleconferencing
    systems based on RTP and MMUSIC style (``Internet'') standards.  Version 01 is
    a minor update mainly based on ITU progress up to, but not including the November
    1995 Geneva SG15 meeting (which extends two days beyond the I-D deadline) Change
    bars are provided relative to version 00.                                                                This
    memo is a submission to the IETF MMUSIC working group.  Comments should be addressed
    to the confctrl@isi.edu mailing list.\n\t "

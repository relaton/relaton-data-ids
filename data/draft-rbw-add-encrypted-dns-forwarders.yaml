  content: "   Typical connectivity service offerings based upon on Customer Premise\n
    \  Equipment (CPEs) involve DNS forwarders on the CPE for various\n   reasons
    (offer local services, control the scope/content of\n   information in DNS, ensure
    better dependability for local service,\n   provide control to users, etc.).  Upgrading
    DNS to use encrypted\n   transports introduces deployment complications as to
    how to sustain\n   current offerings with local services.  Solutions are needed
    to ease\n   operating DNS forwarders in CPEs while allowing to make use of\n   encrypted
    DNS capabilities.\n\n   This document describes the problem and to what extent
    existing\n   solutions can or can't be used for these deployments.  For example,\n
    \  Star certificates and name constraints extension suffer from the\n   problem
    of deploying a new feature to CAs, TLS clients, and servers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The PIM version 2 messages share a common message header format.  The\n
    \  common header definition contains eight reserved bits.  This document\n   specifies
    how these bits may be used by individual message types and\n   creates a registry
    containing the per-message-type usage.  This\n   document also extends the PIM
    type space by defining three new\n   message types.  For each of the new types,
    four of the previously\n   reserved bits are used to form an extended type range.\n\n
    \  This document updates RFCs 7761 and 3973 by defining the use of the\n   currently
    Reserved field in the PIM common header.  This document\n   further updates RFCs
    7761 and 3973, along with RFCs 5015, 5059, 6754,\n   and 8364, by specifying the
    use of the currently reserved bits for\n   each PIM message.\n\n   This document
    obsoletes RFC 8736.\n\n\t "

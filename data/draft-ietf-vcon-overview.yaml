  content: "   A vCon is the container for data and information relating to a real-\n
    \  time, human conversation.  It is analogous to a [vCard] which enables\n   the
    definition, interchange and storage of an individual's various\n   points of contact.
    \ The data contained in a vCon may be derived from\n   any multimedia session,
    traditional phone call, video conference, SMS\n   or MMS message exchange, webchat
    or email thread.  The data in the\n   container relating to the conversation may
    include Call Detail\n   Records (CDR), call meta data, participant identity information
    (e.g.\n   STIR PASSporT), the actual conversational data exchanged (e.g. audio,\n
    \  video, text), realtime or post conversational analysis and\n   attachments
    of files exchanged during the conversation.  A\n   standardized conversation container
    enables many applications,\n   establishes a common method of storage and interchange,
    and supports\n   identity, privacy and security efforts (see [vCon-white-paper])\n\n\t "

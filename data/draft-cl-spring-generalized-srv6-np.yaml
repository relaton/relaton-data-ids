  content: "   As the deployment of SRv6, some new requirements are proposed, such\n
    \  as SRv6 compression, transporting over SR-MPLS/MPLS and IPv4 domains.\n   Therefore,
    it is necessary to consider other types of segments or\n   sub-paths in the end-to-end
    SRv6 network programming.\n\n   This document proposes Generalized Segment Routing
    over IPv6 (G-SRv6)\n   Networking Programming, which supports to encode multiple
    types of\n   Segments in a SRH, called Generalized SRH (G-SRH).  These Segments\n
    \  can be called Generalized Segment, and the ID can be Generalized\n   Segment
    Identifier (G-SID), which may include an SRv6 SID(128 bits),\n   C-SIDs, MPLS
    labels, or IPv4 tunnel information.\n\n   This document also defines the mechanisms
    of Generalized SRv6\n   Networking Programming and the requirements of related
    protocol\n   extensions of control plane and data plane.\n\n\t "

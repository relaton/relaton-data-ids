  script: Latn
  content: "   IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy\n
    \  Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications,\n   such
    as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing\n   Protocol for
    LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on\n   routing metrics and constraints
    [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed\n   Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional
    routes for\n   LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint,\n
    \  and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from\n   one
    or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is\n   partitioned into one
    or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one\n   DODAG per sink. RPL is widely
    considered as a feasible routing\n   protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops and
    lack of a loop free DODAG\n   local repair mechanism are two open issues to be
    addressed. This\n   draft introduces an alternative rank and an Objective Function
    to\n   eliminate DODAG loops in RPL. Based on the proposed rank and\n   Objective
    Function, this draft introduces a loop free RPL.\n\n\t "

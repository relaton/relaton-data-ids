  content: "3GPP is defining the protocol specification for the Communication\nBarring
    (CB) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN)\nsubsystem supplementary
    service and more particularly the dynamic\nincoming communication barring service.
    \ As part of dynamic incoming\ncommunication barring (ICB) service, a SIP based
    Event package\nframework is used for notifying users about communication barrings\n(dynamic
    and rule based) of their incoming communication sessions.\nThis document proposes
    a new SIP event package for allowing users to\nsubscribe to and receive such notifications.
    \ Users can further\ndefine filters to control the rate and content of such notifications.\nThe
    proposed event package is applicable to the ICB supplementary\nservice in IMS
    and may not be applicable to the general internet..\n\t "

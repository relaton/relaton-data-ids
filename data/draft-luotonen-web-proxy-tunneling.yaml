  content: "   This document specifies a generic tunneling mechanism for TCP based\n
    \  protocols through Web proxy servers.  This tunneling mechanism was\n   initially
    introduced for the SSL protocol [SSL] to allow secure Web\n   traffic to pass
    through firewalls, but its utility is not limited to\n   SSL.  Earlier drafts
    of this specification were titled 'Tunneling SSL\n   through Web Proxy Servers'
    <draft-luotonen-ssl-tunneling-XX.txt>.\n   Implementations of this tunneling feature
    are commonly referred to as\n   'SSL tunneling', although, again, it can be used
    for tunneling any\n   TCP based protocol.\n \n   A wide variety of existing client
    and proxy server implementations\n   conform to this specification.  The purpose
    of this specification is\n   to describe the current practice, to propose some
    good practices for\n   implementing this specification, and to document the security\n
    \  considerations that are involved with this protocol.\n\n\t "

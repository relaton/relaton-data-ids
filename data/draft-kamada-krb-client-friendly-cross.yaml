  content: "   This document proposes a cross-realm traversal model, which is\n   suitable
    for resource-limited clients, for Kerberos Version 5.  This\n   model relieves
    the clients of the traversal cost by two means.  One\n   moves the cost of consecutive
    Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) exchanges\n   from clients to Key Distribution Centers
    (KDCs).  The other reduces\n   the traversal cost itself by generating a direct
    inter-realm\n   relationship between two realms.  The document describes behavior
    of\n   clients and KDCs, but does not specify any wire format, which need to\n
    \  be specified separately.\n\n\t "

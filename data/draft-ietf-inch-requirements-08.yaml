  content: "This document describes the high-level functional requirements of an\nabstract
    format, the Format for Incident information Exchange (FINE),\nwhich will facilitate
    the exchange of incident information among\ncomputer security incident response
    teams (CSIRTs) and involved\nparties.  A common and well-defined format will help
    in the exchange\nof incident related information across different administrative\ndomains
    such as organizations, regions, and countries.\nImplementations of FINE will also
    be useful for reactionary analysis\nof current threats and support the proactive
    identification of trends\nthat can lead to incident prevention.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>IP/MPLS networks use packet switching (with the feature store-and-
    forward) and are based on statistical multiplexing. Statistical multiplexing is
    essentially a variant of time division multiplexing, which refers to the asynchronous
    and dynamic allocation of link timeslot resources. In this case, the service flow
    does not occupy a fixed timeslot, and the length of the timeslot is not fixed,
    but depends on the size of the packet. Statistical multiplexing has certain challenges
    and complexity in meeting deterministic QoS, and its delay performance is dependent
    on the used queueing mechanism. This document further describes a generic time
    division multiplexing scheme for layer-3 in an IP/MPLS networks, called timeslot
    queueing and forwarding (TQF) mechanism. TQF is an enhancement based on TSN TAS
    and allows the data plane to create a flexible timeslot mapping scheme based on
    available timeslot resources. It defines a cyclic period consisting of multiple
    timeslots where a flow is assigned to be transmited within one or more dedicated
    timeslots. The objective of TQF is to better handle large scaling requirements.</p>"

  content: "   IP/MPLS networks use packet switching (with the feature store-and-\n
    \  forward) and are based on statistical multiplexing.  Statistical\n   multiplexing
    is essentially a variant of time division multiplexing,\n   which refers to the
    asynchronous and dynamic allocation of link\n   timeslot resources.  In this case,
    the service flow does not occupy a\n   fixed timeslot, and the length of the timeslot
    is not fixed, but\n   depends on the size of the packet.  Statistical multiplexing
    has\n   certain challenges and complexity in meeting deterministic QoS, and\n
    \  its delay performance is dependent on the used queueing mechanism.\n   This
    document further describes a generic time division multiplexing\n   scheme for
    layer-3 in an IP/MPLS networks, called timeslot queueing\n   and forwarding (TQF)
    mechanism.  TQF is an enhancement based on TSN\n   TAS and allows the data plane
    to create a flexible timeslot mapping\n   scheme based on available timeslot resources.
    \ It defines a cyclic\n   period consisting of multiple timeslots where a flow
    is assigned to\n   be transmited within one or more dedicated timeslots.  The
    objective\n   of TQF is to better handle large scaling requirements.\n\n\t "

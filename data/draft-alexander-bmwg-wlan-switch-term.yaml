  content: "This document provides a terminology to be used when performing\nperformance
    test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches and\ncontrollers, including
    systems comprising groups of controllers and\nAccess Points.  The various wireless-specific
    device nomenclature, as\nwell as the definitions of configuration parameters and
    test\nconditions that may be used to characterize the performance of these\ndevices,
    are provided.  The document also defines some of the metrics\nused during WLAN
    switch benchmarking.  This terminology is to be used\nin conjunction with the
    companion methodology document.\n\t "

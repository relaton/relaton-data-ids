  content: "The discussion on instant messaging and a presence protocol is very\nmuch
    biased by the features, limitations, and mistakes of existing\npresence products.
    This document discusses those mistakes and many\ncommonly heard misunderstandings.
    The document proposes a more\nadvanced view (not a protocol) to presence systems,
    merging IM and\nPP. The discussion can be followed on the IMPP mailing list\n(impp@iastate.edu).\n\t "

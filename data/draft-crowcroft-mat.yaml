  content: "Network Address Translation is a technique for reducing the\ncomplexity
    of address re-assignment. It can also lead to a reduction\nin the routing state
    in the core.\nThis draft is about using the technique for the same reasons for\nmulticast.
    The approach is complementary to IP-in-IP tunnels for\nmulticast, but avoids the
    overhead of encapsulation. It has the same\nstate setup requirements at the edges,
    as does NAT.\n\n\t "

  content: "   In PIM-SM shared LAN networks, there is typically more than one\n   upstream
    router. When duplicate data packets appear on the LAN from\n   different routers,
    assert packets are sent from these routers to\n   elect a single forwarder. The
    PIM assert packets are sent\n   periodically to keep the assert state. The PIM
    assert packet carries\n   information about a single multicast source and group,
    along with\n   the metric-preference and metric of the route towards the source
    or\n   RP. This document defines a standard to send and receive multiple\n   multicast
    source and group information in a single PIM assert packet\n   in a shared network.
    This can be particularly helpful when there is\n   traffic for a large number
    of multicast groups.\n\n\t "

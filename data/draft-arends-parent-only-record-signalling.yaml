  script: Latn
  content: "   New RR types have been proposed that appear only at the parent side\n
    \  of a delegation, similar to the DS resource record (RR) type.\n\n   Supporting
    parent side RR types requires modifications to the DNS\n   Security Extensions
    (DNSSEC).\n\n   Without these modifications, validating resolvers are susceptible
    to\n   response modification attacks.  An on-path adversary could\n   potentially
    remove the parent-side resource records without being\n   detected.\n\n   To detect
    the removal of a parent-side RR type, an authenticated\n   denial record (such
    as NSEC or NSEC3) is necessary to confirm\n   presence or absence of a parent-side
    RR type.\n\n   Currently, validating resolver do not expect authenticated denial\n
    \  records in a secure delegation response.  Therefore, a secure signal\n   is
    needed to inform the validating resolver to anticipate\n   authenticated denial
    records for a delegation.\n\n   To support the future deployment of parent-side
    RR types, this draft\n   designates a range of yet unallocated RR types specifically
    for\n   parent-side use.  Authoritative servers will include these records in\n
    \  a delegation response without requiring upgrades.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-\n
    \  Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for\n   traffic
    across a network and can also update the paths to reflect\n   changes in the network
    or traffic demands.\n\n   PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched
    Paths\n   (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path\n
    \  Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  But SDN has a\n   broader
    applicability than signaled (G)MPLS traffic-engineered (TE)\n   networks, and
    the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of\n   use cases.  PCEP has
    been proposed as a control protocol for use in\n   these environments to allow
    the PCE to be fully enabled as a central\n   controller.\n\n   A PCE-based central
    controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of\n   a distributed control plane
    by blending it with elements of SDN and\n   without necessarily completely replacing
    it.  This document specifies\n   the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions when
    a PCE-based\n   controller is also responsible for configuring the forwarding
    actions\n   on the routers for Segment Routing in IPv6 (SRv6), in addition to\n
    \  computing the SRv6 paths for packet flows and telling the edge\n   routers
    what instructions to attach to packets as they enter the\n   network.\n\n\t "

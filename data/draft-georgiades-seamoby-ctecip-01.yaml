  content: "This Internet draft enhances cellular-IP mobility protocol with a\nContext
    Transfer mechanism aiming to further optimise the handoff \noperation in mobile
    networks. Within a cellular-IP domain, during the\nhandoff from one cellular-IP
    base station to another, cellular-IP\npackets could be  used to initiate and transfer
    authorised context\nfrom the previous cellular-IP base station via the cellular-IP\ngateway
    to the new cellular-IP base station. This draft presents how \nthe context transfer
    extension introduced could facilitate in\nreducing latency and packet loss by
    avoiding the signalling required \nbetween the mobile node and the new base station
    \ in  re-establishing\nthe desired state information.\n\t "

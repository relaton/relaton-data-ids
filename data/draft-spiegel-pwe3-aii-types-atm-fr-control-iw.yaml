  content: "This document describes work in progress in the MFA Forum on ATM and\nFrame
    Relay to MPLS Control Plane Interworking.  Two specifications\nare being defined,
    one for client-server interworking (between two\nclient network endpoints that
    communicate across an IP/MPLS network)\nand one for SPVC interworking (from a
    client network endpoint to an\nIP/MPLS network endpoint).  Both client-server
    interworking and SPVC\nInterworking use standard PWE3 control for establishment
    of the\npseudowires that transport the ATM or Frame Relay data connections\nacross
    the IP/MPLS network.  New AII type codepoints from the \"Expert\nReview\" range
    are requested.  The need for these codepoints and\nproposed usage is described.\n\n\n\t "

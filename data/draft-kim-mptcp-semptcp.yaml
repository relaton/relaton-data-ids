  content: "   Multipath TCP has become the transmission technique of choice for the\n
    \  multi-homed environment.  Recently, there have been multiple attempts\n   to
    verify the security of Multipath TCP; but an eavesdropper in the\n   initial handshake
    breaches the primary security goal of Multipath\n   TCP.  In this paper, we introduce
    a secure scheme against an initial\n   eavesdropper, using asymmetric key exchange.\n\n
    \  We optimize the public parameters to overcome two challenges to the\n   use
    of asymmetric cryptography.  Then we show that compared to\n   previously proposed
    methods, our scheme has low overhead, and is more\n   secure.  Our approach applies
    to many weak authentication-based\n   protocols that seek to use asymmetric cryptography.\n\n\n\t "

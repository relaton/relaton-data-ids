  script: Latn
  content: "In some networks such as xDSL networks with WiFi extension, the\nperiodical
    transmission of Agent Advertisements (AA) by mobility \nagents is used by Mobile
    Nodes (MN) to detect movement. To allow fast\nmovement detection, the interval
    at which AAs are sent should not be\nlong. In the early deployment of Mobile IPv4
    (MIPv4), mobility agents\nare deployed in the edge network. For example, in xDSL
    networks, Home\nAgents (HA) and Foreign Agents (FA) are located on or beside Edge\nRouters
    (ER) that usually serves thousands of MNs (typically between\n2000 and 5000 in
    xDSL networks). The periodical transmission of\nmulticast AA to MNs in such a
    large network consumes a significant\namount of the aggregation network bandwidth
    and CPU resources of ERs.\n\n\n\nThis is a practical problem in xDSL networks
    with WiFi extension. \nThis is also a common problem for others access networks
    in which a \nlarge layer-2 network is served by one router.  Hence a Mobility
    \nAgent Discovery proxy (MADP) can be set in access nodes to make the \nMNs detect
    movement fast meanwhile avoiding CPU and network bandwidth\nconsumption in the
    aggregation network. The MADP acts as a proxy to\nMNs as far as agent discovery
    is concerned allowing for AS issued by\nMNs to be locally replied according to
    AA issued by HA/FA on the\naccess network. MADP is a logical function that can
    be placed on a\nsuitable node location depending on access network technology
    and\narchitecture (i.e. WiMAX) to reduce network resource cost related to\nagent
    discovery.\n\t "

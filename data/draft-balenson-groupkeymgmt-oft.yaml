  content: "  We present a scalable method for establishing group session keys\n  for
    secure large, dynamic groups such as multicast sessions.\n  Our method is based
    on a novel application of One-Way Function\n  Trees (OFTs).  The number of keys
    stored by group members, the\n  number of keys broadcast to the group when new
    members are added\n  or evicted, and the computational efforts of group members,
    are\n  logarithmic in the number of group members.  The method provides\n  perfect
    forward and backward security:  evicted members cannot\n  read future messages,
    even with collusion by arbitrarily many\n  evicted members, and newly admitted
    group members cannot read\n  previous messages.\n\n\t "

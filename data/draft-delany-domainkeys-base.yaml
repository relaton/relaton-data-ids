- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "\"DomainKeys\" creates a domain-level authentication framework for email
    by using public key technology and the DNS to prove the provenance and contents
    of an email.\n\n This document defines a framework for digitally signing email
    on a per-domain basis. The ultimate goal of this framework is to unequivocally
    prove and protect identity while retaining the semantics of Internet email as
    it is known today.\n\n Proof and protection of email identity may assist in the
    global control of \"spam\" and \"phishing\". This memo defines a Historic Document
    for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "   Slices in a 5G system should be identified and mapped to the\n   corresponding
    transport network underlay segments to provide the\n   capabilities requested
    by the 5G customer.  One set of slices in a 5G\n   system correspond to resources
    and connectivity to carry signaling\n   and data plane packets across a distributed
    infrastructure that make\n   up the 5G system, for example, distributed entities
    of a radio\n   network (gNB).  Another set of 5G slices represent resource and\n
    \  connectivity capabilities offered by the 5G system to its end users\n   (UE)
    for the lifetime of a session including UE mobility.  Both\n   depend in part
    on multiple transport network slice segments with\n   requirements that include
    bandwidth, latency, and criteria such as\n   isolation, directionality, and disjoint
    routes.\n\n   This document describes how a 5G slice is mapped to a slice in IP
    or\n   Layer 2 transport network for both above cases, including scenarios\n   where
    the 5G customer network is separated from the provider\n   transport network by
    an intermediate network.  Mobile slice criteria\n   are mapped to the appropriate
    transport slice and capabilities\n   offered in backhaul, mid-haul and fronthaul
    connectivity segments\n   between radio side network functions and user plane\n
    \  function(gateway).  Applicability of this framework and underlying\n   transport
    networks, which can enable different slice properties are\n   also discussed.
    \ This is based on mapping between mobile and\n   transport underlays (L2, Segment
    Routing, IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).\n\n\n\t "

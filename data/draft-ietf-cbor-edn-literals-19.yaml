  content: "   This document formalizes and consolidates the definition of the\n   Extended
    Diagnostic Notation (EDN) of the Concise Binary Object\n   Representation (CBOR),
    addressing implementer experience.\n\n   Replacing EDN's previous informal descriptions,
    it updates RFC 8949,\n   obsoleting its Section 8, and RFC 8610, obsoleting its
    Appendix G.\n\n   It also specifies and uses registry-based extension points,
    using one\n   to support text representations of epoch-based dates/times and of
    IP\n   addresses and prefixes.\n\n\n   // (This cref will be removed by the RFC
    editor:) The present -19\n   // includes the definition of the cri'' application-
    extension. cri''\n   // was previously defined in draft-ietf-core-href; however
    the latter\n   // document overtook the present document in the approval process.\n
    \  // As the definition of cri'' is dependent on the present document\n   // (and
    conversely has essentially no dependency on the technical\n   // content of draft-ietf-core-href
    beyond its mere existence), the\n   // text (including IANA considerations) has
    been moved here. -19 is\n   // intended for use at the CBOR WG meeting at IETF
    124.\n\n\t "

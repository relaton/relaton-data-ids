  content: "   This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol\n
    \  Label Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths.  A proxy ping\n   request
    is sent to any Label Switching Routers along a Label Switched\n   Path.  The primary
    motivations for this facility are first to limit\n   the number of messages and
    related processing when using LSP Ping in\n   large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs,
    and second to enable leaf to leaf/\n   root tracing.\n\n\t "

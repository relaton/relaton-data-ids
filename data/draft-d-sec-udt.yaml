  content: "UDT does not have its specific security mechanism. It depends \n   on
    the application to provide authentication and lower layer to \n   provide security
    mechanisms[GG07]. However, UDT implementations     \n   should check each arrived
    packets are from the expected source, \n   since UDP is connectionless. \n\n   This
    document proposes evaluation of security requirements for UDT, \n   or UDP based
    Data Transfer considered as an alternative data transfer \n   protocol for the
    situation when TCP does  not work well.The objective\n   is to achieve a wide
    \ class of security methods used on existing mature protocols such as UDP and
    TCP.\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a mechanism of providing mapping service for\nLISP-like
    architecture.  The mapping service comprises of EID Router\n(ER) mechanism and
    supplementary DHT Mapping Overlay (MO), in which\nER mechanism is for reducing
    forwarding entries in routers while\ndriving the packets to the destination through
    tunnels, and the DHT\nMO serves as a supplement that provides specific mappings
    to reduce\nthe number of tunnels.  The mechanism is flexibly deployable for ISPs\nsince
    it costs little and is easy to progress.\n\t "

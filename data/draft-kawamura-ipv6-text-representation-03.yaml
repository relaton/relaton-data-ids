  content: "As IPv6 network grows, there will be more engineers and also non-\nengineers
    who will have the need to use an IPv6 address in text.\nWhile the IPv6 address
    architecture RFC 4291 section 2.2 depicts a\nflexible model for text representation
    of an IPv6 address, this\nflexibility has been causing problems for operators,
    system\nengineers, and customers.  This document will describe the problems\nthat
    a flexible text representation has been causing.  This document\nalso recommends
    a canonical representation format that best avoids\nconfusion.  It is expected
    that the canonical format is followed by\nhumans and systems when generating an
    address to represent as text,\nbut all implementations must accept any legitimate
    RFC4291 format.\n\t "

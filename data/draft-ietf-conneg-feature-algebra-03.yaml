  content: "A number of Internet application protocols have a need to provide\n  content
    negotiation for the resources with which they interact [1].\n  A framework for
    such negotiation is described in [2].  Part of this\n  framework is a way to describe
    the range of media features which\n  can be handled by the sender, recipient or
    document transmission\n  format of a message.  A format for a vocabulary of individual
    media\n  features and procedures for registering media features are\n  presented
    in [3].\n \n  This document describes an algebra and syntax that can be used to\n
    \ define feature sets which are formed from combinations and\n  relations involving
    individual media features.  Such feature sets\n  are used to describe the media
    feature handling capabilities of\n  message senders, recipients and file formats.\n
    \n  This document also outlines an algorithm for feature set matching.\n\t "

  content: "   The specification defines the processes of token exchange and token\n
    \  translation for workloads.  Token exchange is introduced in\n   [RFC8693],
    allowing the exchange of access tokens, OpenID Connect ID\n   Tokens, and SAML
    assertions for new OAuth access tokens.  However,\n   for workloads, there exist
    a broad array of input and output token\n   types which must be considered beyond
    the input types supported by\n   [RFC8693].  These token types include, but are
    not limited to, SPIFFE\n   SVIDs, x.509 certificates, Kerberos service tickets,
    Amazon sigv4A,\n   macaroons, <...>.  Further, these tokens may be encoded in
    formats\n   including JWT OAuth 2.0 Acesss Tokens [RFC9068], CWT [RFC8392], and\n
    \  protocol buffers (protobufs).  Given the variety and complexity of\n   input
    and output token types and encoding, a strict token exchange\n   that maintains
    all of the contextual information from the input token\n   to the output token
    may not be possible.  We define these non-RFC8693\n   use cases with potentially
    lossy conversions as \"token translation\"\n   (e.g. information may be lost in
    translation).  In this document we\n   describe a workload profile for token exchange,
    using the mechanisms\n   in [RFC8693], and a new set of translations between arbitrary
    token\n   types.  Additionally, we define mechanisms to enrich tokens during\n
    \  translation to support the use cases defined in (todo: add link to\n   use
    cases doc).\n\n\t "

  content: "   The Internet needs support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both address\n   families
    and their attendant protocol suites support multicast of the\n   single-source
    and any-source varieties.  As part of the transition to\n   IPv6, there will be
    scenarios where a backbone network running one IP\n   address family internally
    (referred to as internal IP or I-IP) will\n   provide transit services to attached
    client networks running another\n   IP address family (referred to as external
    IP or E-IP).  It is\n   expected that the I-IP backbone will offer unicast and
    multicast\n   transit services to the client E-IP networks.\n\n   Softwires Mesh
    is a solution for supporting E-IP unicast and\n   multicast across an I-IP backbone.
    \ This document describes the\n   mechanisms for supporting Internet-style multicast
    across a set of\n   E-IP and I-IP networks supporting softwires mesh.\n\n\n\t "

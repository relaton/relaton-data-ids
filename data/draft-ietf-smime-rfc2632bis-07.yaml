  content: "This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage by Secure/Multipurpose
    Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) agents.  S/MIME provides a method to send and
    receive secure MIME messages, and certificates are an integral part of S/MIME
    agent processing.  S/MIME agents validate certificates as described in RFC 3280,
    the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile.  S/MIME
    agents must meet the certificate processing requirements in this document as well
    as those in RFC 3280. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

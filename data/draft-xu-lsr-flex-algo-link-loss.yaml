- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   IGP Flexible Algorithms allow IGPs to compute constraint-based paths.\n
    \  Since link loss plays an important role in network evaluation, links\n   with
    high packet loss rate should be bypassed during forwarding.\n   This draft proposes
    a path computation method based on a link loss\n   constraint to prune unsatisfied
    links in Flexible Algorithms.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever\n
    \  increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of devices.\n   Operators
    begining to seek more information of power consumption in\n   the network, have
    no standard mechanism to measure, report and\n   compare power usage of different
    networking equipment under different\n   network configuration and conditions
    exist.\n\n   This document provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live\n
    \  networks under different traffic loads and various switch router\n   configuration
    settings.  It provides a suite which can be deployed on\n   any networking device
    .\n\n\t "

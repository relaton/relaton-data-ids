abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft summarizes additional personal opinions of the author for\n
    \  why existing stateless multicast solutions BIER/BIER-TE are not\n   sufficient
    to support the operator, architecture and use-case goals\n   that MSR6 proposes
    to solve.\n\n   This document is complementary to problems outlined in I-D.liu-msr6-\n
    \  problem-statement and in no way affects any of them.  Instead, it\n   attempts
    to look more at lower-layer functional challenges of current\n   stateless source
    routing multicast solutions (BIER/BIER-TE), as well\n   as architectural, network
    and protocol design ecosystem requirements\n   of operators.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Hello message for the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) has been
    defined to establish and maintain basic signaling node adjacencies for Label Switching
    Routers (LSRs) participating in a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic-engineered
    (TE) network. The Hello message has been extended for use in Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS) networks for state recovery of control channel or nodal faults.\n\n The
    GMPLS protocol definitions for RSVP also allow a restarting node to learn which
    label it previously allocated for use on a Label Switched Path (LSP).\n\n Further
    RSVP protocol extensions have been defined to enable a restarting node to recover
    full control plane state by exchanging RSVP messages with its upstream and downstream
    neighbors.\n\n This document provides an informational clarification of the control
    plane procedures for a GMPLS network when there are multiple node failures, and
    describes how full control plane state can be recovered in different scenarios
    where the order in which the nodes restart is different.\n\n This document does
    not define any new processes or procedures. All protocol mechanisms are already
    defined in the referenced documents. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.\n\t "

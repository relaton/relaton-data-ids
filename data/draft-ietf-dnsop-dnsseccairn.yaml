  content: "This draft describes the operational and administrative considerations\nencountered
    as part of the migration from a traditional Domain Name\nService (DNS) infrastructure
    to one based on DNS Security (DNSSEC).\nThe information presented in this draft
    is based on the implementation\nof DNSSEC in the Collaborative Advanced Inter-agency
    Research Network\n(CAIRN) testbed.  CAIRN is a DARPA funded testbed used by Government,\nUniversity,
    and Commercial researchers to conduct Internet Protocol\n(IP) network based research.
    \ Additional information on the CAIRN\ntestbed is available at http://www.cairn.net.
    \ Details on the DNSSEC\nimplementation in CAIRN can be found at http://www.cairn.net/DNSSEC.\n\nIt
    is envisioned that the information presented in this draft can be\nused as a starting
    reference for sites interested in deploying DNSSEC.\nIt is also hoped that reporting
    on the experience of CAIRN DNSSEC\nimplementation will provide a forum for general
    discussions\nregarding DNSSEC implementation.\n\t "

    flow for devices with limited input capabilities.\n   Demonstrating Proof of Possession
    (DPoP) [RFC9449] is a mechanism to\n   sender-constrain OAuth 2.0 tokens.  This
    document describes how to\n   use DPoP with the Device Authorization Grant to
    provide a higher\n   level of security for clients.  It binds the DPoP key to
    the entire\n   transaction, from the initial device authorization request through\n
    \  the lifetime of the issued tokens.\n\n\t "

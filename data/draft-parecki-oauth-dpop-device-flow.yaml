abstract:
- content: "<p>The OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant [RFC8628] is an authorization
    flow for devices with limited input capabilities. Demonstrating Proof of Possession
    (DPoP) [RFC9449] is a mechanism to sender-constrain OAuth 2.0 tokens. This document
    describes how to use DPoP with the Device Authorization Grant to provide a higher
    level of security for clients. It binds the DPoP key to the entire transaction,
    from the initial device authorization request through the lifetime of the issued
    tokens.</p>"

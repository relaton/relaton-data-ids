abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allows\nmultihoming
    by using multiple addresses. When communication between the\ninitially chosen
    addresses for a transport session is no longer\npossible, a \"shim\" layer makes
    it possible to switch to a different set\nof addresses without breaking current
    transport protocol assumptions.\nThis draft discusses the issues of detecting
    failures in a currently\nused address pair between two hosts (\"current pair reachability\")
    and\nand picking a new address pair to be used when a failure occurs (\"full\npath
    exploration\").\n\n\t "

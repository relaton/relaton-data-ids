  content: "   This document proposes the addition of new email headers designed\n
    \  specifically to identify emails that are sent as part of phishing\n   detection
    training programs.  These headers would allow recipients to\n   verify the authenticity
    of training emails using DNS queries to\n   confirm that the sending domains are
    authorized to send these types\n   of emails.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Future Mobile Internet has to support many types of traffic  \nflows,
    including both real-time and non real-time \nservices.   In addition, the network
    has to keep account of the \nlocation of each mobile node (MN) as it moves around
    the network. \nThis   draft proposes a novel protocol that combines mobility \nmanagement
    with optimal routing for use over the mobile air \ninterface.\n\t "

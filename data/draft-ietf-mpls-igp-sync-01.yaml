- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In certain networks there is a dependency on edge-to-edge LSPs setup \n
    \  by LDP, e.g. networks that are used for MPLS VPN applications. For \n   such
    applications it is not possible to rely on IP forwarding if the \n   MPLS LSP
    is not operating appropriately. Blackholing of labeled \n   traffic can occur
    in situations where the IGP is operational on a \n   link but LDP is not operational
    on that link. While the link could     \n   still be used for IP forwarding, it
    is not useful for traffic with \n   packets carrying a label stack of more than
    one label or when the IP \n   address carried in the packet is out of the RFC1918
    space. This \n   document describes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this
    \n   condition without introducing any protocol changes.\n\t "

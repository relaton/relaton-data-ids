  content: "   Use of multicast in AI Data Centers (AIDC) is getting attention for\n
    \  efficient large-scale distribution of the same data to many\n   receivers,
    given the collectives like All2All and AllReduce.\n   Emerging technologies like
    In Network Compute(INC) can also benefit\n   from using in-network-distribution
    of the packets by offloading the\n   distribution of the flows to the network.
    \ Given the bursty nature of\n   short-lived all2all flows, BIER is a very good
    multicast technology\n   for AIDC because it does not need the per-establishment
    of the\n   multicast tree states.  This document discusses further optimization\n
    \  of BIER use in AIDC or similar deployment scenarios, and updates\n   RFC4604
    by specifying an IGMP/MLD extension for sources to report\n   receiver information
    to the First Hop Routers.  The extension can be\n   useful and is only needed
    when the source cannot impose the BIER\n   encapsulation.\n\n\t "

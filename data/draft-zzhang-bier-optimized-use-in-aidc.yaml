abstract:
- content: "<p>Use of multicast in AI Data Centers (AIDC) is getting attention for
    efficient large-scale distribution of the same data to many receivers, given the
    collectives like All2All and AllReduce. Emerging technologies like In Network
    Compute(INC) can also benefit from using in-network-distribution of the packets
    by offloading the distribution of the flows to the network. Given the bursty nature
    of short-lived all2all flows, BIER is a very good multicast technology for AIDC
    because it does not need the per-establishment of the multicast tree states. This
    document discusses further optimization of BIER use in AIDC or similar deployment
    scenarios, and updates RFC4604 by specifying an IGMP/MLD extension for sources
    to report receiver information to the First Hop Routers. The extension can be
    useful and is only needed when the source cannot impose the BIER encapsulation.</p>"

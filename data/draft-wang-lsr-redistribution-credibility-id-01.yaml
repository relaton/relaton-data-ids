  content: "   The route redistribution is often deployed in current network between\n
    \  two different protocols domain or instance/process, such as the ISIS\n   domain
    redistribute to OSPF domain, the OSPF domain redistribute to\n   BGP domain, IS-IS
    redistribute to another IS-IS instance/process and\n   so on.  The existing network
    have more complex multiple IGP domains\n   architecture.  Therefore, bidirectional
    route redistribution\n   deployment is more complex for different protocols or
    instances/\n   processes to learn routes from each other.  In recent years, these\n
    \  route redistributions have had many routing loops cases that cause\n   network
    incident.\n\n   This document proposes a simplified method to positively avoid\n
    \  routing loop, and introduces new sub-TLVs to support advertisement\n   IPv4
    and IPv6 prefix extended attribute as Redistribution Credibility\n   ID, while
    redistributing route from one protocol domain or instance/\n   process to another.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "Once an Internet technology is specified and developed, it must be\ndeployed
    and operated. Success of the Internet has relied on the\ncombination of technical
    development, administrative assignment and\noperational interconnection. Just
    as Internet success frequently\nrelies on central coordination for the creation
    of interoperable\ntechnologies, it frequently relies on central coordination for\ndeployment
    and operation of the interoperable services that use\nthose technologies.\n\n\t "

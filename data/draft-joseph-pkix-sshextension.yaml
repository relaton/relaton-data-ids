  content: "   The Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem protocol defines a key distribution\n
    \  protocol to provision an SSH server with user's public keys.  However,\n   that
    protocol is limited to provisioning an SSH server.   This document\n   describes
    extensions to this protocol to allow the provisioning of keys\n   and certificates
    to a server using the SSH transport.\n\n   The defined protocol extensions allow
    the calling client to organize\n   keys and certificates in different namespaces
    on a server.  These\n   namespaces can be used by the server to allow a client
    to configure\n   any application running on the server (e.g., SSH, KMIP, SNMP).\n\n
    \  The defined extensions provide a server-independent mechanism for clients\n
    \  to add public keys, remove public keys, add certificates, remove\n   certificates,
    and list the current set of keys and certificates known by\n   the server by namespace
    (e.g., list all public keys in the SSH\n   namespace).\n\n   Rights to manage
    keys and certificates in a specific namespace are\n   specific and limited to
    the authorized user and are defined as part of\n   the server's implementation.
    \  The described protocol is backward\n   compatible to version 2 defined by RFC
    4819.\n\n\n\t "

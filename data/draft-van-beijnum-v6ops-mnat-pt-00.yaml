  script: Latn
  content: "A smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires that either all hosts\n
    \  are upgraded to dual stack before the first hosts can become IPv6-\n   only,
    or that there be some mechanism for IPv6-only hosts to talk to\n   IPv4-only hosts.
    \ Expecting the former within a reasonable timeframe\n   isn't realistic, based
    on current adoption of dual stack combined\n   with the latest projections for
    the IPv4 depletion that point to a\n   date early in the next decade.  And the
    IETF has recently deprecated\nthe main mechanism that allows the latter: NAT-PT.\n\n
    \  This document proposes a modified form of NAT-PT that addresses the\n   reasons
    why the mechanism was deprecated and currently understood\n   requirements.  This
    should allow future deployment of the modified\n   NAT-PT as an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition
    mechanism, giving operators the\n   option of running their networks largely IPv6-only.\n\t "

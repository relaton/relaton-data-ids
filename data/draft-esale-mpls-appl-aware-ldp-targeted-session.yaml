  content: "   Recent Targeted LDP applications such as Remote LFA and BGP auto\n
    \  discovery FEC 129 pseudowire may automatically establish a targeted\n   LDP
    session to any LSR in the core network. The sender LSR has\n   information about
    the targeted applications to administratively\n   control initiation of the session.
    However the receiver LSR has no\n   such information to control the acceptance
    of this session. This\n   document defines a mechanism to advertise Targeted Application\n
    \  Capability during session initialization. As the receiver LSR becomes\n   aware
    of targeted LDP applications, it may establish a limited number\n   of sessions
    for certain applications. In addition, each targeted\n   application is mapped
    to LDP FEC Elements to advertise only necessary\n   LDP FEC label bindings over
    the session.\n\n\n\t "

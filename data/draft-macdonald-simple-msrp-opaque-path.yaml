  content: "The Message Session Relay Protocol(MSRP) does not allow privacy and\ntopology
    hiding, such that MSRP users can hide the IP Address of\ntheir systems.  This
    limitation is due to the fact that MSRP Path\nheaders contain physical IP addresses.
    \ This document describes a\nmechanism which adds a level of indirection to allow
    privacy and\ntopology hiding, to prevent remote parties and a man-in-the-middle\nfrom
    learning the IP Address and port information of the MSRP client.\nIt also defines
    the option tag msrp-opaque, to indicate such support.\n\t "

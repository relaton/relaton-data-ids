  content: "The International Telecommunications Union Standardization Sector \n(ITU-T)
    has created the H.350 series of Recommendations that specify \ndirectory services
    architectures in support of multimedia \nconferencing protocols. The goal of the
    architecture is to \n'directory enable' multimedia conferencing so that these
    services \ncan leverage existing identity management and enterprise \ndirectories.
    A particular goal is to enable an enterprise or service \nprovider to maintain
    a canonical source of users and their \nmultimedia conferencing systems, so that
    multiple call servers from \nmultiple vendors, supporting multiple protocols,
    can all access the \nsame data store. \n   \nBecause SIP is an IETF standard,
    the contents of H.350 and H.350.4 \nare made available via this document to the
    IETF community. \n\t "

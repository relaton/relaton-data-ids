  content: "   RSVP takes a \"soft state\" scheme to manage the reservation states
    in\n   routers and hosts, the soft states are created and periodically\n   refreshed
    by Path and Resv messages.  Soft state scheme gives a\n   simple way to maintain
    the state synchonization between neighbors,\n   but also introduces scalability
    issue.  This document provides a\n   framework that describes and discusses the
    architecture for stateless\n   RSVP (SL-RSVP), which disabled the soft-state scheme
    to improve the\n   protocol scalability and the other processes of RSVP are kept.
    \ This\n   document does not describe specific protocols or protocol extensions\n
    \  needed to realize this architecture.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   A Host Identity Protocol (HIP) proxy is a host that holds the keying\n
    \  material, and participates in HIP-based communications, on behalf of\n   one
    or more hosts.\n\n   HIP proxies play an important role in the transition from
    the current\n   Internet architecture to the HIP architecture.  A core objective
    of a\n   HIP proxy is to facilitate the communication between legacy (or Non-\n
    \  HIP) hosts and HIP hosts while not modifying the host protocol\n   stacks.
    \ In this document, the legacy hosts served by proxies are\n   referred to as
    Legacy Hosts (LHs).  Currently, various design\n   solutions of HIP proxies have
    been proposed.  These solutions may be\n   applicable in different working circumstances.
    \ In this document,\n   these solutions are investigated in detail to compare
    their\n   effectiveness in different scenarios.\n\n\t "

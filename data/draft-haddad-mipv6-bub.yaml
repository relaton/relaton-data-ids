  content: "Mobile IPv6 [1] defines two different modes to handle the \nmobility problem
    (i.e., mobile node moving accross different \nnetworks and changing its IP address).
    The two modes had been \nmainly designed for scenarios involving one mobile node
    and \none static node (correspondent node). This document answers \nissues related
    to scenarios involving two mobile nodes (i.e., \nthe correspodent node is also
    a mobile node). The document \naddresses also the double jumping problem where
    two mobile nodes \nmove at the same time (i.e., switch to new subnets).\nThe document
    proposes a new mode called 'BUB' (Binding Update \nBackhauling) allowing a more
    secure, reliable and optimized \nexchange of Binding Updates (BUs) between two
    mobile endpoints.\n\t "

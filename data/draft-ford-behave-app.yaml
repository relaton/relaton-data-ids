  script: Latn
  content: "\n   This document defines guidelines by which application designers\n
    \  can create applications that communicate reliably and efficiently\n   in the
    presence of Network Address Translators (NATs),\n   particularly when the application
    has a need for \"peer-to-peer\"\n   (P2P) type of communication. The guidelines
    allow a P2P application\n   to work reliably across a majority of existing NATs,
    as well as all\n   future NATs that conform to the behave requirements specified
    in\n   companion documents. The NAT traversal techniques described in\n   the
    document do not require the use of special proxy or relay\n   protocols, do not
    require specific knowledge about the network\n   topology or the number and type
    of NATs in the path, and do not\n   require any modifications to IP or transport-layer
    protocols\n   on the end hosts.\n\n\t "

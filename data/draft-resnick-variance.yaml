    \  following the requirements of a Best Current Practice (BCP)\n   untenable,
    or where the procedures described in the BCP gives no\n   guidance.  This document
    defines a process for the IETF to grant a\n   variance to any IETF process for
    a single use or of very short\n   duration.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) is an XML-based \nlanguage
    that can be used to specify rules for the execution of Web \nservices in general
    and OPES content services in particular.\nOPES services are a new class of applications
    running on network \nintermediaries, such as caches, proxies, gateways, etc. or
    dedicated \n(callout) servers. They are invoked through intermediaries acting
    on \nbehalf of application endpoints. IRML is designed to serve as a \nsimple
    and efficient, but yet powerful language to express the \nservice execution policies
    of application endpoints. IRML rules are \ntypically processed by intermediaries
    that trigger the execution of \nOPES services according to these rules and policies.

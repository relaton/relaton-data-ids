  content: "   ANVL (A Name-Value Language) is a simple record syntax based on email\n
    \  headers.  An ANVL record is a sequence of data elements ending in a\n   blank
    line.  An element consists of a label, a colon, and an optional\n   value, and
    a long value may be folded (continued) onto the next line\n   by inserting a CRLF
    and indenting the next line.  A value folded\n   across several lines is treated
    as if the lines were joined on one\n   long line; any line beginning with `#'
    is treated as a \"comment\".\n   Example ANVL record:\n\n         entry:\n         #
    first draft\n         who:   Gilbert, W.S. | Sullivan, Arthur\n         what:

  content: "   Currently, the DNSSEC security of a zone is limited by the strength\n
    \  of its weakest signature algorithm.  DNSSEC Strict Mode makes zones\n   as
    secure as their strongest algorithm instead.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note
    is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.\n\n   Discussion of this document
    takes place on the mailing list\n   (dnsop@ietf.org), which is archived at\n   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/dnsop/.\n\n

  content: "This memo describes a PIM routing problem owing to the reverse path\nforwarding
    (RPF) failure on routers having multiple addresses on a\nlink.  This memo also
    considers possible solutions with their pros\nand cons.  The solutions include
    operational one which does not\nrequire any protocol change, and one which uses
    a new PIM Hello\noption.  However, it is beyond the scope of this memo to discuss
    what\nis the most appropriate solution for this problem.\n\t "

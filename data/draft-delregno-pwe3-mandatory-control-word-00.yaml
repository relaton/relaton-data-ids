abstract:
- content: "<p>Of the many variations of PWE3 Encapsulations and Modes (e.g. Ethernet,
    Port Mode, VLAN Mode, etc), only five have the Control Word (CW) as being optional.
    As a result, this causes an issue with VCCV Control Channel selection. This draft
    endeavors to resolve the issue going forward by making the Control Word, and subsequently
    the CW- based VCCV Control Channel, mandatory for all PWE3 Encapsulations.</p>"

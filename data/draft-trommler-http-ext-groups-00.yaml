  content: "This document motivates and describes an extension to HTTP which allows
    protection spaces to be extended across multiple servers residing in possibly
    different domains.  These servers form groups that allow browsers to obtain authentication
    information from a user just once while accessing information on any one server
    cooperating in such a group.                 To achieve this behavior, the HTTP
    WWW-Authenticate header information must be extended.  This approach is independent
    of the authentication scheme, but is most scalable in conjunction with a trusted
    third party authentication scheme, such as the proposed Mediated Digest Authentication.\n\t "

  content: "   DNS-SD allows a client to find a list of named instances of a service\n
    \  name over a particular transport within a domain of interest using\n   standard
    DNS queries.  As the number of potential responders\n   increases, DNS-SD based
    discovery doesn't scale well.  To mitigate\n   the scaling issues, schemes to
    narrow down the search context would\n   be needed.  The document proposes to
    include key/value pairs in the\n   form of a DNS TXT record along with the service
    name in the DNS query\n   to assist with the discovery process.  The DNS TXT record
    can be\n   placed in the additional section of the query without requiring any\n
    \  changes to the structure of DNS messages.\n\n\t "

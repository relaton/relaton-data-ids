- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Over the years there have been various proposals as to use namespaces\n
    \  other than the DNS/IN namespace that is under ICANN administration.\n   Some
    of these were simple DNS competitors others use different lookup\n   technologies.
    \ In addition it is hard to supply different character\n   encodings to DNS as
    each application needs to provide the translation\n   between the encoding used
    and the format expected by DNS.\n\n   This draft proposes a new service layer
    to provide multiplexing of\n   different namespaces into appropriate function
    calls.\n\n\t "

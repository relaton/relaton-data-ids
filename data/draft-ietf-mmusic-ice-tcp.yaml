  content: "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for NAT
    traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the offer/answer model
    of session negotiation.  ICE works by providing a set of candidate transport addresses
    for each media stream, which are then validated with peer-to-peer connectivity
    checks based on Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  ICE provides a general
    framework for describing candidates but only defines UDP-based media streams.
    \ This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the ability to
    offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single stream. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

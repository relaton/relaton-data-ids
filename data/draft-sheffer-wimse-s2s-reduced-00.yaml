abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a proposed revision that simplifies the working group's
    workload-to-workload protocol document. If accepted by the working group, these
    changes will be back-ported to that document. Otherwise, it was a good try. The
    WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for software workloads
    in a variety of runtime environments, from the most basic ones up to complex multi-service,
    multi-cloud, multi- tenant deployments. This document defines the simplest, atomic
    unit of this architecture: the protocol between two workloads that need to verify
    each other's identity in order to communicate securely. The scope of this protocol
    is a single HTTP request-and-response pair. To address the needs of different
    setups, we propose two protocols, one at the application level and one that makes
    use of trusted TLS transport. These two protocols are compatible, in the sense
    that a single call chain can have some calls use one protocol and some use the
    other. Workload A can call Workload B with mutual TLS authentication, while the
    next call from Workload B to Workload C would be authenticated at the application
    level.</p>"

  script: Latn
  content: "The MIKEY specification [2] describes several modes of key\n   distribution
    to setup SRTP [4] sessions, viz., pre-shared key,\n   public-key, and an optional
    Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  In the\n   public-key mode the initiator encrypts
    a random key with the\n   responder's public key and sends it to the responder.
    \ In many VoIP\n   calling scenarios, the initiator may not know the responder's
    public\n   key or in some cases the responder's ID (e.g., call forwarding) in\n
    \  advance.  We propose a new MIKEY mode that works well in such\n   scenarios.\n\t "

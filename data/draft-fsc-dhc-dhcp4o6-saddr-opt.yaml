  content: "   DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] describes one\n
    \  possible mechanism for dynamically configuring IPv4 over an IPv6 only\n   network.
    \ For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 to function with some softwire\n   mechanisms, the operator
    must obtain information about the DHCP 4o6\n   client's allocated IPv4 address
    and PSID, as well as the /128 IPv6\n   prefix that the client will use as the
    source of IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.\n   This memo defines a DHCPv6 option to convey
    this IPv6 prefix between\n   the DHCP 4o6 client and server.  It is designed to
    work in\n   conjunction with the DHCPv4 IPv4 address allocation process message\n
    \  flow.\n\n\n\t "

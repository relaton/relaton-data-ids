  content: "This document defines frame relay pseudo-wire emulation edge-to-edge.\nA
    frame relay pseudo-wire is a mechanism that exists between a\nprovider's edge
    network nodes and support as faithfully as possible\nframe relay services over
    IP and MPLS packet switched network (PSN).\nTwo mapping modes are defined: One-to-one
    mapping mode characterized\nby a one to one relationship between a frame relay
    VC and a pair\nof MPLS LSPs is defined for MPLS PSN. The other mode is known as
    port\nmode or many-to-one mapping mode and is defined for MPLS PSN and IP\nPSN
    with L2TPv3.\n\n\t "

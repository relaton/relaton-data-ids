  content: "In this memo, the extended (per-hop) BGP metrics are proposed to allow
    network operators to implement routing policies which are common cases in the
    practice but require complicated ad-hoc configurations given the virtual absence
    of globally significant metrics in BGP-4.          BGP is an inter-autonomous
    system routing protocol designed for TCP/IP internets.  The current version is
    BGP-4 documented in RFC 1654, versions 1-3 are documented in RFCs 1105, 1163 and
    1267 accordingly.        This document is a supplement to RFC 1654, and describes
    the new features in terms of differences from BGP-4.\n\t "

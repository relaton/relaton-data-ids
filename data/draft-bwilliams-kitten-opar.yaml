  content: "   This document introduces the Open Password Automation Recipe (OPAR)\n
    \  Protocol, a suggested format for providing instructions to password\n   managers
    programmatically that defines the valid construction of a\n   password. With password
    managers becoming integrated into browsers,\n   websites should be able to describe
    the elements of an acceptable\n   password programmatically so password management
    plugins can read\n   and automatically generate the best option. Without this,
    manual\n   intervention by the user is required when the password is too long,\n
    \  contains invalid characters, or does not meet complexity\n   requirements.\n\n\t "

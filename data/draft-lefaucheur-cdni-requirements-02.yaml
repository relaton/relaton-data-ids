  content: "   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for large-scale\n
    \  content delivery.  As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up\n   their
    infrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are\n   deploying their
    own CDNs.  There is a requirement for interconnecting\n   standalone CDNs so that
    their collective CDN footprint can be\n   leveraged for the end-to-end delivery
    of content from Content Service\n   Providers (CSPs) to end users.  The Content
    Distribution Network\n   Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been chartered
    to develop an\n   interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection.\n\n
    \  The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for\n   the
    solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working\n   group.\n\nRequirements
    Language\n\n   The key words \"Must\", \"Should\" and \"May\" in this document
    are to be\n   interpreted in the following way:\n\n   o  \"Must\" indicates requirements
    that are to be supported by the CDNI\n      protocols in the stated scope (aka
    \"within initial CDNI scope\" or\n      \"beyond initial scope\").  A requirement
    is stated as a \"Must\" when\n      it is established by that it can be met without
    compromising the\n      targeted schedule for WG deliverables, or when it is established\n
    \     that specifying a solution without meeting this requirement would\n      not
    make sense and would justify re-adjusting the WG schedule, or\n      both.\n\n
    \  o  \"Should\" indicates requirements that are to be supported by the\n      CDNI
    protocols in the stated scope (aka \"within initial CDNI\n      scope\" or \"beyond
    initial scope\") unless the WG realizes at a\n      later stage that attempting
    to meet this requirement would\n      compromise the overall WG schedule (for
    example it would involve\n      complexities that would result in significantly
    delaying the\n      deliverables).\n\n   o  \"May\" indicates requirements that
    are to be supported by the CDNI\n      protocols in the stated scope (aka \"within
    initial CDNI scope\" or\n      \"beyond initial scope\") provided that dedicating
    WG resources to\n      this work does not prevent addressing \"Should\" and \"Must\"\n
    \     requirements and that attempting to meet this requirement would\n      not
    compromise the overall WG schedule.\n\n\n\t "

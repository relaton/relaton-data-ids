  content: "   This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services\n   mechanisms
    to support the next generation of emergency calls placed\n   by vehicles (automatically
    in the event of a crash or serious\n   incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle
    occupant) and conveying\n   vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the
    crash or incident.\n   Such calls are often referred to as \"Automatic Crash Notification\"\n
    \  (ACN), or \"Advanced Automatic Crash Notification\" (AACN), even in the\n   case
    of manual trigger.  The \"Advanced\" qualifier refers to the\n   ability to carry
    a richer set of data.\n\n   This document also registers a MIME Content Type and
    an Emergency\n   Call Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location
    data\n   (often referred to as \"crash data\" even though there is not\n   necessarily
    a crash).  An external specification for the data format,\n   contents, and structure
    are referenced in this document.\n\n   This document reuses the technical aspects
    of next-generation pan-\n   European eCall (a mandated and standardized system
    for emergency\n   calls by in-vehicle systems within Europe and other regions).\n
    \  However, this document specifies a different set of vehicle (crash)\n   data,
    specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than\n   the eCall
    Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is an extension\n   of the eCall document,
    with the differences being that this document\n   makes the MSD data set optional
    and VEDS mandatory.  This document\n   also discusses legacy (curcuit-switched)
    ACN systems and their\n   migration to next-generation emergency calling.\n\n\t "

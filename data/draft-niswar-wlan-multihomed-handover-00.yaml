  content: "This document discusses inter-domain WLAN handover management for \nmulti-homed
    mobile node (MN) in order to maintain Voice over IP \n(VoIP) quality during handover
    (HO). Switching a communication path \nfrom one Access Point (AP) to another in
    inter-domain WLANs is a \ncritical challenge for real-time applications such as
    VoIP because \ncommunication quality during HO is more likely to be deteriorated.\n\nTo
    maintain VoIP quality during HO, we need to solve many problems. In \nparticular,
    in bidirectional communication such as VoIP, an AP \nbecomes a bottleneck with
    the increase of VoIP calls. As a result, \npackets queued in the AP buffer may
    experience a large queuing\ndelay or packet losses due to increase in queue length
    or buffer\noverflow, thereby causing the degradation of VoIP quality for the MNs
    side.\nTo avoid this degradation, MNs need to appropriately and autonomously \nexecute
    HO in response to the changes in wireless network\ncondition, i.e., the deterioration
    of wireless link quality and the congestion  state at the AP. We then propose
    an HO management considering all of frame retries, AP queue length, and transmission
    rate at an MN for maintaining VoIP quality during HO. \n\t "

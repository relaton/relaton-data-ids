  content: "   Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve better\n
    \  response time, control over data and carbon energy saving by moving\n   the
    computing services towards the edge of the network in scenarios\n   of 5G MEC
    (Multi-access Edge Computing), virtualized central office,\n   and others.  Providing
    services by sharing computing resources from\n   multiple edges is emerging and
    becoming more and more useful for\n   computationally intensive tasks.  The service
    nodes attached to\n   multiple edges normally have two key features, service equivalency\n
    \  and service dynamism.  Ideally they should serve the service in a\n   computational
    balanced way.  However lots of approaches dispatch the\n   service in a static
    way, e.g., to the geographically closest edge,\n   and they may cause unbalanced
    usage of computing resources at edges\n   which further degrades user experience
    and system utilization.  This\n   draft provides an overview of scenarios and
    problems associated.\n\n   Networking taking account of computing resource metrics
    as one of its\n   top parameters is called Compute First Networking (CFN) in this\n
    \  document.  The document identifies several key areas which require\n   more
    investigations in architecture and protocol to achieve the\n   balanced computing
    and networking resource utilization among edges in\n   CFN.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines procedures for fast reroute protection of  \n   Point-To-MultiPoint
    (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths  \n   (TE-LSP) in  MultiProtocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) networks, based  \n   upon Point-To-MultiPoint bypass tunnels.
    The motivation for using   \n   P2MP bypass tunnels is to avoid potentially expensive
    data   \n   duplication along the backup path that could occur if point-to-point
    \ \n   bypass tunnels where used, i.e. to optimize the bandwidth usage,  \n   during
    fast reroute protection of a link or a node. During link or  \n   node failure
    the traffic carried onto a protected P2MP TE-LSP is  \n   tunnelled within one
    or several P2MP bypass tunnels towards a set of  \n   Merge Points. To avoid data
    duplication backup labels (i.e. inner  \n   labels) are assigned by the Point
    of Local Repair (PLR) following the  \n   RSVP-TE upstream label assignment procedure.\n\t "

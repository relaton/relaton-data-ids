abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft describes a method for improving the quality of experience\n
    \  (QoE) for real-time video and other multimedia services using\n   features
    and functions of the end-point only, that is, without\n   requiring any upgrade
    to the network transport infrastructure.  Any\n   upgrade to the network transport
    infrastructure not only incurs\n   significant costs, these are also time consuming
    and technology-\n   dependent.  Therefore, these QoE improvement mechanisms are\n
    \  significantly more attractive to both network operators and service\n   providers.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document outlines the intermediate-term aspects of the approach described
    in ``An Approach to CO/CL Interworking -- Part I: Introduction''.  This approach
    has been developed at the request of the FNC and RARE communities, but may be
    applicable to other communities.  This memo does not explicitly specify a standard,
    however, it may form the basis for policy within the FNC, RARE, or other communities.
    \                                                                                         Distribution
    of this memo is unlimited.  Questions should be directed to the editor.\n\t "

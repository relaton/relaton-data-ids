  content: "The Ident protocol [RFC-1413], specifies a method for a host to\n   request
    from a remote host an assertion of an identifier associated\n   with a TCP connection
    between the two hosts.  This memo specifies\n   extensions to Ident to support
    strong (i.e., cryptographic)\n   authentication methods.  The extensions are based
    on the Simple\n   Authentication and Security Layer [RFC-2222].\n\t "

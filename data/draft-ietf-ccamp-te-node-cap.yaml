  content: "It is highly desired, in several cases, to take into account Traffic Engineering
    (TE) node capabilities during Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) selection, such as,
    for instance, the capability to act as a branch Label Switching Router (LSR) of
    a Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) LSP.  This requires advertising these capabilities
    within the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).  For that purpose, this document specifies
    Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS)
    traffic engineering extensions for the advertisement of control plane and data
    plane traffic engineering node capabilities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "In many roaming scenarios, it is necessary to be able to carry cost \ninformation
    between the different parties in order to facilitate    credit checking, real-time
    accounting, cost presentation to the \nuser. It is also necessary that this information
    be interpretable by \nautomated systems, that these systems be able to modify
    it to take \ncommissions into account, and that non-repudiation mechanisms be
    \navailable. This document proposes such a system to be used with AAA \narchitectures.\n\t "

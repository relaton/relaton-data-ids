  content: "This document is a report from the IRTF Host Identity Protocol (HIP) research
    group documenting the collective experiences and lessons learned from studies,
    related experimentation, and designs completed by the research group.  The document
    summarizes implications of adding HIP to host protocol stacks, Internet infrastructure,
    and applications.  The perspective of a network operator, as well as a list of
    HIP experiments, are presented as well.  Portions of this report may be relevant
    also to other network overlay-based architectures or to attempts to deploy alternative
    networking architectures.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

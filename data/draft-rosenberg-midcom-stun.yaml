  content: "Simple Traversal of UDP Through NATs (STUN) is a lightweight protocol\nthat
    allows applications to discover the presence and types of\nNetwork Address Translators
    (NATs) and firewalls between them and the\npublic Internet. It also provides the
    ability for applications to\ndetermine the public IP addresses allocated to them
    by the nat. STUN\nworks with nearly all existing NATs, and does not require any
    special\nbehavior from them. As a result, it allows a wide variety of\napplications
    to work through existing NAT infrastructure. The STUN\nprotocol is very simple,
    being almost identical to echo.\n\t "

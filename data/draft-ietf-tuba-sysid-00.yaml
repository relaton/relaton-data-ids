  script: Latn
  content: "This memo specifies an upward-compatible extension to the OSI End System--Intermediate
    System routing protocol (ISO 9542:1988) to allow end systems which are autoconfiguring
    their network layer (NSAP) addresses to suggest a value to be used as the System
    ID.  It is primarily intended for use in the TUBA environment, but is also applicable
    to a CATNIP or pure OSI environment as well.                                       This
    document specifies an experimental protocol for use in the Internet.  In addition,
    this document will be submitted to ISO for consideration as an addendum to the
    ISO 9542 standard.                                      Two interoperable implementations
    of this protocol extension currently exist.\n\t "

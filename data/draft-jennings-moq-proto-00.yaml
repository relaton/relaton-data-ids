  content: "   This specification QuicR, an unified media delivery protocol over\n
    \  QUIC.  It aims at supporting multiple application classes with\n   varying
    latency requirements including ultra low latency applications\n   such as interactive
    communication and gaming.  It is based on a\n   publish/subscribe metaphor where
    entities publish and subscribe to\n   data that is sent through, and received
    from, relays in the cloud.\n   The information subscribed to is named such that
    this forms an\n   overlay information centric network.  The relays allow for efficient\n
    \  large scale deployments.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block provides transport level
    support for reliable content delivery and stream delivery protocols.  LCT is specifically
    designed to support protocols using IP multicast, but it also provides support
    to protocols that use unicast.  LCT is compatible with congestion control that
    provides multiple rate delivery to receivers and is also compatible with coding
    techniques that provide reliable delivery of content.  This document obsoletes
    RFC 3451. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

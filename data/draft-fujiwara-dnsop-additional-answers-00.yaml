  content: "   This document proposes to document the ability to provide multiple\n
    \  answers in single DNS response.  For example, authoritative servers\n   may
    add a NSEC resource record or A/AAAA resource records of the\n   query name.  This
    is especially useful as, in many cases, the entity\n   making the request has
    no a priori knowledge of what other questions\n   it will need to ask.  It is
    already possible (an authoritative server\n   MAY already sends what it wants
    in the additional section).  This\n   document does not propose any protocol changes,
    just explanations of\n   an already acceptable practice.\n\n\t "

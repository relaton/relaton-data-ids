  content: "   This document describes a method for selecting IPv6 Interface\n   Identifiers
    that can be employed by Dynamic Host Configuration\n   Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
    servers when leasing non-temporary IPv6\n   addresses to DHCPv6 clients.  This
    method is a DHCPv6 server-side\n   algorithm that does not require any updates
    to the existing DHCPv6\n   specifications.  The aforementioned method results
    in stable\n   addresses within each subnet, even in the presence of multiple DHCPv6\n
    \  servers or DHCPv6 server reinstallments.  It is a DHCPv6 variant of\n   the
    method specified in RFC 7217 for IPv6 Stateless Address\n   Autoconfiguration
    (SLAAC).\n\n\t "

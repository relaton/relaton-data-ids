  content: "   The BIER WG has a charter item to work on mechanisms which use BIER\n
    \  natively in IPv6.  This document is intended to help the WG with this\n   effort
    by describing the problem space of transporting packets, with\n   Bit Index Explicit
    Replication (BIER) headers, in an IPv6\n   environment.  There will be a need
    to send IPv6 payloads, to multiple\n   IPv6 destinations, using BIER.  There have
    been several proposed\n   solutions in this area.  But there hasn't been a document
    which\n   describes the problem and why this may be necessary.  The goal of\n
    \  this document is to describe the BIER IPv6 problem space, basic use\n   cases,
    why new solutions may be needed and briefly summarize some of\n   the proposed
    solutions.\n\n\t "

  content: "National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are widely used by the national\nlibraries
    and other organizations in order to identify various\nresources such as monographs
    pre-dating the emergence of the ISBN\nsystem or still images.  As a rule, NBNs
    are applied to all kinds of\nresources that do not have an established identifier
    system of their\nown.\n\nSince 2001, there has been a URN (Uniform Resource Names)
    namespace\nfor NBNs, and during 2001-2009 millions of URN-based unique and\npersistent
    NBNs have been assigned.  The namespace registration was\nperformed in RFC 3188
    and applied to the NBNs known at that point.\nNo URN:NBN resolution services existed
    at the time when the RFC was\nwritten.  Since then several countries have started
    using URN:NBNs to\nidentify electronic resources and to provide persistent links
    to\nthem.  To this end, many countries have established URN:NBN\nresolution services
    that supply URN - URL linking.\n\nThis document replaces RFC 3188 and defines
    how NBNs can be supported\nwithin the URN framework.  An updated namespace registration
    (version\n4) is included.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis document is an outcome of work
    performed in 2009-2010 as a part\nof the project PersID (http://www.persid.org)
    revising the basic URN\nRFCs, in order to bring them in alignment with the current
    URI\nStandard (STD 63, RFC 3986), ABNF, and IANA guidelines, and to\nestablish
    a modern URN resolution system for bibliographic\nidentifiers.  This work is being
    brought to the IETF, and the intent\nis to establish a \"URNbis\" (or similar)
    working group in the\nApplications Area as soon as possible, which will then target
    this\nand related work.\n\nComments are welcome on the urn@ietf.org or the urn-nid@ietf.org\nmailing
    list (or sent to the authors).  Interested parties are also\ninvited to contribute
    to the WG formation process being discussed on\nthe former list.Status of This

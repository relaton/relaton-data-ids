  content: "   This document describes the BGP Path Security Tracking attribute, an\n
    \  extension to BGP-4. This attribute provides a transitive means for\n   networks
    to indicate BGP security checks in place to upstream\n   networks. Upstream networks
    can optionally use that information to\n   modify the path selection algorithm
    giving preference to paths\n   reporting better security where the prefix length
    is the same and\n   as-path length is similar. Effectively reporting no security
    would\n   be treated the same as prepending the announcement once and reporting\n
    \  strong security would be treated the same as not prepending. The net\n   result
    of using the information to influence path selection is that\n   more secured
    paths would be preferred over less secured paths.\n\n\n\n\t "

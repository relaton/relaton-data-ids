  content: "   Confidential computing is the protection of data in use by performing\n
    \  computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment.\n   Confidential
    computing could provide integrity and confidentiality\n   for users who want to
    run application and process data in that\n   environment.  When confidential computing
    is used in network like MEC\n   and CAN which provide computing resource to network
    users, TEEP\n   protocol could be used to provision network user's data and\n
    \  application in TEE environment in confidential computing resource.\n   This
    document focuses on using TEEP to provision network user's data\n   and application
    in confidential computing in such network.  This\n   document is a use case and
    extension of TEEP and could provide\n   guidance for MEC, CAN and other scenarios
    to use confidential\n   computing.\n\n\t "

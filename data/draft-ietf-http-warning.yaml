abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "       The current HTTP/1.1 (RFC2068) specification introduces a\n        new
    Warning header, meant to carry status information\n        about a request that
    cannot or should not be carried by the\n        response status code.  The existing
    specification for the\n        interaction between Warning and HTTP caches is
    faulty, in\n        that it may allow incorrect results after cache validation\n
    \       operations.  This document identifies two separate (but\n        related)
    problems, and proposes revisions of the HTTP/1.1\n        specification to solve
    these problems.\n\n\t "

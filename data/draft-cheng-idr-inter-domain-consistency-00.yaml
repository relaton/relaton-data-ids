  content: "   The AS_PATH attribute of BGP UPDATE records the AS number that it has\n
    \  passed through.  Ideally, the traffic to the destination IP prefixes\n   in
    NLRI of BGP UPDATE should be reversely forwarded along the AS path\n   recorded
    in the AS_PATH.  However, due to other factors such traffic\n   redirection, traffic
    engineering, and route aggregation, the actual\n   forwarding AS path of the packet
    is usually different from the\n   propagation path of BGP UPDATE.  In other words,
    inter-domain routing\n   and forwarding are usually inconsistent, which results
    in that inter-\n   domain forwarding has security risks such as traffic black
    hole,\n   loop, detour and the malicious AS, etc.  Consistent inter-domain\n   routing
    and forwarding greatly contributes to enhanced inter-domain\n   forwarding security
    and visibility, which facilitates the long-term\n   evolution of the Internet\n\n\t "

  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers try to decide whether or not to\n
    \  upgrade their brown field or green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6\n   transport,
    Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in\n   the transition of
    their Provider (P) core network as well as Provider\n   Edge (PE) Edge network
    from IPv4 to IPv6.  Operators must be able to\n   continue to support IPv4 customers
    when both the Core and Edge\n   networks are IPv4-Only.\n\n   [I-D.mishra-bess-ipv4-only-pe-design]
    details an important External\n   BGP (eBGP) PE-CE Edge IPv4-Only peering design
    that leverages the MP-\n   BGP capability exchange by using IPv4 peering as pure
    transport,\n   allowing both IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
    and\n   IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over\n
    \  the same (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session.  The design\n   change
    provides the same Dual Stacking functionality that exists\n   today with separate
    IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have today.\n   With this design change from
    a control plane perspective a single\n   IPv4 is required for both IPv4 and IPv6
    routing updates and from a\n   data plane forwarindg perspective an IPv4 address
    need only be\n   configured on the PE and CE interface for both IPv4 and IPv6
    packet\n   forwarding.\n\n   [I-D.mishra-bess-ipv4-only-pe-design] provides a
    IPv4-Only PE design\n   solution for use cases where operators are not yet ready
    to migrate\n   to IPv6 or SRv6 core and would like to stay on IPv4-Only Core short\n
    \  to long term and maybe even indefinitely.  With this design,\n   operators
    can now remain with an IPv4-Only Core and do not have to\n   migrate to an IPv6-Only
    Core.  From a technical standpoint the\n   underlay can remain IPv4 and still
    transport IPv6 NLRI to support\n   IPv6 customers, and so does not need to be
    migrated to IPv6-Only\n   underlay.  With this IPv4-Only PE Design solution ,
    IPv4 addressing\n   only needs to be provisioned for the IPv4-Only PE-CE eBGP
    Edge\n   peering design, thereby eliminating IPv6 provisioning at the Edge.\n
    \  This core and edge IPv4-Only peering design can apply to any eBGP\n   peering,
    public internet or private, which can be either Core\n   networks, Data Center
    networks, Access networks or can be any eBGP\n   peering scenario.\n\n   This
    document details an important External BGP (eBGP) PE-PE Inter-AS\n   IPv6-Only
    peering design that leverages the MP-BGP capability\n   exchange by using IPv6
    peering as pure transport, allowing all and\n   any IPv4 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) and IPv6\n   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to
    be carried over the\n   same (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session for all
    Address Family\n   Identifiers (AFI) and Subsequent Address Family Identifiers(SAFI).\n
    \  The design change provides the same Dual Stacking functionality that\n   exists
    today with separate IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have\n   today.  With this
    IPv4-Only PE Design, IPv6 address MUST not be\n   configured on the the Provider
    Edge (PE) - Customer Edge (CE), or\n   Inter-AS ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary
    Router) to ASBR (Autonomous\n   System Boundary Router) PE-PE Provider Edge (PE)
    - Provider Edge\n   (PE).  From a control plane perspective a single IPv4-Only
    peer is\n   required for both IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates and from a data plane\n
    \  forwarindg perspective an IPv4 address need only be configured on the\n   PE
    to PE Inter-AS peering interface for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet\n   forwarding.
    \ This document defines the IPv4-Only PE Design as a new\n   PE-CE Edge and ASBR-ASBR
    PE-PE Inter-AS BGP peering Standard which is\n   described in the POC testing
    document\n   [I-D.mishra-bess-ipv4-only-pe-design] which is now extended to\n
    \  support to all AFI/SAFI ubiquitously.  As service providers migrate\n   to
    Segment Routing architecture SR-MPLS and SRv6, VPN overlay exsits\n   as well,
    and thus Inter-AS options Option-A, Option-B, Option-AB and\n   Option-C are still
    applicable and thus this extension of IPv4-Only\n   peering architecure extension
    to Inter-AS peering is very relevant to\n   Segment Routing as well.\n\n\t "

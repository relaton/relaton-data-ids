  content: "   The proposal to define what is actually an IETF standard and to\n   create
    ways of explaining and qualifying its applicability and\n   relationship to other
    documents has been described in an\n   Internet-Draft, \"Internet Standards Documentation
    (ISDs)\"\n   (draft-ietf-newtrk-repurposing-isd-00).  This document provides some\n
    \  examples of what such documents might look like.  It includes a very\n   complicated
    example (SMTP) and a fairly simple one (the IMAP/POP\n   authorization specification
    of RFC 2195, which has not progressed\n   beyond Proposed Standard).\n\t "

  content: "Internet users continue to find new ways to apply existing Internet standards
    and technology. In particular, it has become common usage to use the DNS to locate
    services on a particular network, by use of names like gopher.tc.umn.edu or www.hypermall.com.
    \                                   This was a natural use of DNS. However, the
    continued commercialization of the Internet and the current trend towards service
    providers who maintain services and 'pseudo-domains' for numerous customers, and
    the difficulties of using multiple IP's requires that not only an IP address,
    but a port number as well, be available to client software looking for a particular
    service.                                                                   This
    draft describes a simple way to support 'multi-home' servers through the DNS,
    with no changes to existing protocols, and only minimal additions to client software.\n\t "

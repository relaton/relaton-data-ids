  content: "   International law defines a number of emblems, such as the blue\n   helmets
    of United Nations peacekeeping forces, the blue and white\n   shield of UNESCO,
    and the Red Cross of the International Committee of\n   the Red Cross, as indicative
    of special protections under the Geneva\n   Conventions.  Similar protections
    attach to journalists who wear\n   \"Press\" protective emblems on the battlefield,
    under Article 79 of\n   Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions and Resolution 2222
    of the\n   United Nations Security Council.  The emblems of national governments\n
    \  and inter-governmental organizations protect diplomatic pouches,\n   couriers,
    and envoys under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic\n   Relations.  Other marks
    enjoy protections against mis-use under the\n   Paris Convention, the Madrid Protocol,
    and the Trade-Related Aspects\n   of Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n   Such
    physical emblems have a number of weaknesses (e.g., no real-time\n   evaluation
    of their authenticity) and do not translate to the digital\n   realm.  This document
    describes a digital emblem which addresses the\n   shortcomings of the physical
    emblems and makes possible the\n   indication of protections of digital assets
    under international law.\n\n\t "

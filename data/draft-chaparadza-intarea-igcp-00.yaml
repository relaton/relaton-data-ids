  content: "   This document presents a proposal for a multi-purpose Generic Control\n
    \  Protocol (IGCP) for IP based networks.  There is a growing need for a\n   generic
    control protocol framework that can be further customized to\n   specific usage
    contexts in which certain types of control information\n   exchange messages and
    behavior among some functional entities hosted\n   by different nodes or devices
    is desired.  For example, the growing\n   area of self-management, self-organization
    and autonomic networking\n   introduces functional entities into the node/device
    and network\n   architectures that need to exchange control information in order
    to\n   implement self-adaptive behavior by dynamically configuring and\n   optimizing
    the network.  In this Draft we capture a number of control\n   message exchange
    types of contexts (semantics) that can be\n   selectively applied in the exchange
    of control information, which can\n   form the basis of a generic control protocol,
    while at the same time\n   defining the part in the message format that can be
    further\n   customized according to the needs of specific functional entities\n
    \  designed to use the generic control protocol for exchanging control\n   information.
    \ In this Draft, we present our proposal for such a\n   generic control protocol,
    whose message format is divided into two\n   parts: a Common Part and a Generic
    Data Part.  The Common Part\n   defines a set of a variety of selectable control
    semantics (e.g.\n   simple one-way control information flow, indications of whether
    an\n   acknowledgement is needed or not, solicitations for information or\n   push/pull
    behaviors, negotiations for parameter value settings, etc).\n   The Generic Data
    Part can be further customized and structured\n   according to some specific use
    case of conveying control information\n   carried by the Data Part that need to
    be parsed and used by some\n   entities designed to interpret the Data Part according
    to their own\n   specific customization and structuring of the Data Part.  We
    also\n   give an example domain of application of the IGCP, namely the domain\n
    \  of autonomic adaptive control of network behaviours, of which we\n   illustrate
    further by providing an example Use Case that customizes\n   the Data Part of
    the IGCP for use by special functional entities\n   residing in different nodes
    in exchanging information using the IGCP\n   messages.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

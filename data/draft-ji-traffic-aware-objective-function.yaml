  content: "   This document proposes a packet transmission rate metric for parent\n
    \  selection.  This metric represents the amount of traffic that the\n   node
    is transmitting to the current parent node.  This document also\n   proposes an
    Objective Function (OF) using the packet transmission\n   rate metric for parent
    selection in order to balance the amount of\n   traffic between nodes.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>In Traffic-Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to establish
    an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth) across one
    or more networks from a source to a destination. TE information is the data relating
    to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of selecting a TE path. TE information
    is usually only available within a network. We call such a zone of visibility
    of TE information a domain. An example of a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous
    System. In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a series
    of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE
    information about each network. This need not be the full set of TE information
    available within each network but does need to express the potential of providing
    TE connectivity. This subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.
    This document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information
    between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment
    and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem statement.
    For reasons that are explained in this document, this work is limited to simple
    TE constraints and information that determine TE reachability.</p>"

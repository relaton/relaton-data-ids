  content: "   The development and advancements in network operation automation have\n
    \  brought new measurement methodology requirements.  Among them is the\n   ability
    to collect instant network operational state as the packet\n   being processed
    by the networking elements along its path through the\n   domain.  That task can
    be solved using on-path telemetry, also called\n   hybrid measurement.  An on-path
    telemetry method allows the\n   collection of essential information that reflects
    the operational\n   state and network performance experienced by the packet.  This\n
    \  document introduces a method complementary to on-path telemetry that\n   causes
    the generation of network telemetry information.  This method,\n   referred to
    as Hybrid Two-Step (HTS), separates the act of measuring\n   and/or calculating
    the performance metric from collecting and\n   transporting network operational
    state.  The HTS packet traverses the\n   same set of nodes and links as the trigger
    packet, thus simplifying\n   the correlation of informational elements originating
    on nodes\n   traversed by the trigger packet.\n\n\t "

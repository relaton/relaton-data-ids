abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the Internet's current connectivity model as
    an observed architectural equilibrium rather than as a failure to be corrected.
    It argues that the deployed Internet no longer provides ambient, unsolicited end-to-end
    transport reachability, not because of a single design error, but as the cumulative
    result of rational responses to scale, security exposure, administrative autonomy,
    and cost containment. Default-deny boundaries and policy enforcement have become
    structural features of the network. Under these conditions, applications and services
    that require mutual visibility rely on a recurring set of mechanisms, including
    relays, overlays, tunnels, rendezvous services, and long-lived outbound connections,
    to enable interaction. These mechanisms are widely deployed, often effective,
    and serve multiple legitimate roles, including constrained initiation, resource
    discovery, and intentional mediation or fan-out. Their persistence reflects sustained
    demand for controlled initiation in the absence of an explicit transport- layer
    admission capability. The document treats the convergence of these mechanisms
    into steady- state infrastructure as diagnostic evidence. When distinct interaction
    roles are collapsed into a common architectural form, local correctness is preserved,
    but predictable system-level effects emerge, including loss of locality, concentration
    of load, obscured failure semantics, and elevation of coordination and authorization
    semantics into higher layers. This analysis is diagnostic rather than prescriptive.
    It does not propose new protocols, standards, or deployment requirements, nor
    does it advocate restoring ambient reachability. Instead, it argues that if transport-visible
    end-to-end semantics (properties observable and enforceable without application
    payload inspection) are to remain meaningful under contemporary conditions, the
    architecture must provide some form of explicit, policy-bounded admission at boundaries.
    Any architectural responses discussed are illustrative only, intended to make
    these constraints concrete rather than to mandate specific mechanisms. The intent
    of this document is to make the present connectivity equilibrium visible as an
    architectural condition in its own right, and to provide a clearer foundation
    for subsequent analysis, design, or standardization efforts that engage with end-to-end
    semantics under real operational constraints.</p>"

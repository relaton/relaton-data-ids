  content: "   This document examines the Internet's current connectivity model as\n
    \  an observed architectural equilibrium rather than as a failure to be\n   corrected.
    \ It argues that the deployed Internet no longer provides\n   ambient, unsolicited
    end-to-end transport reachability, not because\n   of a single design error, but
    as the cumulative result of rational\n   responses to scale, security exposure,
    administrative autonomy, and\n   cost containment.  Default-deny boundaries and
    policy enforcement\n   have become structural features of the network.\n\n   Under
    these conditions, applications and services that require mutual\n   visibility
    rely on a recurring set of mechanisms, including relays,\n   overlays, tunnels,
    rendezvous services, and long-lived outbound\n   connections, to enable interaction.
    \ These mechanisms are widely\n   deployed, often effective, and serve multiple
    legitimate roles,\n   including constrained initiation, resource discovery, and
    intentional\n   mediation or fan-out.  Their persistence reflects sustained demand\n
    \  for controlled initiation in the absence of an explicit transport-\n   layer
    admission capability.\n\n   The document treats the convergence of these mechanisms
    into steady-\n   state infrastructure as diagnostic evidence.  When distinct\n
    \  interaction roles are collapsed into a common architectural form,\n   local
    correctness is preserved, but predictable system-level effects\n   emerge, including
    loss of locality, concentration of load, obscured\n   failure semantics, and elevation
    of coordination and authorization\n   semantics into higher layers.\n\n   This
    analysis is diagnostic rather than prescriptive.  It does not\n   propose new
    protocols, standards, or deployment requirements, nor\n   does it advocate restoring
    ambient reachability.  Instead, it argues\n   that if transport-visible end-to-end
    semantics (properties observable\n   and enforceable without application payload
    inspection) are to remain\n   meaningful under contemporary conditions, the architecture
    must\n   provide some form of explicit, policy-bounded admission at\n   boundaries.
    \ Any architectural responses discussed are illustrative\n   only, intended to
    make these constraints concrete rather than to\n   mandate specific mechanisms.\n\n
    \  The intent of this document is to make the present connectivity\n   equilibrium
    visible as an architectural condition in its own right,\n   and to provide a clearer
    foundation for subsequent analysis, design,\n   or standardization efforts that
    engage with end-to-end semantics\n   under real operational constraints.\n\n\t "

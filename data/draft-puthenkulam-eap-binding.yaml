  content: "There are several motivations for using compound authentication methods\nusing
    tunnels, but man-in-the-middle attacks have been found in these\nprotocols under
    certain circumstances. They occur when the inner \nmethods used inside a tunnel
    method are also used outside it, without\ncryptographically binding the methods
    together. At the time of writing \nthis document, several protocols being proposed
    within the IETF were \nvulnerable to these attacks, including IKE with XAUTH,
    PIC, PANA over \nTLS, EAP TTLS and PEAP. This document studies the problems and
    suggests \npotential solutions to mitigate them. We also provide a reference \nsolution
    for an EAP tunneling protocol like PEAP.\n\n\t "

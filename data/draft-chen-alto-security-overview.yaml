  content: "This document provides an overview of the security mechanisms that\nare
    probably fit for ALTO. Specifically it discusses those mechanisms\nfor authentication,
    encryption and attack-preventing. The goal\nof this draft is to list and analyze
    the existing security \nmechanisms, and to explore suitable solutions to guarantee
    the \nsecurity of ALTO protocol. This draft is a very early draft to \noutline
    the possible security mechanisms and leaves considerable \ncontents and details
    to be added later.\n\t "

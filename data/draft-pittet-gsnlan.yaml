  content: "This document further specifies a method for resolving IP addresses to
    HIPPI-6400 (High-Performance Parallel Interface) hardware addresses (HARP) and
    for emulating IP broadcast in a logical IP subnet (LIS) as a direct extension
    of HARP.  Furthermore, it is the goal of this memo to define a IP and HARP that
    will allow interoperability for HIPPI-800 and HIPPI-6400 equipment both broadcast
    and non-broadcast capable networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

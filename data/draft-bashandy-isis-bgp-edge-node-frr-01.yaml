  content: "Consider a BGP free core scenario where traffic is tunneled between\nedge
    routers. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1, PE2,..., PEn know\nabout a prefix
    P/m via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm.  If\nthe edge router PEi crashes
    or becomes totally disconnected from the\ncore, it desirable for a core router
    \"P\" that is carrying traffic to\nthe failed edge router PEi to immediately restore
    traffic by re-\nrouting packets originally tunneled to PEi and destined to the
    prefix\nP/m to one of the other edge routers that advertised P/m, say PEj,\nuntil
    BGP re-converges. If the packets originally flowing to the\nfailed edge router
    PEi are labeled, then the repairing core router P\nrouter may need to swap, push,
    or pop the label advertised by the\nfailed edge router PEi with another label
    before re-routing the\npacket through an LSP terminating PEj so that PEj can correctly\nforward
    the packet. The document proposes an extension to IS-IS\nprotocol to inform core
    routers about the repair edge router PEj and,\nfor labeled packets, the label
    that needs to be pushed/swapped before\nsending the packet into the tunnel terminating
    on PEj\n\n\t "

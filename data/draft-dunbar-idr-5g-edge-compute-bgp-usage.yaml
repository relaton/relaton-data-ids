- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft describes the problems in the 5G Edge computing\n   environment
    and how BGP can be used to propagating additional\n   information, so that the
    ingress routers in the 5G Local Data\n   Network can make path selection not only
    based on the routing\n   distance but also the running environment of the destinations.\n
    \  The goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G EC\n   services.\n\n\t "

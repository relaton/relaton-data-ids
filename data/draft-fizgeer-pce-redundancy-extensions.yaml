  content: "   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides\n
    \  mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to instantiate and\n   manage
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) on a Path Computation Client\n   (PCC).\n\n   A PCE
    redundance case is very important and has no real solution for\n   many cases,
    like as active-standby, active-active or not concurrent\n   sessions of PCC with
    different PCEs.\n\n   This document proposes extensions to PCEP to allow a PCC
    and PCEs to\n   support PCE fast and smooth redundancy in case of PCEP session
    and\n   PCE failure.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to instantiate and manage Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) on a Path Computation Client (PCC). A PCE redundance case
    is very important and has no real solution for many cases, like as active-standby,
    active-active or not concurrent sessions of PCC with different PCEs. This document
    proposes extensions to PCEP to allow a PCC and PCEs to support PCE fast and smooth
    redundancy in case of PCEP session and PCE failure.</p>"

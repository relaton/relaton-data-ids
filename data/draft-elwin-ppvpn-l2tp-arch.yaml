  content: "This document discusses the use of L2TP for establishing PPVPNs. It\nproposes
    to use L2TP for VPN membership, topology discovery, and as a\ntunneling mechanism.
    The basic idea is based on leveraging the inherent\nstrengths of L2TP for tunneling
    traffic, and extend the same advantages\nto PPVPNS. The mechanism is applicable
    for both Layer2 and Layer3\nPPVPNs.\n\t "

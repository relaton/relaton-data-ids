  content: "The Automated Computer Time Service [ACTS] has been provided\nsince 1988
    for public users who need to synchronize computer\nclocks to the correct time
    to a Federally Provided timesource\nfor security, audit, or just general synchronization
    purposes.\nIn the current evolving EC aware landscape, the source of time\nused
    in best computing practices is more and more important to\nthe overall dependability
    of the trust model. This document\nthen, is filed for historical purposes on the
    already widely\nused, publicly available ACTS time service protocol. [AWTT]\n\t "

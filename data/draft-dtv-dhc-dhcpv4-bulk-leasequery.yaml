  content: "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has been\n   extended
    with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request\n   information about
    DHCPv4 bindings.  That mechanism is limited to\n   queries for individual bindings.
    \ In some situations individual\n   binding queries may not be efficient, or even
    possible.  This\n   document expands on the Leasequery protocol, adding new query
    types\n   and allowing for bulk transfer of DHCPv4 binding data via TCP.\n\t "

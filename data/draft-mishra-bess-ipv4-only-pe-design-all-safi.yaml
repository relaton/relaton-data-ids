  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers try to decide whether or not to\n
    \  upgrade their brown field or green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6\n   transport,
    Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in\n   the transition of
    their Provider (P) core network as well as Provider\n   Edge (PE) Edge network
    from IPv4 to IPv6.  Operators must be able to\n   continue to support IPv4 customers
    when both the Core and Edge\n   networks are IPv4-Only.\n\n   This specification
    details an important External BGP (eBGP) PE-CE\n   Edge IPv4-Only peering design
    that leverages the MP-BGP capability\n   exchange by using IPv4 peering as pure
    transport, allowing both IPv4\n   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
    and IPv6 Network Layer\n   Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over the
    same (Border\n   Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session.  The design change provides
    the\n   same Dual Stacking functionality that exists today with separate IPv4\n
    \  and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have today.  With this design change from\n   a
    control plane perspective a single IPv4 is required for both IPv4\n   and IPv6
    routing updates and from a data plane forwarindg perspective\n   an IPv4 address
    need only be configured on the PE and CE interface\n   for both IPv4 and IPv6
    packet forwarding.\n\n   This document defines the IPv4-Only PE Design as a new
    PE-CE Edge and\n   ASBR-ASBR PE-PE Inter-AS BGP peering Standard defined in this\n
    \  specification which is now extended to support to all AFI/SAFI\n   ubiquitously.
    \ As service providers migrate to Segment Routing\n   architecture SR-MPLS and
    SRv6, VPN overlay exsits as well, and thus\n   Inter-AS options Option-A, Option-B,
    Option-AB and Option-C are still\n   applicable and thus this extension of IPv4-Only
    peering architecure\n   extension to Inter-AS peering is very relevant to Segment
    Routing as\n   well.\n\n\t "

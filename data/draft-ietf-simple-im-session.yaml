  content: "The current specification for the SIP MESSAGE request method\nindicates
    that SIP instant messages according to a model similar to\nthat of a text pager,
    in that each message stands alone. There is no\nconcept of a chat session or a
    text conference where there is a\nstream of messages that are grouped into a session.
    This memo\nproposes a method of describing MESSAGE sessions by treating the\nmessage
    session just like any other media session described in an\nSDP body in an INVITE
    request.\n\n\n\n\t "

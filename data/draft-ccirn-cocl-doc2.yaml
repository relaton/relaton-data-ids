  content: "The Short-term approach outlined in ``An Approach to CO/CL Interworking:
    Part I: Introduction'' is based on the use of transport-layer relays known as
    transport service bridges, or TS-bridges.  Further, the short-term approach also
    assumes that knowledge of the TS-bridges is present in the end-systems.  The companion
    memo ``An Approach to CO/CL Interworking--Part III: The Intermediate-Term--Provision
    of the CONS over TCP and X.25 Subnetworks'' identifies solutions in which end-system
    knowledge of transport-layer relays is avoided.                                                                                                                    The
    purpose of this memo is two-fold: first, modifications to the operational characteristics
    of end-systems are described; and, second, the operational characteristics of
    TS-bridges are described.\n\t "

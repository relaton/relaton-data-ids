  content: "When distributing information through multicast, it is often\nneccessary
    to solicit feedback from receivers. This feedback can be\nto report on reception
    quality, indicate loss of packets, or\nacknowledge receipt of data. There is a
    range of feedback mechanisms\npossible, ranging from polling to periodic multicast
    feedback. This\ndocument presents a taxonomy of these various mechanisms, with
    a\ndiscussion of the pros and cons of each approach and a discussion of\napplicability.\n\t "

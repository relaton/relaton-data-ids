  script: Latn
  content: "   We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to assess
    if\n   a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Bulk\n   Transport
    Performance target by applying a suite of IP diagnostic\n   tests to successive
    subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be\n   robustly applied to key infrastructure,
    such as interconnects or even\n   individual devices, to accurately detect if
    any part of the\n   infrastructure will prevent any path traversing it from meeting
    the\n   specified Target Transport Performance.\n\n   The IP diagnostic tests
    consist of precomputed traffic patterns and\n   statistical criteria for evaluating
    packet delivery.  The traffic\n   patterns are precomputed to mimic TCP or other
    transport protocol\n   over a long path but are constructed in such a way that
    they are\n   independent of the actual details of the subpath under test, end\n
    \  systems or applications.  Likewise the success criteria depends on\n   the
    packet delivery statistics of the subpath, as evaluated against a\n   protocol
    model applied to the Target Transport Performance.  The\n   success criteria also
    does not depend on the details of the subpath,\n   end systems or application.
    \ This makes the measurements open loop,\n   eliminating most of the difficulties
    encountered by traditional bulk\n   transport metrics.\n\n   Model based metrics
    exhibit several important new properties not\n   present in other Bulk Capacity
    Metrics, including the ability to\n   reason about concatenated or overlapping
    subpaths.  The results are\n   vantage independent which is critical for supporting
    independent\n   validation of tests results from multiple Measurement Points.\n\n
    \  This document does not define IP diagnostic tests directly, but\n   provides
    a framework for designing suites of IP diagnostics tests\n   that are tailored
    to confirming that infrastructure can meet a\n   predetermined Target Transport
    Performance.\n\n\t "

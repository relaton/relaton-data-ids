  content: "There are applications (e.g. fault-management, OAM) that need to\nalert
    LSRs along an LSP. Currently defined alert mechanisms for\nlabeled packets (e.g.,
    TTL expiry, GAL, etc) alert a single LSR along\nthe LSP with one alert message.
    To alert multiple LSRs along the LSP,\nmultiple alert messages have to be generated.
    This results in\nincreasing delays in generating the message as the number of
    LSRs\nincrease. If the message is used to recover from faults, it results\nin
    increasing traffic loss. This document defines a simple and fast\nmechanism that
    can alert all the LSRs along a LSP.\n\t "

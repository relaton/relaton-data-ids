- language: en

  content: "   This document extends the base definition of ABNF (Augmented Backus-\n
    \  Naur Form) to express a rule that is constrained by another rule. If\n   a
    rule B is constrained by rule A, then every production generated by\n   rule B
    must also be generated by rule A. By creating subordinate\n   production forms,
    ABNF-using specifications can formally denote the\n   relationship between a general
    rule and specific subsets of that\n   rule, while preserving ABNF's context-free
    nature.\n\n\t "

  content: "SECSH defines an authentication mechanism that is based on public\nkeys,
    but does not define any mechanism for key distribution.  No\ncommon key management
    solution exists in current implementations.\nThis document describes a protocol
    that can be used to configure\npublic keys in an implementation-independent fashion,
    allowing client\nsoftware to take on the burden of this configuration.\nThis protocol
    is intended to be used from the Secure Shell Connection\nProtocol [4] as a subsystem,
    as described in\tSection ``Starting a\nShell or a Command''.  The subsystem name
    used with this protocol is\nThe public-key subsystem provides a server-independent
    mechanism for\nclients to add public keys, remove public keys, and list the current\npublic
    keys known by the server.  Rights to manage public keys are\nspecific and limited
    to the authenticated user.\nA public key may also be associated with a mandatory
    command.\n\t "

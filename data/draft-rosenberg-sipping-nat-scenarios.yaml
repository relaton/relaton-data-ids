  script: Latn
  content: "This document contains a set of examples about how to establish\nsessions
    through Network Address Translators (NATs) using the Session\nInitiation Protocol
    (SIP). NAT traversal for SIP is accomplished\nusing Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE), which allows the\nmedia streams to work, in addition to the SIP extension
    for symmetric\nresponse routing, which allows SIP itself to flow through NAT.
    The\nexamples cover a range of network topologies and use cases. This\nvariability
    helps to demonstrate that the ICE methodology always\nworks, and that a common
    client algorithm, independent of the network\ntopology and deployment configuration,
    results in the best connectivity.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a technique to generate valid DNSSEC answers\n
    \  on demand for non-existing names by claiming the name exists and\n   returning
    a NSEC record for it.  These answers require only one NSEC\n   record and allow
    live-signing servers to minimize signing operations,\n   packet size, disclosure
    of zone contents and required knowledge of\n   the zone layout.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   There exists a class of modems that wish to support the Dynamic Link\n
    \  Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep] but do not present a\n   single
    Layer 2 network domain as required by DLEP.  Such devices may\n   be:\n\n   o
    \ Modems that maintain a varying link to some upstream backbone\n      network
    infrastructure, where the ability to announce link state\n      and DLEP metrics
    is desired, but the concept of a DLEP destination\n      router for the backbone
    does not apply.  Examples of such devices\n      can include LTE modems, IEEE
    802.11 stations not in ad-hoc mode,\n      and some satellite terminals.\n\n   o
    \ Modems that provide Layer 3 wide area network connectivity between\n      devices,
    where individual DLEP destinations do exist, but are not\n      directly reachable
    by MAC address.\n\n   This document introduces an optional extension to the core
    DLEP\n   specification, allowing DLEP to be used between routers and modems\n
    \  that operate in this way.\n\n   Note:\n\n   o  This document is intended as
    an extension to the core DLEP\n      specification, and readers are expected to
    be fully conversant\n      with the operation of core DLEP.\n\n\t "

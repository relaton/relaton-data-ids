  content: "This memo analyzes provider-to-provider Quality of Service (QoS) agreements
    suitable for a global QoS-enabled Internet.  It defines terminology relevant to
    inter-domain QoS models.  It proposes a new concept denoted by Meta-QoS-Class
    (MQC).  This concept could potentially drive and federate the way QoS inter-domain
    relationships are built between providers.  It opens up new perspectives for a
    QoS- enabled Internet that retains, as much as possible, the openness of the existing
    best-effort Internet.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

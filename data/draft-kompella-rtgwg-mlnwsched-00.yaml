  content: "   Large Language Models (LLMs) are pushing the boundaries of\n   technology.
    \ The scale that they have reached currently vastly\n   exceeds the capacity of
    any single compute unit (XPU); this requires\n   a distributed approach where
    multiple XPUs are connected via a\n   \"backend\" network, typically in a single
    data center.  We are\n   approaching the point where the scale exceeds that of
    a single data\n   center, thus requiring multiple such data centers connected
    via a\n   \"data center interconnect\" network.  Training and inferencing are\n
    \  expensive and critical operations, thus they are typically scheduled,\n   i.e.,
    the (compute) resources they need are carefully estimated,\n   allocated and deployed
    so that these resources are efficiently used.\n   However, while compute investment
    in these LLM processing clusters\n   dwarfs that of networks, it is becoming increasingly
    clear that the\n   latter can greatly impact the former.  This has been the focus
    of\n   recent conferences, including the fantel Birds of a Feather meeting\n   in
    IETF 123, @Scale: Networking and Open Compute Project.\n\n   This memo proposes
    that the same care be taken regarding networking\n   resources: that they are
    estimated, allocated and deployed alongside\n   compute resources; that they have
    contingency plans in case of\n   network glitches; and that a holistic view be
    taken in order to\n   optimize the running of training and inferencing jobs.\n\n\t "

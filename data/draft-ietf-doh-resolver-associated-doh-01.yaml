  content: "   Browsers and web applications may want to know if there are one or\n
    \  more DoH servers associated with the DNS recursive resolver that the\n   operating
    system is already using.  This would allow them to get DNS\n   responses from
    a resolver that the user (or, more likely, the user's\n   network administrator)
    has already chosen.  This document describes\n   two protocols for a resolver
    to tell a client what its associated DoH\n   servers are.  It also describes a
    protocol for a client to find out\n   the address of the resolver it is using,
    if it cannot find that\n   address by an operating system API or some other means.\n\n\t "

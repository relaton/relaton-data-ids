  content: "This Internet Draft describes an existing protocol for transporting IP
    packets over AppleTalk networks.  It is intended to specify, standardize, and
    enhance existing implementations.                                      There is
    much confusion over what MacIP really is, as it has grown by many small increments
    designed and implemented by at least as many people.  There has been no central
    or formal design document, so each of the protocol additions and their effects
    are not well understood.  We hope to dissect the anatomy of the current state
    of the art, and recommend a functional subset of the protocol features and a new
    gateway architecture that will help provide services to multiple zones more reliably.
    \          The MacIP protocol is used to transport IP packets across AppleTalk
    networks. There are many existing host and gateway implementations of this protocol,
    and most of them have many slight differences.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Many service providers are exploring distributed computing techniques\n
    \  to achieve better service response time and optimized energy\n   consumption.
    by moving Such techniques rely upon the distribution of\n   computing services
    and capabilities over many locations in the\n   network such as its edge(e.g.,
    5G MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing)\n   scenarios), the metro region, virtualized
    central office, and other\n   locations.  In such a distributed computing environment,
    providing\n   services by soliciting computing resources hosted in various\n   computing
    facilities (e.g., edges) is being considered, e.g., for\n   computationally intensive
    and delay sensitive services.  Ideally,\n   Services should be computationally
    balanced using service-specific\n   metrics instead of simply dispatching the
    service requests in a\n   static way or optimizing solely connectivity metrics.
    \ For example,\n   systematically directing end user-originated service requests
    to the\n   geographically closest edge or some small computing units may lead
    to\n   an unbalanced usage of computing resources, which may then degrade\n   both
    the user experience and the overall service performance.\n\n   This draft provides
    an overview of scenarios and problems associated\n   with realizing such scenarios,
    identifying several key areas which\n   require more investigations in terms of
    architecture and protocol to\n   achieve balanced computing and networking resource
    utilization among\n   edges providing the services.\n\n\t "

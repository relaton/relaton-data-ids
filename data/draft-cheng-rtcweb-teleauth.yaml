  content: " The WebRTC use-cases and related requirements are defined in\n   [draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements]
    that contains browser to\n   browser use-cases and browser-GW/server use-cases
    (e.g., telephony\n   terminal). In the use-case of telephony terminal, it is necessary
    for\n   telephony terminal to be able to attest his identity to the telephony\n
    \  operator. Unlike the current authentication specified in\n   [draft-ietf-rtcweb-security]
    such as PKI based authentication and web\n   based peer authentication WebRTC
    communication is directly controlled\n   by the telephony operator, which poses
    new authentication methods,\n   including re-using existence authentication mechanism
    of telephony\n   operator and authentication by using web credentials. This document\n
    \  presents the security authentication of WebRTC communication for\n   telephony
    terminal.\n\n\t "

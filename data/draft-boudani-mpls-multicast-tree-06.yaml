  content: "A multicast router should keep forwarding state for every multicast\ntree
    passing through it. The number of forwarding states grows with\nthe number of
    groups. In this paper, we present a new approach, the \nMPLS multicast Tree (MMT),
    which utilizes MPLS LSPs between \nmulticast tree branching node routers in order
    to reduce forwarding \nstates and enhance scalability. In our approach only routers
    that \nare acting as multicast tree branching node routers for a group \nneed
    to keep forwarding state for that group. All other non-\nbranching node routers
    simply forward data packets by traffic \nengineered unicast routing using MPLS
    LSPs. We can deduce that our \napproach can be largely deployed because it uses
    for multicast \ntraffic the same unicast MPLS forwarding scheme. We will briefly
    \ndiscuss the multicast scalability problem, related works and \ndifferent techniques
    for forwarding state reduction. We discuss also\nthe advantages of our approach,
    and conclude that it is feasible and\npromising. Finally, we analytically evaluate
    our approach.\n\t "

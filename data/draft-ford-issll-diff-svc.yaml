  content: "This document describes a mapping of IETF Integrated Services[3]\n   over
    Diff-Serv Networks built from network elements having diff-serv\n   defined Per
    Hop Behaviours (PHBs)[11].  In many ways, this document\n   should look like an
    ISSLL document assuming that a differentiated\n   service network looks like an
    instance of _media_ within a\n   integrated services network.\n \n   It describes
    parameter mappings for supporting Controlled Load [6]\n   and Guaranteed Service
    [7] using the capabilities of diff-serv\n   networks in routers and switches.\n
    \n   These mappings fit within an overall Framework for Integrated and\n   Differentiated
    Services[to be submitted].\n\t "

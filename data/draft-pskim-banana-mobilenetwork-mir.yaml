  content: "   This draft considers a packet distribution scheme for bandwidth\n   aggregation
    on the mobile network with a multi-interfaced router\n   (MIR). In the proposed
    scheme, the MIR with multiple heterogeneous\n   wireless network interfaces effectively
    and fairly distributes\n   packets over end-to-end multi-path through multiple
    network\n   interfaces. Each network interface is considered to have a\n   distribution
    counter associated with corresponding end-to-end path.\n   This distribution counter
    varied by both weighted capacity and\n   distributed packets is used to determine
    if a network interface has\n   enough credits to distribute incoming packets on
    corresponding\n   end-to-end path. As a useful design parameter, the capacity
    unit can\n   be shown to make the performance of the proposed scheme as good as\n
    \  possible.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document covers the technical requirements of contractual\n   interactions
    and agreements between individuals and the entities they\n   engage on a network
    as defined in IEEE7012.  It describes how\n   individuals, acting as first parties,
    can proffer their privacy\n   requirements as contractual terms and arrive at
    agreements recorded\n   and kept by both sides.  This includes the hosting format
    for\n   contracts, negotiation of contracts, signing of contracts, and\n   auditing
    of contracts.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document covers the technical requirements of contractual interactions
    and agreements between individuals and the entities they engage on a network as
    defined in IEEE7012. It describes how individuals, acting as first parties, can
    proffer their privacy requirements as contractual terms and arrive at agreements
    recorded and kept by both sides. This includes the hosting format for contracts,
    negotiation of contracts, signing of contracts, and auditing of contracts.</p>"

  content: "   Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve better\n
    \  response time, control over data and carbon energy saving by moving\n   the
    computing services towards the edge of the network in 5G MEC\n   (Multi-access
    Edge Computing) scenarios, virtualized central office,\n   and others.  Providing
    services by sharing computing resources from\n   multiple edges is an emerging
    concept that is becoming more useful\n   for computationally intensive tasks.
    Ideally, services should be\n   computationally balanced using service-specific
    metrics instead of\n   simply  dispatching the service in a static way, e.g.,
    to the\n   geographically closest edge since this may cause unbalanced usage of\n
    \  computing resources at edges which further degrades user experience\n   and
    system utilization. This draft provides an overview of scenarios\n   and problems
    associated with realizing such scenarios.\n\n   The document identifies several
    key areas which require more\n   investigations in terms of architecture and protocol
    to achieve\n   balanced computing and networking resource utilization among edges\n
    \  providing the services.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document introduces extensions to Mobile IPv6 and IPv6 Neighbour
    Discovery to allow for local mobility handling.  Hierarchical mobility management
    for Mobile IPv6 is designed to reduce the amount of signalling between the mobile
    node, its correspondent nodes, and its home agent.  The Mobility Anchor Point
    (MAP) described in this document can also be used to improve the performance of
    Mobile IPv6 in terms of handover speed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions for multi-provider distributed AI
    inference using the widely-adopted OpenAI Responses API as the reference interface
    standard. These extensions enable provider diversity, load balancing, failover,
    and capability negotiation in distributed inference environments while maintaining
    full backward compatibility with existing implementations. The extensions do not
    require changes to standard API usage patterns or existing client applications.
    By treating the OpenAI Responses API as a de facto standard interface (similar
    to how HTTP serves as a standard protocol), these extensions provide an optional
    enhancement layer for multi-provider orchestration, intelligent routing, and distributed
    inference capabilities. The approach preserves the familiar API interface that
    developers already know and use, while enabling seamless integration across multiple
    AI inference providers without vendor lock-in.</p>"

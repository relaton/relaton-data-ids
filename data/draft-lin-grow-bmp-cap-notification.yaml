abstract:
- content: "<p>When BGP Dynamic Capability is supported, dynamic updates of capabilities
    are allowed over an established BGP session. At present, after the BGP session
    is established, the monitored router sends a BMP Peer Up Notification message
    first, containing the initial capabilities. If BGP Dynamic Capability is supported,
    using BMP Peer Up Notification messages to report subsequent capability changes
    for a BGP session becomes inappropriate. This document defines a new Peer Capability
    Update Notification message type in BMP to report peer capability changes.</p>"

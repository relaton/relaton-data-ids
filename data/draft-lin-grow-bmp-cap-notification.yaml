  content: "   When BGP Dynamic Capability is supported, dynamic updates of\n   capabilities
    are allowed over an established BGP session.  At\n   present, after the BGP session
    is established, the monitored router\n   sends a BMP Peer Up Notification message
    first, containing the\n   initial capabilities.  If BGP Dynamic Capability is
    supported, using\n   BMP Peer Up Notification messages to report subsequent capability\n
    \  changes for a BGP session becomes inappropriate.  This document\n   defines
    a new Peer Capability Update Notification message type in BMP\n   to report peer
    capability changes.\n\n\t "

  content: "BGP communities (RFC 1997) are used by service providers for many\npurposes,
    including tagging of customer, peer, and geographically\noriginated routes.  Such
    tagging is typically used to control the\nscope of redistribution of routes within
    a provider's network, and to\nits peers and customers. With the advent of large
    scale BGP data\ncollection (and associated research), it has become clear that
    the\ninformation carried in such communities is essential for a deeper\nunderstanding
    of the global routing system. This document defines\nstandard (outbound) communities
    and their encodings for export to BGP\nroute collectors.\n\t "

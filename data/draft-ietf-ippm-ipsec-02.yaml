  content: "   The O/TWAMP security mechanism requires that endpoints (i.e. both the\n
    \  client and the server) possess a shared secret.  Since the currently-\n   standardized
    O/TWAMP security mechanism only supports a pre-shared\n   key mode, large scale
    deployment of O/TWAMP is hindered\n   significantly.  At the same time, recent
    trends point to wider IKEv2\n   deployment, which in turn calls for mechanisms
    and methods that\n   enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure
    one-way and\n   two-way network performance in a standardized manner.  This document\n
    \  discusses the use of keys derived from an IKE SA as the shared key in\n   O/TWAMP.
    \ If the shared key can be derived from the IKE SA, O/TWAMP\n   can support cert-based
    key exchange, which would allow for more\n   flexibility and efficiency.  Such
    key derivation can also facilitate\n   automatic key management.\n\n\t "

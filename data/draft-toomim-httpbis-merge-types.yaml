  content: "   Merge Types specify how to merge multiple simultaneous edits to a\n
    \  resource.  This happens when two computers edit the same state over a\n   network
    with latency.  A Merge Type specifies how to merge\n   conflicting changes.  If
    the computers implement and agree upon the\n   same Merge Type, then they can
    guarantee to reach a consistent state,\n   after arbitrary edits, eventually.\n\n
    \  You can define new Merge Types.  This document defines Merge Types,\n   the
    structure of the Merge Type system, and IANA registration\n   procedures for Merge
    Types.\n\n\n\n\t "

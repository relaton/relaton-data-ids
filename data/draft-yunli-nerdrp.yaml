  content: "To reliably hand over data packets to the destination in Delay \n\n Tolerant
    Networks (DTNs), many dissemination-based routing protocols \n\n are proposed.
    Dissemination-based routing protocols assure nodes \n\n including intermediate
    nodes and destinations have more chances to \n\n receive packets, which will increase
    the probability that the packets \n\n can be correctly received by the destination.
    However, the existing \n\n error recovery mechanisms in network layer use the
    simple CRC to \n\n check the data packets independently, and discard the error
    packets \n\n even if one correct packet can be obtained from more than one partly
    \n\n error packets. This document describes Dissemination-based Routing \n\n Protocol
    with Network-layer Error Control (NER-DRP). NER-DRP divides \n\n a data packet
    into RS blocks and inserts redundancy to each block. So \n\n the intermediate
    nodes and destinations can recover a correct data \n\n packet from multiple partially
    error copies of the same packet.\n\t "

  content: "   Robocalling has become an increasing problem in the Public Switched\n
    \  Telephone Network (PSTN).  While techniques like verified caller ID\n   can
    help reduce its impact, ultimately robocalling will continue\n   until economically
    it is no longer viable.  This document proposes a\n   new type of cryptocurrency,
    called SIPCoin, which is used to create a\n   tax - in the form of computation
    - that must be paid before placing\n   an inter-domain call on the SIP-based public
    telephone network.\n   SIPCoin maintains complete anonymity of calls, is non-transferable\n
    \  between users avoiding its usage as an exchangeable currency, causes\n   minimal
    increase call setup delays, and makes use of traditional\n   certificate authority
    trust chains to validate proofs of work.\n   SIPCoin is best used in concert with
    whitelist based techniques to\n   minimize costs on known valid callers.\n\n\t "

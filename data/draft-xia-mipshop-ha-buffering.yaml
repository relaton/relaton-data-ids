  content: "In Mobile IPv6, when a Mobile Node (MN) moves from one Access\nRouter(AR)
    to another, there is a period during which the MN is\nunable to send or receive
    packets because of link switching delay and\nIP protocol operations.  This document
    specifies a mechanism to\nreduce packet loss through a Home Agent (HA) buffering
    downlink\npackets during the handover period.\n\t "

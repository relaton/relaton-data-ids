abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The specification for how a client discovers its local network's\n
    \  NAT64 prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for\n   this
    purpose, but in its Domain Name Reservation Considerations\n   section that specification
    indicates that the name actually has no\n   particularly special properties would
    require special handling, and\n   does not request IANA to record the name in
    the Special-Use Domain\n   Names registry.\n\n   Consequently, despite the well
    articulated special purpose of the\n   name, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded
    in the Special-Use Domain\n   Names registry as a name with special properties.\n\n
    \  As a result of this omission, in cases where software needs to give\n   this
    name special treatment in order for it to work correctly, there\n   was no clear
    mandate authorizing software authors to implement that\n   special treatment.
    \ Software implementers were left with the choice\n   between not implementing
    the special behavior necessary for the name\n   queries to work correctly, or
    implementing the special behavior and\n   being accused of being noncompliant
    with some RFC.\n\n   This document describes the special treatment required, formally\n
    \  declares the special properties of the name, and adds similar\n   declarations
    for the corresponding reverse mapping names.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an\n
    \  interface on a network device.  Routing protocols were developed\n   based
    on the assumption that a destination address had this semantic.\n\n   Over time,
    routing decisions were enhanced to route packets according\n   to additional information
    carried within the packets and dependent on\n   policy coded in, configured at,
    or signaled to the routers.\n\n   Many proposals have been made to add semantics
    to IP packets by\n   placing additional information into existing fields, by adding\n
    \  semantics to IP addresses, or by adding fields to the packets.  The\n   intent
    is to facilitate enhanced routing decisions based on these\n   additional semantics
    in order to provide differentiated paths for\n   different packet flows distinct
    from simple shortest path first\n   routing.  We call this approach \"Semantic
    Routing\".\n\n   This document describes the challenges to the existing routing
    system\n   that are introduced by Semantic Routing.  It then summarizes the\n
    \  opportunities for research into new or modified routing protocols to\n   make
    use of new or additional semantics.\n\n   This document is presented as study
    to support further research into\n   clarifying and understanding the issues.
    \ It does not pass comment on\n   the advisability or practicality of any of the
    proposals and does not\n   define any technical solutions.\n\n\t "

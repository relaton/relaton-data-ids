    hosting a Protected Resource to delegate authorization to one\nor more authorities.
    \ An application (Client) accesses the Protected\nResource by presenting a short
    lived, opaque, bearer token (Access\nToken) obtained from an authority (Authorization
    Server).  There are\nProfiles for how a Client may obtain an Access Token when
    acting\nautonomously or on behalf of a User.\n\nStatus of this Memo\n\nThis Internet-Draft

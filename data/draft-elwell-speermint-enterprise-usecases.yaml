  content: "   Work in the SPEERMINT Working Group has focused to some extent on\n
    \  peering between carrier VoIP Service Providers (VSP).  This draft\n   describes
    some use cases involving SIP peering between enterprise\n   VSPs, with and without
    the involvement of carrier VSPs, and also\n   peering between enterprise VSPs
    and carrier VSPs.  It also discusses\n   some of the key technical considerations
    applicable to these use\n   cases.\n\n   This work is being discussed on the speermint@ietf.org
    mailing list.\n\n\t "

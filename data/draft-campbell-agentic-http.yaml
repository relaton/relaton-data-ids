  content: "   This document describes a set of best practices for facilitating\n
    \  interactions between automated software agents (AI agents) using the\n   Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  As agentic systems proliferate,\n   they frequently
    utilize HTTP in ad-hoc ways, leading to\n   interoperability challenges and the
    rise of proprietary, \"walled\n   garden\" ecosystems.  This document proposes
    a minimalist,\n   standardized framework based on existing HTTP semantics to promote
    a\n   more cohesive, efficient, and open ecosystem.  The primary\n   recommendations
    codify the principles of the Agentic Hypercall\n   Protocol (AHP), including tool
    invocation via GET requests, a\n   stateless authentication scheme, and the formalization
    of the 402\n   (Payment Required) status code to enable a native economic layer
    for\n   the machine economy.\n\n\t "

  content: "    The Universal Forms Description Language (UFDL) describes complex\n
    \   business forms for use over the Internet. The objective of the UFDL\n    is
    to enable the creation of cross-platform Internet business forms\n    that (1)
    contain both the complex logic and precise layout that\n    administrators require,
    (2) are simple to maintain and distribute,\n    and (3) integrate easily with
    existing business systems. As more\n    and more business is done over the Internet,
    the need for a form\n    description language that incorporates these features
    grows. HTML\n    is designed for Internet pages, and is severely limited as a
    form\n    language. This document specifies the vocabulary, syntax, and\n    meaning
    of the UFDL.\n\n\t "

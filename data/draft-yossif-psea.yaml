abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern security architectures assume that trust established at login
    can safely extend to all subsequent actions within a session. This assumption
    is fundamentally flawed. Sessions preserve the memory of authentication but not
    the certainty of authority. Post-Session Execution Assurance (PSEA) is an architectural
    security model that addresses this gap by requiring cryptographic proof of real
    human presence, device trust, and execution authority at the exact moment a sensitive
    action is approved — independent of prior authentication or session state. This
    paper defines the PSEA model, its core principles, its distinction from existing
    security paradigms, and its implications for regulated and mission-critical systems.</p>"

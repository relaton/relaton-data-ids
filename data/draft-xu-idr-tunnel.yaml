  content: "Virtual Aggregation (VA) is a mechanism for shrinking the size of the\nDFZ
    FIB in routers [I-D.francis-idr-intra-va].  VA can result in\nlonger paths and
    increased load on routers within the ISP that\ndeploys VA.  This document describes
    a mechanism that allows an AS\nthat originates a route to associate a tunnel endpoint
    terminating at\nitself with the route.  This allows routers in a remote AS to
    tunnel\npackets to the originating AS.  If transit ASes between the remote AS\nand
    the originating AS install the prefixes associated with tunnel\nendpoints in their
    FIBs, then tunneled packets that transit through\nthem will take the shortest
    path.  This results in reduced load for\nthe transit AS, and better performance
    for the customers at the\nsource and destination.\n\t "

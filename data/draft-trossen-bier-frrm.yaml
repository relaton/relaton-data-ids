- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document introduces a semantic for multicast that is based on\n
    \  initiating forward requests, resulting in dynamic return multicast to\n   the
    set of initiating clients.  The key dynamic nature here is\n   represented in
    the return multicast being possibly different for\n   every transmission.\n\n
    \  We introduce this semantic more formally, present exemplifying use\n   cases
    and then focus on realizing this semantic using BIER\n   technology.\n\n   Although
    this document formally introduces the FRRM semantic as a new\n   communication
    semantic, it does not intend to show the realization of\n   it through any other
    means besides BIER.  This is left for separate\n   documents, if desired.\n\n\t "

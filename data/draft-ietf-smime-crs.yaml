  content: "This document defines an Internet PKI Certificate Request Syntax (CRS).\nIt
    addresses a growing need within the Internet PKI community for an\ninterface to
    public key certification products and services based on\nPKCS7 [PKCS7] and PKCS10
    [PKCS10]. A small number of additional services\nare defined to supplement the
    core certificate request service. Current\nindustry practice regarding the use
    of PKCS7 and PKCS10 is also\ndocumented for the benefit of the Internet community.\n
    \nIn general, the use of PKCS7 in this document is aligned to the\nCryptographic
    Message Syntax [CMS] which provides a superset of the\nPKCS7 syntax.  Throughout
    this document, the term CMS should be taken to\ninclude the PKCS #7 document as
    defined in [PKCS7].  The term CRS refers\nto this specification.\n \nThe chief
    differences between CRS and PKIXMGMT are:\n \n- Use of PKCS7 for security encapsulation
    and transaction framework\n- Use of PKCS10 as the certification request message
    content\n- Certification of Diffie-Hellman Public Keys based on PKCS10 requests\n-
    No assumption of reliable connectivity or persistent on-line operation\n- Single
    request/response transaction model\n\n\t "

  content: "   The MarNEW workshop aimed to discuss solutions for badnwidth\n   optimisation
    on mobile networks for encrypted content, as current\n   solutions rely on unencrypted
    content which is not indicative of the\n   security needs of today's internet
    users.  The workshop gathered IETF\n   attendees, IAB members and various organisations
    involved in the\n   telecommunications industry including original equipment\n
    \  manufacturers and mobile network operators.\n\n   The group discussed the current
    internet encryption trends and\n   deployment issues identified within the IETF,
    and the privacy needs\n   of users which should be adhered.  Solutions designed
    around sharing\n   data from the network to the endpoints and vice versa were
    then\n   discussed as well as analysing whether the current issues experienced\n
    \  on the transport layer are also playing a role here.  Content\n   providers
    and CDNs gave an honest view of their experiences delivery\n   content with mobile
    network operators.  Finally, technical responses\n   to regulation was discussed
    to help the regulated industries relay\n   the issues of impossible to implement
    or bad-for-privacy technologies\n   back to regulators.\n\n   A group of suggested
    solutions were devised which will be discussed\n   in various IETF groups moving
    forward.\n\n\t "

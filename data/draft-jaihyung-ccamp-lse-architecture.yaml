- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   A solution for GMPLS implementation over Ethernet based on label \n
    \  encoding method using 48bits of Ethernet address is proposed. \n   Ethernet
    switches supporting this approach control L2-LSP using \n   source & destination
    MAC addresses. The format of GMPLS label \n   encoding on Ethernet header is described.
    GMPLS bridge model and \n   three implementation models over bridged core network
    are presented. \n   The purpose of this draft is not to define new bridge architecture
    \n   but to help understanding some aspects of this approach, and identify \n
    \  requirements for potential extension to current GMPLS protocols and \n   bridge.

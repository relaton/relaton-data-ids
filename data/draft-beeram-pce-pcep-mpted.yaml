  content: "   A Multipath Traffic Engineered Directed Acyclic Graph (MPTED) tunnel\n
    \  is a Traffic Engineering (TE) construct that facilitates weighted\n   load
    balancing of unicast traffic across a constrained set of paths\n   optimized for
    a specific objective.\n\n   This document describes the provisioning of an MPTED
    Tunnel in a TE\n   network using Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP)\n   in a stateful PCE model.\n\n\t "

  content: "To provide Multicast VPN service, a provider edge router originates\n\"MCAST-VPN\"
    BGP routes.  These routes encode addresses from the\ncustomer's address space
    as well as addresses from the provider's\naddress space.  The customer's address
    space may be either IPv4 or\nIPv6.  Independently, the provider's address space
    may be either IPv4\nor IPv6.  The MCAST-VPN BGP routes always contain an \"address
    family\"\nfield that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4\naddresses
    or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no\nfield that explicitly
    specifies whether the provider addresses are\nIPv4 addresses or whether they are
    IPv6 addresses.  The existing\nspecifications do not explicitly say how to determine
    whether a given\nprovider address is IPv4 or IPv6, and there are differing precedents\nabout
    the method used to encode IPv4 addresses in messages that also\ncontain IPv6 addresses.
    \ This document removes any ambiguity by\nspecifying that MCAST-VPN routes always
    encode provider IPv4\naddresses as four-octet addresses, and that the distinction
    between\nan IPv4 address and an IPv6 address is signaled solely by the length\nof
    the address field.\n\t "

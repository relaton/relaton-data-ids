  content: "Increase in the usage of different access networks, the role of \nRadius
    server is increased to provide access across different access \nnetworks and access
    technologies. AAA server provides access to user \nterminals in different security
    mechanisms in access networks. Due \nto the robust architecture of radius server,
    the functionalities of \nserver can be extended to provide different services
    other than the \nauthentication and access to the user terminal. \n\nIn this draft
    we are proposing to extend the functionalities of the \nradius server for the
    mobility management of the user in the access \nnetworks. In this process the
    Radius server performs the mobility \ncontext management of the user when its
    roaming or during handover \nfrom the visiting network and the home network. In
    this draft we are \nproposing to accommodate Proxy Mobile IP (PMIP) using these
    \nextensions. In this proposed architecture we have defined new \nattributes and
    packet format when a Radius server communicates with \nthe MPA/HA of the PMIP
    architecture as well as with another Radius \nserver for context management.\n\t "

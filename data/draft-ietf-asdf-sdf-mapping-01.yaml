abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
    to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models that describe
    Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for interaction over a network.
    It was created as a common language for use in the development of the One Data
    Model liaison organization (OneDM) models. Tools convert this format to database
    formats and other serializations as needed. An SDF specification often needs to
    be augmented by additional information that is specific to its use in a particular
    ecosystem or application. SDF Supplements provide a mechanism to represent this
    augmentation.</p>"

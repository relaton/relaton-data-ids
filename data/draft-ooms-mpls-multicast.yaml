  content: "This document offers a framework for IP multicast deployment in an\nMPLS
    environment.  Issues arising when MPLS techniques are applied to\nIP multicast
    are overviewed.  The pros and cons of existing IP\nmulticast routing protocols
    in the context of MPLS are described and\nthe relation to the different trigger
    methods and LDP modes are\ndiscussed.  The consequences of various layer 2 (L2)
    technologies are\nlisted.  Both point-to-point and multi-access networks are\nconsidered.\n\t "

  content: "This draft presents the requirements of burst-level control in order \nto
    improve channel efficiency in optical networks. By processing and \ncontrol the
    finer granularity of burst data, the network can improve \nits utilization than
    the present circuit switching based optical \nnetworks. Implementation issues
    of transmission and switching for \ndata burst are took into consideration.  \n\t "

  content: "   This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet\n
    \  Architecture Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and\n   Transition
    (ITAT).  The workshop was hosted by the University of\n   Cambridge in Cambridge
    on December 4th and 5th of 2013.  The goal of\n   the workshop was to facilitate
    adoption of Internet protocols,\n   through examination of a variety of economic
    models, with particular\n   emphasis at the waist of the hourglass.  This report
    summarizes\n   contributions and discussions.  As the topics were wide ranging,\n
    \  there is no single set of recommendations for IETF participants to\n   pursue
    at this time.  Instead, in the classic sense of early\n   research, we note areas
    that deserve further exploration.\n\n   Note that this document is a report on
    the proceedings of the\n   workshop.  The views and positions documented in this
    report are\n   those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect
    IAB\n   views and positions.\n\n\t "

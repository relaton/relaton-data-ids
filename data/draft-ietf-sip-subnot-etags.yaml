- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables\nreceiving
    asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP\nuser agents.  This
    framework defines the procedures for creating,\nrefreshing and terminating subscriptions,
    as well as fetching and\nperiodic polling of resource state.  These procedures
    have a serious\ndeficiency in that they provide no tools to avoid replaying event\nnotifications
    that have already been received by a user agent.  This\nmemo defines an extension
    to SIP events that allows the subscriber to\ncondition the subscription request
    to whether the state has changed\nsince the previous notification was received.
    \ When such a condition\nis true, either the body of a resulting event notification
    or the\nentire notification message is suppressed.\n\t "

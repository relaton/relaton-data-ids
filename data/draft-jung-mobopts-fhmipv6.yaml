  content: "This document proposes a scheme to support Fast Handover over HMIPv6 \nnetworks.
    The MIPv6 mobility could be more enhanced by combining \nFMIPv6 with HMIPv6, in
    which MIPv6 is benefited from all the \nadvantages of the respective schemes.
    This document describes how to \nuse FMIPv6 for HMIPv6 (F-HMIPv6). The F-HMIPv6
    is designed to be \nfriendly with the data transport feature of HMIPv6. In F-HMIPv6,
    the \ntunnel for fast handover is established between MAP and NAR, rather \nthan
    between PAR and NAR. For this purpose, the MN exchanges the \nFMIPv6 messages
    with MAP, not PAR. The F-HMIPv6 utilizes the FMIPv6 \nmessages for handover support
    without further defining any new \nmessages. For the F-HMIPv6, it is proposed
    to define a new flag 'F' in \nthe HMIPv6 MAP option.\n\t "

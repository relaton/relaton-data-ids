  content: "   This document describes an architecture for security management in\n
    \  Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework.  This\n   security
    management architecture consists of I2NSF User, Security\n   Management System
    (i.e., Security Controller and Developer's\n   Management System), and Network
    Security Functions (NSFs) in the\n   I2NSF framework.  I2NSF User consists of
    Application Logic, Policy\n   Updater, and Event Collector.  Security Controller
    consists of\n   Security Policy Manager and NSF Capability Manager.  This document\n
    \  explains their missions and the processing of security management in\n   a
    high level.  It also describes representative use cases, such as\n   security
    management for the list of malware domains, security\n   management for VoIP-VoLTE
    and time-dependent access control.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The IS-IS routing protocol uses TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoding in
    a\n   variety of protocol messages.  The original IS-IS TLV definition\n   allows
    only for 255 octets of value in maximum.  MP-TLV\n   [I-D.ietf-lsr-multi-tlv]
    gives one proposal trying to solve this\n   issue, but has some unsolved challenges
    for its implementations and\n   deployment.  This document analyzes in detail
    these challenges and\n   proposes the community to find other better solution.\n\n\n\t "

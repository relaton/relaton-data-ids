  content: "   In this paper we propose a new hierarchical method to enhance\n   the
    current routing and forwarding paradigm for the Internet\n   called Tunneled Inter-Domain
    Routing (TIDR). We will present the\n   way in which TIDR permits to establish
    tunnels to the edge of\n   the network, and how they will be used to forward traffic
    to\n   stub networks. These tunnels will be explicitly signaled by\n   using a
    new transitive BGP attribute called LOCATOR. This new\n   routing and forwarding
    paradigm provides, among others, the\n   following benefits: global routing table
    reduction, inter-domain\n   routing infrastructure protection, improved multi-homing
    of edge\n   networks, numerous forwarding decisions for a particular address\n
    \  prefix, it stops the AS number consumption, and it can be\n   smoothly deployed.\n\n\t "

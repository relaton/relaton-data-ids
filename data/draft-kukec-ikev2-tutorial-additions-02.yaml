  content: "   This document contains additions to the R. Perlman's draft\n   Understanding
    IKEv2: Tutorial, and rationale for decisions.  Its\n   purpose is to request for
    comments and to incorporate it into\n   draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01.  This
    document describes some of\n   controversial issues discussed on the IPsec mailing
    list and\n   described in various IETF documents that were written after the\n
    \  publication of draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01.  Its additional\n   purpose
    is to explain some of IKEv2 protocol parts that were not\n   described in draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01.
    \ It follows the\n   original R. Perlman draft's concept to be both a tutorial
    for\n   understanding IKEv2 and a summary of IKEv2 issues.\n\n\t "

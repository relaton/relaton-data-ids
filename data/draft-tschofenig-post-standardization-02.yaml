abstract:
- content: "<p>Advancements in the design of web browsers have introduced fundamental
    changes to the architecture of application protocols. The widespread availability
    and growing sophistication of JavaScript interpreters in browsers enables web
    servers to push to browsers all of the application logic required to implement
    a client-server protocol. Consequently, many client-server applications that once
    required an installed client on a host computer now can rely simply on a modern
    browser to act as a client for the purposes of a particular application. For example,
    where once email clients required a custom application to access an inbox, increasingly
    a web browser can serve this purpose as well as the purpose-built applications
    of the past. Similarly, HTTP with the assistance of JavaScript can subsume the
    functions performed by the protocols like POP3 and IMAP. The need for Internet
    standards beyond HTTP to implement an email inbox application consequently diminishes
    - why author standards and worry about interoperability of clients and servers
    when the server can simply push to the client all the code it needs to be interoperable?
    Many client-server applications on the Internet could potential migrate to this
    code distribution methodology. [Note: A separate mailing list has been created
    for discussions related to this document and it can be found here: https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/webapps

  content: "   The TTL of a DNS Resource Record expresses how long a record may be\n
    \  cached before it should be discarded.  This document discusses the\n   possibility
    of \"stretching TTLS\" (using them past their expiration)\n   if they cannot be
    refreshed.  This works on the assumption that stale\n   data may be better than
    no data.\n\n   PLEASE NOTE: This document is a strawman to drive discussion.  It
    may\n   or may not be a good idea; this document documents the idea so that\n
    \  there is something concrete to throw tomatoes at.\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside
    square brackets ([]) is additional background\n   information, answers to frequently
    asked questions, general musings,\n   etc.  They will be removed before publication.
    \ This document is\n   being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-\n

    open issues, etc should all be available here.  The authors\n   (gratefully) accept

  content: "The need to support L2VPN services with disparate Attachment Circuits
    \n(heterogeneous transport) is becoming as important as the support of \nL2VPN
    services with the same type of Attachment Circuits (homogenous \ntransport). To
    support L2VPN services with heterogeneous transport, \nsome means of interworking
    is needed.  The requirement to support L2VPN \ninterworking is stated in [PPVPN-L2FRWK].
    This document describes \ndifferent approaches and mechanisms that can be used
    to provide L2VPN \ninterworking among disparate interfaces.\n\t "

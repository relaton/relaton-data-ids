  content: "This document addresses the communication between an application\n   server
    and media server.  The current work in SIPPING and XCON\n   working groups show
    these logical entities but do not address the\n   physical decomposition and the
    protocol between the entities.\n\n   This document presents the requirements from
    a media server control\n   protocol (MCP) that enables an application server to
    use a media\n   server.  It will address the aspects of announcements, IVR and\n
    \  conferencing media services.\n\t "

  content: "   This draft defines an HTTP/2 [RFC9113] extension to support Symmetric\n
    \  HTTP, which makes a simplifying assumption that the client-side HTTP\n   server
    is only accessible and addressible by the server that accepted\n   the HTTP/2
    connection.\n\nDiscussion Venues\n\n   This note is to be removed before publishing
    as an RFC.\n\n   Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at\n

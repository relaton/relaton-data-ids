  content: "   Some networks, such as in space, have links that are up and down\n
    \  based on a known schedule.  The links characteristics, such as\n   latency
    and bandwidth, are often also known in advance.  This\n   document describes a
    data model, also known as contact plan or graph,\n   and file format to be used
    as input to forwarding and routing\n   engines.  This specification applies for
    both IP and Bundle Protocol.\n\n\t "

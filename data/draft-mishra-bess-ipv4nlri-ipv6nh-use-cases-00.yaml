  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or\n
    \  green field core to an IPv6 transport such as an MPLS LDPv6 core or\n   SRv6
    core, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in\n   the transition
    of the core from IPv4 to IPv6 being able to continue\n   to support legacy IPv4,
    VPN-IPv4, and Multicast VPN customers.  IXPs\n   (Internet Exchange points) are
    also facing IPv4 address depletion at\n   their peering points, which are large
    Layer 2 transit backbones that\n   service providers peer and exchange IPv4 and
    IPv6 (Network Layer\n   Reachability Information) NLRI.  Today these transit exchange
    points\n   are dual stacked.  One proposal to solve this issue is to use\n   [RFC5549]
    to carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI\n   in an IPv6 next
    hop and eliminate the IPv4 peering completely using\n   the concept of [RFC5565]
    softwire mesh framework.  So now with the\n   MP-BGP reach capability exchanged
    over IPv4 AFI over IPv6 next hop\n   peer we can now advertise IPv4(Network Layer
    Reachability\n   Information) NLRI over IPv6 peering using the [RFC5565] softwire
    mesh\n   framework.  Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of\n   usable
    next-hop address families is determined by the Address Family\n   Identifier (AFI)
    and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).\n   Historically the AFI/SAFI
    definitions for the IPv4 address family\n   only have provisions for advertising
    a Next Hop address that belongs\n   to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4
    or VPN-IPv4 Network Layer\n   Reachability Information (NLRI).  [RFC5549] specifies
    the extensions\n   necessary to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with
    a Next\n   Hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an\n
    \  extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the\n   Next
    Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6\n   Protocol.  [RFC5549]
    defines the encoding of the Next Hop to\n   determine which of the protocols the
    address actually belongs to, and\n   a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers
    to dynamically discover\n   whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI
    with an IPv6\n   Next Hop.  With this new MP-BGP capability exchange allows the
    BGP\n   peering session to act as a pure transport to allow the session to\n   carry
    Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address\n   Family Identifier
    (SAFI) for both IPv4 and IPv6.  This document\n   describes the critical use case
    and OPEX savings of being able to\n   leverage the MP-BGP capability exchange
    usage as a pure transport\n   allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over the
    same BGP TCP\n   session.  By doing so allows for the elimination of Dual Stacking
    on\n   the PE-CE connections making the peering IPv6 only carrying both IPv4\n
    \  and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).  This\n   document
    also provides a possible solution for IXPs (Internet\n   Exchange points) that
    are facing IPv4 address depletion at these\n   peering points to use BGP-MP capability
    exchange defined in [RFC5549]\n   to carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability Information)
    NLRI in an\n   IPv6 next hop using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.\n\n\t "

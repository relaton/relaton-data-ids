  content: "This document provides an applicability statement on the use of \n   Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and \n   mechanisms to support
    Basic Mode Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks \n   (L1VPNs). \n    \n   L1VPNs provide
    customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over \n   layer 1 networks. The
    operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic \n   Mode and the Enhanced Mode
    where the Basic Mode of operation does not \n   feature any exchange of routing
    information between the layer 1 \n   network and the customer domain. This document
    examines how GMPLS \n   protocols can be used to satisfy the requirements of a
    Basic Mode \n   L1VPN.\n\t "

  content: "IKE was designed for use with certificates.  In a remote access\nscenario,
    that implies that clients must possess their own\ncertificates.  We leverage off
    of work already done to fast-start\ncertificate use with IPsec via the Simple
    Certificate Enrollment\nProtocol [SCEP].  We use only parts of SCEP over a client\nauthenticated
    TLS/HTTP connection to a CA.  By using TLS, the client\ncan trust a CA root certificate
    it receives, without an out-of-band\nverification and the CA can perform automatic
    enrollment.  We replace\nthe out-of-band client identification process for a certificate\nenrollment
    with a legacy authentication, like RADIUS.  Further, since\nthe certificates issued
    here are short-lived, there is no need to\nsupport client-based revocation or
    rekeying.  Also, there is\ntypically no need for CRL support.\n\t "

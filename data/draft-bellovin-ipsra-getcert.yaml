  content: "(Insert justification, possibly copied wholesale from section 1.1 and\nmaybe
    2.1/2.2 of draft-kelly-ipsra-userauth-00.txt)\nWe consider inadvisable to change
    IKE [RFC2409] to meet these needs.\nIKE is a complex protocol; adding more features
    to it is a bad idea.\nInstead, we propose a layered approach:  use standard IKE,
    with\ncertificates, but provide a simple mechanism to provide clients with\nkeys
    and certificates.\nA number of objections have been raised to using certificates.
    \ The\nmost important is that we lack a public key infrastructure (PKI).  We\ndo
    not agree that this is an obstacle.  Our proposal provides a\nsimple mechanism
    for certificate generation and retrieval, while\nstill relying on legacy authentication
    infrastructures.  Furthermore,\nwe provide for an easy migration path to certificate
    use once\norganizational PKIs are deployed.\nOur purpose at this point is not
    to present a firm protocol.  Rather,\nwe sketch several ideas for what such a
    protocol could look like.\nFinal details can be determined if and when the working
    group opts\nfor this path.\nIn the interests of simplicity, we have chosen to
    reuse standard\nprotocols and components.  In particular, we use HTTP [RFC2616]
    for\ntransport, HTML [RFC1866] as a data representation and TLS [RFC2246]\nfor
    confidentiality.  However, we do not mandate (or even necessarily\nencourage)
    use of a actual Web browser for certificate retrieval.\nAs an alternative, we
    present a transient shared secret generation\nmechanism for IKE.\n\t "

    Collections

  script: Latn
  content: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Extensions for the Web Distributed
    Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) do not define the behavior for the \"POST\"
    method when applied to collections, as the base specification (HTTP) leaves implementers
    lots of freedom for the semantics of \"POST\".\n\n This has led to a situation
    where many WebDAV servers do not implement POST for collections at all, although
    it is well suited to be used for the purpose of adding new members to a collection,
    where the server remains in control of the newly assigned URL. In fact, the Atom
    Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) uses POST exactly for that purpose. On the other
    hand, WebDAV-based protocols, such as the Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV),
    frequently require clients to pick a unique URL, although the server could easily
    perform that task.\n\n This specification defines a discovery mechanism through
    which servers can advertise support for POST requests with the aforementioned
    \"add collection member\" semantics. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "The directory is becoming an important part of the organization. As the\ndata
    in the directory becomes more critical, it needs to be consistent.\nWith more
    applications storing information in the directory, there is a\nneed for transaction
    (atomic commit/rollback) services to be offered by\nthe directory to ensure consistency.
    \ This document describes a\nmechanism to implement transaction service in a distributed
    replicated\ndirectory. It also describes the LDAP APIs that can be used to provide\na
    standard interface for the transaction service.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   TURN server and the network in which it is hosted due to load could\n
    \  adversely impact the traffic relayed through it.  During such high\n   load
    event, it is desirable to shed some traffic but TURN server lack\n   requirements
    about the flows to prioritize them.  This document\n   defines such a mechanism
    to communicate flow characteristics from the\n   TURN client to its TURN server.\n\n\t "

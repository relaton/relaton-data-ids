  content: "   This document describes the structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their role
    in\n   the NFSv4 security architecture.  While the focus of this document is\n
    \  on the role of ACLs in providing a more flexible approach to file\n   access
    authorization than is made available by the POSIX-derived\n   authorization-related
    attributes, the potential provision of other\n   security-related functionality
    is covered as well.\n\n   While the goals of the description are similar to that
    used in\n   previous specifications, the approach taken is substantally\n   different,
    in that the relationship of the multiple ACL models\n   supported has changed.
    \ A core set of functionality, derived form the\n   the now-withdrawn POSIX draft
    ACLs is presented as the conceptual\n   base of the feature set.  Additional features
    used to provide the\n   functionality within the NFSv4 ACL model are presented
    as OPTIONAL\n   extensions to that core.\n\n   The current version of the document
    is intended, in large part, to\n   result in working group discussion regarding
    repairing problems with\n   previous specifications of ACL-related features and
    to enable work to\n   provide a greater degree of interoperability than has been
    available\n   heretofore.  The drafts a framework for addressing these issues
    and\n   obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary changes.\n\n   When
    the resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it\n   will supersede
    the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics\n   appearing in existing minor
    version specification documents for\n   NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby updating
    RFC7530 and RFC8881.\n\n\t "

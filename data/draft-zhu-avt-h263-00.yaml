  content: "This document specifies the RTP payload format for encapsulating H.263
    bitstreams in Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). The H.263 payload header is
    designed for flexibility and simplicity. RTP can use one of three possible modes
    for H.263 video streams depending on the desired performance characteristics.
    The shortest header mode (Mode A) results in simplicity and easy recovery of lost
    packets, brought about by fragmentation at Group of Block (GOB) boundaries. The
    long header modes (Mode B and C) result in more efficient use of bandwidth, brought
    about by fragmentation at Macroblock (MB) boundaries.\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a use case for RFC4474 (SIP Identity) for\n
    \  verifying a certificate that might not be publicly verifiable by\n   traditional
    means.  It provides a best current practice document for\n   binding an identity
    to a certificate for the duration of a session.\n   The certificate may then be
    used to bootstrap further security\n   parameters, e.g., for securing media data.
    \ A discussion of possible\n   enhancements is included in the appendix.  Editors
    Note: The first\n   version of this draft was discussed in the SIPPING WG.  As
    the target\n   of this draft is a BCP for current issues, the draft was updated
    and\n   submitted to the SIP WG.\n\n\t "

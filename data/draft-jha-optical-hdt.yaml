  content: "Next-generation optical network configurations are increasingly\nbecoming
    a complex mix of SONET/SDH and DWDM-based direct data-over-\nfiber links. As SONET/SDH
    networks are primarily geared for TDM\nsupport, transporting IP/ATM packets along
    with PDH (Plesiochronous\nDigital Hierarchy) channels (such as T1/T3/E1/E3) results
    in\ninefficient utilization of provisioned bandwidth. In addition, hybrid\nnetworks
    of ring and mesh configurations for short and long haul\nLAN/MAN/WAN communications
    need a unified end-to-end protocol that\ncan seamlessly transport packets (native
    or otherwise) over any mix\nof optical networks.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "The purpose of this Internet Draft is to propose an update to Internet
    RFC 1521 to include a new primary content-type to be known as chemical. RFC 1521[1]
    describes mechanisms for specifying and describing the format of Internet Message
    Bodies via content-type/subtype pairs. We believe that chemical defines a fundamental
    type of content with unique presentational and processing aspects. We outline
    the typical expected uses of such a content type and propose a number of chemical
    sub-types. This document updates IETF Internet Draft draft-rzepa-chemical-mime-type-00.txt
    in which this specific proposal was made, incorporates suggestions received during
    the initial discussion period and indicates scientific support for and uptake
    of this proposal[2-7].\n\t "

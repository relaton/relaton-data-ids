  content: "The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to\nprovide
    guidance to applications, which have to select one or several\nhosts from a set
    of candidates that are able to provide a desired\nresource.  Entities seeking
    guidance need to discover and possibly\nselect an ALTO server to ask.\n\nThis
    document proposes an ALTO-based scheme to select an ALTO server\nthat can give
    guidance to a given ALTO client.  Unlike some other\nproposed ALTO discovery mechanisms,
    this solution works well if the\nclient seeks guidance from a set of ALTO servers
    that are operated by\nan entity which is not the operator of the access network.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies a bundle of DKIM (RFC 6376) extensions and\n
    \  adjustments.  They do not hinder the currently distributed processing\n   environment
    that includes DKIM, ARC, DMARC and SPF, and are as such\n   backward compatible.
    \ Their aim is however to ultimately slim down\n   the email environment that
    needs to be administrated and maintained,\n   by establishing mutual agreements
    in between sender and receiver(s),\n   verifiable through public-key cryptography,
    and let the SMTP protocol\n   handle decisions solely based upon that.\n\n\t "

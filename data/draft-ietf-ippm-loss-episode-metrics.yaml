  content: "The IETF has developed a one-way packet loss metric that measures the
    loss rate on a Poisson and Periodic probe streams between two hosts.  However,
    the impact of packet loss on applications is, in general, sensitive not just to
    the average loss rate but also to the way in which packet losses are distributed
    in loss episodes (i.e., maximal sets of consecutively lost probe packets).  This
    document defines one-way packet loss episode metrics, specifically, the frequency
    and average duration of loss episodes and a probing methodology under which the
    loss episode metrics are to be measured. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

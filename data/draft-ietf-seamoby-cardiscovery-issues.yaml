  content: "Handoff in IP mobility protocols involves moving a mobile node's\nLayer
    3 routing reachability point from one access router to\nanother, before or after
    the mobile node has established a Layer 2\nconnection with the radio access point
    that is covered by the new\naccess router. In addition, other context information
    about the\nmobile node's IP service may be transferred from the old access\nrouter
    to the new one, in order to minimize the service disruption\nduring the handoff
    process. While the exact details of how this is\naccomplished vary depending on
    the IP mobility and seamless handoff\nprotocols, one common thread required for
    IP-level handoffs is\ndiscovering the candidate access routers for the mobile
    node's\nhandoff. Discovering the candidate access router involves\nidentifying
    its IP address as well as its capabilities that the\nmobile node might be interested
    in. At the time of IP-level handoff,\nif a collection of candidates is identified,
    an algorithm is run to\ndetermine the target access router for the mobile node's
    handoff.\nThis document describes the problem of candidate access router\ndiscovery.
    The document does not discuss the algorithm by which the\nactual target access
    router is selected, nor how the handoff to the\ntarget is achieved.\n\t "

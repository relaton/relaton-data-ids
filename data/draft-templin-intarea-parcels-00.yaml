  content: "   IP packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) are understood to contain a unit of\n
    \  data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss.  Upper\n   layer
    protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n   prepare data units
    known as \"segments\", with traditional arrangements\n   including a single segment
    per packet.  This document presents a new\n   construct known as the \"IP Parcel\"
    which permits a single packet to\n   carry multiple segments.  The parcel can
    be opened at middleboxes on\n   the path with the included segments broken out
    into individual\n   packets, then rejoined into one or more repackaged parcels
    to be\n   forwarded further toward the final destination.  Reordering of\n   segments
    within parcels is unimportant; what matters is that the\n   number of parcels
    delivered to the final destination should be kept\n   to a minimum, and that loss
    or receipt of individual segments (and\n   not parcel size) determines the retransmission
    unit.\n\n\t "

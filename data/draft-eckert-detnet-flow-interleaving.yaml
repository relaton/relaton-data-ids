  content: "   This memo explain requirements, benefits and feasibility of a new\n
    \  DetNet service function tentatively called \"flow interleaving\".  It\n   proposes
    to introduce this service function into the DetNet\n   architecture.\n\n   Flow
    interleaving can be understood as a DetNet equivalent of the\n   IEEE TSN timed
    gates.  Its primary role is intended to be at the\n   ingress edge of DetNet domains
    supporting higher utilization and\n   lower bounded latency for flow aggregation
    (interleaving of flows\n   into a single flow), as well as higher utilization
    and lower bounded\n   latency for interleaving occurring in transit hops of the
    DetNet\n   domain in conjunction with in-time per-hop bounded latency forwarding\n
    \  mechanisms.\n\n\t "

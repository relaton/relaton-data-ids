  content: "   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non-\n
    \  Queue-Building Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The purpose of this NQB\n   PHB
    is to provide a separate queue that enables smooth, low-data-\n   rate, application-limited
    traffic flows, which would ordinarily share\n   a queue with bursty and capacity-seeking
    traffic, to avoid the\n   latency, latency variation and loss caused by such traffic.
    \ This PHB\n   is implemented without prioritization and without rate policing,\n
    \  making it suitable for environments where the use of either these\n   features
    may be restricted.  The NQB PHB has been developed primarily\n   for use by access
    network segments, where queuing delays and queuing\n   loss caused by Queue-Building
    protocols are manifested, but its use\n   is not limited to such segments.  In
    particular, applications to\n   cable broadband links, Wi-Fi links, and mobile
    network radio and core\n   segments are discussed.  This document recommends a
    specific\n   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to identify Non-Queue-\n
    \  Building flows.\n\n\t "

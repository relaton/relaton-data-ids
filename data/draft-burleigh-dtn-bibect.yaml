  content: "   This document describes Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (BIBE), a\n
    \  Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) \"convergence\n   layer\"
    protocol that tunnels BP \"bundles\" through encapsulating\n   bundles.  The services
    provided by the BIBE convergence-layer\n   protocol adapter encapsulate an outbound
    BP \"bundle\" in a BIBE\n   convergence-layer protocol data unit for transmission
    as the payload\n   of a bundle.  Security measures applied to the encapsulating
    bundle\n   may augment those applied to the encapsulated bundle.  The protocol\n
    \  includes a mechanism for recovery from loss of an encapsulating\n   bundle,
    called \"custody transfer\".  This mechanism is adapted from\n   the custody transfer
    procedures described in the experimental Bundle\n   Protocol specification developed
    by the Delay-Tolerant Networking\n   Research group of the Internet Research Task
    Force and documented in\n   RFC 5050.\n\n\t "

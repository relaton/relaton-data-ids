  content: "As technologies that enable bidirectional communication over HTTP\nhave
    become more pervasive, interest has grown in (1) defining\nimproved mechanisms
    for support of existing technologies (short-term\nsolutions such as new HTTP headers)
    and (2) laying the foundation for\ndevelopment of new bidirectional protocols
    (long-term solutions such\nas WebSocket, Bidirectional Web Transfer Protocol,
    and Reverse HTTP).\nIn order to provide context for such work, this document provides
    a\nfirst tentative map of the design space for bidirectional HTTP, with\nspecial
    attention to deployed infrastructure (e.g. web clients,\nintermediaries, firewalls,
    NATs, web servers) and programming\nenvironments.\n\t "

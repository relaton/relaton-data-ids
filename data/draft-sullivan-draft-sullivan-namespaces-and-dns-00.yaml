  content: "   You should probably not read this.  It's not done.\n\n   Not every
    domain name is intended to appear in the global DNS.  It is\n   also possible
    that not everything that looks like a domain name is\n   intended to be one.  Regardless
    of whether a given name is intended\n   to appear in the DNS, such names often
    turn up in domain name slots.\n   When choosing a naming scheme that is not intended
    to be part of the\n   global DNS, it is necessary to understand the architectural\n
    \  implications of using domain names or a domain-name-like syntax.\n\n\t "

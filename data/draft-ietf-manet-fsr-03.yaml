  content: "The Fisheye State Routing (FSR) algorithm for ad hoc networks \nintroduces
    the notion of multi-level 'scope' to reduce routing \nupdate overhead in large
    networks.  A node stores the Link State \nfor every destination in the network.
    \ It periodically broadcasts \nthe Link State update of a destination to its neighbors
    with a \nfrequency that depends on the hop distance to that destination \n(i.e.,
    the 'scope' relative to that destination).  State updates \ncorresponding to far
    away destinations are propagated with lower \nfrequency than those for close by
    destinations.  From state updates,\nnodes construct the topology map of the entire
    network and compute \nefficient routes.  The route on which the packet travels
    becomes \nprogressively more accurate as the packet approaches its \ndestination.
    \ FSR resembles Link State routing in that it propagates\nLink State updates.
    \ However, the updates are propagated as \naggregates, periodically (with period
    dependent on distance) instead\nof being flooded individually from each source.
    \ FSR leads to major \nreduction in link O/H caused by routing table updates.
    \ It enhances \nscalability of large, mobile ad hoc networks.\n\t "

  content: "   ID/Location separation protocols are proposed for scalable routing,\n
    \  enhancing mobility and privacy in IPv6-based vehicular networks.  In\n   IPv6-based
    vehicular networks, ID/Location separation architecture is\n   expected to offer
    benefits.  This document analyzes how ID/Location\n   separation protocols can
    adjust into IP based vehicular networks and\n   suggests requirements for efficient
    ID/Location separation in\n   vehicular networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines a new DNS load balance function that is able
    to\n   transfer information in zone transfer and not need online signing.\n   DNS
    base load balance is popular technology.  It provides weight base\n   response
    and location base response.  It have become an indispensable\n   part of traffic
    engineering.  However, DNS base load balance can't\n   transfer load balance information
    in zone transfer and need online\n   singing because it is not standardized.  This
    document defines a new\n   DNS resource record called \"LB\".  LB RR provides
    the balancing\n   information weight, location and target domain name.\n\n\t "

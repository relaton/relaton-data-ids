  content: "There has recently been a lot of activity in defining the components\nfor
    MPLS-based traffic engineering.  This includes the recent\nextensions of the Interior
    Gateway Protocols (IGPs) to carry metrics\nand resource class information about
    links.  This memo explores\nadditional metrics that are useful for traffic engineering.
    \ We also\ndescribe some of the subtleties associated with the use of the\nresource
    class (or color) vector that has been defined in the IGP\nextensions.\n\t "

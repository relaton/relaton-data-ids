abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Currently, HTML forms allow the producer of the form to request \ninformation,
    including files of data, from the operator using the \nform. However, this capability
    is limited because HTML forms don't \nprovide a way to ask the operator to submit
    input from arbitrary \nsources such as audio devices like microphones. Since input
    and \nupload from various devices is a feature that will benefit many \napplications,
    this draft proposes an extension to the HTML INPUT \ntype='file' form element.
    Motivations include language instruction \nassistance, voice transcription, and
    high-quality speech \ntransmission under low-bandwidth conditions.\n\t "

  content: "     This memo describes a peer-to-peer protocol to set up shortcut\n
    \    paths in an environment where an internetworking (L3) protocol,\n     such
    as IP, overlays a link-layer (L2) protocol such as ATM.  In\n     such a network,
    L3 routing is the default mechanism for data\n     transfer but it is also possible
    to set up direct L2 paths such as\n     ATM VCs, that bypass L3 routing, so as
    to expedite the transfer of\n     data.  The protocol described in this memo can
    be applied as an\n     inter-LIS (Logical IP Subnetwork) shortcut protocol when
    an L2\n     subnetwork is configured into multiple LISs.  It can also be used\n
    \    as an independent protocol to set up direct L2 paths.  In this way,\n     it
    operates without L2 address resolution servers and allows the\n     use of conventional
    routers (those without address resolution\n     function) in the network. Therefore,
    it is useful for networks that\n     have no available L2 address resolution service.\n\t "

    to compelling events.  The resulting location\n   information is conveyed in existing
    location formats wrapped in\n   GEOPRIV privacy extensions to the Presence Information
    Document\n   Format (PIDF-LO).  Location disclosure is limited to voluntary\n
    \  disclosure by a notifier that possesses credentials for the named\n   resource.\n\t "

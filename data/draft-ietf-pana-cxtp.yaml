  content: "The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP based\naccess
    networks.  However, in roaming environments, IP clients might\nchange of gateways
    and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur.\nThe present document describes
    a solution based on the Context\nTransfer Protocol (CXTP) to enhance IP handover
    in mobile\nenvironments.  Note that only the intra-domain case is considered.\nThis
    protocol can recover the previously established PANA security\ncontext from previous
    PANA Authentication Agent.\n\n\n\t "

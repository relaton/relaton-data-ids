  content: "   This paper reviews some of the Enterprises and Organizations\n   requirements
    and constraints and tests the current Encrypted Client\n   Hello (ECH) proposal
    in these environments.  In particular it\n   highlights the need for several clarifications
    as well as highlights\n   known attack vectors which will become easier with the
    current ECH\n   proposal.  The current ECH drafts should consider how they want
    to\n   include enterprises operational security capabilities to mitigate\n   these
    attacks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a nested NEMO Route Opimization (NNRO)\n   protocol
    for the communications between any two nodes in the same\n   nested mobile network.
    \ A nested NEMO Route Opimization message is\n   used to exchange the routing
    information between two mobile network\n   nodes in the same nested mobile network.
    \ The protocol is designed in\n   a way such that the mobility of the entire nested
    mobile network is\n   transparent to the nodes therein.\n\t "

  content: "   DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and\n   Conformance)
    is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating\n   organization can express
    domain-level policies and preferences for\n   message validation, disposition,
    and reporting, that a mail-receiving\n   organization can use to improve mail
    handling.  DMARC policies can be\n   applied at the individual domain level or
    for a set of domains at the\n   organizational level.  The design of DMARC precludes
    grouping\n   policies for a set of domains above the organizational level, such
    as\n   TLDs (Top Level Domains).  These types of domains (which are not all\n
    \  at the top level of the DNS tree) can be collectively referred to as\n   Public
    Suffix Domains (PSDs).  For the subset of PSDs that require\n   DMARC usage, this
    memo describes an extension to DMARC to enable\n   DMARC functionality for such
    domains.\n\n\t "

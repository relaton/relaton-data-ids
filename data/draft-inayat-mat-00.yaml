  content: "This document describes MAT, a mobile network architecture that allows\nsmooth
    node mobility in wireless IP networks without using any packet\nintercepter/forwarder.
    \ The mobility solution is specifically designed\nfor time-sensitive real-time
    applications, particularly the applications\nwhere payload tends to be short and
    packet header overhead is very\nsignificant.  Connections are established as per
    permanent addresses of\nthe nodes but are carried on by the IP layer according
    to the temporary\naddresses by address translation at the end nodes.  The mapping\ninformation
    is maintained by database servers, which can be placed in\nthe Internet in a distributed
    manner.  TCP connections and security\nassociations can be preserved even if the
    node moves to another subnet\nor the node changes its active interface in a multi-homed
    environment\nwithout modifying TCP or IPsec.  In comparison with Mobile IPv4 and\nIPv6,
    MAT has several advantages in terms of header overhead and fault\ntolerance.\n\t "

  content: "       Network services become increasingly multifarious. To efficiently\n
    \      guarantee the quality of services and fully utilize the network\n       resources,
    network operators need to process the traffic flows\n       through more fine-grained
    way. It is a promising way to deploy a\n       series of middleboxes integrating
    various functions. However, this\n       results in two challenges: 1) how to
    control such increasingly\n       different middleboxes; 2) how can networks provide
    a common joint\n       control scheme for both the middleboxes and forwarding
    elements. This\n       document proposes a common joint scheme for middleboxes
    and\n       forwarding elements. This scheme adopts logically centralized control\n
    \      method and utilizes standard control interfaces, which makes it\n       flexible
    and efficient for the networks to determine the most\n       optimizing path and
    the most appropriate functions in the middleboxes\n       for traffic flows. It
    guarantees the quality of services and\n       significantly improves resource
    utilization.\n\n\t "

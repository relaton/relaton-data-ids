  content: "   Multicast services such as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast\n
    \  Service (eMBMS) become more and more popular in mobile networks.  In\n   mobile
    transport network, it is important for the operators to\n   provide efficient
    transport of multicast services with existing\n   network devices.  This document
    describes a mechanism of using point-\n   to-point Pseudowires (PW) [RFC3985]
    to achieve efficient layer 2\n   multicast transportation in mobile transport
    networks.The document\n   gives a multicast method by utilizing a Point-to-Point
    (P2P) path\n   between nodes in a packet transport network , according to the\n
    \  destination IP address.  With it, the PTN nodes can replicate and\n   forward
    the service message, which are received from the multicast\n   server, to the
    plurality of multicast clients corresponding to the\n   destination IP address.\n\n\t "

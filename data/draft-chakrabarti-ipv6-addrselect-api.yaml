  content: "The IPv6 default address selection document (RFC 3484) describes the rules
    for selecting source and destination IPv6 addresses, and indicates that applications
    should be able to reverse the sense of some of the address selection rules through
    some unspecified API.  However, no such socket API exists in the basic (RFC 3493)
    or advanced (RFC 3542) IPv6 socket API documents.  This document fills that gap
    partially by specifying new socket-level options for source address selection
    and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify address selection based on the
    source address preference in accordance with the socket-level options that modify
    the default source address selection algorithm.  The socket API described in this
    document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want to choose
    between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6 aware applications
    that want to use the care-of address for communication.  It also specifies socket
    options and flags for selecting Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) or non-CGA
    source addresses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.\n\t "

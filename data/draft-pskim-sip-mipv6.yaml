abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This draft proposes a new mechanism for Session Initiation Protocol
    \n   (SIP) over Mobile IPv6. In this mechanism, a home agent (HA) on home\n   subnet
    acts as a redirect server and a registrar for SIP as well as \n   a home router
    for Mobile IPv6. Thus, a binding cache in the HA \n   contains location information
    for SIP as well as home registration \n   entries for Mobile IPv6. An access router
    on foreign subnet acts as\n   only a router that offers a domain name. To implement
    the proposed \n   mechanism, some messages used in network layer are newly defined,
    \n   such as a router advertisement, a router solicitation and a binding\n   update.
    In the proposed mechanism, a mobile node doesn't require \n   dynamic host configuration
    protocol (DHCP) and thus both home and \n   foreign subnets don't need DHCP servers,
    unlike existing mechanisms\n   on Mobile IPv4.\n\t "

  content: "   This draft forms part of a discussion on the appropriate use of the\n
    \  Reply-To header in e-mail messages.  This draft argues for one\n   particular
    proposed definition of the Reply-To header.\n \n   It is not intended that this
    document ever become anything more than\n   an Internet-Draft.  If adopted, the
    text here, or a modified version\n   of some parts of it, would be merged into
    the proposed replacement\n   for RFC822.\n\t "

  content: "   This document defines ASCII encoding method for Constrained\n   Application
    Protocol(CoAP). CoAP has defined a binary encoding method\n   to exchange requests
    and responses between constrained nodes or\n   gateways. However, some communication
    modules in constrained nodes\n   support ASCII data only. These modules are cheaper
    and widely\n   deployed. To support these modules, this document describes the\n
    \  method to convert binary CoAP messages to base64 styled ASCII\n   messages.\n\n\t "

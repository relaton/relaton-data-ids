  content: "   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates for\n
    \  the purposes of supporting validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths\n   in
    the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that\n   protocol
    known as BGPSEC.  BGP is a critical component for the proper\n   operation of
    the Internet as a whole.  The BGPSEC protocol is under\n   development as a component
    to address the requirement to provide\n   security for the BGP protocol.  The
    goal of BGPSEC is to design a\n   protocol for full AS path validation based on
    the use of strong\n   cryptographic primitives.  The end-entity (EE) certificates
    specified\n   by this profile are issued under Resource Public Key Infrastructure\n
    \  (RPKI) Certification Authority (CA) certificates, containing the AS\n   number
    extension, to routers within the Autonomous System (AS).  The\n   certificate
    asserts that the router(s) holding the private key are\n   authorized to send
    out secure route advertisements on behalf of the\n   specified AS.  This document
    also profiles the Certificate Revocation\n   List (CRL), profiles the format of
    certification requests, and\n   specifies Relying Party certificate path validation
    procedures.  The\n   document extends the RPKI; therefore, this documents updates
    the RPKI\n   Resource Certificates Profile (draft-ietf-sidr-res-cert-profile).\n\n\t "

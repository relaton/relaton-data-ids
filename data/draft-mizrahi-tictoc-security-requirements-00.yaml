  content: "   As time synchronization protocols are becoming increasingly common\n
    \  and widely deployed, concern about their exposure to various security\n   threats
    is increasing. This document defines a set of requirements\n   for security solutions
    for time synchronization protocols, focusing\n   on the IEEE 1588 and NTP. This
    document also discusses the security\n   impacts of time synchronization protocol
    practices, the time\n   synchronization performance implications of external security\n
    \  practices, the dependencies between other security services and time\n   synchronization.\n\n\t "

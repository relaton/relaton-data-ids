  content: "   A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool usable\n
    \  for different purposes such as scenario planning, impact analysis,\n   and
    change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin into\n   network management
    together with AI, it allows the network management\n   activities to take user
    intent or service requirements as input,\n   automatically assess, model, and
    refine optimization strategies under\n   realistic conditions but in a risk-free
    environment.  Such\n   environment that operates to meet these types of requirements
    is said\n   to have AI driven Network Operations.\n\n   AI driven Network Operations
    brings together existing technologies\n   such as Network Digital Twin and AI
    which may be seen as the use of a\n   toolbox of existing components enhanced
    with a few new elements.\n\n   This document describes an architecture for AI
    driven network\n   operations and shows how these components work together.  It
    provides\n   a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and\n
    \  realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of the network\n   service.\n\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   The SCIM 2.0 Core API defines a simple profile for searching for\n
    \  specific resource types using filters and qualifiers in combination\n   with
    the HTTP GET verb.  The Extended Search specification defines\n   the following
    additional features:\n\n   o  Specification of search terms within an HTTP POST
    verb to avoid\n      accidental leakage of confidential information via HTTP GET
    URLs,\n\n   o  An optional result set representation enabling clients to page\n
    \     through results in a state consistent fashion, and\n\n   o  The ability
    to search across multiple resource types (endpoints)\n      and return one or
    more resource types.\n\n\n\t "

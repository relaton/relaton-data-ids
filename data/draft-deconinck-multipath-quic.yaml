  content: "   Multipath TCP has shown how a reliable transport protocol can\n   efficiently
    use multiple paths for a given connection.  We leverage\n   the experience gained
    with Multipath TCP to propose simple extensions\n   that enable QUIC to efficiently
    use multiple paths during the\n   lifetime of a QUIC connection.\n\n\t "

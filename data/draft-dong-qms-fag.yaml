  content: "   This document addresses the issue of provisioning end-to-end Quality\n
    \  of Service (QoS) for multimedia services over heterogeneous networks\n   and
    introduces a parametric model by using network calculus theory\n   for QoS class
    mapping between different QoS domains.  Then a QoS\n   Mapping Scheme based on
    Flow Aggregation (QMS-FAG) is proposed in\n   this document to mitigate the information
    loss problem due to mapping\n   between QoS domains with different granularity
    of QoS class and to\n   provide efficient network resources utilization by considering
    user's\n   Quality of Experience (QoE).  In QMS-FAG, the QoS requirements of\n
    \  service flows are indicated by a unique FAG identifier which is\n   described
    in a service flow map of QoS parameters.  With FAG\n   identifier and mapping
    executors sitting at the border of different\n   QoS domains, QMS-FAG allows smooth
    QoS class mapping between networks\n   with different granularity of QoS class.
    \ Both numerical analysis and\n   simulation studies are given to demonstrate
    the efficiency of the\n   proposed method.\n\n\t "

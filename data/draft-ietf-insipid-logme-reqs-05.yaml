  script: Latn
  content: "   SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to debug customer\n   reported
    problems and for regression testing if network or client\n   software is upgraded.
    \ As networks grow and become interconnected,\n   including connection via transit
    networks, it becomes impractical to\n   predict the path that SIP signalling will
    take between clients, and\n   therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling
    end-to-end.\n\n   This draft describes requirements for adding an indicator to
    the SIP\n   protocol data unit (PDU, or a SIP message) that marks the PDU as a\n
    \  candidate for logging.  Such marking will typically be applied as\n   part
    of network testing controlled by the network operator and not\n   used in regular
    client signalling.  However, such marking can be\n   carried end-to-end including
    the SIP terminals, even if a session\n   originates and terminates in different
    networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo presents a possible solution to the multihoming in IPv6\nproblem.
    It borrows from earlier 8+8 and GSE proposals but it diverts\nfrom these approaches
    in order to be more readily deployable.\nA source host that wants to initiate
    communications looks up the IPv6\naddresses that will function as the transport-layer
    identifier and\nthe IP-level locators for the remote end in the DNS and collapses\nboth
    of its own addresses into a single one. This makes it possible\nto communicate
    without prior negotiation, but without opening the\ndoor to trivial identity theft
    that must be repaired by cryptographic\nmeans.\n\n\t "

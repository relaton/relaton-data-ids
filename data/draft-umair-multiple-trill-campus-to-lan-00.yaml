  content: "   TRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can\n
    \  have multiple end stations and RBridges attached.  Where multiple\n   RBridges
    are attached to a link, native traffic to and from end\n   stations on that link
    is handled by a subset of those RBridges called\n   \"Appointed Forwarders\",
    with the intent that native traffic in each\n   VLAN (Virtual LAN) be handled
    by at most one RBridge. But when two\n   trill campuses are connected through
    a LAN network, AF selection for\n   each campus should be selected differently.
    This type of scenario\n   occurs when two different TRILL Campuses are connected
    to single LAN\n   and want access to common set of VLAN's.\n\n   The following
    paper is an attempt to handle such scenario.\n\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a framework for the transmission of precise \ntime
    and frequency across packet switched networks, in particular IP \nand MPLS. It
    examines what is needed over and above the protocols \nthemselves to allow accurate
    recovery of time and frequency at remote \nnodes across the packet network. \n\n\t "

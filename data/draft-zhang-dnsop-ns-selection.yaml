  content: "   Nameserver selection algorithms employed by DNS resolvers are not\n
    \  currently standardized in the DNS protocol, and this has lead to\n   variation
    in the methods being used by implementations in the field.\n   Recent research
    has shown that some of these implementations suffer\n   from security vulnerabilities.
    \ This document provides an in-depth\n   analysis of nameserver selection utilized
    by mainstream DNS software\n   and summarizes uncovered vulnerabilities.  It then
    provides\n   recommendations for defending against these security and availability\n
    \  risks.  Designers and operators of recursive resolvers can adopt\n   these
    recommendations to improve the security and stability of the\n   DNS.\n\n\t "

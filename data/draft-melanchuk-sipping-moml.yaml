  content: "The Media Objects Markup Language (MOML) is a modular and extensible \n
    \  language to define media processing objects which execute on media \n   servers.
    The base language defines a set of primitive media objects \n   (called primitives)
    and provides tools to group primitives together \n   and specify how they interact
    with each other. Clients use the base \n   MOML, or extend MOML, to create precisely
    tailored media processing \n   objects which may be used as parts of application
    interactions with \n   users or conferences or to transform media flowing internal
    to a \n   media server. IVR is an example of an application interaction with a
    \n   user.\n\t "

  content: "   This draft specifies requirements for inter-carrier OAM supporting\n
    \  end-to-end OAM functionality and mechanisms development in a multi-\n   operator
    environment. It reviews the already proposed OAM\n   requirements addressed in
    IETF [RFC5706, RFC5860], ITU-T [Y.1730],MEF\n   [MEFOAM] and IEEE [IEEE1, IEEE2]
    which were mainly proposed on a per\n   transport technology basis, but aims to
    differentiate and focus on\n   the requirements and additional requirements resulting
    from inter-\n   operator considerations only.\n\n\t "

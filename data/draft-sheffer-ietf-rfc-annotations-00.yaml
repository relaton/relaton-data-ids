- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFCs were initially intended as, literally, requests for comments.\n
    \  Since then, they have turned into standards documents, with a\n   peculiar
    process to report errors and a highly onerous process to\n   actually have the
    RFC modified/republished.  Non-IETF participants\n   are typically unaware of
    any way to provide feedback to published\n   RFCs, other than direct email to
    the listed authors.  This is very\n   different from the way many web specifications
    are developed today\n   and arguably leads to the value of published RFCs diminishing
    over\n   time.  This document proposes an experiment to remedy this situation\n
    \  through the deployment of web annotations.\n\n\t "

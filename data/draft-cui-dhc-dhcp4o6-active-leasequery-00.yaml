  content: "   As networks migrate towards IPv6, some entities still have the\n   requirement
    for IPv4 configuration.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341]\n   provides a mechanism
    for obtaining IPv4 configuration information\n   dynamically in IPv6 networks.
    \ DHCPv4/DHCPv6 Active Leasequery allows\n   a client to get real-time DHCP address
    binding information data via\n   TCP.  This document describes an extension of
    DHCPv6 Active\n   Leasequery to provide an mechanism to getting real-time DHCPv4
    over\n   DHCPv6 lease information.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>As networks migrate towards IPv6, some entities still have the requirement
    for IPv4 configuration. DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] provides a mechanism for
    obtaining IPv4 configuration information dynamically in IPv6 networks. DHCPv4/DHCPv6
    Active Leasequery allows a client to get real-time DHCP address binding information
    data via TCP. This document describes an extension of DHCPv6 Active Leasequery
    to provide an mechanism to getting real-time DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 lease information.</p>"

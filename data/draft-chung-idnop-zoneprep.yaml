  content: "Zoneprep intends to provide a framework for applying Charprep \nvariants
    to zone file management.  More specifically, Charprep \nprofiles are used to generate
    a set of perceptually equivalent \ndomains from a given primary domain, Zoneprep
    policy profiles are \nused to determine which among the generated set of Charprep
    variants \nto include into the DNS zone file. \nThis document does NOT provide
    any specific Zoneprep policy profiles, \ninstead it describes a framework for
    Zone Administrators (e.g. \nregistries) to consider when implementing IDN.  More
    importantly, to \nconsider the policy on reserving and publishing variants from
    the \ngiven primary domain to the DNS zone files. \nThis framework also leads
    into the discussion of provisioning \nprotocol for IDN, more importantly for a
    server to announce its \npolicies on reserved variants and zone variants, as well
    as for the \nclient to further manage the IDN.  This document will NOT describe
    \nextensively this issue, for further discussion please refer to [EPP-\nI], which
    incorporates this framework into EPP. \n \n\t "

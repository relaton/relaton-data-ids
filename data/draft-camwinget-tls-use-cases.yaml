  content: "   Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, public\n
    \  sector, and cloud service providers today in order to both complement\n   and
    enhance host-based security solutions.  TLS 1.3 introduces\n   several changes
    to TLS 1.2 with a goal to improve the overall\n   security and privacy provided
    by TLS.  However some of these changes\n   have a negative impact on network-based
    security solutions and\n   deployments that adopt a multi-layered approach to
    security.  While\n   this may be viewed as a feature, there are several real-life
    use case\n   scenarios where the same functionality and security can not be\n
    \  offered without such network-based security solutions.  In this\n   document,
    we identify the TLS 1.3 changes that may impact such use\n   cases.\n\n\t "

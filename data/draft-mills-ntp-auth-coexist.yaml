  content: "The purpose of this document is to extend the NTP/SNTP authentication\nscheme
    to support additional features, including Public Key\nInfrastructure (PKI) cryptography,
    in order to certify the identity\nof the sender and verify the integrity of the
    data included in an\nNTP message, as well as provide support for other facilities
    such\nas a timestamp and non-repudiation service.\n \nThis document describes
    a new extension field to support new services\nfor securely binding sender credentials
    to the NTP message stream.\nOne or more of these fields can be included in the
    NTP header to\nsupport designated security services or other services should they\nbecome
    necessary. The presence of these fields does not affect the\noperation of the
    NTP timekeeping model and protocol in any other way.\n \nAdditional fields may
    provide means to securely bind arbitrary client\ndata to be signed along with
    the other information in the message.\nThe ability to sign arbitrary client data
    provides an important non-\nrepudiation feature that allows this data to be cryptographically
    bound\nto an NTP timestamp, together with sender credentials and signature.\n\t "

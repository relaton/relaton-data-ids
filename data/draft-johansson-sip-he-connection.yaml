  content: "   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports multiple transports\n
    \  running both over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.  In more and more cases, a\n   SIP
    user agent (UA) is connected to multiple network interfaces.  In\n   these cases
    setting up a connection from a dual stack client to a\n   dual stack server may
    suffer from the issues described in RFC 6555\n   [RFC6555] - Happy Eyeballs -
    significant delays in the process of\n   setting up a working flow to a server.
    \ This negatively affects user\n   experience.\n\n   This document builds on RFC
    6555 and explains how a RFC3261 [RFC3261]\n   compliant SIP implementation can
    quickly set up working flows to a\n   given hostname (located by using DNS NAPTR
    and SRV lookups) in a dual\n   stack network using connection oriented transport
    protocols.  A\n   solution for connectionless transport protocols is discussed
    in a\n   separate document.\n\n\t "

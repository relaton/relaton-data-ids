  script: Latn
  content: "   In situations where a transmitter of Security Event Tokens (SETs) to\n
    \  a network peer is also a receiver of SETs from the same peer, it is\n   helpful
    to have an efficient way of sending and receiving SETs in one\n   HTTP transaction.
    \ Using current mechanisms such as \"Push-Based\n   Delivery of Security Event
    Tokens (SETs) Using HTTP\" or \"Poll-Based\n   Delivery of Security Event Tokens
    (SETs) Using HTTP\" both require two\n   or more HTTP connections to exchange
    SETs between peers.  In many\n   cases, such as when using the OpenID Shared Signals
    Framework (SSF),\n   the situation where each entity is both a transmitter and
    receiver is\n   getting increasingly common.  In addition, this specification
    enables\n   the transmission and reception of multiple SETs in one HTTP\n   connection.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes some methods which may be used by Service \n  Providers
    to provide Virtual Private Networks for some scenarios \n  where the Service Provider's
    network or Customer's network is \n  comprised of part of IPv4 network and part
    of IPv6 network.These\n  situations can't be avoided during the process of IPv4
    transition to\n  IPv6, e.g. IPv6 backbone network for IPv4-IPv6 hybrid VPN sites,or
    \n  IPv4 backbone network for IPv4-IPv6 hybrid VPN sites,or IPv4-IPv6 \n  hybrid
    backbone network for IPv4-IPv6 hybrid VPN sites.This proposal \n  continue to
    use the concepts described in the Internet draft \n  'BGP/MPLS VPN'[2547bis],such
    as RD,VRF,Route Target and some \n  mechanisms. In BGP/MPLS VPN, MPLS is used
    to forward packets over\n  the backbone, and \"Multiprotocol BGP\" is used for
    distributing VPN \n  routes over the service provider backbone.\n\t "

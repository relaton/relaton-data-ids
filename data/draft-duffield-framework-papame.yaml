  content: "A wide range of traffic engineering and troubleshooting tasks rely on\nreliable,
    timely, and detailed traffic measurements. We describe a\npassive packet measurement
    framework that is (a) general enough to\nserve as the basis for a wide range of
    operational tasks, and (b)\nrelies on a small set of primitives that facilitate
    uniform\ndeployment in router interfaces or dedicated measurement devices,\neven
    at very high speeds. This document describes the motivation for\nsuch a framework
    through several operational examples, defines the\nmeasurement primitives (filtering,
    sampling, and hashing), and\nillustrates their use.\n\t "

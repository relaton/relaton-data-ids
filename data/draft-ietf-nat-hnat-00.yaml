  content: "   Network Address Translation has become a popular technique that\n   allows
    private addresses unregistered with Internet Assigned Number\n   Authority (IANA)
    to be used by organizations within a private routing\n   realm. These private
    addresses must not be advertised in the public\n   Internet. Hence network address
    translator (NAT) are placed at the\n   private routing realm border to translate
    private addresses to globally\n   unique addresses and vice versa before packets
    are exchanged between\n   the disparate routing realms. These modifications of
    the packet header\n   by the NAT cause problems with the use of end-to-end security
    protocols\n   such as IPSec and DNSSEC because network address translation does\n
    \  exactly what the security protocols are trying to prevent.\n \n   Host Network
    Address Translation (HNAT) and Host Network Address Port\n   Translation (NAPT),
    on the other hand, enable end hosts to carry out\n   address (and port) translations
    before applying security algorithms. To\n   make dynamic HNAT and HNAPT possible,
    three conditions are essential.\n   First, there must exist a way for end hosts
    to discover the IP address\n   of Host-NA(P)T-Server. Second, there must be a
    way for externally\n   destined packets to be routed in the private domain between
    the Host\n   -NA(P)T-Client and Host-NA(P)T-Server. Lastly, Host-NA(P)T-Client
    must\n   be able to obtain an address (and port) binding from the Host-NA(P)T\n
    \  -Server dynamically. This draft aims to address these issues to a\n   considerable
    extent. Methods suggested are by no means exhaustive in\n   coverage and implementation
    specifics may vary from vendor to vendor.\n\n\t "

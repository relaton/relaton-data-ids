  content: "   Link Aggregation can be used as Attachment Circuit (AC) of the PWE3
    \n   service. Link Aggregation is treated as a single interface. But \n   changes
    in the the member interface may affect use of the aggregated \n   link. \n\n   This
    draft suggests a method to signal the status of the member \n   interface of Link
    Aggregation AC to remote Provider Edge (PE) device. \n   With this status information,
    the remote PE can decide to discard \n   traffic over bandwidth, avoid congestion
    at local PE and avoid wasted \n   bandwidth of the Packet Switched Network (PSN).
    \ \n\n   This mechanism is required in PWE3 applications because pseudo-wires
    \n   provide layer 1/layer 2 services, carrying traffic that may not \n   respond
    to loss events by executing congestion avoidance \n\t "

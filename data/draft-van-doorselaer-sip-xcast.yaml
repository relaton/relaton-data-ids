  content: "Explicit Multicast (xcast) is a multicast scheme that uses an\nexplicit
    list of destinations instead of one logical multicast\naddress.  Explicit  Multicast
    \ complements  the  existing  multicast\nschemes in that it can efficiently support
    very large numbers of\ndistinct (small) multicast groups and thus can play an
    important\nrole  in  making  multicast  practical  for  applications  such  as\nmultiparty
    \ IP  telephony,  various  conferencing  &  collaborative\napplications, multiparty
    networked games, etc...\nThis  document  explains  how  multiparty  IP  telephony
    \ conferences\nmaking use of xcast can be established by SIP carrying SDP. Some\nopen
    issues will be identified and discussed. Possible extensions to\nSIP and SDP to
    streamline the use of xcast will be suggested as\nwell.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>From charter and milestones, the enhanced Deterministic Networking
    (DetNet) is required to provide the enhancement of flow identification and packet
    treatment for data plane to achieve the DetNet QoS in large-scale networks. This
    document analyzes the gaps of the existing technologies especially applying the
    DetNet data plane as per RFC8938 and proposes the enhancement of packet treatment
    to support the functions and metadata for enhanced DetNet data plane. It describes
    related enhanced controller plane considerations as well.</p>"

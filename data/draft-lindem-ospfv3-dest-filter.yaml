  content: "   OSPFv2 has been criticized for it vulnerability to Denial of Service\n
    \  (DOS) attacks.  With OSPFv3, it is a simple matter to filter on the\n   destination
    address at an implementation dependent level in order to\n   limit the scope of
    DOS attacks to directly attached routers.  Unlike\n   hop limit checking mechanisms,
    it is compatible with the existing\n   OSPFv3 behavior.  However, this level of
    protection will preclude the\n   deployment of virtual links in topologies where
    the filtering is\n   applied.\n\t "

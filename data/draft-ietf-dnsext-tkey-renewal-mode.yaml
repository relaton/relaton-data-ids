  content: "   This document defines a new mode in TKEY and proposes an atomic\n   method
    for changing secret keys used for TSIG periodically.\n   Originally, TKEY provides
    methods of setting up shared secrets other\n   than manual exchange, but it cannot
    control timing of key renewal\n   very well though it can add or delete shared
    keys separately. This\n   proposal is a systematical key renewal procedure intended
    for\n   preventing signing DNS messages with old and non-safe keys\n   permanently.\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "RFC 2468 [1] defines the need of a standardized format for\n     identifying
    ISP subscribers for dial-up roaming operations. It\n     introduced the Network
    Access Identifier (NAI) to fulfill this\n     need. The NAI is provided by the
    mobile node to the dialed ISP\n     during PPP authentication.\n \n     The ability
    to resolve an NAI for second and third generation\n     cellular mobile nodes
    allow traditional cellular service providers\n     to evolve their home cellular
    networks to provide cellular\n     services, IP packet data services and so on
    with a single\n     subscription using NAIs. Additionally, this allows cellular\n
    \    provider to evolve their networks to be IP based.\n \n     Second and third
    generation cellular mobile nodes must perform a\n     registration and authentication
    process with their wireless service\n     provider before the mobile node user
    may initiate other operations\n     (See [1] for examples). These mobile nodes
    do not support the\n     programming of an NAI nor does the cellular registration
    message\n     support the transfer of an NAI to the wireless access network. For\n
    \    example, North American cellular networks (e.g. AMPS, TDMA, CDMA)\n     service
    mobile nodes that register with a Mobile Identification\n     Number (MIN). The
    MIN is then associated with a cellular\n     subscriber. For the same reasons
    stated in [1], it would be\n     convenient if an option was available to provide
    the wireless\n     subscriber identification in the form of an NAI during the
    wireless\n     registration and authentication process. This draft proposes a\n
    \    solution to resolve NAIs from traditional mobile node identifiers.\n\t "

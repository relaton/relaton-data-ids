  script: Latn
  content: "   The router survivability capability provided by the Virtual\n   Router
    Redundancy Protocol for IPv4 (VRRPv4) satisfies the\n   requirements for many
    LAN environments. There are, however,\n   LAN environments that have sub-second
    failover requirements and\n   thus a need for finer granularity of the VRRP timers.
    This draft\n   proposes extensions to VRRPv4 [RFC 3768] for specifying sub-second\n
    \  Advertisement Intervals. A new message type is introduced which\n   permits
    the timer granularity for the Advertisement Interval to\n   be specified. In addition,
    a new field is introduced permitting\n   the specification of the number of missed
    ADVERTISEMENTs before\n   a Virtual Router Master is declared down.\n\n\t "

  content: "   When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be\n
    \  able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to\n   reduce
    sending traffic for some period of time.  Otherwise, it must\n   continue to expend
    resources parsing and responding to Diameter\n   messages, possibly resulting
    in congestion collapse.  The existing\n   mechanisms provided by Diameter are
    not sufficient for this purpose.\n   This document describes the limitations of
    the existing mechanisms,\n   and provides requirements for new overload management
    mechanisms.\n\n\t "

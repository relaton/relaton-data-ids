  content: "   Since the route of packets to the same anycast adddress may change\n
    \  according to the network/node condition, it is not suitable to use\n   anycast
    addresses directry for stateful communications (such as TCP).\n   The more preferable
    use of the anycast addresses is to discover (the\n   unicast address of) service
    node.\n\n   The approach intended to describe in this document is to resolve\n
    \  (i.e., obtain) the corresponding unicast address for the anycast\n   address
    prior to establishing the communication. We call this process\n   as Anycast Address
    Resolving (AARP).\n\n   The objevtive of the AARP is to enable the use of anycast
    addresses\n   to all existing applications without any modifications.\n\t "

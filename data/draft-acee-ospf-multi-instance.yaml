  content: "OSPFv3 includes a mechanism for supporting multiple instances on the\nsame
    link.  OSPFv2 could benefit from such a mechanism in order to\nsupport multiple
    routing domains on the same subnet.  The OSPFv2\ninstance ID is reserved for support
    of separate OSPFv2 protocol\ninstances.  This is different from OSPFv3 where it
    could be used for\nother purposes such as putting the same link in multiple areas.\nOSPFv2
    supports this capability using a separate subnet or the OSPF\nmulti-area adjacency
    capability.\n\t "

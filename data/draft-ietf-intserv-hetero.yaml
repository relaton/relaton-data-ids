abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Routers need not provide all services defined by the intserv WG.  This
    will inevitably lead to heterogeneity in the set of services offered by network
    elements.  How can we enable applications to obtain the end-to-end service they
    desire in the face of this heterogeneity?  This document describes an approach
    involving replacement services and characterizations that builds end-to-end service
    out of heterogeneous per-link service offerings.  This proposal was first described
    in [1], from whence much of the text was lifted.\n\t "

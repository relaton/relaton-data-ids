  content: "   Most existing literature on load balancing in data center\n   networks(DCN)
    focuses on balancing traffic between servers (links),\n   but there is relatively
    little attention given to balancing traffic\n   at the core-level of individual
    servers.  In this draft, we present a\n   load balancing framework for DCN that
    is aware of core-level load, in\n   order to address this issue.  Specifically,
    our approach transfers\n   real-time load from CPUs to an L4 load balancer, which
    then selects a\n   core with lower load based on load information to deliver the
    data\n   packet.  Theoretically, our approach can completely avoid this\n   problem,
    making the system more stable and enabling higher CPU\n   utilization without
    overprovisioning.\n\n\t "

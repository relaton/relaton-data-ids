abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document specifies an alternative retransmission timeout (RTO)\n
    \  and congestion control back off algorithm for the CoAP protocol,\n   called
    Fast-Slow RTO (FASOR).\n\n   The algorithm specified in this document employs
    an appropriate and\n   large enough back off of RTO as the major congestion control\n
    \  mechanism to allow acquiring unambiguous RTT samples with high\n   probability
    and to prevent building a persistent queue when\n   retransmitting.  The algorithm
    also aims to retransmit quickly using\n   an accurately managed RTO when link-errors
    are occuring, basing RTO\n   calculation on unambiguous round-trip time (RTT)
    samples.\n\n\t "

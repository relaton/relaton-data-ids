  content: "Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] requires that when a BGP speaker receives an OPEN
    message with one or more unrecognized Optional Parameters, the speaker must terminate
    BGP peering. This complicates introduction of new capabilities in BGP.                                                       This
    document defines new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities, that is expected
    to facilitate introduction of new capabilities in BGP by providing graceful capability
    negotiation.                                 The proposed parameter is backward
    compatible - a router that supports the parameter can maintain BGP peering with
    a router that doesn't support the parameter.\n\t "

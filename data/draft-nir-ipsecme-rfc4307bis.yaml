  content: "   The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic\n
    \  algorithms in order to provide security services.  The Internet Key\n   Exchange
    protocol provides a mechanism to negotiate which algorithms\n   should be used
    in any given association.  However, to ensure\n   interoperability between disparate
    implementations, it is necessary\n   to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement
    algorithms to ensure that\n   there is at least one algorithm that all implementations
    will have\n   available.  This document defines the current set of algorithms
    that\n   are mandatory to implement as part of IKEv2, as well as algorithms\n
    \  that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory\n   at
    some future time.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Content providers delivering content via CDNs will sometimes deliver\n
    \  content over HTTPS (or both HTTPS and HTTP) but configure the CDN to\n   pull
    from the origin over cleartext and unauthenticated HTTP.  From\n   the perspective
    of a client, it appears that their requests and\n   associated responses are delivered
    over HTTPS, while in reality their\n   requests are being sent across the network
    in-the-clear and responses\n   are delivered unauthenticated.  This exposes user
    request data to\n   pervasive monitoring [RFC7258]; it also means response data
    may be\n   tampered with by active adversaries.  Terminating TLS connections on\n
    \  a load balancer and contacting a backend over cleartext has long been\n   common
    within data centers, but doing this TLS termination and\n   downgrade to HTTP
    at a CDN introduces additional risk when the\n   unprotected traffic is sent over
    the general Internet, sometimes\n   across national boundaries.\n\n   While it
    would be nice to say \"never do this,\" customer demand,\n   content provider
    use-cases, and market forces today make it\n   impossible for CDNs to not support
    downgrade.  However, following a\n   set of best practices can provide visibility
    into when this is\n   happening and can reduce some of the risks.\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IKEv2 specifies that Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication
    must be used together with responder authentication based on public key signatures.
    This is necessary with old EAP methods that provide only unilateral authentication
    using, e.g., one- time passwords or token cards.\n\n This document specifies how
    EAP methods that provide mutual authentication and key agreement can be used to
    provide extensible responder authentication for IKEv2 based on methods other than
    public key signatures. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

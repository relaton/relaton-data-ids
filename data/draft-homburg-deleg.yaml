  content: "   This document proposes a mechanism for extensible delegations in the\n
    \  DNS.  The mechanism realizes delegations with resource record sets\n   placed
    below a _deleg label in the apex of the delegating zone.  This\n   authoritative
    delegation point can be aliased to other names using\n   CNAME and DNAME.  This
    document proposes a new DNS resource record\n   type, IDELEG, which is based on
    the SVCB and inherits extensibility\n   from it.\n\n   IDELEG RRsets containing
    delegation information will be returned in\n   the authority section in referral
    responses from supportive\n   authoritative name servers.  Lack of support in
    the authoritative\n   name servers, forwarders or other components, does not obstruct\n
    \  obtaining the delegation information for resolvers, as it is\n   originally
    authoritative information that can be queried for\n   directly.  None, mixed or
    full deployment of the mechanism on\n   authoritative name servers are all fully
    functional, allowing for the\n   mechanism to be incrementally deployed on the
    authoritative name\n   servers.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo describes the set of goals for a tunneling setup protocol\n
    \  that could be used in several network cases to jumpstart its IPv6\n   offering
    to its customers by providing them IPv6 connectivity through\n   a simplistic
    tunneling mechanism.\n\n   The basic network cases, which may have different sets
    of goals, are\n   also introduced, including 3GPP and other Service Providers.
    \ Two\n   cases are analyzed in the Service Provider scenario, one which apply\n
    \  to simplistic mechanism where the user is already authenticated by\n   other
    network existing means, and another which also takes care of\n   the user authentication.\n\t "

  content: "   The details of Generic Security Service (GSS) credential store\n   management
    vary by platform and even by GSS mechanism.  Credential\n   store management is
    an interesting concept that requires exploration.\n\n   This document defines
    a small extension to the GSS-API for GSS-API\n   credential store management.
    \ While exploration of the credential\n   store management problem is the goal
    of this document, implementation\n   of these interfaces is not discounted nor
    discouraged.\n\t "

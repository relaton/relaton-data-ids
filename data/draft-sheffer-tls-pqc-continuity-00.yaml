abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet transitions toward post-quantum cryptography (PQC),
    many TLS servers will continue supporting traditional certificates to maintain
    compatibility with legacy clients. However, this coexistence introduces a significant
    vulnerability: an undetected rollback attack, where a malicious actor strips the
    PQC or Composite certificate and forces the use of a traditional certificate once
    quantum-capable adversaries exist. To defend against this, this document defines
    a TLS extension that allows a client to cache a server's declared commitment to
    present PQC or composite certificates for a specified duration. On subsequent
    connections, clients enforce that cached commitment and reject traditional-only
    certificates that conflict with it. This mechanism, inspired by HTTP Strict Transport
    Security (HSTS) but operating at the TLS layer provides PQC downgrade protection
    without requiring changes to certificate authority (CA) infrastructure.</p>"

  content: "   The MAC/IP Advertisement route specified in [RFC7432] can optionally\n
    \  carry IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote\n   PEs
    can use this information to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4\n   ARP requests
    and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages (or 'unicast-\n   forward' them to the
    owner of the MAC) and reduce/suppress the\n   flooding produced by the Address
    Resolution procedure. This EVPN\n   capability is extremely useful in Internet
    Exchange Points (IXPs) and\n   Data Centers (DCs) with large broadcast domains,
    where the amount of\n   ARP/ND flooded traffic causes issues on routers and CEs,
    as explained\n   in [RFC6820]. This document describes how the [RFC7432] EVPN
    proxy-\n   ARP/ND function may be implemented to help IXPs and other operators\n
    \  deal with the issues derived from Address Resolution in large\n   broadcast
    domains.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "   As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or\n
    \  green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP-\n   BGP)now
    plays an important role in the transition of their Provider\n   (P) core network
    as well as Provider Edge (PE) Edge network from IPv4\n   to IPv6.  Operators must
    be able to continue to support IPv4\n   customers when both the Core and Edge
    networks are IPv6-Only.\n\n   This document details an important External BGP
    (eBGP) PE-CE Edge\n   IPv6-Only peering design that leverages the MP-BGP capability\n
    \  exchange by using IPv6 peering as pure transport, allowing both IPv4\n   Network
    Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer\n   Reachability
    Information (NLRI)to be carried over the same (Border\n   Gateway Protocol) BGP
    TCP session.  The design change provides the\n   same Dual Stacking functionality
    that exists today with separate IPv4\n   and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have today.
    \ With this design change from\n   a control plane perspective a single IPv6 is
    required for both IPv4\n   and IPv6 routing updates and from a data plane forwarindg
    perspective\n   an IPv6 address need only be configured on the PE and CE interface\n
    \  for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding.\n\n   This document provides a much
    needed solution for Internet Exchange\n   Point (IXP) that are facing IPv4 address
    depletion at large peering\n   points.  With this design, IXP can now deploy PE-CE
    IPv6-Only eBGP\n   Edge peering design to eliminate IPv4 provisioning at the Edge.
    \ This\n   core and edge IPv6-Only peering design paradigm change can apply to\n
    \  any eBGP peering, public internet or private, which can be either\n   Core
    networks, Data Center networks, Access networks or can be any\n   eBGP peering
    scenario.  This document provides vendor specific test\n   cases for the IPv6-Only
    peering design as well as test results for\n   the five major vendors stakeholders
    in the routing and switching\n   indusrty, Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei.
    \ With the test\n   results provided for the IPv6-Only Edge peering design, the
    goal is\n   that all other vendors around the world that have not been tested\n
    \  will begin to adopt and implement this new Best Current Practice for\n   eBGP
    IPv6-Only Edge peering.\n\n   As this issue with IXP IPv4 address depletion is
    a critical issue\n   around the world, it is imperative for an immediate solution
    that can\n   be implemented quickly.  This Best Current Practice IPv6-only eBGP\n
    \  peering design specification will help proliferate IPv6-Only\n   deployments
    at the eBGP Edge network peering points to starting\n   immediately at a minimum
    with operators around the world using Cisco,\n   Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei.
    \ As other vendors start to\n   implement this Best Current Practice, the IXP
    IPv4 address depletion\n   gap will eventually be eliminated.\n\n\t "

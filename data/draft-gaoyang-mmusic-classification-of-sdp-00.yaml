  content: "Generally, next SDP is alternative descriptions for the previous one\nof
    the same session.  But there is other type of SDP which describe\npart of the
    session, not all aspects of the session.  It must be\ncombined with the previous
    one(or ones) to show the effects.  There\nhas been such usage of SDPs in RFC3108.
    \ But there is no such\nguidance for that extension and usage.  This text is aimed
    for that.\n\t "

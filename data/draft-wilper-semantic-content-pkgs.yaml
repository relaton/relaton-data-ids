  content: "   This document specifies Semantic Content Packages, an experimental\n
    \  data structure and associated format for storing and transmitting a\n   named
    set of RDF statements with a set of content streams.  Packages\n   can be arranged
    as a set of files in a directory hierarchy or\n   serialized into a single stream
    for transmission and archival\n   storage.  For the latter, a new ZIP-based media
    type,\n   application/scp, is defined.\n\n\n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "As discussed in [1], the need for survivable optical networks is \ncritical,
    and introducing capabilities that further enhance network \nsurvivability continues
    to be an essential objective.   This is \nparticularly important for operators
    with stringent requirements for \nnetwork resilience and service survivability.
    \ However, disruption of \nservice can result not only from faults, but also from
    scheduled \nmaintenance procedures. This draft introduces some additional \nconsiderations
    and carrier needs related to failure recovery and \nscheduled maintenance work
    in switched optical networks. These are of \ncritical importance for serving -business
    customers who require super \nhigh quality service assurance and pay correspondingly
    high tariffs in \norder to guarantee this level of QoS.\n\t "

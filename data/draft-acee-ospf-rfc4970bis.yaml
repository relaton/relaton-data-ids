  content: "   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to\n
    \  know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the\n   routing
    domain.  This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and\n   OSPFv3 for advertising
    optional router capabilities.  A new Router\n   Information (RI) Link State Advertisement
    (LSA) is proposed for this\n   purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented
    with a new opaque\n   LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented
    with a new\n   LSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be\n
    \  advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or\n   autonomous
    system (AS)).  This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by\n   providing a revised specification
    including support for advertisement\n   of multiple instances of the RI LSA and
    a TLV for functional\n   capabilities.\n\n\t "

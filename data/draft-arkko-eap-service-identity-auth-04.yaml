  content: "   EAP is typically used in an arrangement where the actual service\n
    \  (such as a wireless LAN access point) is separated from the\n   authentication
    server.  However, EAP itself does not have a concept\n   of a service identity
    or its parameters, and thus the client usually\n   does not authenticate any information
    about the service itself, even\n   when a mutually authenticating EAP method is
    used.  This document\n   specifies a backward compatible extension to popular
    EAP methods for\n   authenticating service related information, such as the identity
    and\n   type of the offered service.  A common parameter name space is\n   created
    in order to ensure that the same kinds of identifiers can be\n   authenticated
    independent of the choice of the EAP authentication\n   method, retaining the
    EAP media independence principle.\n\t "

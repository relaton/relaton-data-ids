  content: "   BGP Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the\n   dissemination
    of traffic flow specification rules.  The primary\n   application of this extension
    is DDoS mitigation where the flowspec\n   rules are applied in most cases to all
    peering routers of the\n   network.\n\n   This document will present another use
    case of BGP Flow-spec where\n   flow specifications are used to maintain some
    access control lists at\n   network boundary.  BGP Flowspec is a very efficient
    distributing\n   machinery that can help in saving OPEX while deploying/updating
    ACLs.\n   This new application requires flow specification rules to be applied\n
    \  only on a specific subset of interfaces and in a specific direction.\n\n   The
    current specification of BGP Flow-spec does not detail where the\n   flow specification
    rules need to be applied.\n\n   This document presents a new interface-set flowspec
    action that will\n   be used in complement of other actions (marking, rate-limiting
    ...).\n   The purpose of this extension is to inform remote routers on where to\n
    \  apply the flow specification.\n\n   This extension can also be used in a DDoS
    mitigation context where a\n   provider wants to apply the filtering only on specific
    peers.\n\n\n\t "

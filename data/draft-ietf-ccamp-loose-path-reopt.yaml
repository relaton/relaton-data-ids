  content: "This document defines a mechanism for the reoptimization of loosely routed
    MPLS and GMPLS (Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) signaled with Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic
    Engineering (RSVP-TE).  This document proposes a mechanism that allows a TE LSP
    head-end Label Switching Router (LSR) to trigger a new path re-evaluation on every
    hop that has a next hop defined as a loose or abstract hop and a mid-point LSR
    to signal to the head-end LSR that a better path exists (compared to the current
    path) or that the TE LSP must be reoptimized (because of maintenance required
    on the TE LSP path).  The proposed mechanism applies to the cases of intra- and
    inter-domain (Interior Gateway Protocol area (IGP area) or Autonomous System)
    packet and non-packet TE LSPs following a loosely routed path.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

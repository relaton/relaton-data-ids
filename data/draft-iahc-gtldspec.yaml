    of the Internet Society, and at the request of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    (IANA).  IANA has responsibility for the maintenance of core administrative tables
    for Internet services, including 'top level' domain names (TLD) and the delegation
    of their maintenance to appropriate agencies.  The IAHC is tasked with developing
    administration and management enhancements for the general class of TLDs that
    have been called 'international'.\n\t "

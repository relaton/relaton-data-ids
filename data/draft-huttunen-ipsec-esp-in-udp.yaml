  content: "NAT is widely used for Internet 'connection sharing' and ships as a standard
    feature in every router and edge device.  Cable and DSL deployments have been
    \ known to install NAT in embedded devices resident inside the home.  Additionally
    most hotel Internet connections are using NAT.  Many airport & wireless services
    in public areas use NAT to connect to the Internet.  Some Internet Service Providers
    use a centralized NAT to connect their clients to the Internet.\n\t "

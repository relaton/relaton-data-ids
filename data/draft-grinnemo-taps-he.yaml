- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Ideally, network applications should be able to select an appropriate\n
    \  transport solution from among available transport solutions.\n   However, at
    present, there is no agreed-upon way to do this.  In\n   fact, there is not even
    an agreed-upon way for a source end host to\n   determine if there is support
    for a particular transport along a\n   network path.  This draft addresses these
    issues, by proposing a\n   Happy Eyeballs framework.  The proposed Happy Eyeballs
    framework\n   enables the selection of a transport solution that according to\n
    \  application requirements, pre-set policies, and estimated network\n   conditions
    is the most appropriate one.  Additionally, the proposed\n   framework makes it
    possible for an application to find out whether a\n   particular transport is
    supported along a network connection towards\n   a specific destination or not.\n\n\t "

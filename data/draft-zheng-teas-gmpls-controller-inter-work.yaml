  content: "   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows\n
    \  each network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery,\n   routing
    and signaling in a distributed manner.\n\n   On the other hand, with the development
    of software-defined\n   transport networking technology, a set of NEs can be controlled
    via\n   centralized controller hierarchies to address the issue from multi-\n
    \  domain, multi-vendor and multi-technology. An example of such\n   centralized
    architecture is ACTN controller hierarchy described in\n   RFC 8453.\n\n   Instead
    of competing with each other, both the distributed and the\n   centralized control
    plane have their own advantages, and should be\n   complementary in the system.
    This document describes how the GMPLS\n   distributed control plane can interwork
    with a centralized\n   controller system in a transport network.\n\n\t "

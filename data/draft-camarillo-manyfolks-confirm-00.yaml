  content: "This document describes certain functionality that is missing in the\ncurrent
    'Integration of Resource Management and SIP' [1] (a.k.a.\nmanyfolks draft). An
    extension to add this functionality is\noutlined.\nThis functionality is needed
    in general to provide richer signalling\ncapabilities and can be employed in several
    scenarios. This draft\ndescribes its use in third party call control applications.\n
    \  If this extension is accepted it is foreseen that this draft would\n   be merged
    with [1].\n\t "

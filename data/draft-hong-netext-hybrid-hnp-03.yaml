  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) supports multihoming where a mobile node\ncan
    connect to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces for\nsimultaneous access
    or inter-technology handoff.  However, for an\ninter-technology handoff, PMIPv6
    does not allow simultaneous access\nsince all the home network prefixes associated
    with one interface are\ndelivered to another interface of a mobile node.  In addition,
    if we\nassume that the flow is classified by home network prefix, then the\nPMIPv6
    cannot support flow mobility since it requires moving just\nsome home network
    prefixes between interfaces.  In this document, we\npropose a hybrid home network
    prefix assignment (HHNPA) scheme where\nboth the static prefix model and the dynamic
    prefix model are used.\nBy using these two different home network prefix models,
    it can\nsupport flow mobility that some home network prefixes are moved to\nanother
    interface and some home network prefixes are remained at\nexisting interface.\n\t "

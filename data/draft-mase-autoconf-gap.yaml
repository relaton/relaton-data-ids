  content: "\n   We consider Internet connectivity of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET),\n
    \  where two or more fixed or mobile nodes (MNs) may have a wired or\n   wireless
    interface to the fixed Internet in addition to the wireless\n   interface for
    the MANET.  The points of attachment of MNs to the\n   Internet are termed as
    \"Access Routers (ARs),\" A stationary MN, that\n   has wired connection with
    the Internet may become an AR itself.\n   Typically, only a single AR is used
    as the Internet Gateway (IGW) in\n   a MANET.  Two or more IGWs may be used, but
    the number of the IGWs\n   should be kept to a minimim.  This minimizing feature
    is named\n   \"Gateway Aggregation.\"  MANET routing protocol runs on the MBGs,
    and\n   both routing control messages and data packets of the MANET are\n   tunneled
    between an MN and its associated AR, between an AR and its\n   selected IGW, and
    also between an IGW and its peer IGW.  The IGW\n   advertises the network prefix
    for the MNs to configure their global\n   care-of-addresses.  An MN configures
    its care-of-address with the\n   prefix advertised by one of the IGWs.  Once it
    obtains its global\n   address, it does not have to change it during its stay
    in the MANET.\n\n\t "

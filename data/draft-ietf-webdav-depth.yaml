  content: "   The WebDAV protocol specification [Goland et al., 1997] defines the\n
    \  DELETE, COPY and MOVE methods. However these methods have a scope of\n   a
    single source resource. It is common for principals to wish to\n   perform a DELETE,
    COPY or MOVE on a collection and all its internal\n   members. This specification
    defines the DELETE-TREE, COPY-TREE and\n   MOVE-TREE methods that perform the
    equivalent of DELETE, COPY and\n   MOVE across a collection and all its progeny.\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   End-host mobility with the Host Identity Protocol uses IP-address\n
    \  tests to protect against malicious packet redirection and third-party\n   flooding.
    \ The tests cause handover signaling delays to increase by\n   one round-trip
    time.  This document proposes a credit-based strategy\n   that allows peers to
    securely resume active communications after\n   handover as soon as possible,
    and to pursue a concurrent IP-address\n   test subsequently.  The optimization
    thus eliminates the additional\n   handover delay that IP-address tests entail.\n\t "

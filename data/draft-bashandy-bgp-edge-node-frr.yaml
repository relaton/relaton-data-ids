  content: "Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1,\nPE2,...,
    PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1,\nCE2,..., CEm.  If the
    edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally\ndisconnected from the core, it is
    desirable for a core router \"P\"\ncarrying traffic to the failed edge router
    PEi to immediately restore\ntraffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled
    to PEi and\ndestined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers that\nadvertised
    P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it is\nhighly desirable to
    keep the core BGP-free while not imposing\nrestrictions on external connectivity.
    Thus (1) a core router should\nnot be required to learn any BGP prefix, (2) the
    size of the\nforwarding and routing tables in the core routers should be\nindependent
    of the number of BGP prefixes,(3) provisioning overhead\nshould be kept at minimum,
    (4) re-routing traffic without waiting for\nre-convergence must not cause loops,
    and (4) there should be no\nrestrictions on what edge routers advertise what prefixes.
    For\nlabeled prefixes, (6) the label stack on the packet must allow the\nrepair
    PEj to correctly forward the packet and (7) there must not be\nany need to perform
    more than one label lookup on any edge or core\nrouter during steady state\n\n\t "

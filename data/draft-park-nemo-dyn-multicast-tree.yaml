  content: "   Multicast Supporting is one of the most important issues in Network\n
    \  Mobility Environment, because some killer applications related to \n   multicast
    service need to be provided on Next Generation Network.\n   However, current NEMO
    technique based on basic support protocol have\n   got many problems to support
    the service such as route optimization,\n   pinball route, mass of multicast problem,
    etc. the most signficant \n   problem of the service in NEMO environment is that
    Mobile Network \n   cannot be sure that multicasting from parent mobile networks
    is \n   possible when the network is nested, Moreover, even though the best \n
    \  case that all mobile networks have its own multicast router is \n   supposed
    and multicasting is working well, the multicast route tree \n   can not be optimized
    due to different MNPs of the multicast routers\n   in each nested network.\n    This
    document defines additional functions of each component to \n   enable dynamic
    multicast tree construction for multicast service\n   in Mobile Network.\n\t "

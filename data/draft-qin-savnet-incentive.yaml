abstract:
- content: "<p>Source address spoofing remains a significant challenge in today's
    Internet. Although source address validation (SAV) mechanisms, such as ingress
    filtering [RFC2827], unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) [RFC3704], and the
    Enhanced Feasible-Path Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (EFP-uRPF) [RFC8704], have
    been proposed for a long time, none of them have been widely deployed due to their
    limitation in accuracy, lack of incentive, or other cost concerns. This document
    specifically explains the incentive problem of existing SAV mechanisms and clarifies
    the direct incentive that SAVNET hopes to achieve.</p>"

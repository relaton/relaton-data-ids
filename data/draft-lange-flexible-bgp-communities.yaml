  content: "This document defines a new attribute for BGP called the Flexible\nCommunity
    attribute.  Flexible Communities build on the experience\nand utility of the standard
    BGP community, and the extended BGP\ncommunity attributes.  This attribute allows
    operators to associate\nstructured information with a route or set of routes.
    \ This\ninformation can be then be used to execute routing policy.  An\nenhanced
    version of communities is necessary to accommodate IPv6,\n4-byte ASN's, and introduce
    a more extensible and flexible policy\nexpression.  This document also introduces
    the concept of Neighbor\nClasses.  A Neighbor Class is applied to a group of BGP
    neighbors who\nshare certain attributes.  For example, the PEER Neighbor Class
    could\nbe applied to BGP sessions between ASN X and other networks with\nwhich
    ASN X has a non-transit peering relationship.\n\t "

  content: "   Constrained IoT devices often operate more efficiently in a loosely\n
    \  coupled environment without maintaining end-to-end connectivity\n   between
    nodes.  Information Centric Networking naturally supports\n   this demand by replicated
    data distribution and hop wise forwarding.\n   This document outlines a deployment
    option for NDN in low-power and\n   lossy networks (LLNs) that follows a publish-subscribe
    pattern.  The\n   proposed protocol scheme simplifies name-based routing significantly\n
    \  and facilitates even large off-duty cycles for constrained nodes.\n\n\t "

  content: "   While the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides\n   confidentiality
    for the contents of a media packet, a significant\n   amount of metadata is left
    unprotected, including RTP header\n   extensions and contributing sources (CSRCs).
    \ However, this data can\n   be moderately sensitive in many applications.  While
    there have been\n   previous attempts to protect this data, they have had limited\n
    \  deployment, due to complexity as well as technical limitations.\n\n   This
    document proposes a new mechanism to completely encrypt header\n   extensions
    and CSRCs as well a simpler signaling mechanism intended\n   to facilitate deployment.\n\n\t "

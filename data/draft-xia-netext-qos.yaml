  content: "This document describes Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning in a\nProxy
    Mobile IPv6 domain through enabling differentiated services.\nWhen a packet is
    encapsulated in a mobile access gateway (or a local\nmobility anchor), the differentiated
    services codepoint (DSCP) field\nin the outer header is mapped to the priority
    of a mobile node, or\nthe precedence of an application of the mobile node.  Intermediary\nrouters
    between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility\nanchor, which forward
    the packet based on the outer header of the\npacket, prioritize the packet according
    to the DSCP value of the\nouter header.\n\t "

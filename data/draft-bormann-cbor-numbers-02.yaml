  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as defined in STD
    94\n   (RFC 8949), is a data representation format whose design goals\n   include
    the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small\n   message size, and
    extensibility without the need for version\n   negotiation.\n\n   Among the kinds
    of data that a data representation format needs to be\n   able to carry, numbers
    have a prominent role, but also have inherent\n   complexity that needs attention
    from protocol designers and\n   implementers of CBOR libraries and of the applications
    that use them.\n\n   This document gives an overview over number formats available
    in CBOR\n   and some notable CBOR tags registered, and it attempts to provide\n
    \  information about opportunities and potential pitfalls of these\n   number
    formats.\n\n\n   // This is a rather drafty initial revision, pieced together
    from\n   // various components, so it has a higher level of redundancy than\n
    \  // ultimately desired.\n\n\t "

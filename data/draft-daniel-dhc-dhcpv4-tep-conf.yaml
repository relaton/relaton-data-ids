  content: "The intent of this draft is to provide a solution to automate tunnel      \n
    \    end-point configuration for a configured IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel. This      \n
    \    uses a DHCPv4 option to percolate the tunnel end-point configuration      \n
    \    information. This is very useful to connect a newly deployed native      \n
    \    IPv6 cloud to other existing IPv6 networks using IPv4 backbone as \n     well
    as to connect isolated dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 nodes to IPv6 \n     networks through
    IPv4.\n\t "

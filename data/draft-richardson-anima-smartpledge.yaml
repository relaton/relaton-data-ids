  content: "   This document details the mechanism used for initial enrollment by
    a\n   smartphone into a BRSKI based enrollment system.\n\n   There are two key
    differences in assumption from\n   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]: that
    the intended registrar\n   has Internet, and that the Pledge has no user-interface.\n\n
    \  This variation on BRSKI is intended to be used in the situation where\n   the
    registrar device is new out of the box and is the intended\n   gateway to the
    Internet (such as a home gateway), but has not yet\n   been configured.  This
    work is also intended as a transition to the\n   Wi-Fi Alliance work on the Device
    Provisioning Protocol (DPP).\n\n\t "

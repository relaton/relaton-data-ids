  content: "It is common for Internet hosts to associate a relatively long-lived identifier,
    often called a username or owner name, to each TCP connection. The Identity Server
    announces the identifier associated with a particular TCP connection to the host
    on the other end of the connection. The Identity Server may be used on any host
    which associates a relatively long-lived identifier to each connection.\n\t "

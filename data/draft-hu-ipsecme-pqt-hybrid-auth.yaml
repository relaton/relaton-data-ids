  content: "   One IPsec area that would be impacted by Cryptographically Relevant\n
    \  Quantum Computer (CRQC) is IKEv2 authentication based on traditional\n   asymmetric
    cryptographic algorithms: e.g RSA, ECDSA; which are widely\n   deployed authentication
    options of IKEv2.  There are new Post-Quantum\n   Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms
    for digital signature like NIST\n   [ML-DSA], however it takes time for new cryptographic
    algorithms to\n   mature, so there is security risk to use only the new algorithm\n
    \  before it is field proven.  This document describes a IKEv2 hybrid\n   authentication
    scheme that could contain both traditional and PQC\n   algorithms, so that authentication
    is secure as long as one algorithm\n   in the hybrid scheme is secure.\n\n\t "

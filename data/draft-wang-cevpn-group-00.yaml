  content: "IPsec tunneling provides a site-to-site connection when building a \nCE-based
    IPsec VPN. In a large scale VPN deployment, especially when \na service provider
    manages a large number VPNs, there is a need to \nmanage IPsec tunnels on a group
    basis, instead of on a tunnel basis.  \nThis document describes the definition
    of a VPN group, its \nattributes, and usage of VPN group when managing IPsec tunnels.
    By \ngrouping IPsec tunnels and sites into an IPsec VPN group, service \nproviders
    can design, provision, and manage the IPsec-based CE VPN \nat both group level
    and tunnel/site level. This gives service \nproviders more flexibility and provides
    more aggregation capability \nto reduce operation complexity.\n\t "

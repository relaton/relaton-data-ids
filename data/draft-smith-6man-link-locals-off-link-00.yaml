  content: "   Certain link-layers limit reachability for one set of nodes, while\n
    \  permitting full reachability for a different set of nodes, for\n   unicast,
    multicast and broadcast traffic.  If IPv6 hosts are members\n   of the first set
    of nodes, and IPv6 routers are members of the\n   second, Link-Local traffic between
    IPv6 hosts will fail, due to the\n   default on-link assumption for Link-Local
    destinations.  This memo\n   describes the use of a Link-Local Prefix Information
    Option to\n   indicate to these hosts that Link-Local destinations are \"off-link\",\n
    \  and are reachable via their default router(s).\n\n\t "

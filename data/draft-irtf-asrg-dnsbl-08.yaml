  content: "The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has led
    to the creation of shared blacklists and whitelists of IP addresses or domains.
    \ The DNS has become the de-facto standard method of distributing these blacklists
    and whitelists.  This memo documents the structure and usage of DNS-based blacklists
    and whitelists, and the protocol used to query them.  This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has
    led to the creation of shared blacklists and whitelists of IP addresses or domains.
    The DNS has become the de-facto standard method of distributing these blacklists
    and whitelists. This memo documents the structure and usage of DNS-based blacklists
    and whitelists, and the protocol used to query them. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"

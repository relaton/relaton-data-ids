  content: "   This document specifies the Lightweight authentication extension for\n
    \  the Host Identifier Protocol (LHIP).  The goal of LHIP is to reduce\n   the
    computational requirements of the Host Identifier Protocol (HIP),\n   thus, making
    its benefits, such as end-host mobility and multihoming,\n   accessible to CPU-restricted
    devices.  LHIP reduces the computational   cost of establishing, updating, and
    closing a HIP association by\n   providing an alternative way of signing and verifying
    HIP control\n   packets which is based on computationally inexpensive hash function\n
    \  computations and hash chains.  However, LHIP does not provide nor\n   does
    it aim at providing the same level of security as HIP does.\n   Especially, host
    authentication and payload encryption are not\n   possible.  The LHIP extensions
    in this draft specify also mechanisms\n   for dynamic transitioning between lightweight
    and full HIP\n   associations on the fly.\n\n\n\t "

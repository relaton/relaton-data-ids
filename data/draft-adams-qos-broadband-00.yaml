- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This document describes a proposal which deals with congestion conditions
    that may arise when a home or SME customer requests too many simultaneous flows
    to be forwarded down a DSL link or other access technology.  It provides a solution
    to guaranteeing certain flows while making others (typically the latest or another
    flow selected for policy reasons) the subject of focused packet discards.  It
    has a number of significant benefits over other possible solutions, such as classical
    RSVP, and these are also listed in the document.\n\t "

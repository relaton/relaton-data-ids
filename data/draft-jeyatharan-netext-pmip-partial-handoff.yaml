  content: "Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) only supports session continuity for one\nbasic
    scenario of vertical handoff -- the transfer of all prefixes\nassigned from one
    interface to another.  However, there are some\nother advanced scenarios associated
    with vertical handoff that\ninvolves only transferring one (or some, but not all)
    of the prefixes\nthat are allocated to an existing interface to a newly powered
    on\ninterface.  This draft outlines extensions to PMIPv6 protocol in\norder for
    a multiple interfaced mobile node to achieve such partial\nvertical handoff of
    selected prefix(es).\n\t "

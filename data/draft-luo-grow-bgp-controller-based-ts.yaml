  content: "   Due to the dramatically increased network traffic and the desire of\n
    \  differentiated services, it is essential for operators to provide the\n   traffic
    steering service under limited network resources and maximize\n   their benefits
    at the same time.  The traditional method for traffic\n   steering depends on
    static configuration which is time consuming and\n   error-prone.  As development
    of SDN, the controller is introduced for\n   traffic steering with the global
    view of network topology and route\n   information.  This document describes typical
    use cases for traffic\n   steering services and proposes the traffic steering
    solution based on\n   BGP controller.\n\n\n\t "

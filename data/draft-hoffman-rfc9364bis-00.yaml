  content: "   This document describes the DNS Security Extensions (commonly called\n
    \  \"DNSSEC\") that are specified in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035, as well as\n   a
    handful of others.  One purpose is to introduce all of the RFCs in\n   one place
    so that the reader can understand the many aspects of\n   DNSSEC.  This document
    does not update any of those RFCs.  A second\n   purpose is to state that using
    DNSSEC for origin authentication of\n   DNS data is the best current practice.
    \ A third purpose is to provide\n   a single reference for other documents that
    want to refer to DNSSEC.\n\n   This document obsoletes RFC 9364.\n\n   This document
    is being tracked at (https://github.com/paulehoffman/\n   rfc9364bis).\n\n\t "

  content: "RBridges provide the ability to have an entire campus, with multiple \nphysical
    links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows \nfor zero configuration
    of switches within a campus, optimal pair-wise \nrouting, safe forwarding even
    during periods of temporary loops, and \nthe ability to cut down on ARP/ND traffic.
    The design also supports \nVLANs, and allows forwarding tables to be based on
    RBridge \ndestinations (rather than endnode destinations), which allows \ninternal
    routing tables to be substantially smaller than in \nconventional bridge systems.\n\t "

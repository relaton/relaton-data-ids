  content: "The continuous growth of routing tables in the core of Internet is a\nchallenge.
    \ It would become overwhelming if each multihomed customer\nsite would need a
    provider independent prefix to take full advantage\nof its multihoming.  IPv6
    has the potential to solve this problem,\nbut a complete specification is still
    missing.  This draft proposes\nan approach for a solution.\n\nThe Stateless Address
    Mapping (SAM) model, introduced for this, is\napplicable to a hierarchy of routing
    zones with multihoming permitted\nat each level, and with each zone using local
    addresses for its\ninternal routing plan.  End-to-end transparency of the Internet
    is\nmaintains across these local-address zones, thanks to a systematic\nencapsulation
    of global-address packets into local-address packets.\nLocal addresses are statelessly
    derived from prefixes found in global\naddresses, and from static parameters of
    traversed zones.  Global\nprefixes delegated by a zone to its child interfaces
    can be obtained\nby autoconfiguration, thanks to to a bidirectional correspondence\nbetween
    SAM local addresses and SAM global prefixes.\n\nDeployment can be incremental.\n\t "

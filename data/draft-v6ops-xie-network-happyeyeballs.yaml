abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   During the period of IPv6 transition, both ISP and ICP (Internet\n
    \  Content Provider) care about user's experience in dual-stack network.\n   They
    hesitate to provide IPv6 to their users due to the fear of poor\n   IPv6 performance.
    \ Network-based Happy Eyeballs (NHE) is proposed in\n   this memo as a approach
    to provide better connectivity to end users\n   by doing accurate measurement
    and comparison on IPv6/IPv4 performance\n   on the network side other than client-side
    Happy Eyeballs (HE)\n   ([RFC8305]).  It works independently with client's adoption
    of HE.\n\n   REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source of the document with test\n
    \  script is currently placed at GitHub [NHE-GitHub].  Comments and pull\n   request
    are welcome.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a methodology for testing the\noperation, administration
    and maintenance (OA&M) of a general\nVPN service, that is applied here to Hierarchical
    Virtual\nPrivate LAN Services (HVPLS) as described in [VPLS].  As part\nof this
    methodology, the MPLS ping concepts described in [LSP-\nPING] are extended to
    enable HVPLS spoke-to-spoke connectivity\ntesting.  A method to provide the information
    necessary for\nthis spoke-to-spoke OA&M is also proposed.\nThese are the goals
    of this draft:\n-   checking connectivity between 'service-aware'\nnodes of a
    network,\n-   verifying data plane and control plane integrity,\n-   verifying
    service membership\nThere are two specific requirements to which we call attention\nbecause
    of their seemingly contradictory nature:\n-   the checking of connectivity MUST
    involve the\nability to use packets that look like customer\npackets\n-   the
    OAM packets MUST not propagate beyond the\nboundary of the provider network\n\t "

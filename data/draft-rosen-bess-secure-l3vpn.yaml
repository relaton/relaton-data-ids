  content: "   The Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology described in RFC\n
    \  4364 is focused on the scenario in which a network Service Provider\n   (SP)
    maintains a secure backbone network and offers VPN service over\n   that network
    to its customers.  Customers access the SP's network by\n   attaching \"Customer
    Edge\" (CE) routers to \"Provider Edge\" (PE)\n   routers, which exchange cleartext
    IP packets.  PE routers generally\n   serve multiple customers, and prevent unauthorized
    communication\n   among customers.  Customer data sent across the backbone (from
    one PE\n   to another) is encapsulated in MPLS, using an MPLS label to associate\n
    \  a given packet with a given customer.  The labeled packets are then\n   sent
    across the backbone network in the clear, using MPLS transport.\n   However, many
    customers want a VPN service that is secure enough to\n   run over the public
    Internet, and which does not require them to send\n   cleartext IP packets to
    a service provider.  Often they want to\n   connect directly to edge nodes of
    the public Internet, which does not\n   provide MPLS support.  Each customer may
    itself have multiple tenants\n   who are not allowed to intercommunicate with
    each other freely.  In\n   this case, the customer many need to provide a VPN
    service for the\n   tenants.  This document describes a way in which this can
    be achieved\n   using the technology of RFC 4364.  The functionality assigned
    therein\n   to a PE router can be placed instead in Customer Premises Equipment.\n
    \  This functionality can be augmented by transmitting MPLS packets\n   through
    IPsec Security Associations.  The BGP control plane sessions\n   can also be protected
    by IPsec.  This allows a customer to use RFC\n   4364 technology to provide VPN
    service to its internal departments,\n   while sending only IPsec-protected packets
    to the Internet or other\n   backbone network, and eliminating the need for MPLS
    transport in the\n   backbone.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document introduces a new multicast routing protocol for use\n
    \  over ad hoc networks. The protocol is called AMRIS, short for Ad hoc\n   Multicast
    Routing protocol utilizing Increasing id-numberS. The\n   conceptual idea behind
    AMRIS is to assign every node in a multicast\n   session with an id-number. A
    delivery tree rooted at a particular\n   node called Sid joins up the nodes participating
    in the multicast\n   session. The relationship between the id-numbers(and the
    node that\n   owns it) and Sid is that the id-numbers increase in numerical value\n
    \  as they radiate from the root of the delivery tree. The significance\n   of
    the Sid is that it has the smallest id-number within that\n   multicast session.
    Utilizing the id-numbers, nodes are able to adapt\n   rapidly to changes in link
    connectivity. Recovery messages due to\n   link breakages are confined to the
    region where it occurred.\n\n\t "

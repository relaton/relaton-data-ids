  content: "The Media Sessions Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and\n   invoke
    many different types of services on IP media servers.  Clients\n   can use it
    define how multimedia sessions interact on a media server\n   and to apply services
    to individual or groups of users.  MSML can be\n   used, for example, to control
    media server conferencing features such\n   as video layout and audio mixing,
    create sidebar conferences or\n   personal mixes, and set the properties of media
    streams.  As well,\n   clients can use MSML with other languages such as the Media
    Objects\n   Markup Language (MOML) or VoiceXML to interact with individual users\n
    \  or with groups of conference participants.\n\t "

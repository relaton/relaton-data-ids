  content: "This memo defines a 'Green Model' for information commerce using the Internet.
    \ In this model, the information merchant carries all risk of non-payment.  By
    shifting the risk of non-payment, we do not require guarantees of credit worthiness
    for a merchant.  This allows every participant to be both a buyer and a merchant
    of information on the Internet.  Transactions relating to accounting and settlement
    are performed through either the exchange of store-and-forward messages (using
    the 'application/green-commerce' format defined in [1]), or interactive protocol
    exchanges (using the 'Simple Green Commerce Protocol' defined in [2]).\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   Transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 is a common solution\n
    \  to the problem of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider\n   networks.
    \ A number of differing functional approaches have been\n   developed for this,
    each having their own specific characteristics.\n   As these approaches share
    a similar functional architecture and use\n   the same data plane mechanisms,
    this memo describes a specification\n   whereby a single CPE can interwork with
    all of the standardized and\n   proposed approaches to providing encapsulated
    IPv4 in IPv6 services.\n\n\n\t "

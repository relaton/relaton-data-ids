  content: "   This document proposes a stateful model for automating Multi-Link DNS\n
    \  Service Discovery, as an extension to the existing solution, which\n   relies
    entirely on multicast DNS for discovering services, and does\n   not formally
    maintain DNS zone state.  When fully deployed this will\n   confer several advantages:
    the ability to do DNS zone transfers,\n   integrating with existing DNS infrastructure;
    the elimination of the\n   need for regular multicast queries; and the ability
    for services to\n   securely register and defend their names, preventing malicious\n
    \  spoofing of services on the network.\n\n\t "

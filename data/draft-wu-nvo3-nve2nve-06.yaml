abstract:
- content: "<p>This document looks at control plane aspect related to both tenant
    system to NVE control interface and NVE to Network Virtualization Authority (NVA)
    control interface NVE use to enable communication between tenant systems and focuses
    on NVE to NVA control interface, which is complementary to [draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp]
    that describes the high level control plane requirements related to the interaction
    between tenant system and NVE when the two entities are not co-located on the
    same physical device.</p>"

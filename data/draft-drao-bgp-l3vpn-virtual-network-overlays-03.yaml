  content: "   Virtual network overlays are being designed and deployed in various\n
    \  types of networks, including data centers.  These network overlays\n   address
    several requirements including flexible network\n   virtualization and multi-tenancy,
    increased scale, and support for\n   mobility of virtual machines.  Such overlay
    networks can be used to\n   provide both Layer-2 and Layer-3 network services
    to hosts at the\n   network edge.  New packet encapsulations are being defined
    and\n   standardized to support these virtual networks.  These\n   encapsulations,
    such as VXLAN and NVGRE, are primarily based on IP\n   and are currently defined
    to support a Layer-2 forwarding service.\n\n   BGP based Layer-3 VPNs, as specified
    in RFC 4364, provide an industry\n   proven and well-defined solution for supporting
    Layer-3 virtual\n   network services.  However, RFC 4364 procedures use MPLS labels
    to\n   provide the network virtualization capability in the data plane. With\n
    \  the increasing support for IP overlay encapsulations in data center\n   devices,
    there is a strong preference to utilize this support to\n   deploy Layer-3 virtual
    networks using the familiarpolicy and\n   operational primitives of Layer-3 VPNs.\n\n
    \  This document describes the use of BGP Layer-3 VPNs alongwith various\n   IP-based
    virtual network overlay encapsulations to provide a Layer-3\n   virtualization
    solution for all IP traffic, and specifies mechanisms\n   to use the new encapsulations
    while continuing to leverage existing\n   BGP Layer-3 VPN control plane techniques,
    extensions and\n   implementations.  This mechanism provides an efficient incremental\n
    \  solution to support forwarding for IP traffic, irrespective of\n   whether
    it is destined within or across an IP subnet boundary.\n\n\t "

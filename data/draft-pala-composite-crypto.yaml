  content: "   PKIs are used to provide scalability and ease key management.  One\n
    \  type of PKIs that is predominant for securing communications and data\n   is
    based on the X.509 standard.  Since the security of PKIs,\n   ultimately, depends
    on the security of the cryptographic building\n   blocks that are used for authentication
    and encryption, the standards\n   community made algorithm agility a priority.
    \ Algorithm agility, in\n   particular, enables upgrading to newly available algorithms
    when\n   needed.\n\n   The CompositeCrypto (i.e., CompositeKey and CompositeSignature\n
    \  structures) described in this document provides an additional tool\n   that
    enables the use of multiple algorithms to authenticate data\n   without the need
    to use multiple certificates and more complex data\n   structures.\n\n   This
    document provide the description of the definition and encoding\n   rules for
    CompositeKey and CompositeSignature.  A description of how\n   to use these structures
    in main PKIX objects (e.g., X.509\n   certificates, CRLs, OCSP responses, etc.)
    is also provided.\n\n\t "

  content: "IPSec [RFC2401]is pervasive in many scenarios to build the channel of\nsecurity
    mechanism to protect the communication between the host and\nthe local servers,
    such as DNS recursive name server [RFC1304].  In\nthe public wireless access environment,
    an extra trust relationship\nconfiguration between the roaming host and the local
    server, manually\nor by IKE [RFC2409], is indispensible.\n\nDHCP is typically
    the first protocol executed by a mobile host when\nit enters a new network, so
    this document present an extension to\nDHCPv6 to piggyback the parameters needed
    for IPSec, avoiding the\ndelay invited by manual configuration of security association
    or IKE\ninteraction for IPSec.\n\t "

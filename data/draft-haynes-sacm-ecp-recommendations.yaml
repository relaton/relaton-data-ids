  content: "   This document builds off of\n   [I-D.fitzgeraldmckay-sacm-endpointcompliance]
    and\n   [I-D.haynes-sacm-ecp-mapping] to provide high-level recommendations\n
    \  for which Trusted Computing Group [TCG] Endpoint Compliance Profile\n   [Endpoint-Compliance-Profile]
    specifications might be most\n   productively brought into the IETF SACM Working
    Group (WG).  Each\n   section considers the alignment of an ECP specification
    with SACM,\n   how the specification could be leveraged by SACM as well as potential\n
    \  modifications, and suggests a prioritization of specifications for\n   submission
    to the SACM WG.\n\n\t "

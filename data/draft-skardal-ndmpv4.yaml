  content: "The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) defines a mechanism and \nprotocol
    for controlling backup, recovery, and other transfers of \ndata between primary
    and secondary storage.  \nThe NDMP architecture separates the network attached
    Data Management \nApplication (DMA), Data Servers and Tape Servers participating
    in \narchival or recovery operations. NDMP also provides low-level control \nof
    tape devices and SCSI media changers.  \nThe XDR and TCP/IP protocols are foundations
    for NDMP.  \nThe key goals of NDMP include interoperability, contemporary \nfunctionality,
    and extensibility. \nThe XDR and TCP/IP protocols are foundations for NDMP.  \nThe

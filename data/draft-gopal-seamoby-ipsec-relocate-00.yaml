  content: "Seamless offering of security to a Mobile Node (MN) during handovers is\ncrucial
    for enabling a variety of application services in the Mobile\nInternet.  Handovers
    also imply that a terminal such as a MN may perform\nnetwork access authentication
    in order to obtain connectivity and access\nto network features such as QoS, header
    compression etc.  Security\ncontext associated with several Security Associations
    (SA) may need to\nbe transferred in order to achieve this.  This enables the MN
    to regain\nauthenticated connectivity and establish new SAs without having to\nreinitiate
    time-consuming operations.\n\t "

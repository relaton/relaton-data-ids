  content: "   This documents defines the Lightweight Authenticated Time (LATe)\n
    \  Synchronization Protocol, a secure time synchronization protocol for\n   constrained
    environments.  The messages are encoded using Concise\n   Binary Object Representation
    (CBOR) and basic security services are\n   provided by CBOR Object Signing and
    Encryption (COSE).  A secure\n   source of time is a base assumption for many
    other services,\n   including security services.  LATe Synchronization protocol
    enables\n   these time-dependent services to run in the context of a constrained\n
    \  environment.\n\n\t "

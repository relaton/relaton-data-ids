  script: Latn
  content: "This document considers the requirements for implementing PIM Source-\nOnly
    (PIM-SO) which will allow the creation of source-based multicast\ntrees across
    multiple domains in the Internet.  PIM-SO realizes the\nEXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast
    service model in which there is a single\nsource for every multicast group, and
    group membership and addressing\nis based on a multicast group address (G) as
    well as the source's\nunicast address (S). Our short-term goal is to implement
    PIM-SO with\nminimal changes to the current multicast routing infrastructure by\nAugust
    2000, and to provide proof of concept by deploying it on\nSprintlab's experimental
    network. By the end of the year, we envisage\nthat PIM-SO will be ready to be
    incorporated in Sprint's multicast\nbackbone as a commercial point-to-multipoint
    service.\n\n\t "

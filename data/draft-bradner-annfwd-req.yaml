  content: "There are a number of situations in the Internet where it would be\nuseful
    to be able to have an application be able to send traffic to a\ndestination without
    revealing the IP address of the destination to\nthe source, or the IP address
    of the source to the destination, or\nboth.  One way to do this is to have a network
    resident set of\nservers which can forward packets, with encryption and decryption\napplied
    to their source and destination addresses when appropriate.\nWe will call this
    server an anonymizing forwarder.\n\t "

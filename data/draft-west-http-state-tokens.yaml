  content: "   This document describes a mechanism which allows HTTP servers to\n
    \  maintain stateful sessions with HTTP user agents.  It aims to address\n   some
    of the security and privacy considerations which have been\n   identified in existing
    state management mechanisms, providing\n   developers with a well-lit path towards
    our current understanding of\n   best practice.\n\n\t "

  content: "   The DMZ Link Bandwidth draft provides a way to load-balance traffic\n
    \  to a destination (which is in a different AS than the source) which\n   is
    reachable via more than one path.  Typically, the link bandwidth\n   (either configured
    on the link of the EBGP egress interface or set\n   via a policy) is encoded in
    an extended community and then sent to\n   the IBGP peer which employs multi-path.
    \ The link-bandwidth value is\n   then extracted from the path extended community
    and is used as a\n   weight in the FIB, which does the load-balancing.  This draft
    extends\n   the usage of the DMZ link bandwidth to another setting where the\n
    \  ingress BGP speaker requires knowledge of the cumulative bandwidth\n   while
    doing the load-balancing.  The draft also proposes neighbor-\n   level knobs to
    enable the link bandwidth extended community to be\n   regenerated and then advertised
    to EBGP peers to override the default\n   behavior of not advertising optional
    non-transitive attributes to\n   EBGP peers.\n\n\t "

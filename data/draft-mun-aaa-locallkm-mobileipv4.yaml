  content: "   Isolating the access to mobility agents by the VPN gateway which\n
    \  guards the home agent, home resources is disturbing the operations\n   of mobile
    node away from its home that needed to perform the\n   registration of the current
    location according to the specification\n   because the access from the outside
    is restricted by the VPN policy.\n   This paper presents the authentication and
    key exchange scheme using\n   the AAA infrastructure for a user in Internet to
    access the Intranet\n   behind the VPN gateway. By defining the role of authentication
    and \n   tunnel processing for each agent or relaying entity, we are able to \n
    \  obtain our goal to the security-aware environment. Also, the \n   performance
    result of the proposed scheme is discussed in depth.\n\n\t "

  content: "   OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates, made up\n
    \  of primary keys, direct key signatures, user IDs, identity\n   certifications
    (\"signature packets\"), subkeys, and so on.  They are\n   often assembled by
    merging multiple certificates that all share the\n   same primary key, and are
    distributed in public keystores.\n\n   Unfortunately, since many keystores permit
    any third-party to add a\n   certification with any content to any OpenPGP certificate,
    the\n   assembled/merged form of a certificate can become unwieldy or\n   undistributable.
    \ Furthermore, keystores that are searched by user ID\n   can be made unusable
    for specific names or addresses by public\n   submission of bogus data.  And finally,
    keystores open to public\n   submission can also face simple resource exhaustion
    from flooding\n   with bogus submissions, or legal or other risks from uploads
    of toxic\n   data.\n\n   This draft documents techniques that an archive of OpenPGP\n
    \  certificates can use to mitigate the impact of these various attacks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a mechanism for creating shared,\n
    \  secret, random bits.  This document describes extensions to the IKEv2\n   protocol
    to use random bits created via QKD as keys for IPsec.  The\n   Diffie-Hellman
    key agreement mechanism is replaced with QKD.  The use\n   of QKD-generated keys
    with standard IPsec will extend the lifetime of\n   privacy guarantees for IPsec-protected
    data: future technological\n   advances that break Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    will not disclose\n   data until such time as the encryption algorithm used for
    the IPsec\n   tunnel is broken.\n\n\t "

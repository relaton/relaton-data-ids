  content: "This document provides a survey of transport protocols which are\ndesigned
    to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard\nTCP than standard
    TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it.\nSuch protocols could be used
    for low-priority \"background\" traffic,\nas they provide what is sometimes called
    a \"less than\" (or \"lower\nthan\") best effort service.\n\t "

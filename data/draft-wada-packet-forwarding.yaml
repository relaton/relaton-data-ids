  content: "This memo describes a new protocol for mobile internetworking:  the Internet
    Packet Transmission Protocol (IPTP). IPTP provides packet forwarding and host
    location functions that make mobility transparent to all protocols above IP. IPTP
    specifies control messages between the networking software on mobile hosts and
    a special Packet Forwarding Service. Backward compatibility is provided by requiring
    no modifications to stationary hosts or internetwork routers. To reduce overhead,
    IPTP provides for lazy propagation of location updates. To enhance performance,
    routes adapt as mobile hosts move.\n\t "

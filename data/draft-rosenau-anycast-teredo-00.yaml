  script: Latn
  content: "   Because of the shortage of remaining IPv4 addresses you have to\n   expect
    that in a near time there will be IPv6-only services in the\n   internet (such
    as web servers).\n\n   Because many internet service providers do not support
    IPv6, yet,\n   there is the need of a reliable translation mechanism so customers\n
    \  only having access to IPv4 only can access IPv6 services.\n\n   This document
    describes a translation mechanism which is similar to\n   the Teredo protocol
    [RFC4380].  However this protocol is based on\n   anycast addressing and should
    also work with symmetric NATs.\n\n\t "

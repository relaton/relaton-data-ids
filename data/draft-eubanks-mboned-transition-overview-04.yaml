  content: "   IPTV providers must serve content to their customers during the\n   period
    of transition from IPv4 to IPv6.  During this period, the\n   content provider
    may support only one version of IP while the\n   customer's receiver device supports
    only the other.  Likewise, the\n   network between the provider and its customer
    may include segments\n   supporting only one version of IP or another.\n\n   This
    document provides an overview of the multicast transition\n   problem.  It also
    provides an overview of the solution space.  The\n   solution space is characterized
    by an adaptation function (AF) that\n   provides an interface between IPv4 and
    IPv6 multicast domains.  This\n   document also discusses various multicast use
    cases which may occur\n   during IPv6 transitioning.  These use cases motivate
    the solution\n   space discussion and the requirements that appear at the end.\n\n\t "

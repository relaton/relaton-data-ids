  content: "Many solutions have been proposed to enable automatically switched \ntransport
    networks (ASTN). This document describes a control plane \narchitecture that can
    be applied to different packet and circuit \nswitching technologies (including
    fiber, waveband, wavelength, PDH, and \nSONET/SDH). The control plane technology
    is based on IP/MPLS control \nplane protocols. As such, this document is based
    on the concepts \nintroduced in [MPLambdas] and [GMPLS-SIG] from an architectural
    \nperspective. It also describes how this control plane architecture \ncould facilitate
    control plane integration of networks across technical, \nadministrative, and
    business domains. This memo includes generic \nprocedures, key concepts, and technical
    considerations for the \ngeneralized MPLS control plane architecture.  It is intended
    to \naccentuate understanding of the application domains, create \narchitectural
    alignment, and serve as guide for protocol engineering.\n\n\t "

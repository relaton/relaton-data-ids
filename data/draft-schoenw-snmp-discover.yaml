- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The third version of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\n
    \  assumes that a manager knows the identifier of a remote SNMP protocol\n   engine
    (the so called snmpEngineID) in order to retrieve or\n   manipulate objects maintained
    locally on the remote engine.  This\n   document introduces a well-known localEngineID
    and a discovery\n   mechanism which can be used to learn the engine identifier
    of a\n   remote SNMP protocol engine.  The proposed mechanism is independent\n
    \  of the features provided by SNMP security models and may also be used\n   by
    other protocol interfaces providing access to managed objects.\n\n\t "

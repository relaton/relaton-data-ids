- language: en

  content: "There are several mechanisms for distributing public keys and\ncertificates
    today. These distribution services publish certificates\nwhich contain cryptographic
    public keys. Clients that use any of \nthese distribution services to retrieve
    certificates, require\nadditional software for the retrieval, parsing and verification\nof
    these certificates. In this draft, we propose an alternate\nscheme that takes
    advantage of the Secure DNS infrastructure to \ndistribute verified public keys
    obtained from other distribution\nservices.\n\t "

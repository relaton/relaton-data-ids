  content: "   This memo defines an API for Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration\n
    \  (MPIC) services to facilitate domain control validation (DCV) from\n   multiple
    network perspectives.  MPIC enhances the security of\n   publicly-trusted certificate
    issuance by mitigating the risk of\n   localized, equally-specific BGP hijacking
    attacks that can undermine\n   traditional DCV methods permitted by the CA/Browser
    Forum Baseline\n   Requirements for TLS Server Certificates.  This API enables\n
    \  Certification Authorities (CAs) to more reliably integrate with\n   external
    MPIC providers, promoting a more robust and resilient Web\n   PKI ecosystem.  The
    API design prioritizes flexibility, scalability,\n   and interoperability, allowing
    for diverse implementations and\n   deployment models.  This standardization effort
    is driven by the need\n   to consistently address vulnerabilities in the domain
    validation\n   process highlighted by recent research and real-world attacks,
    as\n   reflected in Ballot SC-067 V3 of the CA/Browser Forum's Server\n   Certificate
    Working Group.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document standardizes the means of requesting a sampled capture\n
    \  stream from a router, receiving details about the resulting data\n   flow,
    and the structure of the data flow itself.  This is\n   specifically tailored
    to having various hardware ASICs be able to\n   perform this operation as quickly
    as possible, by allowing\n   communication of the specific bit formats of headers
    applied to the\n   packet flow, in a way that enhances interoperability between
    sources\n   and sinks.  Historically, NetFlow and its ilk have been used for\n
    \  these use cases, however the growth in hardware forward speeds is far\n   outpacing
    the growth in CPU speeds, and the CPU-heavy parts of\n   NetFlow is resulting
    in a reduction of sampling rates that include\n   all of the fields provided by
    NetFlow that require CPU lookups.\n\n\t "

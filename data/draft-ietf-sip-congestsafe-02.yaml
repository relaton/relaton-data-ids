abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol allows the use of UDP for transport\nof
    SIP messages. The use of UDP inherently risks network congestion\nproblems, as
    UDP itself does not define congestion prevention,\navoidance, detection, or correction
    mechanisms. This problem is\naggravated by large SIP messages which fragment at
    the UDP level.\nTransport protocols in SIP are also negotiated on a per-hop basis,
    at\nthe SIP level, so SIP proxies may convert from TCP to UDP and so\nforth. This
    document defines by which a SIP User Agent may require\nthat its requests are
    not sent over UDP or other transports having\ncongestion-related characteristics
    similar to those of UDP.\n\t "

  content: "   SenML [I-D.ietf-core-senml] defines a base time attribute and time\n
    \  value which is used to determine the time when a value is recorded.\n   In
    some applications a SenML pack will contain a series of records\n   related to
    a constant sample time interval, e.g. once every 60\n   seconds.  This means that
    the time attribute will be required for\n   each record.  This document defines
    a new \"time offset\" base\n   attribute that allows a sender to include the time
    for the sample\n   interval between records.  If the \"time offset\" base attribute
    is\n   used the sender will not send the time attribute for each record,\n   minimising
    message and storage size.\n\n\t "

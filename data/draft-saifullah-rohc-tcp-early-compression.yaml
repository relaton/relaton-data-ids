  content: "This document specifies Early Compression Enabler for ROHC-TCP to\nincrease
    compression gain. The enabler provides a generic platform to\nimplement an early
    compression mechanism. An early compression\nmechanism is an out-of-band mechanism
    that populates the ROHC-TCP\ndecompression context with some of the header fields
    before the ROHC-\nTCP initialization step. ROHC-TCP does not need to carry those\nfields,
    thus early compression provides compression from the very\nfirst TCP packet and
    increases the compression gain. It is especially\nuseful for short-lived TCP connections.
    The document describes the\nworking of Early Compression Enabler as part of ROHC-TCP.
    It also\nspecifies protocol changes for the ROHC-TCP protocol. It does not\nspecify
    any particular early compression mechanism.\n\t "

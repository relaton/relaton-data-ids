  content: "6to4 [1] defines a mechanism for allowing sites to communicate\nusing
    IPv6 over the public IPv4 Internet.  It does so by assigning a\nblock of IPv6
    addresses corresponding to any 'public' (globally-scoped)\nIPv4 address, and a
    means of tunneling IPv6 traffic destined for such\naddresses over the IPv4 Internet.
    \ In this way, any site which is\nconnected to the IPv4 Internet and which has
    at least one global IPv4\naddress assigned to it, can communicate with IPv6.\n\t "

  content: "   SPKI structures are defined for public keys, hash values, access\n
    \  control list (ACL) entries and certificates.  This document gives\n   examples
    of such structures for real world applications.  The\n   examples here are not
    tied to any specific application and should be\n   taken as informative examples
    rather than standard formats.  However,\n   once applications are fielded using
    such structures and we have\n   experience with them, we can consider publishing
    those formats as\n   proposed standards.  That effort is considered out of scope
    for this\n   document.\n\n\t "

  content: "GEOPRIV defines the concept of a 'using protocol' -- a protocol that carries
    GEOPRIV location objects.  GEOPRIV also defines various scenarios for the distribution
    of location objects that require the concepts of subscriptions and asynchronous
    notifications.  This document examines some existing IETF work on the concept
    of presence, shows how presence architectures map onto GEOPRIV architectures,
    and moreover demonstrates that tools already developed for presence could be reused
    to simplify the standardization and implementation of GEOPRIV.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t "

  content: "  This document is a non-exhaustive set of considerations for protocol\n
    \ designers and implementers with regards to attack defence. These\n  considerations
    can be used as an aid to analyse protocol design\n  choice and in turn to help
    combat threats and defend users of these\n  protocols and systems against malicious
    attacks.\n\n  First, we list well-known classes of attacks that pose threats,
    with\n  relevant case studies and descriptions. Next, we give a list of\n  defence
    measures against these attacks to be considered when\n  designing and deploying
    protocols. Naturally, deployments of\n  protocols vary greatly between use cases;
    therefore, some attacks and\n  defensive measures outlined may require more consideration
    than\n  others, dependent on use case.\n\n  This RFC can be used by protocol designers
    to write the Security\n  Considerations section in an RFC. The impact on attack
    defence of a\n  protocol should be considered in multiple use cases across the\n
    \ multiple layers of the internet in its this section. Defence against\n  malicious
    attacks can be improved and it can be weakened by design\n  features of protocols.
    Designers should acknowledge the role of\n  protocols in attack prevention, detection
    and mitigation; this\n  document aims to be a useful guide in doing so.\n\n\t "

  content: "The FMIPv6 draft proposes a number of changes in the local link and \nrouting
    information exchange architecture for wireless networks that \nare not quite aligned
    with standard IETF protocols, including the \nbase MIPv6 protocol itself. This
    draft proposes modifications of \nFMIPv6 to tighten the semantics of anticipated
    care-of address \nconfiguration around the prehandover signaling as a logical
    \nextension of Router Discovery, and around the HI/HAck exchange as a \nlogical
    extension of routing information propagation. It also \nproposes some extensions
    to Router Discovery for reactive handover \nto piggyback signaling for quickly
    establishing a tunnel to the \nPrevious Access Router on top of standard RFC 2461
    Router Discovery \nsignaling. \n\t "

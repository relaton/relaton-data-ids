  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion\n
    \  issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of\n   the
    original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for\n   Easy IPv4),
    outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the\n   Internet system architecture
    enhancement considerations. EzIP may\n   expand an IPv4 address by a factor of
    256M without affecting the\n   existing IPv4 based Internet, or the current private
    networks. It is\n   in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not
    only\n   both direct and private network connectivity, but also their\n   interoperability.
    EzIP deployments may coexist with existing Internet\n   traffic and the IoT (Internet
    of Things) operations without\n   perturbing their setups, while offering end-users
    the freedom to\n   indepdently choose which service. EzIP may be implemented as
    a\n   software or firmware enhancement to Internet edge routers or private\n   network
    routing gateways, wherever needed, or simply installed as an\n   inline adjunct
    hardware module between the two, enabling a seamless\n   introduction. The 256M
    case detailed here establishes a complete\n   spherical layer of routers for interfacing
    between the Internet fabic\n   (core plus edge routers) and the end user premises.
    Incorporating\n   caching proxy technology in the gateway, a fairly large geographical\n
    \  region may enjoy address expansion based on as little as one ordinary\n   IPv4
    public address utilizing IP packets with degenerated EzIP\n   header. If IPv4
    public pool allocations were reorganized, the\n   assignable pool could be multiplied
    512M fold or even more. EzIP will\n   immediately resolve local IPv4 address shortages,
    while being\n   transparent to the rest of the Internet. Under the Dual-Stack\n
    \  environment, these proposed interim facilities will relieve the IPv4\n   address
    shortage issue, while affording IPv6 more time to reach\n   maturity and to provide
    the availability levels required for\n   delivering a long-term general service.\n\n\t "

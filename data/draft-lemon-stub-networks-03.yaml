  content: "   This document describes a set of practices for connecting stub\n   networks
    to adjacent infrastructure networks, as well as to larger\n   network fabrics.
    \ This is applicable in cases such as constrained\n   (Internet of Things) networks
    where there is a need to provide\n   functional parity of service discovery and
    reachability between\n   devices on the stub network and devices on an adjacent
    infrastructure\n   link (for example, a home network).\n\n   The stub networks
    use case is intended to fully address the need to\n   attach a single network
    link to an infrastructure network, where the\n   attached link provides no through
    routing and in cases where\n   integration to the infrastructure routing fabric
    (if any) is not\n   available.\n\n\t "

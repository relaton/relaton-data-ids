  script: Latn
  content: "   The purpose of this draft is to document how the Locator/Identifier\n
    \  Separation Protocol (LISP) can be used to enable a secure layer\n   3-based
    Hybrid Cloud, which is a composition of two or more distinct\n   cloud infrastructures
    that remain unique entities, but are bound\n   together to enable data and application
    portability.\n\n   It describes how LISP, in combination with IPsec, can be implemented\n
    \  on a virtualized router that is deployed on a public cloud and on the\n   enterprise
    Data Center to enable cloud bursting, workload migration,\n   rapid provision
    of new applications in the cloud and disaster\n   recovery use cases.  This draft
    covers how LISP allows virtual\n   machines (VMs) to be moved to the cloud without
    requiring changes to\n   the VMs IP and/or MAC-address.\n\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "This draft proposes a generic mechanism for deriving short-lived\ntraffic
    keys from the longed-lived keys.  The long-lived key could be\na preshared secret
    or a key obtained from some key management\nprotocol.  The mechanism described
    in this draft can be used to\nimplement key rollovers without requiring the participating
    routers\nto exchange any additional information.\n\t "

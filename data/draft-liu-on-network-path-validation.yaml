  content: "   Network path validation refers to a technology that ensures data\n
    \  packets to strictly travel along a chosen network path.  It aims to\n   enforce
    data to travel only on the assigned network path and provide\n   evidence that
    the data has indeed followed this path.  While existing\n   efforts primarily
    focus on the control plane, path validation\n   protects and monitors routing
    security in the data plane.  This\n   document provides a technical definition
    of the Network Path\n   Validation problem, briefly overviews past efforts, models
    its ideal\n   solution and design goals, and lists out different use case across\n
    \  various layers of the Internet.\n\n\t "

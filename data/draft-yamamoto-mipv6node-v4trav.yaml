  content: "   This draft presents Mobile IPv6 [1] operation in IPv4 networks by\n
    \  using existing automatic tunneling method.  A mobile IPv6 node uses\n   Mobile
    IPv6 to maintain connectivity while moving between IPv6\n   subnets.  Not all
    access networks will transition to IPv6 at once.\n   Therefore, seamless Mobile
    IPv6 connectivity is not guarantied since\n   a mobile IPv6 node may roam into
    an IPv4 only network.  We describe a\n   scheme, named GLOB6, to allow mobile
    IPv6 nodes to traverse IPv4\n   subnets by using automatic tunneling. ISATAP [2]
    is an example\n   automatic tunneling mechanism described in this document to\n
    \  enable Mobile IPv6 connectivity over IPv4 networks. The\n   draft concludes
    with a brief description of how the scheme\n   can be applied to certain 3G networks
    as well as WLAN\n   deployments as part of an overall strategy for the\n   realization
    \ of global mobility - a main feature of IPv6.\n\n\t "

  content: "MPLS-TE Graceful Shutdown is a method for explicitly notifying the nodes
    in a Traffic Engineering (TE) enabled network that the TE capability on a link
    or on an entire Label Switching Router (LSR) is going to be disabled. MPLS-TE
    graceful shutdown mechanisms are tailored toward addressing planned outage in
    the network.\n\n This document provides requirements and protocol mechanisms to
    reduce or eliminate traffic disruption in the event of a planned shutdown of a
    network resource. These operations are equally applicable to both MPLS-TE and
    its Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extensions. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

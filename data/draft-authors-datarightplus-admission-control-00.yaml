  content: "   The establishment of a shared model of trust is critical to any\n   functioning
    technology ecosystem, particularly when it relates to the\n   sharing of data
    and the execution of Consumer specific actions.\n   Traditional models of trust
    have typically revolved around implicit\n   trust established through bi-lateral
    arrangements (i.e. legal\n   contracts) between participants.  The issue with
    this approach is\n   that, at scale, it is not possible for all participants to\n
    \  efficiently establish communication with all other participants.\n   This leads
    to the requirement for a mechanism to establish trust\n   across participants
    in a way that the business layer of an\n   organisation has confidence in ensuring
    participant interaction is\n   validated.\n\n\t "

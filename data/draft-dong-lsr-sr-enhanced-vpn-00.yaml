  content: "   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the\n
    \  needs of new applications, particularly including the applications\n   that
    are associated with 5G services.  These applications require\n   better isolation
    and have more stringent performance requirements\n   than that can be provided
    with traditional overlay VPNs.  An enhanced\n   VPN may form the underpin of 5G
    transport network slicing, and will\n   also be of use in its own right.  This
    document describes how Multi-\n   Topology Routing (MTR) as described in RFC 5120
    and RFC 4915, can be\n   extended to signal the resources allocated in the underlay
    network to\n   construct the virtual networks for enhanced VPN services, together\n
    \  with the Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs) used to identify and\n   access
    the network resources allocated for the virtual networks in\n   the data plane.\n\n\t "

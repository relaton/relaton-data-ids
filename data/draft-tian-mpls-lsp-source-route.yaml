- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "One advantage that MPLS provides is that it allows traffic to be\n   directed
    through an explicit path that deviates from IP routing.\n   Such ability is widely
    used in traffic-engineering and fast-reroute.\n   Currently signaling protocols
    such as RSVP is needed to establish and\n   maintain such an explicit Label Switched
    Path. When there are a large\n   number of such signaled LSPs in the network,
    the aggregated signaling\n   and maintenance overhead can be significant.\n\n
    \  In this paper, we propose a way to establish a source routed explicit\n   path
    with zero signaling overhead. The scheme uses a stack of labels\n   and requires
    domain wide LDP FEC to label bindings.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies the use of a reserved IANA IPv4 address\nallocation
    to support the deployment of IPv6 transition technologies\nand IPv4 address sharing
    technologies post IPv4 exhaustion.  Service\nproviders are in the process of implementing
    IPv6 support by\nproviding dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 services to their end-users.
    \ One\nmethod for continued support of the IPv4 Internet post IANA IPv4\ndepletion
    is through the use of a carrier-provided NAT444\ninfrastructure.  Another mechanism
    used to transition to IPv6 is an\nIPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel such as IPv6 Rapid Deployment
    (6RD).  This\ndocument details the use of an IANA reserved address block for these\npurposes.\n\t "

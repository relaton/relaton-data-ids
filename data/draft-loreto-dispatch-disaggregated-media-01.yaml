  content: "Disaggregated media refers to the ability for a user to create a\nmultimedia
    session combining different media streams, coming from\ndifferent devices under
    his or her control, so that they are treated\nby the far end of the session as
    a single media session.  This\ndocument lists several use cases that involve disaggregated
    media in\nSIP.  Additionally, this document analyzes what types of\ndisaggregated
    media can be implemented using existing protocol\nmechanisms, and the pros and
    cons of using each of those mechanisms.\nFinally, this document describes scenarios
    that are not covered by\ncurrent mechanisms and proposes new IETF work to cover
    them.\n\t "

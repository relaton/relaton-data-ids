  content: "This memo sets out an MPLS-based solution to the IP service delivery \nproblems
    as set out in RFC 2990. The solution is based on source \nrouting of IP flows
    using MPLS label stacks.  \nThe solution elements are introduced sequentially
    and a usage \nscenario is mapped out that aligns with the work in the ISSLL working
    \ngroup.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   More and more of today's devices are multi-homing capable, in\n   particular
    3GPP user equipment like smartphones.  In the current\n   standardization of the
    next upcoming mobile network generation 5G\n   Rel.16, this is especially targeted
    in the study group Access Traffic\n   Steering Switching Splitting [TR23.793].
    \ ATSSS describes the\n   flexible selection or combination of 3GPP untrusted
    access like Wi-Fi\n   and cellular access, overcoming the single-access limitation
    of\n   today's devices and services.  Another multi-connectivity scenario is\n
    \  the Hybrid Access [I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture][I-D.\n   muley-network-based-bonding-hybrid-access],
    providing multiple access\n   for CPEs, which extends the traditional way of single
    access\n   connectivity at home to dual-connectivity over 3GPP and fixed access.\n
    \  A missing piece in the ATSSS and Hybrid Access is the access and path\n   measurement,
    which is required for efficient and beneficial traffic\n   steering decisions.
    \ This becomes particularly important in\n   heterogeneous access networks with
    a multitude of volatile access\n   paths.  While MP-TCP has been proposed to be
    used within ATSSS, there\n   are drawbacks when being used to encapsulate unreliable
    traffic as it\n   blindly retransmits each lost frame leading to excessive delay
    and\n   potential head-of-line blocking.  A decision for MP-TCP though leaves\n
    \  the increasing share of UDP in today's traffic mix\n   (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05168>)
    unconsidered.  In this document,\n   a multi-access framework is proposed leveraging
    the MP-DCCP network\n   protocol, which enables flexible traffic steering, switching
    and\n   splitting also for unreliable traffic.  A benefit is the support for\n
    \  pluggable congestion control which enables our framework to be used\n   either
    independent or complementary to MP-TCP.\n\n\t "

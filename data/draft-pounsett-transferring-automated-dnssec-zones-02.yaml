- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Section 4.3.5.1 of [RFC6781] \"DNSSEC Operational Practices, version\n
    \  2\" describes a procedure for transitioning a DNSSEC signed zone from\n   one
    (cooperative) operator to another.  The procedure works well in\n   many situations,
    but makes the assumption that it is feasible for the\n   two operators to simultaneously
    publish slightly different versions\n   of the zone being transferred.  In some
    cases, such as with TLD\n   registries, operational considerations require both
    operators to\n   publish identical versions of the zone for the duration of the\n
    \  transition.  This document describes a modified transition procedure\n   which
    can be used in these cases.\n\n\t "

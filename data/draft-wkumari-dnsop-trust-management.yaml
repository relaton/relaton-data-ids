  content: "   [ Editor note: This originally included a mechanism to actually roll\n
    \  the keys (like RFC5011 does), but feedback from the Prague meeting\n   indicated
    a strong preference for signalling only. ]\n\n   This document describes a simple
    method for validating recursive\n   resolvers to signal their configured list
    of DNSSEC trust anchors.\n   This mechanism allows the trust anchor maintainer
    to monitor the\n   progress of the migration to a new trust anchor, and so predict
    the\n   effect before decommissioning the existing trust anchor.\n\n   It is primarily
    aimed at the root DNSSEC trust anchor, but should be\n   applicable to trust anchors
    elsewhere in the DNS as well.\n\n   [ Ed note - informal summary: One of the big
    issues with rolling the\n   root key is that it is unclear who all is using RFC5011,
    who all has\n   successfully fetched and installed the new key, and, most\n   importantly,
    who all will die when the old key is revoked.  By having\n   resolvers query for
    a special QNAME, comprised of the list of TAs\n   that it knows about, we effectively
    signal \"up stream\" to the\n   authoritative server.  By querying for this name,
    the recursive\n   exposes its list of TAs to this authoritative server.  This
    allows\n   the TA maintainer to gather information relating to the state of TAs\n
    \  on resolvers.]\n\n   [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional
    background\n   information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,\n
    \  etc.  They will be removed before publication.]\n\n   [ This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at:\n   https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-trust-management.
    \ The\n   most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be\n
    \  available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]\n\n\t "

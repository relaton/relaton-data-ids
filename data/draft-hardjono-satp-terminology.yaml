- content: "<p>This memo collates existing terminology related to digital assets,
    asset networks and distributed ledger technology (DLT) that are relevant to the
    secure asset transfer protocol (SATP) and the IETF more broadly. Existing terms
    are borrowed as much as possible, and new terms are introduced only when necessary
    and with emphasis on technology neutrality.</p>"

  content: "   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme\n
    \  resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems]\n   have
    been devised in their process of creating standards by the\n   Digital Video Broadcasting
    Project (DVB), the Association of Radio\n   Industries and Businesses in Japan
    (ARIB) and the OpenCable\n   Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and
    future scheduled\n   publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications\n
    \  such as HTTP, MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or other XML based\n   metadata.\n\n
    \  These URI are used to locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other\n   multimedia
    broadcast programme services (i.e., channels or events)\n   and also the audio-visual
    components related to that programme, for\n   example an HTTP-based programme
    guide on the Web or other XML-based\n   electronic programme guides in digital
    broadcast receivers.\n\n   This document defines the \"dvb\" URI scheme for the
    benefit of the\n   Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital
    Video\n   Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.\n\n\t "

- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   Multi-homing of NVEs is a desirable feature to NVO3 since it provides\n
    \  Tenant Systems with reliable connection, load-balance, etc. The major\n   issue
    of the multi-homing of NVEs is that it introduces one-to-many\n   mapping from
    Tenant System (inner) addresses to NVE (outer)\n   addresses.\n\n   This document
    identifies the requirements for multi-homing of NVEs\n   and specifies corresponding
    solutions to meet these requirements. The\n   key is to let remote NVEs be aware
    of the group of NVEs that are\n   offering multi-homing to Tenant Systems, therefore
    the remote NVE can\n   cope with the one-to-many mapping correctly.\n\n\t "

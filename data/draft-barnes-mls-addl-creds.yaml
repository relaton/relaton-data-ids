  content: "   This specification defines two new kinds of credentials for use\n   within
    the Message Layer Security (MLS) credential framework:\n   UserInfo Verifiable
    Credentials and multi-credentials.  UserInfo\n   Verifiable Credentials allow
    clients to present credentials that\n   associate OpenID Connect attributes to
    a signature key pair held by\n   the client.  Multi-credentials allow clients
    to present authenticated\n   attributes from multiple sources, or to present credentials
    in\n   different formats to support groups with heterogeneous credential\n   support.\n\n\t "

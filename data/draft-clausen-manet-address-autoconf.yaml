  content: "   In this draft, a simple autoconfiguration mechanism for MANETs is\n
    \  developed. The mechanism aims at solving the simple, but common,\n   problem
    of one or more new nodes emerging in an existing network. A\n   solution is proposed,
    which allows these new nodes to acquire an\n   address and participate in the
    network. The method is simple, both\n   algorithmically and in the requirements
    to the network. While this is\n   a partial solution to the general autoconfiguration
    problem, the\n   mechanism described in this draft can satisfy the requirements
    for a\n   great number of real-world situations. Though examples are given with\n
    \  OLSR [1] [11] being the routing protocol in use, nothing prevents the\n   described
    mechanisms to work along with other routing protocols.\n\t "

  content: "The ICMPv6 protocol provides many functions which in IPv4 were either\nnon-existent
    or provided by lower layers.  IPv6 architecture also\nmakes it possible to secure
    all IP packets using IPsec, even ICMPv6\nmessages.  IPsec architecture has a Security
    Policy Database that\nspecifies which traffic is protected, and how.  It turns
    out that the\nspecification of policies in the presence of ICMPv6 traffic is hard,\nparticularly
    with ICMPv6 packets related to Neighbor Discovery.\nSound looking policies may
    easily lead to loops: The establishment of\nsecurity requires Neighbor Discovery
    messages which can not be sent\nsince security has not been established yet.  The
    purpose of this\ndraft is to inform system administrators and IPsec implementors
    in\nwhich manner they can handle the ICMPv6 messages.  Common\nunderstanding of
    the way that these messages are handled is also\nnecessary for interoperability,
    in case vendors hardcode such rules\nin to products.\n\n\t "

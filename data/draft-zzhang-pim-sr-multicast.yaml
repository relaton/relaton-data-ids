  content: "   With Segment Routing (SR) architecture [rfc8402], a unicast flow can\n
    \  be routed through an SR network following an explicit path specified\n   in
    the packet, w/o the need for per-flow state in the network.  As a\n   result,
    the otherwise needed protocols to signal the per-flow unicast\n   state can also
    be removed from the network.  This document discusses\n   options for multicast
    in an SR network.\n\n\t "

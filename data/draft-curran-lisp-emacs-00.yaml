abstract:
- content: <p>One of the potential problems with the "map-and-encapsulate" approaches
    to routing architecture is that there is a significant chance of packets being
    dropped while a mapping is being retrieved. Some approaches pre-load ingress tunnel
    routers with at least part of the mapping database. Some approaches try to solve
    this by providing intermediate "default" routers which have a great deal more
    knowledge than a typical ingress tunnel router. This document proposes a scheme
    which does not drop packets yet does not require a great deal of knowledge in
    any router. However, there are still some issues that need to be worked out.</p>

  content: "   This note describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a network that has\n
    \  more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that\n   implements
    BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple\n   routers to choose from.
    \ It also applies to other scenarios such as\n   the usage of stateful firewalls
    that effectively act as address-based\n   filters.\n\n   This host behavior may
    interact with source address selection in a\n   given implementation, but logically
    follows it.  Given that the\n   network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed
    with multiple\n   provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to use
    a\n   source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all\n   neighboring
    routers are advertising that prefix in their Router\n   Advertisement Prefix Information
    Options, this document specifies to\n   which router a host should present its
    transmission.  It updates RFC\n   4861.\n\n\t "

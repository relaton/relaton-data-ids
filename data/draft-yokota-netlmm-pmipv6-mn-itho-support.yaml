  content: "A Virtual Interface is a software semantic internal to the host\noperating
    system.  This semantic is widely available in all popular\noperating systems and
    is used in various protocol implementations.\nThe Virtual Interface support is
    also required on the mobile node\noperating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for
    leveraging various\nmobility features such as inter-technology handoffs, multihoming
    and\nflow mobility support.  This document explains the operational\ndetails of
    Virtual Interface construct and the inter-working with the\nnetwork elements in
    the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for supporting\nvarious network-based mobility management
    features.\n\t "

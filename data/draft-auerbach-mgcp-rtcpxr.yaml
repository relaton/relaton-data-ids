  content: "            The main intent of this document is to define a Media Gateway
    Control \n            Protocol (MGCP) package to control the reporting of metrics
    supported \n            by the VoIP metrics block in RTCP Extended Reports as
    specified in [RFC \n            3611]. It also allows the call agent to control
    whether or not the \n            gateway will request a peer device via SDP to
    send the VoIP metrics \n            block in RTCP Extended Reports and whether
    it will respond positively \n            to such requests from the peer device.
    Besides this primary focus, this \n            MGCP RTCP-XR Package                             4/12/2007
    \n            package also allows the reporting of metrics defined for RTCP Sender
    \n            Reports and Receiver Reports [RFC 3550] and the reporting of session
    \n            description parameters (based on the ones defined in RFC 2327, RFC
    2198 \n            etc.). \n\n\t "

  content: "   Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an extension to\n
    \  DS-Lite which moves the Network Address Translation function from the\n   DS-Lite
    AFTR to the B4.  It can be deployed in a DS-Lite network to\n   gradually reduce
    the load of Carrier Grade NAT in the AFTR.  However,\n   when DS-Lite and lw4over6
    co-exist in the same network, B4 elemtns\n   and lwB4 elements may want to signal
    the DHCPv6 server the type of\n   AFTR (i.e.  AFTR or lwAFTR) they request.  In
    this memo, a new DHCPv6\n   option is proposed for lwB4 element to request the
    IPv6 address of\n   its corresponding lwAFTR.\n\n\t "

  content: "Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that
    are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service provider.
    \ Often, these sets of resources are referred to as \"Web services\" or \"Web
    APIs\".  This specification defines link relations that represent relationships
    from Web services or APIs to resources that provide documentation, descriptions,
    metadata, or status information for these resources.  Documentation is primarily
    intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for
    automated consumers.  Metadata provides information about a service's context.
    \ This specification also defines a link relation to identify status resources
    that are used to represent information about service status.\n\t "

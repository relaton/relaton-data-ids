  content: "   SIP is an application-layer control protocol that can establish, \n
    \  modify, and terminate multimedia sessions. SIP makes use of elements \n   called
    proxy servers to help route requests to and from the user's \n   current location.
    Before a SIP request can be sent by a SIP client, \n   an outbound SIP proxy (first
    hop proxy) has to be discovered to which \n   the SIP request can be forwarded.
    This draft proposes a new method \n   for discovering the address of first hop
    outbound SIP proxy server \n   based on the use of anycast addressing and the
    SIP OPTIONS request. \n   This new method can be used with either IPv4 or IPv6,
    however the \n   description and examples given in this draft are for IPv6 only.

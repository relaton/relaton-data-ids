  content: "Differentiated services are intended to provide scalable service\n   discrimination
    in the Internet without the need for per-flow state\n   and signaling at every
    hop.  The differentiated services approach to\n   providing quality of service
    in networks employs a small, well-\n   defined set of building blocks from which
    a variety of services may\n   be built.  The services may be either end-to-end
    or intra-domain.  A\n   wide range of services can be provided by a combination
    of:\n \n   - setting bits in the TOS octet at network edges and administrative\n
    \    boundaries,\n   - using those bits to determine how packets are treated by
    the\n     routers inside the network, and\n   - conditioning the marked packets
    at network boundaries in accordance\n     with the requirements of each service.\n
    \n   A differentiated-services-capable network node includes a classifier\n   that
    selects packets based on the TOS octet and is capable of\n   delivering the treatment
    corresponding to that marking of the TOS\n   octet.  Setting of the TOS octet
    and other conditioning of the\n   dynamic behavior of marked packets need only
    be performed at network\n   boundaries and may vary in complexity.  This draft
    presents a\n   differentiated services definition of the TOS octet and the\n   operational
    model behind that definition.\n\t "

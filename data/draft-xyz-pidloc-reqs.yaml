  content: "   Use of Identifier Locator separation systems is proposed for various\n
    \  use cases to allow for efficient and service aware flexible end-to-\n   end
    routing.  A statement on the issue of privacy preservation of\n   both users and
    devices identity and location describes major\n   challenges identified for this
    problem.  This document attempts to\n   derive requirements towards a potential
    solution space of approaches\n   to preserve privacy in Identifier-Locator split
    (PidLoc) protocols.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a secure and highly-efficient augmented\n   password-authenticated
    key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user\n   remembers a low-entropy password
    and its verifier is registered in\n   the intended server.  In general, the user's
    password is chosen from\n   a small set of dictionary, making the password susceptible
    to offline\n   dictionary attacks.  The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure\n
    \  against passive attacks, active attacks and offline dictionary\n   attacks
    (on the obtained messages with passive/active attacks).\n   Also, this protocol
    provides resistance to server compromise in the\n   context that an attacker,
    who obtained the password verifier from the\n   server, must at least perform
    offline dictionary attacks to gain any\n   advantage in impersonating the user.
    \ The AugPAKE protocol is not\n   only provably secure in the random oracle model
    but also the most\n   efficient over the previous augmented PAKE protocols (SRP
    and AMP).\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document describes a coordinatable mechanism for the networks\n
    \  that each contains a service node in the Computing Centric Network\n   (CCN).
    \ The CCN stands for an overlay network or called a network\n   federation that
    focuses on the computing service providing.  In CCN,\n   many service nodes in
    different networks can join in or leave the\n   federation dynamically.\n\n\n\n\t "

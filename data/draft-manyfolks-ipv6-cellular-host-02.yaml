  content: "As an increasing number of cellular hosts are being connected to the\nInternet,
    IPv6 becomes necessary. Examples of such hosts are GPRS,\nUMTS, and CDMA2000 terminals.
    Standardization organizations are also\nmaking IPv6 mandatory in their newest
    specifications, such as the IP\nmultimedia terminals specified for UMTS. However,
    the concept of\nIPv6 covers many aspects, numerous RFCs, a number of different\nsituations,
    and is also partly still evolving.\n\t "

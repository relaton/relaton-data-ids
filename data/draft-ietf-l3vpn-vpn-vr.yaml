  content: "This document describes a network-based Virtual Private Network \n   (VPN)
    architecture using the virtual router (VR) concept. Multiple \n   VRs can exist
    in a single physical device. A VR emulates all the \n   functionality of a physical
    router, and therefore inherits all \n   existing mechanisms and tools for configuration,
    operation, \n   accounting, and maintenance. Any routing protocol can be used
    to \n   distribute VPN reachability information among VRs, and no VPN-\n   related
    modifications or extensions are needed to the routing \n   protocol for achieving
    VPN reachability. Direct VR-to-VR \n   connectivity may be configured through
    layer-2 links or through IP- \n   or MPLS-based tunnels. Traffic from VRs belonging
    to different VPNs \n   may be aggregated over a \"backbone VR\" network, which
    greatly \n   simplifies VPN provisioning. This architecture accommodates various
    \n   backbone deployment scenarios, both where the VPN service provider \n   owns
    the backbone, and where the VPN service provider obtains \n   backbone service
    from one or more other service providers.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scope-aggregated OAuth 2.0 authorization
    pattern for multi-step AI agent workflows. An AI agent aggregates the scopes required
    across a workflow and only initiates a single authorization procedure for the
    aggregated scope. This reduces repeated user consents and multiple authorization
    round-trips, improving authorization efficiency.</p>"

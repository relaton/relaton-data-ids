  content: "   This document describes a scope-aggregated OAuth 2.0 authorization\n
    \  pattern for multi-step AI agent workflows.  An AI agent aggregates\n   the
    scopes required across a workflow and only initiates a single\n   authorization
    procedure for the aggregated scope.  This reduces\n   repeated user consents and
    multiple authorization round-trips,\n   improving authorization efficiency.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a widely \ndeployed
    framework for host registration and configuration [DHC]. \nDHCP, however, was
    designed only for fixed hosts on physically secure\nLANs. Other protocols fill
    some of the gap. PPP [PPP] is a good \nsolution for many commercial service providers
    (where framing is \nneeded). Mobile IP [MIP] is ideal for registering and configuring\nroaming
    users (when transparent address binding is needed). This \nstill leaves many environments
    where there is no ideal solution,\nsuch as: roaming users who do not need transparent
    address binding\ne.g., a mobile web browser), and commercial service providers
    \nwho want to support home networking with multiple nodes. This draft\nproposes
    DHCP as the best protocol to meet these new needs, because \nit leave open how
    (and whether) to provide other functions, such as \nframing (e.g., PPP), locating
    (e.g., Mobile IP in co-located mode), \ninter-domain AAA (e.g., [AAAR]), or address
    distribution (e.g., \n[DAAP]). We describe and solicit feedback on seven new requirements
    \nthat would be placed on DHCP to meet these needs.  \n\n\t "

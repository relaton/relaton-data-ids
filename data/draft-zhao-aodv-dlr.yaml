  content: "The Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector and Dynamic Local Repair \n(AODV-DLR)
    routing protocol is intended for use by mobile nodes in\nan ad hoc network.  It
    offers quick adaptation to dynamic link \nconditions, low processing and memory
    overhead, low network \nutilization, and determines unicast routes to destinations
    within \nthe ad hoc network.  It adopts dynamic local repair in which a route
    \nrepair message is used to not only attempt to discovery a route to \ndestination,
    but also try to set up a route to downstream node (next\nhop or next two hop).
    It uses destination sequence numbers to ensure \nloop freedom at all times (even
    in the face of anomalous delivery of\nrouting control messages), avoiding problems
    (such as \"counting to \ninfinity\") associated with classical distance vector
    protocols.\n\t "

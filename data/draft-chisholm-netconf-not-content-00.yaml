abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETCONF Event Notifications standard specifies the mechanism by
    which NETCONF clients can subscribe to and receive event notifications. However,
    with the exception of a timestamp, no standard Notification content was defined.
    This memo defines a set of information that should be included in all NETCONF
    notifications, information that should be included based on class of notification
    and also defines a set of specific notifications to support specific management
    functions, such as configuration.</p>"

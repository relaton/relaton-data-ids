  content: "In order to support more flexible replication methods, it is\ndesirable
    to specify some manner in which an LDAP client may\nretrieve a set of changes
    that have been applied to an LDAP server's\ndatabase.  The client, which may be
    another LDAP server, may then\nchoose to update its own replicated copy of the
    data.  This document\nspecifies an object class that may be used to represent
    changes\napplied to an LDAP server.  It also specifies a method for\ndiscovering
    the location of the container object that holds these\nchange records, so that
    clients and servers have a common rendezvous\npoint for this information.\n\t "

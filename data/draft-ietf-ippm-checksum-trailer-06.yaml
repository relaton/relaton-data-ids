  content: "The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way Active
    Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) are used for performance monitoring in IP networks.
    \ Delay measurement is performed in these protocols by using timestamped test
    packets.  Some implementations use hardware-based timestamping engines that integrate
    the accurate transmission time into every outgoing OWAMP/TWAMP test packet during
    transmission.  Since these packets are transported over UDP, the UDP Checksum
    field is then updated to reflect this modification.  This document proposes to
    use the last 2 octets of every test packet as a Checksum Complement, allowing
    timestamping engines to reflect the checksum modification in the last 2 octets
    rather than in the UDP Checksum field.  The behavior defined in this document
    is completely interoperable with existing OWAMP/TWAMP implementations.\n\t "

  script: Latn
  content: "   IPv4-over-IPv6 tunneling transition mechanisms provide both IPv4 and\n
    \  IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-\n   existing
    period.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for\n   IPv6(DHCPv6) options
    has been extended and defined to configure\n   tunnel initiator (TI) in lightweight
    4over6.  However, in many\n   networks, the configuration information are stored
    in Authentication\n   Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers while user configuration\n
    \  is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through DHCPv6\n   protocol.
    \ Thus AAA server as a database can be extended to establish\n   and store the
    whole information of tunnels and help the tunnel\n   concentrator (TC) recover
    in failure.  This document defines the\n   mechanism and the Remote Authentication
    Dial In User Service (RADIUS)\n   attributes that carry TI configuration information
    from AAA server to\n   BNG and the tunnel configuration information from AAA server
    to TC.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a modeling technique for configuring large\n
    \  size devices in a compact way, when the device contains many similar\n   data
    node patterns.  A device here refers to any such entity that\n   acts as a netconf
    server.  This is realized by instructing the device\n   to locally generate repetitive
    patterns of data nodes from a master\n   copy called 'template' that is configured
    in the device.  This\n   approach is both convenient and efficient, as it minimizes
    the size\n   of the running data store and reduces network provisioning time.
    \ It\n   leverages existing YANG specification features and can be implemented\n
    \  with standard, off-the-shelf tools.\n\n\t "

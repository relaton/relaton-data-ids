  content: "   Data centers have become critical components of the infrastructure\n
    \  used by network operators to provide services to their customers.\n   Data
    centers are attached to the Internet or a backbone network by\n   gateway routers.
    \ One data center typically has more than one gateway\n   for commercial, load
    balancing, and resiliency reasons.\n\n   Segment routing is a popular protocol
    mechanism for operating within\n   a data center, but also for steering traffic
    that flows between two\n   data center sites.  In order that one data center site
    may load\n   balance the traffic it sends to another data center site it needs
    to\n   know the complete set of gateway routers at the remote data center,\n   the
    points of connection from those gateways to the backbone network,\n   and the
    connectivity across the backbone network.\n\n   Segment routing may also be operated
    in other domains, such as access\n   networks.  Those domains also need to be
    connected across backbone\n   networks through gateways.\n\n   This document defines
    a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation\n   attribute to allow each gateway
    router to advertise the routes to the\n   prefixes in the segment routing domains
    to which it provides access,\n   and also to advertise on behalf of each other
    gateway to the same\n   segment routing domain.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "This document describes a mechanism via which X Window System \nclient
    applications may have their communications with the X Windows\nSystem server forwarded
    across a Telnet communications channel.  This\nis desireable when the Telnet session
    is established through a Firewall\nor Network Address Translator which does not
    allow arbitrary connections\nto be created from the host machine to the client
    machine; or when the\nTelnet session is using an authenticated and encrypted channel
    and that\nsame security is desired for the X Window System session data.  \nAuthorization
    to communicate across the tunnel is provided to the X \nWindows System client
    via use of X Display access control data.\n\t "

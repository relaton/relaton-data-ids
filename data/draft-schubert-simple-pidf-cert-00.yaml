  content: "\n   This document specifies a means to integrate Certificate Management\n
    \  Service for The Session Initiation Protocol(SIP) with presence.\n   Presentities
    employing the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)\n   can use the extensions
    in this draft to advertise their ability to\n   exchange signalling using S/MIME,
    and thus allow secure signalling\n   between the two peers.  In a presence application,
    the presence of\n   this information could be displayed to watchers as the padlock\n
    \  \"secure signalling available\" of the presentity.\n\n\t "

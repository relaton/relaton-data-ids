  content: "   Content caching plays an important role in Information-Centric\n   Networking
    (ICN).  Many of current ICN designs adopt a limited, en-\n   route hierarchical
    caching mechanism; additionally, caching and\n   forwarding are largely uncoordinated
    in these designs.  This draft\n   describes a coordinated caching and forwarding
    design to improve\n   content access cost and cache miss rate of ICN.\n\n\t "

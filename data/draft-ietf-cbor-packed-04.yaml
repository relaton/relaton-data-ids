  content: "   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data\n
    \  format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small\n   code
    size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the\n   need for version
    negotiation.\n\n   CBOR does not provide any forms of data compression.  CBOR
    data\n   items, in particular when generated from legacy data models often\n   allow
    considerable gains in compactness when applying data\n   compression.  While traditional
    data compression techniques such as\n   DEFLATE (RFC 1951) can work well for CBOR
    encoded data items, their\n   disadvantage is that the receiver needs to unpack
    the compressed form\n   to make use of data.\n\n   This specification describes
    Packed CBOR, a simple transformation of\n   a CBOR data item into another CBOR
    data item that is almost as easy\n   to consume as the original CBOR data item.
    \ A separate decompression\n   step is therefore often not required at the receiver.\n\n\t "

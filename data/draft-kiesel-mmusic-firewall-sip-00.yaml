  content: "SIP-based multimedia applications dynamically negotiate parameters\nfor
    the related media streams, such as UDP port numbers.  Therefore,\nfirewalls that
    want to inspect these streams have to interact with\nthe session signaling.  Several
    architectures and protocols have been\ndeveloped for the dynamic control of firewalls
    on the media path, e.\ng., MIDCOM, SIMCO, and the NSIS NAT/FW NSLP.  This document\ninvestigates
    problems with the interaction of standard SIP (as of RFC\n3261) and these firewall
    control protocols, especially with respect\nto error handling.  It will be pointed
    out how existing SIP\nextensions can be used for improving the interaction, and
    which\nadditional mechanisms need to be specified.  While the actual\nspecification
    of such additional mechanisms is out of the scope of\nthis document, it solicits
    feedback and discussion.\n\t "

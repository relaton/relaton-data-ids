  content: "   Saratoga is a data transfer protocol designed to carry potentially\n
    \  large volumes of data over difficult network paths, often including\n   only
    a single high-rate link and only one application flow.  As the\n   requirements
    for use vary across deployment environments, the base\n   Saratoga specification
    only assumes that an implementation will be\n   able to clock packets out at a
    configurable rate, and beyond this\n   specifies no inherent or particular congestion-control
    behaviour.\n   The design of Saratoga deliberately supports the integration of\n
    \  congestion-control algorithms without modification to the base\n   protocol.
    \ This document describes how congestion control can be\n   supported in the Saratoga
    transfer protocol.  Saratoga is intended\n   for use in private networks, where
    its use is engineered as a single\n   flow to fill a link.  However, as Saratoga
    is implemented over UDP,\n   it can be multiplexed, and can be run across the
    public Internet, in\n   which case congestion control in accordance with the UDP
    Guidelines\n   becomes necessary.\n\n\t "

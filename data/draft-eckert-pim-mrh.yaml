  content: "   This document describes the IPv6 extensions to support an experiment\n
    \  in which new IPv6 Routing headers that support stateless replication\n   are
    implemented and deployed for IPv6 Segment Routing Networks.\n   Collectively,
    these headers are called Multicast Routing Header\n   (MRH).\n\n   One purpose
    of this experiment is to demonstrate that the MRH can be\n   implemented and deployed
    in a production network.  Another purpose is\n   to encourage replication of the
    experiment.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This document outlines the motivation, requirements, and\n   architectural
    design for a distributed Session Initiation Protocol\n   (dSIP). dSIP is a Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) based approach for SIP\n   registration and resource discovery using distributed
    hash tables\n   maintained with SIP messages.  This design removes the need for\n
    \  central servers from SIP, while offering full backward compatibility\n   with
    SIP, allowing reuse of existing clients, and allowing P2P\n   enabled peers to
    communicate with conventional SIP entities.  A basic\n   introduction to the concepts
    of P2P is presented, backward\n   compatibility issues addressed, and security
    considerations are\n   discussed.\n\n   dSIP is one possible implementation of
    the protocols being discussed\n   for creation in the P2PSIP WG.  In the context
    of the work being\n   proposed, this draft represents a concrete proposal for
    the P2PSIP\n   Peer Protocol, using SIP with extensions as the underlying protocol.\n
    \  In this architecture, no P2PSIP Client Protocol is needed, rather\n   unmodified
    SIP is used for access by non-peers.\n\n\t "

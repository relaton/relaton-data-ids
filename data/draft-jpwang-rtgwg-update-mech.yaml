  content: "When a connection request comes in a mesh optical network, the \nrouters
    automatically choose the suitable routing paths and \nwavelength to it according
    to the network topology and link state\ninformation saved in its global link state
    database. Because some \nof these wavelengths may be released or occupied at any
    time, the \nglobal state database is always out of date and needed by update by
    \nsome an update policy. A suitable link state update policy is \ncritical, since
    that a high frequency update polity imposes heavy \nburden on network, while a
    low frequency one would increase the \ninaccurate of the global link state database.
    In this paper, we \npropose a link state update policy, named EA-HD policy, which
    \nconsiders two index of a link, one is the Hamming distance between \nthe local
    link state database and the global link state database, \nand another is the used
    ratio of its wavelengths. The proposed \nupdate policy gets a trade-off between
    the accurate of link state \ninformation and its update cost. Simulation proves
    that our scheme \nachieve a good performance in traffic blocking probability while
    \nmaintaining moderate volume of update traffic.\n\t "

  content: "   This document specifies how users can find and communicate with each\n
    \  other privately when using end-to-end encryption messaging.  Users\n   can
    retrieve the key materials and message delivery endpoints of\n   other users without
    revealing their social graphs to the key material\n   service hosts.  Users can
    search for phone numbers or user IDs,\n   either individually or in batches, using
    private information\n   retrieval (PIR).  Our specification is based on the state-of-the-art\n
    \  lattice-based homomorphic PIR scheme, which provides a reasonable\n   tradeoff
    between privacy and cost in a keyword-based sparse PIR\n   setting.\n\n\t "

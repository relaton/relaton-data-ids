  content: "This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n
    \  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n   In
    particular, it describes managed objects for information related\n   to the Fibre
    Channel network's Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF)\n   routing protocol.  At
    present, this memo is in development as part of\n   the SM-FSM project of T11.5
    (http://www.t11.org).  The plan is that\n   it will later become a work item of
    IETF's IMSS working group.\n\t "

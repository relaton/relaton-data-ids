  content: "This document describes a set of considerations and strategies to\nuse
    in increasing the character repertoire available in a protocol\nelement or suite
    of protocol elements.  This document is not meant\nto provide normative instruction
    to protocol designers, but does\nhope to provide guidance on common issues arising
    from this task.\nThis initial draft does not contain real-world examples for the\ndifferent
    strategies outlined below; before final publication, the\nIAB plans to add such
    examples and solicits feedback from the\ncommunity on examples appropriate to
    this draft. Feedback on this\npoint or the draft as a whole should be sent to
    the editors or the\nIAB.\n\t "

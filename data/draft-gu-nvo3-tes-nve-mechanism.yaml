  content: "   his draft introduces the interaction required between TES to NVE when\n
    \  NVE is located in an external box to TES .  The signaling between TES\n   and
    NVE has to be designed carefully to reflect all the interaction\n   requirements.
    \ This document describes the relevant considerations\n   for such design and
    also provides a basic analysis of the potential\n   reusable protocols.  Currently
    this draft focuses on the general\n   interaction procedures with relevant parameters
    and the signaling\n   design consideration.  It may be extended to show more detailed\n
    \  signalling design recommendation and/or solution recommendation in\n   the
    future with the progress of NVO3's work.\n\n\t "

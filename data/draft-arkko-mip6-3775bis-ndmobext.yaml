  content: "This specification extends IPv6 Neighbor Discovery with features that\nare
    useful for mobile nodes.  These features provide information for\nthe purposes
    of detecting the loss of Router Advertisements,\ndetermining the global address
    of the router, or for discovering\nwhich routers are also Mobile IPv6 home agents.
    \ These extensions are\nrequired for Mobile IPv6 operation, but they are also
    useful for any\ntype of nomadic or mobile nodes.  This document revises a part
    of RFC\n3775 which originally defined these extensions.\n\n\n\n\t "

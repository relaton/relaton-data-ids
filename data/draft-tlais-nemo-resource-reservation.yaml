  content: "Degradation or forced service termination may occur because of\n   frequent
    handoffs that may occur within NEMO networks. This paper\n   presents a resource
    reservation scheme aiming at supporting quality\n   of service guaranty. We focus
    on a reservation protocol adapted to\n   NEMO specifications. For doing so, we
    use a generic signaling\n   protocol that may exploit advantages of both reservation
    protocols;\n   IntServ and DiffServ.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents the evaluation results of CoAP in terms of\n
    \  various latency metrics over UDP/TCP under different network\n   environments.
    \ We conduct experiments via both GPRS and WiFi.  We\n   also evaluate how the
    latency metrics are impacted by the background\n   traffic.\n\n\t "

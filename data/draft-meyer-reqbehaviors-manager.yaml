  content: "The behavior of mail lists on the Internet has become \nmuch more sophisticated
    than the alias expanders \ndiscussed in the standards for Internet messages \nformats.
    The lack of standard behavior for this part of \nthe Internet messaging system
    creates confusion among \nusers, resulting in misdirected or inappropriately \nduplicated
    messages. This document lists required \nbehaviors for mail list managers derived
    from [RFC2821] \nand [RFC2822] in hopes of reducing the confusion, \nmisdirected
    and duplicated mail, while at the same time \nsimplifying the configuration process
    for mail list \nmanagers.\n\t "

  content: "This document specifies three sets of new ciphersuites for the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support authentication based on pre-shared keys
    (PSKs).  These pre-shared keys are symmetric keys, shared in advance among the
    communicating parties.  The first set of ciphersuites uses only symmetric key
    operations for authentication.  The second set uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange
    authenticated with a pre-shared key, and the third set combines public key authentication
    of the server with pre-shared key authentication of the client. [STANDARDS-TRACK]\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents the problem of configuring a large number of\n
    \  IKE/IPsec systems in such a way that any two of them can use IPsec to\n   protect
    the traffic between them.  Manual configuration of all\n   possible tunnels is
    too cumbersome in such cases, so an automated\n   method is needed.\n\n\t "

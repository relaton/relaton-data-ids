  content: "RFC 2003 specifies a method by which an IP datagram may be\nencapsulated
    (carried as payload) within an IP datagram. This is a\nmeans to alter the normal
    IP routing for datagrams, by delivering\nthem to an intermediate destination that
    would otherwise not be\nselected by the (network part of the) IP Destination Address
    field in\nthe original IP header.\nThis draft allows to extend this encapsulation
    mechanism also for\nprivate IP addresses.\n\n\n\t "

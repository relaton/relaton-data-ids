  content: "It is expected that MPLS-based recovery could become a viable option \nfor
    obtaining faster restoration than layer 3 rerouting. To deliver \nreliable service,
    however, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS)[ ], \n[ ] requires a set of procedures
    to provide protection of the \ntraffic carried on the label switched paths (LSPs).
    This imposes \ncertain requirements on the path recovery process [ ], and requires
    \nprocedures for the configuration of working and protection paths, \nfor the
    communication of fault information to appropriate switching \nelements, and for
    the activation of appropriate switchover actions. \nThis document specifies a
    mechanism for path protection switching \nand restoration in MPLS networks.\n\t "

  content: "The Trusted Platform Module, for the past decade, has shown potential\nto
    improve computer security. However, there is growing concerns that\nthe Trusted
    Platform Module, and its related technologies might be\nchallenging for Forensic
    Investigators to acquire and analyze certain\ndigital evidence. For example, if
    the key evidence is encrypted, and\ncryptographically bound to a set of platform
    characteristics, then\nthose characteristics must exist on the platform (that
    is being used\nto decrypt the evidence) before the evidence can be decrypted.\nAs
    a result, it is believed that if a suspect cryptographically\nbound the evidence
    to the platform characteristics, and those\ncharacteristics in some way got changed,
    then it might not be\npossible to decrypt the potential evidence.\n\nFor this
    reason, we explored how Trusted Platform Module and its\nrelated technologies
    might support digital forensic analysis \nwithin a trusted enterprise network.\n\t "

  content: "   This document provides an overview of models for MANET and NEMO.  It\n
    \  descibes the MANET and the NEMO characteristics.  It also also lists\n   problems
    using the MANET and NEMO technology, when problems are not\n   described in other
    documents.  It is claimed that MANET suits small\n   mobile network topologies,
    providing optimal paths for communication\n   within a MANET cloud and towards
    the outside.  It is also claimed\n   that NEMO suits small mobile subnets, providing
    sub-optimal paths for\n   to Internet connected nodes.  This document is used
    for evaluating a\n   need for a MANET for NEMO, called MANEMO.\n\n\t "

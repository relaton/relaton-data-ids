  content: "   This is a submission for the creation of an new IANA Time Zones\n   registration
    process.  This is intended to be a central repository\n   for time zone names.
    \ The registry does not presume to be the\n   authority for time zone information
    or rules.  This register is\n   simply a place where time zone names may be registered
    for public\n   access.  This registery only registers time zone names.  The\n
    \  description of the time zone is not included in this memo.  Vendors\n   and
    services companies can elect to provide time zone servers that\n   publish time
    zone information details.\n\t "

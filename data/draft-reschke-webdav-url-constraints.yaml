  content: "   Both WebDAV servers and clients frequently map URI-escaped characters\n
    \  inside a path segment to non-ASCII characters.  These mappings can\n   only
    be interoperable if there is a consensus about the appropriate\n   character encoding.
    \ This document specifies a default encoding that\n   is compatible with both
    the recommendations for URIs in HTML content\n   and the \"Internationalized Resource
    Identifiers\" (IRI) specification.\n\n   Furthermore, servers that implement a
    mapping to locally constrained\n   names frequently do not support specific names,
    or silently map\n   \"similar\" names to the same resource (for instance when
    content is\n   stored in a filesystem that is case-preserving, but not case-\n
    \  sensitive).  For these cases, discovery and error signalling features\n   are
    defined.\n\t "

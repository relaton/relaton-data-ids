  content: "   E-VPN can be used as a control plane protocol for NVO3 network. In
    All-Active\n   access scenario, loop & echo forwarding prevention among multi-homed
    NVEs relies\n   on \"Split horizon\" filtering mechanism. ESI MPLS label is leveraged
    to perform\n   split horizon filtering in MPLS based EVPN network. In VXLAN or
    NVGRE\n   encapsulation based overlay network, no MPLS is used. Therefore a new
    method is\n   introduced in this document to achieve split horizon filtering in
    non-MPLS overlay\n   network. Data plane of the overlay network is extended with
    a LAGID field. The\n   function of LAGID is similar to ESI MPLS Label in [EVPN].
    It is used to identify\n   each Ethernet segment(ES) on each NVE.\n\n\t "

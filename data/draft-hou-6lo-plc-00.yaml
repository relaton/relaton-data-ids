  content: "   Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines\n
    \  for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to\n   support
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially the smart\n   meters for electricity.
    \ With the inherent advantage of existing\n   electricity infrastructure, PLC
    is expanding deployments all over the\n   world, indicating the potential demand
    of IPv6 for future\n   applications.  As part of this technology, Narrowband PLC
    (NBPLC) is\n   focused on the low-bandwidth and low-power scenarios, including\n
    \  current standards such as IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903.  This\n   document
    describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained\n   PLC networks.\n\n\t "

  content: "   IETF network slice has been introduced to meet specific service\n   requirements,
    such as the connectivity requirements and the\n   associated network capabilities
    such as bandwidth, latency, jitter\n   and network functions with the resource
    behaviors such as computing\n   and storage availability.\n\n   For the realization
    of IETF network slices, one or more network\n   resource partitions (NRPs) can
    be created in the network.  Each NRP\n   is a collection of network resources
    (buffer, queuing, scheduling,\n   etc.) allocated in the underlay network.  The
    connectivity constructs\n   from one or more IETF network slices can be mapped
    to an NRP.  NRP\n   specific identifiers could be carried in the IETF network
    slice\n   packets, which could be used to determine the set of network\n   resources
    to be used for the processing and forwarding of the packets\n   in the corresponding
    NRP.\n\n   With the development of IETF network slicing technologies and the\n
    \  deployment of IETF network slices in different types of networks,\n   there
    are emerging requirements about the new capability and\n   functionality of IETF
    network slices.  To meet those requirements, it\n   is expected that the concept
    IETF network slice and NRP needs be\n   generalized.\n\n   This document describes
    the considerations about possible\n   generalization of IETF network slice and
    NRP.\n\n\t "

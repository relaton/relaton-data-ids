  content: "   This document defines Secure RADIUS (SRADIUS), which is a transport\n
    \  profile for RADIUS.  There are three changes from traditional RADIUS\n   transport
    protocols.  First, TLS transport is required and insecure\n   transports are forbidden.
    \ Second, the shared secret is no longer\n   used, and all MD5-based packet signing
    and attribute obfuscation\n   methods are therefore no longer necessary.  Finally,
    the now unused\n   Authenticator field is repurposed to contain an explict request
    /\n   response identifier, called a Token.\n\n   SRADIUS connections can transport
    all RADIUS attributes.\n   Implementation of SRADIUS requires only minor changes
    to packet\n   encoder and decoder functionality.  Nothing else is changed from\n
    \  traditional RADIUS.\n\n\t "

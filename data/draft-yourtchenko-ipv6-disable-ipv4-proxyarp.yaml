  content: "   rfc3927 defines the behavior \"Proxy ARP for Everything\" in case the\n
    \  only address present on the host is IPv4 link-local.  However, it\n   does
    not specify anything about the presence or absence of IPv6\n   global addressing.
    \ This results in the hosts assuming it has both\n   IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity
    in the scenario where the host itself is\n   dualstack-enabled, but the network
    supplies only IPv6 configuration\n   information.  Some implementations in this
    case may decide to use\n   IPv4, which results in long connection delays.  This
    document\n   proposes to avoid the \"Proxy ARP for Everything\" behavior if the
    host\n   has been assigned an IPv6 address.\n\n\t "

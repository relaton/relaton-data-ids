  content: "This document defines the bundle security protocol, which provides data
    integrity and confidentiality services for the Bundle Protocol. Separate capabilities
    are provided to protect the bundle payload and additional data that may be included
    within the bundle. We also describe various security considerations including
    some policy options.\n\n This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking
    Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication
    as an RFC were raised. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.\n\t "

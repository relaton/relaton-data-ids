  content: "This document proposes a lightweight mechanism for signaling a PE \nrouter's
    capability to encapsulate MPLS using dynamic GRE and/or IP.\nThis is applicable
    when a MPLS packet is tunnelled using a dynamic \nGRE and/or IP encapsulation
    [MPLS-IP-GRE] between PE routers. For \ninstance the MPLS packet may be a 2547
    based MPLS VPN packet \n[2547bis] or a layer 2 packet transported using MPLS [MARTINI].
    \nAdding such a mechanism has several benefits. It helps in blackhole \navoidance
    and eases transitioning from MPLS tunneling based \nLayer 3/Layer 2 VPNs to GRE/IP
    tunneling based Layer 3/Layer 2 VPNs \n(and vice versa). Such a mechanism is needed
    where a network may be \nusing MPLS and GRE (or IP) for tunneling, at the same
    time, in 2547 \nbased or Layer 2 VPNs. It can help in encapsulation selection
    when \nmultiple tunneling technologies are supported. It can also be used to\nenhance
    the security of the network backbone. \n\t "

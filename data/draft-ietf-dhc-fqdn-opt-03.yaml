  content: "DHCP [DHCP] can be used to automate the process of configuring TCP/IP
    host computers.  However, some of the DHCP options carry IP addresses rather than
    Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN). Use of IP addresses constrains the DHCP client
    to use the addresses that were in use at the time the client received its configuration
    information; these addresses may change over time, (e.g., a server may be assigned
    a new IP address), so that the IP addresses used by the client may become invalid.
    \                       An alternative to passing IP addresses is to pass FQDNs
    instead of (numeric) IP addresses.  Doing this allows a client to defer binding
    between a particular network entity (e.g., a server) and its IP address until
    run time.  As stated in [Carpenter:96], 'Deferring the binding avoids the risk
    of changed mapping between IP addresses and specific network entities (due to
    changing addressing information).  Moreover, reliance on FQDNs (rather than IP
    addresses) also localizes to the DNS the changes needed to deal with changing
    addressing information due to renumbering.'     This document defines a new DHCP
    option that allows the use of FQDNs instead of IP addresses in DHCP options.\n\t "

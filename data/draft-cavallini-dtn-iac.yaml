abstract:
- content: <p>This document describe a new anycast addressing scheme for Delay- Tolerant
    Networking (DTN), named Interplanetary Anycast Communication (iac). Designed for
    use within the DTN Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7), iac enables IP Anycast-like
    funcionality in the Context of Delayed Tolerant Network, so this mechanism enables
    the routing and delivery of bundles to a single member of a specified iac anycast
    group based on a structured Endpoint Identifier (EID) URI scheme. The document
    formally defines the "iac" URI scheme, made of three main components, an Allocator
    Identifier, a Group Number, and a Service Number, details registration requirements
    with IANA addressing formats, and service numbering conventions while maintaining
    compatibility with existing IPN/IMC-based identifiers.</p>

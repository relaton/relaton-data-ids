  content: "   Identifier-Locator Addressing architecture defined in\n   [I-D.herbert-nvo3-ila]
    proposes the use of locator-identifier split\n   in IPv6 address to realize workload
    mobility and more efficient use\n   of network resources.  This document describes
    how ILA can be\n   implemented in datacenter using BGP as the control-plane protocol.\n
    \  Generally speaking, ILA could be built using different control\n   planes,
    and BGP is one particular instantiation.  The motivation is\n   BGP being a well-known
    protocol, sufficient for small to medium size\n   deployments, on scale of few
    millions of identifier to locator\n   mappings.  Defining more generic and scalable
    control plane variants\n   is outside of scope of this document.\n\n\t "

  content: "   This memo defines a framework for allowing asynchronous communication\n
    \  between sleepy sensors mediated by a supporting Proxy node.  The\n   Proxy
    acts as a store-and-forward agent that handles requests on\n   behalf of a sleepy
    client, and buffers responses coming from the\n   target origin until the requesting
    client wakes up and get the\n   computation results.\n\n   A new CoAP option,
    Sleepy, is defined to initiate and control the\n   asynchronous exchange.\n\n\t "

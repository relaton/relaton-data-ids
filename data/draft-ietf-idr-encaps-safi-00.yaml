  content: "In certain situations, transporting a packet from one BGP speaker to\n
    \  another, the BGP next hop, requires that the packet be encapsulated\n   by
    the first BGP speaker and decapsulated by the second. To support\n   these situations,
    there needs to be some agreement  between the two\n   BGP speakers with regard
    to the \"encapsulation information\", i.e.,\n   the format of the encapsulation
    header as well as the contents of\n   various fields of the header.\n\n   The
    encapsulation information need not be signaled for all\n   encapsulation types.
    In the cases where the signaling is required\n   (such as L2TPv3, GRE with key),
    This draft specifies a method by\n   which BGP speakers can signal encapsulation
    information to each\n   other. The signaling is done by sending BGP updates using
    the\n   \"Encapsulation SAFI\" and IPv4 or IPv6 AFI. In the cases where no\n   encapsulation
    information needs to be signaled (such as GRE without\n   key), this draft specifies
    a BGP extended community that can be\n   attached to UPDATE messages that carry
    payload prefixes to indicate\n   the encapsulation protocol type to be used.\n\t "

  content: "   This document presents a method of utilizing IPv6 underlay tunnels
    to\n   transfer the PPPoE session information in broadband networks.  By\n   taking
    advantage of the programmability of SRv6 SIDs, it not only\n   enables trusted
    authentication and secure access for broadband users\n   but also meets the needs
    of operators to provide differentiated\n   services to broadband users and flexibly
    deploy services.\n\n\t "

  content: "This memo was started as an effort to describe ``IPTalk'' for the AppleTalk-IP
    Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  It became apparent
    that since no protocol standard or description existed that implementation specific
    information was unavoidable. KIP is the prototypical AppleTalk/IP Gateway implementation
    and is available in source form.  KIP's functionality forms the basis for many
    commercial products available today.\n\t "

  content: "   Path-Aware Semantic Address (PASA), proposes to algorithmically\n   assign
    addresses to nodes in a 6lo environment so to achieve\n   stateless forwarding,
    hence, allowing to avoid using a routing\n   protocol.  PASA is more suitable
    for stable and static wireline\n   connectivity, in order to avoid renumbering
    due to topology changes.\n   Even in such kind of scenarios, reliability remains
    a concern.  This\n   memo tackles specifically reliability in PASA deployments,
    analyzing\n   possible broad solution categories to solve the issue.\n\n\t "

  content: "This document defines an opportunistic SRTP key exchange mechanism to
    \nget the best-case SRTP keys, using a slightly modified version of \nSecurity
    Descriptions model [secdes], followed by a second-stage \nmedia-plane key exchange
    based on [XXX].  There are several distinct \nadvantages to this mechanism over
    others; these benefits are \ndocumented herein.  The main goal of this draft is
    to put forth a \nstrawman proposal to perform a 2-stage key-exchange, first via
    a \n[secdes] style mechanism, then through a media-plane mechanism. \n\t "

abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Being the widely used transport protocol in Internet, TCP might be \ninfluenced
    by the congestion occurred in those nodes (i.e., routers, \nIP/ATM access nodes,
    and ATM switches) along the travelling path. Since \nTCP relies on the end-to-end
    window-based mechanism to explain the \ncongestion, there is limited room for
    intermediate network elements to \nexplicitly contribute to the TCP control. However,
    in huge pipe networks, TCP might be ineffective because it starts decreasing its
    rate just after it senses packet's loss, implying that the network has already
    been congested somewhere. A general mechanism of delaying ACKs in congested nodes
    is presented in this draft to connect the traffic \ncontrol of TCP with that of
    network elements. This mechanism can be \nconsidered as an enhancement to the
    currently prevalent TCP and referred \nto Fast-TCP. The basic idea of Fast-TCP
    arises from the fact that \ncontrolling ACK flows can indirectly affect the dynamics
    of TCP's \nbehavior. ACK delay mechanism can be easily implemented in various
    \nnetwork nodes where information of link utilization or buffer occupancy \nmay
    be employed to notify the congestion. By using ACK delay policy at \nIP routers
    in a complex network, we present the simulation results to \nshow that this policy
    achieves good TCP throughput and reduces the \nbuffer requirement.\n\t "

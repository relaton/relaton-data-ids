  content: "This memo presents a set of object classes that can be used to define
    the local representation of the state of the conferences (sessions) that the local
    system is involved in (LASSO: local session state objects).  In addition, some
    initial information is given on how to map this state to similar semantics in
    the ITU T.120 series of recommendations.  We think these object classes might
    be used as a basis for defining the dynamic state variables visible in the horizontal
    control protocol used in a session.                                                                   This
    memo is a submission to the IETF MMUSIC working group.  Currently, this memo is
    in ``strawman'' stage.  Comments of any kind are positively encouraged and should
    be addressed to the confctrl@isi.edu mailing list.\n\t "

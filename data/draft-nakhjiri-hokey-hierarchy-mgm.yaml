  content: "   This document describes a generic delivery framework for usage and/\n
    \  or domain specific keys, derived as part of an EAP EMSK hierarchy,\n   from
    an EAP server to an intended third party key holder.  The\n   framework description
    includes different scenarios for key delivery,\n   depending on the type of keys
    being delivered.  It also includes,\n   specification of derivation of keys required
    for security protection\n   of key requests and delivery signaling.  The key delivery
    framework\n   also includes proper specification and conveyance of the context
    and\n   scope of the keys being delivered.  All keys generated directly from\n
    \  EMSK as part of the EMSK key hierarchy are derived following the\n   guidelines
    described in [I-D.ietf-hokey-emsk-hierarchy].  Derivation\n   of the EMSK based
    handover root key (HRK) and domain specific\n   handover root keys (DSHRK) for
    use in the problem of handover keying\n   and re-authentication is also described.\n\n\t "

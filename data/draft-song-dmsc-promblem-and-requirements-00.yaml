  content: "   Service meshes, as one infrastructure, has been widely used in the\n
    \  major public cloud providers.  Its main function is to accomplish the\n   policy
    routing, precise traffic allocation, and traffic throttling\n   etc.  Currently,
    the design and implementation of service mesh takes\n   the centralized control
    approach, which bring various challenges for\n   its current deployments and further
    developments.  This document\n   analyzes the problems that exists in current
    service mesh\n   implementations, and provide the requirements for the future\n
    \  distributed micro service communication(DMSC) infrastructure.\n\n\n\t "

  content: "  In the Media Gateway Control Protocol Specification [2], there is \n
    \ nothing preventing multiple Call Agents talking to the same endpoint. \n  However,
    this can present a problem if they are both trying to \n  control the endpoint
    at the same time. The packages defined in this \n  document solve this problem
    and provide new (and better) mechanisms \n  for endpoint ownership control. \n\t "

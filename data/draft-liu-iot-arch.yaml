  content: "   In this document, it identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data\n
    \  storages for archiving and developing data sharing platform, and\n   application
    units to be important system components for developing\n   digital communities:
    i.e., building-scale and city-wide ubiquitous\n   facility networking infrastructure.
    \ The standard defines a data\n   exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects
    these components\n   (gateways, storages, application units) over the IPv6-based
    networks.\n   This enables integration of multiple facilities, data storages,\n
    \  application services such as central management, energy saving,\n   environmental
    monitoring and alarm notification systems.\n\n\t "

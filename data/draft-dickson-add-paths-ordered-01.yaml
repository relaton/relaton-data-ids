  content: "This Internet Draft describes an enhanced format for encoding prefix\ninformation,
    to permit multiple copies of a prefix with different\npaths to be announced and
    withdrawn.\n\nPrefix instances using the new format include both unique\nidentifiers,
    and ordinals to control path selection.\n\nWithdrawal of prefixes requires a slight
    modification to disambiguate\nprefix instances.Author's Note\n\nThis Internet
    Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related\ndraft(s) being placed
    on the Standards Track for idr.\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [4].\n\t "

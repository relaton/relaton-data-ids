  content: "   This document explores the potential of Information-Centric\n   Networking
    (ICN) to enhance interoperability between metaverse\n   platforms.  ICN's content-centric
    approach, in-network caching, and\n   inherent security features can address key
    challenges such as\n   scalability, low-latency performance, data ownership, and\n
    \  standardization needs.  It also identifies these challenges and\n   proposes
    solutions to optimize data sharing, enable efficient content\n   distribution,
    and enforce secure access controls.\n\n\t "

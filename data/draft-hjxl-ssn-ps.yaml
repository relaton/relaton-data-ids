  content: "   With the wide deployment of 4G and beyond mobile networks, a great\n
    \  number of cells need high precision frequency and/or time\n   synchronization
    for their normal operation. It is crucial to manage\n   the synchronization network
    in a scalable way and simplify the\n   monitoring and operation for synchronization
    networks. This document\n   analyzes the use cases and requirements in synchronization
    networks,\n   and provides a problem statement for scalable synchronization\n
    \  networks.\n\n\n\n\n\t "

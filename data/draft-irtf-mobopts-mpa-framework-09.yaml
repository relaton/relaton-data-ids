  content: "This document describes Media-independent Pre-Authentication (MPA), a
    new handover optimization mechanism that addresses the issues on existing mobility
    management protocols and mobility optimization mechanisms to support inter-domain
    handover. MPA is a mobile- assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that
    works over any link layer and with any mobility management protocol, and is most
    applicable to supporting optimization during inter-domain handover. MPA's pre-authentication,
    pre-configuration, and proactive handover techniques allow many of the handoff-related
    operations to take place before the mobile node has moved to the new network.
    We describe the details of all the associated techniques and their applicability
    for different scenarios involving various mobility protocols during inter-domain
    handover. We have implemented the MPA mechanism for various network-layer and
    application-layer mobility protocols, and we report a summary of experimental
    performance results in this document.\n\n This document is a product of the IP
    Mobility Optimizations (MOBOPTS) Research Group. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.\n\t "

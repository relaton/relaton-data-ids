  content: "People like their computers to work quickly.  During the transition\nto
    new technology, both old and new technologies have to peacefully\nco-exist.  However,
    if users experience connection delays attributed\nto the new technology the new
    technology will be shunned.\n\nHTTP (\"The Web\") is one of the most visible and
    time-critical\napplications that is used by nearly every Internet user.  It is\ncritical
    that new technologies which improve HTTP not impair or delay\nthe display of HTTP
    content.  It is also important that users retain\nthe ability to share URIs amongst
    friends and colleagues, even if the\nother users have not upgraded to the new
    technology.\n\nThis draft makes several recommendations to ensure user satisfaction\nand
    a smooth transition from HTTP's pervasive IPv4 to IPv6 and from\nTCP to SCTP.\n\nThe
    audience for this draft is application developers and content\nproviders.  This
    draft is discussed on the Applications Discuss\nmailing list, https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss.\n\t "

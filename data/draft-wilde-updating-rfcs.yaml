  content: "   As part of document metadata, RFCs can reference existing RFC that\n
    \  they update or obsolete.  While obsoleting is well-understood\n   (replace
    the obsoleted RFC in its entirety), updating has more\n   nuances because the
    updated RFC remains valid.  This document\n   contains some clarifications about
    how to handle updating in a way\n   that makes it easier for readers to understand
    how the original and\n   the updating RFC relate.\n\nNote to Readers\n\n   This
    draft should be discussed on the wgchairs mailing list [1].\n\n   Online access
    to all versions and files is available on github [2].\n\n\t "

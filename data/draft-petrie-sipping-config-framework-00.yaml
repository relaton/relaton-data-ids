  content: "This document defines the application of a set of protocols for \nconfiguring
    a SIP user agent.  The SIP user agent must discover how \nand from where to retrieve
    its initial configuration and be notified \nof changes and updates which impact
    its configuration.  The \nobjective is to define a means for automatically configuring
    a user \nagent such that it can be functional without user or administrative \nintervention.
    \ The framework for discovery, delivery, notification \nand updates of user agent
    configuration is defined here.  This \nframework is also intended to ease ongoing
    administration, \nconfiguration and upgrading of large scale deployments of SIP
    user \nagents.  The contents and format of the configuration data to be \ndefined
    is outside the scope of this document.\n\t "

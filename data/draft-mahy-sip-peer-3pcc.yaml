- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The 3rd party call control draft [2] demonstrates a usage of SIP [3]\n\nwith
    some of the enhancements of RFC2543bis [4].  This usage\n\nrequires that a 3pcc
    controller remain in the signaling path and\n\nmaintain state for the duration
    of the call.  While this is\n\nnecessary in certain situations (ex: protocol translation:
    H.323 [5]\n\nto SIP, SIP to RTSP [6], HTTP [7] to SIP), it is sub-optimal in pure\n\nSIP
    environments.  This draft demonstrates a usage of the REFER\n\nmethod [8] and
    SIP for presence [9] to allow authorized peers to\n\nparticipate in call control.\n\t "

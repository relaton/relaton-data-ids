  content: "This document defines a mechanism by which two entities can make use\nof
    SDP arrive at a common view of a multimedia session between them.\nIn the model,
    one participant offers the other a description of the\ndesired session from their
    perspective, and the other participant\nanswers with the desired session from
    their perspective. This\noffer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions
    where\ninformation from both participants is needed for the complete view of\nthe
    session. The offer/answer model is used by protocols like SIP.\n\n\t "

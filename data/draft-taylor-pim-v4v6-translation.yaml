abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   This document describes the procedures required for correct operation\n
    \  of a multicast router in a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment, where\n   some
    or all of the multicast group and unicast source addresses can\n   be translated
    between IPv4 and IPv6, and where incoming multicast\n   data may need to be forwarded
    into both IPv4 and IPv6 distribution\n   trees.  The router is assumed to support
    Protocol Independent\n   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM, RFC 4601) in an environment\n
    \  consisting of a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 local hosts and PIM peers.\n   The
    work is easily generalized to other versions of PIM.\n\n\t "

  content: "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that\nallows
    a client to request that a particular protocol extension be\nused to process the
    request. The server declines the request if it\ndoes not support the extension.
    However, there is currently no way\nfor a server to determine which extensions
    are supported by the\nclient. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows
    the server\nto tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not define\na
    way for a client to query a server about the extensions it\nsupports. This document
    defines a SIP extension that allows clients\nto indicate, in a request, the set
    of extensions supported. We also\ndefine a mechanism that allows clients, through
    an OPTIONS request,\nto determine the extensions supported by a server.\n\t "

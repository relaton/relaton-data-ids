  content: "   This document specifies the family of Hashed Token SASL mechanisms\n
    \  which enable a proof-of-possession-based authentication scheme and\n   are
    meant to be used to quickly re-authenticate of a previous\n   session.  The Hashed
    Token SASL mechanism's authentication sequence\n   consists of only one round-trip.
    \ The usage of short-lived,\n   exclusively ephemeral hashed tokens is achieving
    the single round-\n   trip property.  The SASL mechanism specified herein further
    provides\n   hash agility, mutual authentication and support for channel binding.\n\n\t "

  content: "The 128 bits of IPv6 address space is considerably bigger than the 32\n
    \  bits of address space in IPv4.  In particular, the IPv6 subnets to\n   which
    hosts attach will by default have 64 bits of host address\n   space.  As a result,
    traditional methods of remote TCP or UDP port\n   scanning to discover open or
    running services on a host will\n   potentially become far less computationally
    feasible, due to the\n   larger search space in the subnet.  This document discusses
    that\n   property of IPv6 subnets, and describes related issues for site\n   administrators
    of IPv6 networks to consider, which may be of\n   importance when planning site
    address allocation and management\n   strategies.\n\t "

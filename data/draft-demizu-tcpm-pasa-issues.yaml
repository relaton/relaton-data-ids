  content: "   This memo describes a method of protecting TCP connections against\n
    \  off-path, third party spoofing attacks, by making use of the TCP\n   Timestamps
    option specified in RFC1323.\n\n   The original basis of the idea was proposed
    by Kacheong Poon.  This\n   memo discusses its issues to add complementary ideas
    to his original\n   approach.  Viable ideas in this memo will be incorporated
    into his\n   upcoming draft.\n\t "

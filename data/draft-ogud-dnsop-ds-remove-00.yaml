abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   RFC7344 specifies how trust can be maintained in-band between parent\n
    \  and child.  There are two features missing in that specification:\n   initial
    trust setup and removal of trust anchor.  This document\n   addresses the second
    omission.\n\n   There are many reasons why a domain may want to go unsigned.  Some
    of\n   them are related to DNS operator changes, others are related to\n   DNSSEC
    signing system changes.  The inability to turn off DNSSEC via\n   in-band signalling
    is seen as a liability in some circles.  This\n   document addresses the issue
    in a sane way.\n\n\t "

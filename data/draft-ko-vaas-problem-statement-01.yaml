abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the problems and challenges associated with
    the process of setting up secure connections between authorized network nodes.
    The network nodes can be located anywhere in a private or public network, directly
    connected or behind one or more levels of NAT. Setting up a secure connection
    in this environment entails the resolution of various issues such as authentication,
    peer discovery, virtual network address management, routing information exchange
    and connection parameters determination.</p>"

  content: "This document describes AMG, a mechanism for stateless\nautoconfiguration
    of IPv6 addresses for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks\n(MANETs), connected to the Internet
    by means of one or more gateways.\nNetwork prefixes are disseminated by Internet
    gateways and are used\nby nodes to configure a set of global IPv6 addresses.  An
    algorithm\nis specified, by which nodes can choose the optimal address for data\ntraffic.
    \ Configured global addresses are also advertised to other\n\nMANET nodes, to
    minimize latencies in case of gateway failures, MANET\npartitions and mergers.
    \ The specified mechanism aims to be\nindependent from any particular MANET routing
    protocol and to\neffectively exploit multiple gateways.\n\t "

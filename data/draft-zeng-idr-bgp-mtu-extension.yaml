  content: "   Proper functioning of path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) discovery\n
    \  [RFC1191] requires that IP routers have knowledge of the MTU for each\n   link
    to which they are connected.  As MPLS progresses, [RFC3988]\n   specifies extensions
    to LDP in support of LDP LSP MTU discovery.  For\n   the LSP created using Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC3107], it\n   does not have the ability to signal the
    path MTU to the ingress Label\n   Switching Router (LSR).  In the absence of this
    functionality, the\n   MTU for the BGP LSP must be statically configured by network\n
    \  operators or by equivalent off-line mechanisms.\n\n   This document defines
    the MTU Extended Community for BGP in support\n   of BGP LSP MTU discovery.\n\n\n\t "

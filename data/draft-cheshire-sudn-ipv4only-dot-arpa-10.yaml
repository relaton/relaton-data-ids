abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "   The specification for how a client discovers its network's NAT64\n
    \  prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this\n   purpose,
    but declares it to be a non-special name in that\n   specification's Domain Name
    Reservation Considerations section.\n\n   Consequently, despite the well articulated
    special purpose of the\n   name, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the Special-Use
    Domain\n   Names registry as a name with special properties.\n\n   As a result
    of this omission, in cases where software needs to give\n   this name special
    treatment in order for it to work correctly, there\n   was no clear mandate authorizing
    software authors to implement that\n   special treatment.  Software implementers
    were left with the choice\n   between not implementing the special behavior necessary
    for the name\n   queries to work correctly, or implementing the special behavior
    and\n   being accused of being noncompliant with some RFC.\n\n   This document
    formally declares the actual special properties of the\n   name, and adds similar
    declarations for the corresponding reverse\n   mapping names.\n\n\t "

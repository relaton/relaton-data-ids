  content: "   This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code.  This\n
    \  response code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary\n   rejected
    their call attempt.  No one will deliver, and thus no one\n   will answer, the
    call.  As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware that\n   future attempts to contact
    the same User Agent Server will likely\n   fail.  The initial use case driving
    the need for the 608 response\n   code is when the intermediary is an analytics
    engine.  In this case,\n   the rejection is by a machine or other process.  This
    contrasts with\n   the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code, which a human at the
    target\n   User Agent Server indicated the user did not want the call.  In some\n
    \  jurisdictions this distinction is important.  This document also\n   defines
    the use of the Call-Info header field in 608 responses to\n   enable rejected
    callers to contact entities that blocked their calls\n   in error.  This provides
    a remediation mechanism for legal callers\n   that find their calls blocked.\n\n\t "

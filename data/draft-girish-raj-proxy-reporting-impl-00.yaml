  content: "   This document suggests a way for implementing a IGMP/MLD proxy-\n   reporting
    switch in which reports received from downstream hosts \n   and queries received
    from upstream routers are used to build the \n   Subscription Aggregation table.
    Subscription Aggregation table can \n   be used for forwarding multicast data
    traffic, sending state change\n   and current state reports to upstream router
    ports. \n\t "

  content: "   This document describes an extension to the TLS protocol to allow TLS\n
    \  clients to authenticate with legacy credentials using the Extensible\n   Authentication
    Protocol (EAP).\n\n   This work follows the example of IKEv2, where EAP has been
    added to\n   the IKEv2 protocol to allow clients to use different credentials
    such\n   as passwords, token cards, and shared secrets.\n\n   When TLS is used
    with EAP, additional records are sent after the\n   ChangeCipherSpec protocol
    message, effectively creating an extended\n   handshake before the application
    layer data can be sent.  Each EapMsg\n   handshake record contains exactly one
    EAP message.  Using EAP for\n   client authentication allows TLS to be used with
    various AAA back-end\n   servers such as RADIUS or Diameter.\n\n   TLS with EAP
    may be used for securing a data connection such as HTTP\n   or POP3, where the
    ability of EAP to work with backend servers can\n   remove that burden from the
    application layer.\n\n   This document is a protocol model, rather than a full
    protocol\n   specification.\n\n\t "

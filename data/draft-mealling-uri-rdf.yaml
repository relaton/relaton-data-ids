  content: "Many emerging Internet applications use URIs to identify various\nprotocol
    components. In many of these cases it is possible for a URI\nto be used as a value
    that was created outside the context of that\napplication. This document describes
    an architecture using RESCAP\nand RDF to allow an application to discover basic
    relationships\nbetween the URI in question and its Resource.\n\n\t "

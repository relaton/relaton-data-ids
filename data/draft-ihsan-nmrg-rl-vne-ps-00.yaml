  content: "   In Network virtualization (NV) technology, Virtual Network Embedding\n
    \  (VNE) is a problem to map a virtual network to the substrate network.\n   It
    has a great impact on the performance of virtual network and\n   resource utilization
    of the substrate network.  An efficient\n   embedding strategy can maximize the
    acceptance ratio of virtual\n   networks to increase the revenue for Internet
    service provider.\n   Several works have been appeared on the design of VNE solutions,\n
    \  however, it has becomes a challenging issues for researchers.  To\n   solved
    the VNE problem, reinforcement learning (RL) can play a vital\n   role to make
    the VNE problem more intelligent and efficient.\n   Moreover, RL has been merged
    with deep learning techniques to develop\n   adaptive models with effective strategies
    for various complex\n   problems.  In RL, agents can learn desired behaviors (e.g,
    optimal\n   VNE strategies), and after learning and completing training, it can\n
    \  embed the virtual network to the subtract network very quickly and\n   efficiently.
    \ RL can reduce the complexity of the VNE method,\n   however, it is too difficult
    to apply RL techniques directly to VNE\n   problems and need more research study.
    \ In this document, we are\n   presenting a problem statement to motivate the
    research community to\n   solve the VNE problem using reinforcement learning.\n\n\t "

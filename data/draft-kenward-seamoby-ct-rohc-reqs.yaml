  content: "There is an interest in enhancing the performance of handover between
    \naccess routers through the transfer of forwarding context [2]. To \nclearly
    understand the requirements for this transfer, it is useful to \nexamine the requirements
    of specific feature contexts.  \nThis document reviews the requirements for transferring
    the context \nassociated with RObust Header Compressions (ROHC [3]) in preparation
    \nfor a handoff of the IP traffic being compressed. \n      \n\n\t "

  content: "   The IETF QUIC working group has been chartered to produce extensions\n
    \  that would \"enable ... multipath capabilities\" since the working\n   group
    was formed in 2016, but because multipath was an extension,\n   work on multipath,
    and the other extensions named in the charter,\n   waited while work proceeded
    on the core QUIC protocol specifications.\n\n   After the QUIC working group chairs
    requested publication for the\n   core QUIC protocol specifications, they scheduled
    a virtual interim\n   meeting to understand the use cases that various groups
    inside and\n   outside the IETF were envisioning for multipath with QUIC.\n\n
    \  As part of that discussion, it became obvious that people had a\n   variety
    of ideas about how multiple paths would be used, because they\n   weren't looking
    at the same use cases, and so had different\n   assumptions about how applications
    might use QUIC over multiple\n   paths.\n\n   This document is intended to capture
    questions that have come up in\n   discussions, with some suggested answers, to
    inform further\n   discussion in the working group.\n\n\t "

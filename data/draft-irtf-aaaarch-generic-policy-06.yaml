  content: "In this document the concept of a so-called Driving Policy is pre-\nsented.
    \ A Driving Policy determines the behavior of an AAA server\n(Authentication,
    Authorization, Accounting) when it is confronted\nwith a specific message type
    of the AAA protocol.  The first part\nof this document defines the role of a Driving
    Policy and how it\nfits into the AAA concept.  According to the model presented,
    the\nmain task of a Driving Policy is to describe which pre-conditions\nhave to
    be checked before the corresponding actions, needed to\nfulfill an incoming AAA
    request, can be called, and how to deal\nwith the post-conditions of these actions.
    \ In the second part a\ngrammar is proposed for these Driving Policies accompanied
    by the\nnecessary comments about the semantics.\n\t "

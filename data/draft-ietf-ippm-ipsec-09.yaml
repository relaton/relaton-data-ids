  content: "   The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and Two-Way Active\n
    \  Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) security mechanism require that both the\n   client
    and server endpoints possess a shared secret.  Since the\n   currently-standardized
    O/TWAMP security mechanism only supports a\n   pre-shared key mode, large scale
    deployment of O/TWAMP is hindered\n   significantly.  At the same time, recent
    trends point to wider\n   Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) deployment
    which, in\n   turn, calls for mechanisms and methods that enable tunnel end-users,\n
    \  as well as operators, to measure one-way and two- way network\n   performance
    in a standardized manner.  This document describes the\n   use of keys derived
    from an IKEv2 security association (SA) as the\n   shared key in O/TWAMP.  If
    the shared key can be derived from the\n   IKEv2 SA, O/TWAMP can support certificate-based
    key exchange, which\n   would allow for more operational flexibility and efficiency.
    \ The key\n   derivation presented in this document can also facilitate automatic\n
    \  key management.\n\n\t "

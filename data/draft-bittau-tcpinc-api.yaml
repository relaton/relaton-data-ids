  content: "   TCP-ENO negotiates encryption at the transport layer.  It also\n   defines
    a few parameters that are intended to be used or configured\n   by applications.
    \ This document specifies operating system interfaces\n   for access to these
    TCP-ENO parameters.  We describe the interfaces\n   in terms of socket options,
    the de facto standard API for adjusting\n   per-connection behavior in TCP/IP,
    and sysctl, a popular mechanism\n   for setting global defaults.  Operating systems
    that lack socket or\n   sysctl functionality can implement similar interfaces
    in their native\n   frameworks, but should ideally adapt their interfaces from
    those\n   presented in this document.\n\n\t "

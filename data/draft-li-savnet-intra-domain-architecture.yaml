abstract:
- content: "<p>Intra-domain source address validation (SAV) plays an important role
    in defending against source address spoofing attacks in intra-domain networks.
    However, existing intra-domain SAV mechanisms have the problems of inaccurate
    validation, high operational overhead, and limited protection. To overcome these
    problems and improve intra- domain SAV, this document proposes an overall architecture
    of source address validation in intra-domain network (named as Intra-domain SAVNET).
    Intra-domain SAVNET discovers the real data-plane forwarding path via hop-by-hop
    message propagation and helps intra- domain routers generate accurate SAV tables.</p>"

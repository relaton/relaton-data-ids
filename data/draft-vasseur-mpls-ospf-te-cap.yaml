  content: "This draft proposes OSPF traffic engineering capability TLVs. Two \ncapability
    TLVs are defined in the current draft: the Path \nComputation Server Discovery
    (PCSD) TLV that allows a router to \nannounce its Path Computation Server capability
    to other LSRs within \nan OSPF area or a routing domain and the Mesh-group TLV
    used by an \nLSR to indicate its desire to participate to a mesh of Traffic \nEngineering
    Label Switched Path (this mesh of TE LSPs is identified \nby a mesh-group number).
    They are both used in the context of MPLS \nTraffic Engineering. Additional OSPF
    TE capability TLVs may be added \nin further revision of this draft. Those OSPF
    TE capability TLVs \nwill be carried within the OSPF router information LSA (opaque
    type \nof 4, opaque ID of 0) defined in [18]. \n\t "

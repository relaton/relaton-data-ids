  content: "   Many service providers have been exploring distributed computing\n
    \  techniques to achieve better service response time and optimized\n   energy
    consumption.  Such techniques rely upon the distribution of\n   computing services
    and capabilities over many locations in the\n   network, such as its edge, the
    metro region, virtualized central\n   office, and other locations.  In such a
    distributed computing\n   environment, providing services by utilizing computing
    resources\n   hosted in various computing facilities (e.g., edges) is being\n
    \  considered, e.g., for computationally intensive and delay sensitive\n   services.
    \ Ideally, services should be computationally balanced using\n   service-specific
    metrics instead of simply dispatching the service\n   requests in a static way
    or optimizing solely connectivity metrics.\n   For example, systematically directing
    end user-originated service\n   requests to the geographically closest edge or
    some small computing\n   units may lead to an unbalanced usage of computing resources,
    which\n   may then degrade both the user experience and the overall service\n
    \  performance.  We have named this kind of network with dynamic sharing\n   of
    edge compute resources \"Computing-Aware Networking\" (CAN).\n\n   This document
    provides the problem statement and the typical\n   scenarios of CAN, which is
    to show the necessity of considering more\n   factors when steering the traffic
    to the appropriate service instance\n   based on the basic edge computing deployment
    to provide the service\n   equivalency.\n\n\t "

  content: "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is \n
    \  based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as \n   specified
    in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW) \n   and multi-segment
    PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with \n   additional Operations, Administration
    and Maintenance (OAM) \n   procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching
    management \n   for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence
    of \n   a control plane. \n\n   This document provides a framework that supports
    a comprehensive set \n   of OAM procedures that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements
    [11].\n\t "

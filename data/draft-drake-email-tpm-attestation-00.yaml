abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism for email senders to include hardware
    attestation evidence in message headers, enabling receiving mail servers to cryptographically
    verify that an email was composed on a machine containing a genuine Trusted Platform
    Module (TPM) from a known manufacturer (Intel, AMD, Infineon, or similar). The
    verification chain runs from the email header directly to the TPM manufacturer's
    root Certificate Authority, requiring no trust in any intermediary identity service.
    As a companion mechanism, this document also defines a privacy- preserving alternative
    using SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT, RFC 9901) where the sender can prove specific
    claims about their hardware trust level without revealing their hardware identity.
    Together, these mechanisms provide Sybil-resistant email authentication: each
    sender requires a unique physical security chip, making large-scale automated
    spam economically infeasible regardless of advances in artificial intelligence.
    While this document specifies these mechanisms for email message headers, the
    attestation formats defined herein - both the CMS attestation bundle and the SD-JWT
    trust proof - are self-contained, transport-independent data structures applicable
    to HTTP headers, agent-to-agent messaging, and other Internet protocols.</p>"

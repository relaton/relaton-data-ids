  content: "Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) is a protocol that allows for an\n   element
    behind a NAT or firewall to receive incoming data over TCP or\n   UDP connections.
    \ It is most useful for elements behind symmetric\n   NATs or firewalls that wish
    to be on the receiving end of a\n   connection to a single peer.  TURN does not
    allow for users to run\n   servers on well known ports if they are behind a nat;
    it supports the\n   connection of a user behind a nat to only a single peer.  In
    that\n   regard, its role is to provide the same security functions provided\n
    \  by symmetric NATs and firewalls, but to \"turn\" them into port-\n   restricted
    NATs.\n\t "

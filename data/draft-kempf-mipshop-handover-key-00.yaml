  content: "Fast Mobile IPv6 requires that a Fast Binding Update is secured \nusing
    a security association shared between an Access Router and a \nMobile Node in
    order to avoid certain attacks. In this document, a \nmethod for distributing
    a shared key to secure this signaling is \ndefined. The method utilizes the RSA
    public key that the Mobile \nNode used to generate its Cryptographically Generated
    Address in \nSEND. The RSA public key is used to encrypt a shared key sent from
    \nthe Access Router to the Mobile Node prior to handover. The \nability of the
    Mobile Node to decrypt the shared key verifies its \npossession of the private
    key corresponding to the CGA public key \nused to generate the address. This allows
    the Mobile Node to use \nthe shared key to sign and authorize the routing changes
    triggered \nby the Fast Binding Update.\n\t "

abstract:
- content: "<p>The DRIP Entity Tag (DET) public Key Infrastructure (DKI) is a specific
    variant of classic Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) where the orginization is
    around the DET, in place of X.520 Distinguished Names. Further, the DKI uses DRIP
    Endorsements in place of X.509 certificates for establishing trust within the
    DKI. There is a shadow PKI behind the DKI, with many of its X.509 fields mirroring
    content in the DRIP Endorsements. This PKI can at times be used where X.509 is
    expected and non-constrained communication links are available that can handle
    their larger size.</p>"

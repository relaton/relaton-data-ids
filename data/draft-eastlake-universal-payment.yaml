  content: "The Internet is becoming an increasingly commercial arena in which payments
    are rendered for goods, information, and services. To support such commerce, various
    incompatible Internet payment protocols have been proposed or adopted by a variety
    of organizations.  There appears to be little prospect of merger of all or abandonment
    of most of these protocols.                                                                 A
    header syntax, the Universal Payment Preamble (UPP), is presented for parties
    to negotiate payment alternatives at any point in shopping, until a final hand-off
    to a particular chosen payment system.  The chosen payment system, not UPP, is
    responsible for the security of any actual transmission of funds.\n\t "

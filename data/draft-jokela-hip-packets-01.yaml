  content: "This memo describes alternative, optimized packet structures for the\nHost
    Identity Payload and Host Layer Protocol (HIP). The packet\nstructures presented
    in this memo are intended replace original\npackets in HIP. In addition, this
    memo describes a new packet, CER,\nto transmit certificates.\nThe main objective
    in redefining HIP packet structures is to make the\npacket structures simpler
    and more distinct, which makes the\nimplementation work easier, hopefully leading
    to more secure protocol\nimplementation. The new structures reduce the average
    packet size and\ntake advantage of other existing IPv6 protocols formats, including\nalignments
    concerns, like the newly suggested Mobility header format\nfor Mobile IPv6.\n\t "

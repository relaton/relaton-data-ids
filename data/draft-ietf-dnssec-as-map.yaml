  content: "   One requirement of secure routing is that independent routing\n   entities,
    such as those identified by Internet Autonomous System\n   Numbers, be able to
    authenticate messages to each other.  Additions\n   have developed to the Domain
    Name System to enable it to be used for\n   authenticated public key distribution
    [RFC 2065].  This draft maps\n   all Autonomous System numbers into DNS Domain
    Names so that the DNS\n   security can be used to distribute their public keys.\n\n
    \  [Changes from previous version are to accommodate AS numbers larger\n   than
    16 bits and to delegate on decimal boundaries rather than binary\n   boundaries.]\n\n\t "

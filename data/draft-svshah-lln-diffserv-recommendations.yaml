abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "   Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in\n   traditional
    networks.  There exist well defined recommendations for\n   the use of appropriate
    differentiated service classes for different\n   types of traffic (eg. audio,
    video) in these networks.  Per-Hop\n   Behaviors are typically defined based on
    this recommendations.  With\n   emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs),
    it is important to have\n   similar defined differentiated services recommendations
    for LLN\n   traffic.  Defined recommendations are for LLN class of traffic\n   exiting
    out of LLNs towards high-speed backbones, converged campus\n   network and for
    the traffic in the reverse direction.\n\n\t "

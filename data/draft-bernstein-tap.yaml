  content: "It is common for Internet hosts to associate a relatively long-lived identifier,
    commonly a 'username' or 'owner name,' to each TCP connection. TAP announces the
    identifier associated with a particular TCP connection to the host on the other
    end of the connection. TAP may be used on any host which associates a relatively
    long-lived identifier to each connection.\n\t "

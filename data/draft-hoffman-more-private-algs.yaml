  content: "   RFC 4034 allocates one value in the IANA registry for DNSSEC\n   algorithm
    numbers for private algorithms.  That may be too few for\n   experimentation where
    multiple yet-to-be-assigned algorithms are\n   used.  This document assigns seven
    more values for this use case.\n\n   This document is currently maintained at\n
    \  https://github.com/paulehoffman/draft-hoffman-more-private-algs.\n   Issues
    and pull requests are welcomed.  If the document is later\n   adopted by a working
    group, a new repository will likely be created.\n\n\t "
